[BEGIN] The pizza was not very good. The crust was burnt. The bread rolls are flat pieces of burnt bread. The guy who answers the phone for take out is really rude.  [END]
[BEGIN] cheap with the food is high in price  [END]
[BEGIN] Started out really good Not the quality it was at opening. Kissimmee was good originally too. Can't keep up with the food. What is there for long time is cold and in the danger zone! HACCP! Same that the quality has diminished!  [END]
[BEGIN] I use to like this place but the last meal got me sick for a week. Avoid the pakoras like Ebola.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our bartender Erin was super rude and the beer was warm. Music was so loud that you can't speak to anyone. The decor is from the 80's and it's pretty dirty. Won't go back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was decent but the server was practically abusive - whatever you do don't get chris c. as your waiter.  [END]
[BEGIN] While I love the product, the service is deplorable. Negative attitudes, and the cashier never looked at me while she took my order. Pointedly looked anywhere BUT at me. Is the management that desperate for help? I work in a service industry and rarely find myself appalled.  [END]
[BEGIN] This motel was disgusting! Immediately reeked of cigarettes and had multiple and I mean multiple stains on the comforter!!!! Nasty as hell yall b advised!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This restaurant is the worst I have ever been to. The service was nonexistent, we finally got salads, then we were never offered entrees. A while later someone came by and offered us dessert, I said we didn't get entrees I'll take the check.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service, I had to repeat my order multiple times and the people I was with didn't get their order. The server left "early" so our table was left to no one. Taking my food to go next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Todd Jefferies is a dumbfuck. Conservative rhetoric regurgitated from the asshole of Rush Limbaugh. Poison audio.  [END]
[BEGIN] "We'll call you if anything changes and we can't make it." ...4 hrs later, no electrician has showed up, no call, and no return of my call. I could make it to the job site on time-- why couldn't they?  [END]
[BEGIN] Manager looked like he was 15 years old and was a huge d-bag. Would never go back to this ABC, how about you hire people that have a tiny clue about the products they sell or how to be nice in general.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oy. Food poisoning two times in a row, months apart. I won't be coming here again for any of the sandwiches. I'm sure the soup here is still fine, and the chicken pot pie too but avoid this place unless you want to take a risk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Zero star. Three person per party. Deceptive. Be aware of this restaurant. They charge tax and tip on your final. And collect additional tips. Go elsewhere where the restaurant owners do not take advantage of their customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is NASTY! Complete with rats running around inside! If you value your health and well-being stay away from "merengue restaurant"!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Only one person for returns and booking, one hour waiting, 5 parties still before us to pick up. Avoid this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came for an eye appointment today at 1pm. They were already 30-45 mins behind. A bit frustrating. Especially for a Monday. Suggest going to another campus if you can. I ended up not even being seen until almost 4pm.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kept me waiting 40 minutes for a takeout pizza. Once the befuddled counter man found my pizza it was of course cold. I got my money back and refused a free pie. A bad operation.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is bland. Ive eaten here 3-4 times over the years and it's always the same. I have a friend that moved her from Cuba and he has the same opinion.  [END]
[BEGIN] Called Green Cleaning for the past two weeks to make an appointment and didn't get a call back. I called amazonlocal, where I bought the coupon, to get a refund. Awful way to run a business.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful. Rip off artists and sh!t food to boot. Stay away at all costs  [END]
[BEGIN] I doubt the pharmacy staff are IDIOTS, messed up my perscription TWICE IN A ROW!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] 35 dollar corkage fee? Insane? Or just bad customer service? Thus the one star Why would anyone pay that? No one wants customers bringing own wine, but they do it as customer service  [END]
[BEGIN] My first time not happy with the service I received when I brought my car to get cleaned today. I have an suv, and when they were vacuming the inside, they didn't vacuum the backtrunk area at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not even 1 star. We were waiting for 25 minutes, nobody asked us or updated us about the waiting time and when they found a table a man came asking about the number of our party and placed other group with 1 more person. Can't be less professional.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got my Reuben sandwich and a turkey sandwich with combos at 8:30 pm and they were meh...bread was awful and dry. At 8:50 I went to refill my soda and those bastards closed up shop already. Definitely will not be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] You're paying a minimum of $20 to stare at a highway, grass, a lake, and a bunch of hotels. I can't believe anyone actually buys this garbage. This is Central Florida, not somewhere scenic.  [END]
[BEGIN] They NEVER seem to get our order correct, service is crappy, food is inconsistent and has gone down hill steadily in the last 6-9 months! WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!  [END]
[BEGIN] Changed menu inside but not on board outside. Completely different. Bad services ended up leaving server never came to table. After 10 minutes Don't waste your time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad service. Waiting for long time to order while the waitresses just heading down playing the phone and chatting with each other. No one come to add water. Waitress speak to customers in bad manners and seems angry all the time about something. Didn't enjoy at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love Chick-Fil-A. Their restaurants are always clean, with fast, polite service, and the food is yummy. This particular CFA fails on every count. What a dirty, confused, mess of a place. Meh. Go somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Usually have very good experiance at joes, but my friend's turkey burger was wrong and undercooked (pink) 3 times. Unacceptable in my eyes, and I wont be back at let to this location.  [END]
[BEGIN] My french toast came with a hair on it. The replacement had one less piece and wasn't cooked all the way through. They didn't even offer to take it off the bill or compensate in any way.  [END]
[BEGIN] Embarrassed to have given this place my business when there are so many other options. I don't think other establishments would treat there customers so poorly. Save time and headache, play somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wait time is ridiculous. Everyone else seems OK with that. Not me. Buffalo burger was bland. Service was bad. Gay/Bi bartender needs to learn to treat everyone equally. I got ignored. Reflected in her tip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service, dirty menus with food all over them, we are non smokers, everyone around us was smoking...  [END]
[BEGIN] AVOID THIS RESTAURANT! Not only was the food horrible and horribly overpriced but I got a horrible case of food poisoning. I would say it was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably one of the worst shots in Columbus. No consistency whatsoever. I'm a 195 average bowler in most other houses. Sawmill, I'm a 170. Heavy oil is typical. Just a bad shot. And expensive beer prices as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] awful experience in this salon. they cut my skin and soak with acetone. it burning!! she not even say sorry. painting over my cuticle. never coming back here.!  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't do it. Took money. No show. No response. Bad business and well known for such behavior. Contract is faulty. Don't do it.  [END]
[BEGIN] They racist and there was no parking Go to Golden anchor tattoo instead. Ask for tez he's Black  [END]
[BEGIN] They have 2 huge "Open Sunday" signs in the window. Their hours (posted on the door) say that they're open 10:00-5:00 on Sunday's. I arrived at 10:10 on Sunday and they were closed. No sign/note on the door with a reason why. Won't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] this place is terrible. for the quality there is no heart or soul that went into the soup. it's just plain salt + msg. I am pretty sure this place will be out of business very soon if they continue to operate like this.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worse food I have ever had.DONT GO HERE! The food is a joke. It looks unsafe and I really wish health inspection checks this place out. It's scary to eat from such places.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not very friendly service, had to point out areas on the outside that were missed and they didn't bother vacuuming the back seat. All in all a bad experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] With customers from Mexico and an employee from Estonia. The Estonian had to get her passport to buy a drink; the Mexicans couldn't despite holding a US work visa in their passport.  [END]
[BEGIN] You get what you pay for $50 loud, cheap room but at least beds were comfortable and continental breakfast was just white bread, cereal, coffee, juice. That's it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great views, but food was sub par. The quality was something I would expect at Chili's or something along those lines. Prices were high. Won't return. Great tourist trap.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have called this store numerous times and they always put you on hold forever .I have even been hung up on!and if you hang up and call back they do not remember helping you and are very unaware of products they have.Do not call them !  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude waiter here laughed at me when I dropped my cellphone. Had a poor experience at the, now closed, Boathouse in Horseshoe Bay as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't get the hype. Yes they have interesting eccentric flavors but the donuts are way to dense and doe-y it's almost like they're wet and haven't dried yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had it at a friend house. I heard lots about ohhh how great it is. Uuuhhhhh, no Not so good Nothing truely special or different just flavorless.  [END]
[BEGIN] Filthy. Worst Delta SkyClub I've ever seen. Floors were sticky and dirty. There was gnats around the food and dead flies on the floor. I was shocked!!  [END]
[BEGIN] horrible customer service took a great idea and ruined it - they over charge and then refuse to properly refund claiming its because they are a non profit. do not rent here.  [END]
[BEGIN] I placed an order via delivery.com, then waited...and waited. After an hour and a half, I tried calling--no answer, and a full voice mail box. I've been trying to get through now for more than 2 hours, and still no food or even anyone picking up the phone. Ridiculous.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hipster soaked craphole with consistently shitty service. Plus you tell me your kitchen is closed when the place is full and you're pouring drinks. Screw you and your tent-like dress namesake.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad food And weird crowd at the bar. I felt like it was a place older people went to pick up dates Staff is really not trained well and food came out incomplete.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came in, was ignored at the door for a few minutes. Finally was seated, and it took the waitress 15 minutes before she came over for our drink order. SLOWEST SERVICE EVER. The food tasted old. The service was awful. Don't go here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really? Items in this picture are SMALLER than they appear. A $5 dollar breakfast bowl with the dimensions of 4 in x 2 in. Aka SIDE item at any BBQ place. What a joke. And the food sucks too. Nasty flour tortillas.  [END]
[BEGIN] I liked how attentive the sushi chef and the server were, (quite a bit more than one would expect from a sushi train place) But the fish wasnt fresh, it had all obviously been frozen before, um GROSS! Thats not ok with me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible setup with one way driving through vacuum area to car was line. No way to vacuum after washing without going through the wash again since there is no other way off the property.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was horrible and the customer service was worse. To top it off, my car was burglarized overnight and no one even offered to assist with calling the police. My advice would be to stay away from this hotel and area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Waited 2 hour for just one pizza. Terrible services and there was no apologies from either the manager or the driver.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst I've ever had I could of filled my cup with the grease that I squeezed out of it absolute disgusting !  [END]
[BEGIN] Waited for two hours. Continued to get told thirty more minutes the whole time. After two hours they said they more minutes, but we found out that the TWO tables they has for four people has just received appetizers. Ridiculous management  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible wait. Saturday afternoon, peak summer travel, two people working and looking at hour plus wait to get a car. If going to Orlando you may want to consider a different rental company. No other company backed up like this.  [END]
[BEGIN] I didn't see the Yelp reviews and Zagat sticker until it was too late. It seems all the good places are closed until January 2nd.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad service!!! They served me this mushroom without washing. I had ask them why the mushroom look dusty (black dots are soil). They told me that they already washed and this is how the mushrooms supposed to be. This is the worst place ever!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Business Closed Purchased a living social coupon and made a reservation for Sunday brunch, unfortunately, the restaurant was closed. Several people were turned away. No sign, no lights on and no one answered the phone when we called. Many us were disappointed. It appears they are out of business.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not like other Newks. The staff doesn't care here. It took forever to get a soup and sandwhich. Newks is good - just go to another location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kids meals are over priced and the regular menu prices seem high for the food value. Seems like the prices match the area of town but your paying way more for what you get in my opinion. Dessert was dry, seems it was sitting in the window for too long.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the slowest place I have been too in my whole entire life! We waited over an house for a few burgers and a pizza. Just a total disaster. They gave us nachos and guacamole on the house to make it up What a joke !  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad quality food. So much salt. We waited for utensils over 5 minutes after we got the food. I never come back here. I don't recommend to anybody.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is ok. Service is poor, ladies that take your order yell at you, they look like they don't really like their job, there is no effort.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got the feel that I am not welcome there!!! Seriously!!! Worst customer services I have seen in the US...  [END]
[BEGIN] Since they were shut down by the board of health a few years ago for having raw sewage in their fishtanks, I can not stomach this place!  [END]
[BEGIN] Come here if you enjoy horrible service, overpriced food, and being charged a 20% gratuity fee when you have a group of four. This place sucks flaccid monkey gonads.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not sure how these guys got my number but I've been receiving robocalls from them for over a year now. I've asked them to stop calling me and reported it to the do not call registry. I have no idea how to get these to stop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food 3 stars. Service not even one. Worst service ever in a Korean restaurant. No smile at all kimchi comes later than main dish. Will never come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] New management allows druggies to live in units. Complained numerous times and nothing happens. Guy sleeps outside yelling "bad people" and bangs on the walls when folks walk by. Do not rent a unit from this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] So we had a decent night out until the bouncer said "get those homos out" to my friends. Not cool. At this day and age a bouncer should not be homophobic in Boston.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ugh.... While visiting Orlando --worse Walmart I've shopped at. Long lines, MESSY & DIRTY!!! --Beware --  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a breakfast burrito and it came with a white price of plastic or piece of bone.. I almost chipped my tooth.. Pretty freaking disturbing:: never eating here ever again  [END]
[BEGIN] No, just no. The management change left this place unlivable. I left here o terrible terms and I will never look back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried brew 76 and it stinks like cat piss smells. Tastes like dirt. Won't ever try another Sam Adams again. Sneaky selling beer that tasts like this crap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pharmacy never picks up the phone!! And when you tell them, they get angry and put you on hold.  [END]
[BEGIN] omg!!! this place recently received 20 kitchen violations~!!!! yuck~!!~  [END]
[BEGIN] had a cup of "SMALL" coffe and apple tart bill came to over $8.00. Called back the next day, not for money, but just curious. The man on the phone said tha apple tart was $5.75 OMG, I know real estate & baking is expensive but that is just insulting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Disappointing stay at this hotel. The rooms are quite dated and smell old. The bathroom was moldy. Is it that hard to keep a bathroom from becoming moldy? The only explanation is that their cleaning staff are incompetent and the manager in charge of checking their work, just as bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too bad service at this place, and preparing the food very badly presented. 2010 to now buy like 5 times and all the same  [END]
[BEGIN] If this place could receive zero stars, I would take the one above this review away.  [END]
[BEGIN] We ordered after seeing it on grub hub and the food was very disappointing and made with low quality meats similar to low grade pre packaged deli style. They got here quickly though, so that's one good thing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I rushed herefrom downtown to get here at 10;30 pm. It turns out they stop serving food at 10 pm :( FAIL!  [END]
[BEGIN] Mediocre food. My lamb was overcooked and the rice was dry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big crowd, overprice, rude staff.. even the flee market has more to offer than this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible. What's the use of their comfy beds if all you hear is traffic noise. We got stuck in a room facing the river and it sounds like we're sitting by the side of a freeway. Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very unhappy with the experience. Would not recommend. I felt deceived and cheated. Stylist fresh out of school, unqualified. For a $40 haircut, I expect competence, and on this day I didn't get it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The guy in the truck didn't even seem interested to acknowledge me. So I went to the food truck next to him  [END]
[BEGIN] This location has really gone downhill, the french onion soup was tasteless with a scab of cheese thrown on top. The boneless buffalo wings arrived cold and the nachos were burnt.  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased a cake and it had a metal or freezer burn taste. Total bummer and waste of 30.00. Go elsewhere this place has slowly done down hill and is over priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow so disgusting in my tummy, we are here last night and the people couldn't have been less into it. They were all so sad and slow. PF Changs more like PF Bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fake Chinese food...worst Chinese food experience ever!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the clothes, but the customer service here is absolutely horrendous. Like one reviewer said below, the staff made me feel like Julia in Pretty Woman -- for no reason at all. Never going to this BCBG again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ridiculously priced!! If you want to pay $60-80 per head and willing to go away hungry, this is the restaurant for you. Small plates priced like entrees in a normal restaurant. Don't waste your money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awkward experience at the outside bar here. The bartender was fine to us, but was giving most of the other people out around the bar attitude to the point it was uncomfortable. Hopefully just a bad day, but from the look of the other reviews, maybe not so much!  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't know what happened to this place, but the mochi was very stale when I visited. Also, the staff were really unfriendly, and I'm wondering since it's a cash only business -- is it a front for something illegal? Maybe the BBB should investigate them?  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has some of the worst fried chicken I've ever had. I don't recommend it at all. There's a reason why there are only seven reviews for this restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered the chicken wrap on a Friday night after a long flight. Service took too long probably due to being understaffed. Chips were stale wrap WAY overpriced, cold, and bland with soagy lettuce. Avoid this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Low inventory, cannot obtain any help from staff, did most of my part research from google since staff was unhelpful and inept. You can tell the knowlegdge differences between Home Depot and Lowes.  [END]
[BEGIN] I absolutely hated this restaurant. Went there for lunch ordered the blt which is very hard to screw up but they managed to the tomatoes were rotten the bacon was raw. Also service was very poor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hey. This big hotel told me there's no two beds available and gave me a queen size bed. And we have two 6-feet men. My reservation is request for two beds... Terrible hotel and service. I won't go there any more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst "Greek Food" Ive ever had. Mostly pre-packaged, cold and dried out. They actually reheated the meat on a grill rather than shave it to order. Nothing fresh here at all and over priced. Horrible-Horrible-Horrible. Completely ruined my food experience in Boston for the day.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went there for lunch. I got food poisoning from their food. I don't know whether it was from the sushi or Chicken. Will never go there again!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been on hold with Mears customer service for over 25 minutes at this point. Will my call be answered by the time I finish writing this review... Looks like that's a no. I'll probably be calling a different shuttle service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered chicken shawarma but guess what's inside the wrap??? Do really Chicken shawarma has chicken in it or may be falafel  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was cooked badly. Waitress was worse. Definitely not worth$53 per person plus tip.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a rip off. 17 bucks for parking, 16,50 for the ticket and 20 bucks for some popcorn and two cokes. Not worth it at all.....  [END]
[BEGIN] Turn back while you still can. Service is slow even when the place isn't busy. Food is mediocre at best. Cold soup from a can or a freezer; soggy bruchetta, bland food that tastes overly processed. In a town of delicious food, go get it - anywhere but here.  [END]
[BEGIN] The manager of this Starbucks is very very rude. He is rude to customers and his employees. Says he is very busy but is always on his phone  [END]
[BEGIN] Dog food would b better. Been there several times tried different things and nothing has been good. The fajitas look like beef stew salsa is jar salsa cheese dip is runny water, margaritas r ok but overpriced.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very slow service. To long of a wait for average service, and the food wasnt that good. Much better BBQ can be had in PDX, sorry snoop, but your uncles got no game.  [END]
[BEGIN] The manager is rude and unprofessional. They mixed up my sub with another person's sub. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband went in for a cleaning with a Google Offer. They told him he needed over $4,000 worth of work done. Needless to say this was incorrect. Beware. Should have checked Yelp first. Poor guy. He was so stressed out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just saw a video on Instagram of a rat running across the window inside this restaurant. Gonna skip this place next time I'm in the city... if it's still open that is.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice enough employees but seems to be managed poorly. This is one of the dirtiest McDonalds I have visited. Very glad this is not our local one because I would not go again  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst place ever! Waited over 30 minutes for my food the place wasn't even busy!!! Will not be returning rude workers also food came out ice cold!!!! Rated -12 stars  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was horrible for an overpriced hamburger. We waited over 10 minutes for a beer. We finally had to get up to pay our bill.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't bother with this place. I came here at 9pm and they had already stopped serving.  [END]
[BEGIN] AWFUL. Was trying to support local business so did not read reviews. Livid with how ruined my clothes turned out. Was visiting from out of town so can't even go back to get shunned away by the grouchy old woman. TAKE YOUR CLOTHES ELSEWHERE!  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible. Bad service, and the quality of the smoothies is... no words to describe it. Strawberry smoothie without strawberries. This was a first. And $5 for 20oz of milk is just ridiculous. Stay away!  [END]
[BEGIN] Closed their doors 45 minutes early. No coffee for us. As we pulled out of the parking lot the lights came back on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is awful. Plus pizza takes a long time. Other Papa Gino's are much better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible food. The salad is definitely not worth $10. Tried macaroni and cheese, and the clam chowder. Both tasted like they were out of a bag. Won't be returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the place for people who need a TRUE deep massage. Brianna is great but usually booked up. Maybe good for someone who doesn't have true body pain. Canceling our memberships. Had them because we moved from out-of-state and have been consistently disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst Migas on the planet. When my plate arrived, I thought it looked like vomit. It tasted only a little bit better. Glad toast came with the crappy Migas so at least I had something to eat for breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not carry the Gluten Free bread and only has shredded cheddar cheese. They also don't carry pepper jack cheese and the bathroom was disgusting. Super slow service.  [END]
[BEGIN] A slightly burned sandwich, and when we got home to finish our last half had a nicely melted in hair. Will not be returning. Interesting flavors though  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was two cliks north of terrible. Yrs, the drinks are strong but not well or artfully crafted. To top it off, it's expensive! Sixty bucks for a grocery store quality steak and Mac and cheese life you can get in a box. Disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] This may have honestly been the worst meal I have ever had in my life. One positive comment is they heard the feedback and didn't charge for the entree. Great place to watch the game, but eat somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unknown object in the food. I ordered their small eel clay pot. Use my spoon to flip the rice and found something like hair.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service from the cashier was by far the rudest I have had in Florida. The bacon cheese burger is the absolute worst burger I have ever eaten. McDonald's even rates higher. The only positive thing is that the Milkshake was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nash was rude and nasty and messed up 3 orders. She seemed like she was on some sort of drug. Possibly crack cocaine. Not pleased.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wanted to like it, just couldn't. Seafood tasted frozen and freezer burnt - nothing was even edible. We left hungry and ate elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst possible experience in my last year!!! Park staff was rude and I couldn't even get on one ride. Park was over packed for this "Special 20 Year Anniversary" promotion. I wasted $60.00 to burn my ass off in the hot sun!!!! Never again!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here for hour and a half and still waiting to get in for appointment that is over an hour past schedule if you go here def make time. Horrible. Not 1 good thing to say at this point.  [END]
[BEGIN] Second time I got food poisoning from this place. It tasted great going down but the 4 times vomited last night was a horrible suprise I'm done.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst experience ever! Completely disorganized farm. Haunted maze time tickets that were purchased were not honored. Ran out of a lot of food. Long lines due to disorganization. Avoid at all costs.  [END]
[BEGIN] We wanted hot coffe and they did not heat the milk. They had a very bad attitude and did not let us sit inside. Never coming back there that's for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the slowest Starbucks EVER! 15 min on multiple occasions for a latte at 6am when its minimally busy. Training is seriously needed here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible. The new menu is limited with many of best items gone. No longer sourcing their meats from reputable local vendors. Prices went up, portions down. Had we gone any later the chicken i had would have been jerky. Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor service, bartender(manager) of that's what you want to call her proceeded to try to scold me because we we're upset that we had waited 30 minutes to get our checks. Very rude and the worst experience in Boston to date.. Food was mediocre by the way  [END]
[BEGIN] They don't have any sugar free flavors. They don't have any Equal. Kind of dissapointing. It's like all the coffee houses on this part of town are identical.  [END]
[BEGIN] Flight was cancelled and they sent us to this hotel. One staff member on duty and waited over an hour in line to get our room! Very disgusted at the service here and would never recommend or stay at any Doubletree again!  [END]
[BEGIN] So far me and my 4 friends have been sitting out back for 20 mins without any service... terrible first impression. Went to the bar and was told "someone would be sent over to serve you" apparently his name is Billy... where are you Billy? I'm thirsty and hungry!  [END]
[BEGIN] Services are good but they do not know how to deal with worker's compensation properly. And they flat out refused to work with my nurse who was trying to get them paid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Why does this McDonald's drive- thru take forever EVERYTIME NEVER FAILS I would never recommend coming to this McDonald's What is going on in there?  [END]
[BEGIN] never open when i'm not at work. can't reset password online. impossible to self-manage account/transponders. just total suckage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sign flashing open. Advertised open till 11 pm. @ 10:02 pm met at the front door with a sorry we are closed sorry we won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is very American, not authentic at all. The soup was too sweet. I ordered the kimchi fried rice, and there were more American sausages than kimchi. The environment is too loud as well. Overall, extremely disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst customer service possible. Placed order. Told 1 1/2 hr. Ok. Now at 2 hrs. Been to store they just say its coming. BS. Should have just said it was impacted by Harvy,irma etc. we are 3/4 mile from store.  [END]
[BEGIN] To bad no one came to our table for 20 mins. Would have like to try the place out. Nice location but NO SERVICE. Food might be good but wait staff makes you wait. Boooo  [END]
[BEGIN] Omg...this was recommended to us by someone who lives in the area. The food was good, can't argue that....but a day later....every...single...one of us had horrible diarrhea. There will be no "next time."  [END]
[BEGIN] No sweet tea. "We've tried in the past, but people kept complaining it was either too sweet or too unsweet, so we've just stopped." OK, fine. But revamp your menu, lest your clientele may start to think this joint is SOUTHERN COUNTRY STYLE. Jesus..  [END]
[BEGIN] The most horrible homophobic bar in Boston. Don't do it! "Get these homos out" - said by bartender  [END]
[BEGIN] We gave it another shot and I'm sad to say I'd rather have Dominos than this way overpriced pizza.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very expensive place, staff not really friendly. I ordered some food and was shocked when I asked for some bread and they told me that they have no bread, and instead tried to explain me their concept...  [END]
[BEGIN] One person behind the counter and he was the cashier as well. Long line during busy rush hour in the morning. It's a management problem!  [END]
[BEGIN] The wait killed the taste we should of enjoyed. An hour for fries, tacos, and sliders was a joke. Sliders were disappointing because the consisted of a lot of burned ends. Bread for burger and sliders were great. I just expected a better meal for such a long wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] nasty Chinese food. This kind of food is unacceptable! Too salty, broccoli hard as a rock, cabbages are rotted  [END]
[BEGIN] One guy behind the counter and a line 30 deep on a Sunday afternoon. What were the owners thinking of staffing one guy on a Sunday afternoon. Even salt and straw has four on at a time when they're busy. Sorry I had to wait 30 mins for a scoop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely indifferent service. Terribly overcooked food I couldn't finish. Salty shepherd's pie. Nice to call yourself a 'gastro pub' ... but you forgot to make any attempt at decent food. Never. Again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Found a huge bug in my salad. Halfway through the salad I discovered this bug. I almost threw up. I found the leg first, then found it's huge black body. Ugh!  [END]
[BEGIN] The beer specials are pretty cool. For a BBQ joint in Austin this place should be pretty far down on your list. If you want some good wings and a beer this place is not bad. For BBQ please go elsewhere  [END]
[BEGIN] disappointing... ran out of pearls and my pineapple slush was completely ice. five dollars for a cup of ice! you'll have to PAY me to come back..... also never get the avocado flavour... disgusting  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the worst. Avoid at all costs from Hartsfield Jackson. Driver was texting and driving and on the phone the whole trip. Dangerous!  [END]
[BEGIN] Overrated pizza. Racist staff. I have been to all pizza joints in East Boston and I have to say this is nothing special. That, mixed with the "we don't like your kind 'round here" attitude from the staff, is definitely a deal breaker for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Shittiest cane's ever. Chicken batter always under done. Smaller portion chicken strips than anywhere else. Complete rip off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bummer!! We came in to have a bite Saturday nite at 10:05pm but were told they now closed at 10pm instead of the 12:00am that the sign said. We had to go over to Waterloo to get some food since Scoreboard was already closed despite their posted closing time.  [END]
[BEGIN] They sell knock-off products here and won't tell you they're fakes (their Vision Spinner 2's are obvious, blatant, fakes). They're moderately pricey too (I've seen worse though).  [END]
[BEGIN] Never had to wait so long for an emission test. Felt like he put other races each other. And first come first serve doesn't mean shit for Mike.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pure bad even though it's run by Thai family.. how disappointing. The food is sooo greasy and the taste is not worth the price at all. On a small note, I found it rather unprofessional to always present the little daughter at the door.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst ride of the day. Not a ride. On your feet the whole time. You just watch special effects on a stage. The only impressive effect was a twister in the building.  [END]
[BEGIN] Management changed and so did the quality and number of items in the buffet. Recipes don't taste the same and service has become horrendous. So disappointed to lose one more good restaurant in Austin!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an overpriced very average restaurant. Went there with high hopes today as we were today it was the best place in animal kingdom. Very disappointed. $300 for very average, even the chicken was overdone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took forever to get two Whopper Jr's fries and drinks. Drink machine half empty. Sticky tables. Totally disorganized.  [END]
[BEGIN] Be aware the April server charge extra tip to you after you paid even if you tip already..  [END]
[BEGIN] Haven't received a single check from them despite what my online account says. The staff is unreliable and donated a lot of things I said I was coming to pick up. Now they're going out of business and not paying anyone. Class action lawsuit material.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty rude staff! They refused to seat at a table because they were "waiting for larger groups." You can tell that there were plenty of open tables! You could also tell how the wait staff and greeter could care less about my disappointment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food and price are ok, but service is very bad, means staffs. They can find any reason to give you a hard time. That why, I stopped go back there for a year now.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gotta laugh, after seeing their advertisement for full selection of batteries come to find out they do not have a battery for my vehicle. Total bummer. Next time I'll call ahead and ask before I come down.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a terrible dining experience, tried to rectify it with management and corporate - and nobody listened. Said it would be used for "training and development." The sad part is that the food is great, it's a shame I'll never go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the spaghetti and meatballs and pork and beans. Small portions and just not enjoyable. Very disappointing. Friends had the beef Wellington and lobster Thermidor and loved it. Maybe my girlfriend and I made the wrong choice? May not return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really bland food. Asked for spicy and it just wasn't there. We even had to salt our food. Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Be careful before driving out here. I'm here now in front of the business, and the door was locked at 9:29 AM, and the phone number for them on Yelp was disconnected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Literally the worst food I've ever had...and at such a high price. The avocado "salad" is shredded Iceburg lettuce and the salsa is the blandest salsa I've ever tasted. Jarred Tostitos salsa tastes gourmet compared to this. Unbelievable they are still in business. Plain awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Met my expectations for a dealership- extremely overpriced. Charged me $720 to replace an axle boot I had done elsewhere for $180. Shame on me for not getting a second opinion at that time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn't participate in any coupons or promotions including points. Skip this chicken for the clown across the way.  [END]
[BEGIN] The manager of this establishment is a total tots. Has no sense of costumer service and I am convinced he spits in the tacos.  [END]
[BEGIN] No cars left despite my reservation. Sad customer service--National you're better than this!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pissed off went to safe way at 1130 tonight and all doors were locked there was no sign indicating a special schedule and its not any american holiday, even the website and telephone message says midnight this is bulll shit  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't waste your time unless you want to be in an immature environment where you wait 30 minutes to get a drink and risk getting stabbed. No thank you. Avoid this place and go downtown.  [END]
[BEGIN] As a Chinese guy, I should say taste of this restaurant's hotpot is boring. Worst than make hotpot at home. Eating at here is waste of time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very dark,loud kitchen,bad tables,kind of felt like I was at a strip club buffet.boo, corporate restaurants are horrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst food ever and over charged not Worth it .. it is more like fast food, shouldn't be charged that much Ripped off!  [END]
[BEGIN] There is no in Joy in joysticks... We were really excited about this new venue; however the service was atrocious. We were NOT acknowledged or greeted at the bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not impressed with the performance by James. Got French tips, paid the usual $36... Didn't last me a week. Won't be returning or referring again. Avoid this place, it's a scam!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] If I could rate it with no stars, I would have. It was the worst take out I've ever had. -Watery beef that looked like dirty bath water -Noodles were overcoked and mushy -Shrimp was ovbiously frozen and not fresh -Green beans were from a can Don't eat here. Ever.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is getting too greasy and gave me headaches..even ate someone's hair that was in the food.. I used to be a fan of Lemon Thai but time to find a new restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst place for Honda service. Tony Yuen is the worst service consultant. Please stay away from this place  [END]
[BEGIN] rude on the phone - would not listen when I tired to explain the location of pick up in the time I was on the phone someone requested an Uber car - 3 minutes the car was there - never again  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered a chicken burrito bowl. Everything was fine until I got to a giant chunk of RAW chicken. Unacceptable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Epically slow service. Employees appear to be in super slo motion with no clear direction. Lack of leadership.  [END]
[BEGIN] Okay, after all the talk, this was the biggest restaurant dissapointment I've had in quite some time. The food was horrible and the service and wharehouse decor are the pits. Am I missing something?  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're looking for the charm of the old Green Pastures, I'm sorry to say that it is GONE.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pulled into the drive - thru at 12:04 this afternoon. It's currently 12:35 & we just got our food! Maybe I'm mistaken but, I was under the impression that fast food was supposed to be...I don't know... FAST!!! We weren't even given a receipt with our order!  [END]
[BEGIN] Since when is 18% tip automatically added for a party of just two? UPDATE: Restaurant Owner 'alex Z.' Khayyam wrote on 3/31/2012: "Typical groupon customer" Your food does not match up to your attitude, judging from your responses on Yelp.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not impressed and not coming back. Service was good, the food was mediocre, the greek potatoes were nastee.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very uncomfortable seats Bad food Unhelpful staff Beer is way overpriced Screens look awful  [END]
[BEGIN] This is probably by far the worst fried rice and teriyaki rice I have ever had in my life. The snow pea was raw and the fried rice is all wet and sticking together. I don't expect it to be good but not this bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely terrible service. Been here multiple times and had multiple issues. Most of the time the bad service was from the orange haired lady that looks like a manager  [END]
[BEGIN] 5 stars for having the perfect Halloween costume [flapper girl] in the window display AND a friggin' swexy dress on the mannequin right next to it. Negative 5,000 stars for not putting the items in the window display on sale until 2.5 weeks later.  [END]
[BEGIN] Let me sum this up in a really simple way: 10XGreat Music - 5XIdiotic Staff - 5XIdiotic Crowd = 0 Safe yourself the pain and head over to a classier place...  [END]
[BEGIN] Normally I love this place except today- the chicken shawarma meat was spoiled (cannot make this up) and about halfway through eating my salad I was so nauseous. So grossed out.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is location right off of international drive and sandlike. Super slow service. Not enough baristas to keep up with demand. I've been to a lot of Starbucks in Orlando and this is by far the worst.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sauce on chicken piccata was way too heavy. Almost like jello. Flavor was bland. You got a large portion of chicken but thick, flavorless sauce was just too much.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bring your own lunch if you plan to eat here, service is crappy. Waited a while and finally left without anyone every coming to take our order for food or drinks. We will not be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wish I could give this place no stars because their staff has some of the worst customer service I've ever seen and I'm a server.  [END]
[BEGIN] Refused to take a valid DD coupon...and the kid at the register had an attitude about it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I concur with many of these other reviews that they are completely unresponsive. I have left several messages and still have never received a response about a survey.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place, but service is not the same anymore. We've been sitting here for 15 minutes waiting for waitress.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the worst Vietnamese places in Boston Chinatown. Their portions are the measliest.  [END]
[BEGIN] WORSE SERVICE EVER !!!!! Girls at the front desk were so rude and unprofessional we sat for 30 minute and no one came to our table and this is the second time this happens I would have gave it zero star if I could  [END]
[BEGIN] Very rude staff and manager, did not honor a reservation though we were actually early for our reserved time.  [END]
[BEGIN] I usually like Baja but not today. The service was quick but I guess my first clue should have been the burrito not being that hot. Well now I'm paying for it. FOOD POISONING...avoid at all cost!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn't tell me that they canceled my cab, even though I called to double check. Stranded for an hour! Won't use again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is just crazy my out kids got push stuff stolen. The pizza was ok but cold by the time we got it. Half the stuff doesn't have tickets I took my kids here spent 150 realize they wasnt gettong ticket would not recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a craving... Took the kid.. Ate.... Ran for ice Cream to rid us of the grease bomb grease soaked chicken mouth feel afterwards. Trimmed off the extraneous pieces of non chicken fried blobs while eating. Was starving or would have trashed it after bite 1. Truly terrible  [END]
[BEGIN] HORRIBLE delivery service. How does it take an extra hour and a half to deliver something in the SAME town?! Additionally, when you call the restaurant they don't answer their phones. Beyond frustrating! Admittedly the wings are quite good but it is SO not worth it. STAY AWAY!  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought $100 of gifts items, requested 2 separate bags, staff refused... Offered to pay for the extra bag, was still refused... Was quoted some BS company policy... Lost a customer over a 20cent bag...  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks for the beer. But we didn't need yet another sports bar in the neighborhood. This one is no different from the rest.  [END]
[BEGIN] outdated hotel , overpriced, rude staff. advise you check out the marriott courtyard brookline; much much nicer and cheaper. comparable room will run $250-260 vs $300 +  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible, horrible place. This is not chinese food. But service is even worse than the food. Skip and never come here. Don't even try it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hmm don't order the chicken burger they just slap it on two buns with cheese and charge u up the kazoo. It is half the size of a dollar bill.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went to get my tire repaired and they just worried about upselling and trying to get me to buy a new tire, they saidthe tire could not be repaired, I went to another dealer and they said no problem! saved me a $100.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still at Waves Car Wash in Dedham. Bought regular car wash. Rims still very dirty. They said I paid for car wash. Needed to pay extra $5.00 if I want rims clean. Took picture but can't attach. Go to more ethical place.  [END]
[BEGIN] A waste of money. Overpriced! Nothing special about these pastries. Poorly managed. No system for lines or ordering. Poor customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't waste your time or money here. Go one block up to the Marriott Residence Inn.  [END]
[BEGIN] 3.50 you call it's! Including top shelf! Everything! And then you get your tab and suddenly everything wasn't 3.50. Watch out for this scam.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unless you enjoy horrendous guest service, I would suggest looking elsewhere. Been with this unit for several years and have yet to have a positive customer service experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want to have gut wrenching, well, gut pain for your entire flight, definitely eat here before boarding. 7 hours later, still waiting for whatever this is to pass. the food didn't taste great on the way in either.  [END]
[BEGIN] AWFUL. 1. Very difficult to find in the building. 2. Waited forever for my appointment. 3. The doctor didn't listen to me, tried to treat me with medications that I have already used. So annoying. 4. Got the bill in the mail for $180.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food has been good. Went tonight and the hostess was absent. 3 servers came by and told us someone would be by to help us. After almost 10 minutes we just left. Never found out how long the wait would be as we never talked to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] While his was the most honest estimate, Jason has not returned multiple calls to finish the job. Came highly recommended - I would NOT do business with Lakeside and not recommend them to anyone!!!!! Very poor follow up and customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow! Extremely mediocre:( McD's gets a 4 star grade. We couldn't get a straight answer on what exactly was in the Garden Burger. I expect more for a $50 meal for 4 people. Boo! Also, the back room had lotsa room but was frigid:(  [END]
[BEGIN] "Eek! Methinks not" nails it. The music is not only too loud, it sucks. Drove me out, didn't order anything. Wasn't gonna pay $5.41 (??) for a beer just to be tortured by... easy-listening soft jazz muzak?  [END]
[BEGIN] Literally the WORST motel ever!!!!!!! Stains everywhere. Bed bug problems. Shitty furniture and shitty tv. No internet. It was the most terrible place I've ever stayed in.  [END]
[BEGIN] I JUSTgot kicked out of the.store, for asking if they.did shipping. Guy.is just.plain rude, and the.store smells like.dog. Avoid!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I go to the Quincy office and the doctors are ok but if you need to see someone right away due to an emergency they just about tell you to jump in a lake. Money is the only concern here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service and attitude from the workers. They forgot a lot of orders. Do not go here  [END]
[BEGIN] Poorly mismanaged. Don't waste your money at this place. A total miss on every point.  [END]
[BEGIN] One pizza was estimated to take an hour and a half. When that time arrived, nobody showed. When I contacted the store, they have no record of the order, even though I have an email confirming and a pending payment on my credit card. Garbage service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just awful service. Waitress was mean and condescending. Made comments based on people not ordering more alcohol. Really made us uncomfortable to dine here. Food was what you would expect.  [END]
[BEGIN] terrible service!!! I was there on 4-2-14 and I will never use this branch again, the greeter its very polite but they only have 2 representatives and they are so slow!!!! 10 people were waiting and they didn't seem to care thank god for suntrust!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst Starbucks in the world. So slow, always get order wrong and terrible service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Waiting 1 hr and 26 min to rent a car! Line is longer than a Disneyworld ride. Staff doesn't care, barely a mumble out of them- AVOID!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad food and awful migraine inducing acoustics. Everything tasted the same - lemongrass, hot peppers and lime leaves. And why when you order the $58.00 pp tasting menu do you get two dishes with mussels.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service at the front desk. The people they employ here don't give a ****. They are lazy and do the bare minimum that is required of them. Sad that I had to leave the nice people of Quincy PF and make this my home gym.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has gone so downhill over the past 10 years. Its a shame, I keep trying to give them another chance but they always mess up on my simplest orders. They also all seem miserable there. See ya for good!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been sitting at the for an hour waiting for my food Changing shifts The bartender Lea could give a shit She never put the order in  [END]
[BEGIN] THE WORST FOOD TRUCK EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD!!! The tacos have maybe 1/2 oz of meat, the rest is lettuce, carrots, and onions. The owner or cook, whatever he is, is a complete a$$hole. Never contract out this food truck for your own good! What a complete waste!!!!!! Miserable experience!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ice cream was great, unfriendly employees and got rock hard stale gummy bears on my ice cream. Couldn't even chewy threw it so I had to pick them all out.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was not good. The Wellington was ordered medium rare and came out well done. The pork belly appetizer was like shoe leather. Contacted the manager by email and never heard back from them. Would not recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a nightmare! I chose to have my vehicle towed here after an accident and I would caution anyone else against doing so.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am in search of a go to cheap manicure place in Boulder. This is not it. While it is cheap ($12 vs. avg $15), you get what you pay for. Cheap polish, sloppily done, and rushed. I'd avoid this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food leave everything to be desired. Drinks are overpriced. Always feels like a sauna inside.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had an electrical box in my room start arcing and flashing and banging and called the Eversource customer service line for help and the woman was rude and didn't believe me so I had to call the fire department and they told me to call Eversource.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered two pasta dishes. Fettucini alfredo with chicken and alioli with sausage. Food was garbage. Fettucini had zero sauce and portions were small. Price was around $26. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the other restaurants inthe area (Alfonss). Dont know how they are still in business.  [END]
[BEGIN] It used to be good but the price is insane now $5 for less oz. VISO will be going out of business with prices like this.  [END]
[BEGIN] My Gift Certificate for Coldwater Creek Spa was not honored because the company went bankrupt. I think the new spa (Me Spa) should have honored these gift certificates for good business practice. Since it was not honored I will not be going to this new spa unfortunately.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful service from the cashier...don't bother just go across the street. Where they have great food.  [END]
[BEGIN] If I could give 0 stars I would. I will never give this dealership one more dime of my money. Such a shame I was just there test driving a 2018 vehicle! The service department is awful!!!! Contact me with questions.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had our usual Friday lunch with colleagues here again. I felt very uncomfortable to pay extra for mustard I asked. It makes me think if I will be charged for salt and pepper next time. I recommend management to re-think about their policy to charge for condiments.  [END]
[BEGIN] WAY WAY WAY too loud today, could feel the bass from a block away. Even at Sheridan's, the grocery store nearby, people were unhappy with hearing their music. Not cool or respectful of the neighboring businesses at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not sure why I went here without checking Yelp. Would not have. Anyway, typical tourist trap. I. The mood for Greek food so I went in. Obviously it caters to the tourists. Order the souvlaki plate with gyro meat. Almost inedible. Would not waste your time.  [END]
[BEGIN] We waited for almost one hour and everyone came later than us has finished eating. So we eventually did not get food at all and we were in a rush. It is really disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was so annoying No service , and roaches ! The only thing that was good was the front desk lady  [END]
[BEGIN] The pizza was cold and 40 minutes late. I asked for extra cheese and it came with NONE! No cheese. Wtf... this is the second time we have had trouble with Pizza Hut. Dominoes it is. Thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolute dump. Plenty of air freshener to give the appearance of cleanliness. The floors are filthy. This place was great in the 60's I'm sure. The beds are less comfortable than an army cot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sushi price way to high, extremely small portion, and is not fresh!! Will not go back !  [END]
[BEGIN] The place is beautiful. The staff is great. The food is terrible. I love sushi, I don't even know how they succeed to make such bad sushi. I went because of the reviews, ordered 4 rolls, but it was the worse sushi we ever tried.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't come to this bar if you don't want to experience racism first hand! Kicking people out for being hispanic! Amazing that they're still in business.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there for bingsu and was so disappointed. I can make a better softer shaved ice at home!! The whole thing lacked flavor..even their ice cream doesn't have flavor. Don't understand why or how but it was awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had high hopes for this place, but these guys are like really pushy car salesman, asking too many questions. Couldn't just look around.  [END]
[BEGIN] I honestly wish I could leave a zero stars, this hotel has the worst service and they clearly don't care to improve!  [END]
[BEGIN] turn off the screaming ad on your website. the pause button doesn't work. geez.  [END]
[BEGIN] Filthy n terrible customer service. I stood there for almost 10 min waiting for my cup for my drink. Never again! I had no where to eat because of no clean tables.  [END]
[BEGIN] We arrived in Boston last night and we're so excited to dine here. What DISAPPOINTMENT! "higher" thank PF Changs. No sure how the chef is a James Beard award winner.. server Xavier was amazing!!! Really bummed that we wasted a night here.  [END]
[BEGIN] DO NOT EVER CALL THIS COMPANY.. RIDICULOUSLY RIPPED US OFF. $90.00 charge to get a part which he should have in his truck. And he didn't mention when he quoted us before he took off. $190.00 for about 20 min work. Once again do not use them, please!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The place is old and needs major/modern renovation. Seats are small and not reclinable as other modern theatres. Whoever seats next to you gey ready to bump shoulders (but this is Austin, everything is old and overcrowded). Food is ok and have a good selection of draft beers.  [END]
[BEGIN] If i could give a negative star i would. Server was nice but absent, steak came out raw, and the manager was extremely aggresive and rude. Will never be going there again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered eggs benny with bacon for takeout and food was cold as soon as it was picked up. Not a great way to serve bacon. Ended up with food poisoning. Will never go back. Avoid takeout,  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was good, order was wrong, trying to get credit, the desert was frozen solid. do not know it I will order again. maybe if I get my credit,,, called Rice Bowl, they said they do not do that.... have to call someone else ???  [END]
[BEGIN] Overrated. Weak in taste. High on price. Go to the Thai Noodle place on Guadalupe instead.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is as far from a burger joint as one can be. Over priced, greasy, and about as much flavor as a truck tire. Go elsewhere?  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not enjoy this place at all. The Milky Sake wasn't good. The broth for the beef udon was very bland and the Miso soup was cold. The Japanese fried chicken was flavorful but that's about it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst Dominos. Over a two an a half hour wait no pizza and all they did was laugh about the order while on hold.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cafe D'Antonio just refused to seat us because our entire party wasn't there yet. My kids were starving and we weren't even offered something to drink. In 11 years we've lived in Celebration this was the worst restaurant experience here to date... Not cool.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very disappointed in the veggie wrap...99.99% lettuce..for $8.59 I expected better...  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got my food delivered to me 45 minutes ago and it sucked. The shrimp rolls were burnt to a crisp, the "fried rice" was basically steamed brown rice and the egg roll was cold on the ends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went into this place expecting someone to tickle my fancy - NOT happening! All sorts of paraphernalia hanging on the walls and in cabinets and such - but owner says no way was I getting my fancy tickled with or without paraphernalia... neva going back again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Unitus "approved" me for a loan, then took a week of wasting my time before reneging on said loan. Worst experience I've had with a financial institution anywhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Flyer and website don't mention that tours are only offered on the hour. I had to wait 50+ minutes for the next tour since I arrived right after the full hour.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's been 1 hour and a taxi has not even been dispatched to my location yet... When I called for an update the lady just said "I'll keep working on it" no apology no sympathy... I'm going to be so late for work... This is unreal.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is wack! Sucks cause bdubs has dope wings! But this location gives bdubs a bad name. Vibe sucks... staff sucks.. and customer service sucks. Boo  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got the worst $10 sandwich ever. It's like a burnt crouton. UPDATE: I was so dissatisfied that I called the shop. Spoke to the owner, who was genuinely apologetic and quickly sent me a refund+. I'll give it another chance.  [END]
[BEGIN] I come to here with my friends once a while and most of us are fan of the vermicelli dishes. However, yesterday we had a lunch there and noticed the portion served had significantly shrunk!  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't ever do business with State Farm! Horrible service! They will do everything in their power to screw you and not pay your claim. Don't ever do business with McCollum auto body either. This is a state farm preferred body shop and they do horrible work. Very unprofessional.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wouldn't give them one if it weren't required. Food is l o u s y. Im so disgusted I dont even want to write the review but, it is so so necessary.  [END]
[BEGIN] 2.5 hours for an oil change. Yep. Thats right.  [END]
[BEGIN] Business refuses to offer nationally-advertised deals. Lame. Avoid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't buy the groupon because you will not be able to use it and Groupon will give you too much trouble when you ask for a refund.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ate here on Tuesday evening. Service was not good. Lines were long. I got blue cheese on my burger and it had been slapped on the burger and was not melted in the least. The fries were the only saving grace.  [END]
[BEGIN] So... incredibly... BLAND. Order the cubano sandwich or go somewhere else, because every other dish here sucks. Out of 8 meals I've ordered, just about everything was disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lousy attitude, coffee is so-so. Customers seem to be competing with each other to earn a spot in an Apple commercial. Avoid at all costs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Way too much sauce and the crust sucks and this is just another chain pizza place added to the west side wonderland of chain pizzas. Thank god bari pizza is not far from grove city or I would not eat pizza at all anymore.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunate. Slimy blobs of ground beef do not a good taco make. The absolute worst White People Tacos i've ever seen. And I grew up in East Texas. There are MUCH better $2 tacos in our fantastic city than this trash. Go (anywhere) else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow! Two thumbs down. I wasn't expecting a gourmet meal....just wanted a quick sandwich. I ordered the Club. What I got was a single slice of turkey, barely two slices of bacon, wilted lettuce and 1/2" slice of tomato on white hard bread. Never again, not even if it's free.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was awful. We waited for 45 minutes for a table then an hour an a half for food. Also when we asked for no onions that's exactly what they put all over the top of our salad.  [END]
[BEGIN] I can easily taste MSG even though the waitress told me they don't use it. I doubt that they ever wash their vegetables since some leaves are still attached to each other.  [END]
[BEGIN] Contacted this company and arranged a time to meet for an estimate. I took a few hours off of work to meet with them and they never showed or called.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yesterday I ordered a burrito bowl, super disappointed with the food, I ordered rice and i could literally count how many pieces of rice there were in my food, the chicken was hard and there was shredded cheese! I dont like shredded cheese at all!  [END]
[BEGIN] The server making the pizza was extremely rude and really arrogant. She put barely any toppings and when we asked for more cheese was extremely rude and changed her tone. This is awful customer service and will not be returning to blaze again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not like the service, checked twice for id, was not able to change the gratuity, did not accept the cake I baked for my friend's birthday, over priced and very small portions  [END]
[BEGIN] Only way this place stays in business is because there's no competition in Hillsdale. Bad food, runny curries, over or undercooked vegetables. Nice atmosphere and good service though. But food is below mediocre, some dishes inedible. Wish they'd leave and let some better restaurant move in to the neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay away. Had no less then 20 visits by contractors in less than a year. Stole $300 from me during the move out by not getting quotes for an appliance door.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not eat here if your hungry...smallest portions everrrrrrr. Service is worse than the size  [END]
[BEGIN] The highlight of this meal was the bread... Was very disappointed with the bolognese and the margarita pizza which lacked any sort of flavor. Would recommend 20 different Italian restaurants in the area over Posto.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really atrocious customer service. They were exceptionally rude. Their pizza is good, but definitely not worth being talked down to and called "hun." Never going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Slow as hell, unorganized, always a line. How about waiting 4 hours for a prescription getting home and realizing they forgot one!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Zero stars for unfriendly service. My wife and I walked in, two white guys were behind the counter, barely looked at us, so we just walked out immediately. We were thinking about biking around Stanley Park, guess not. Left with a bad taste of Canadian in-hospitality  [END]
[BEGIN] Used to go to this place quite a bit. Success seems to have ruined their attitude. Asked for a cup of ice because the soda was not cold out of the cooler and they told me that would be 25 cents!!!! Are you kidding me? See ya later!  [END]
[BEGIN] No food, waited while they forgot my drink order 3x. Never did get my drink even after 6 orders of sushi. Had to stop eating because I was thirsty. Nice biz model guys... Did I mention that the same thing happened the last I went there.  [END]
[BEGIN] $10 cover charge for this place even with a dinner reservation? Ridiculous. Try your luck somewhere else. This food is not worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wish I could agree with the fellow yelpers on this one but there door and yelp page have them open till 4:30 but they had an employee standing guard at the door telling people they are closed at 3:45  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. They couldn't get bills correct, food was delayed and sub-par at best and more than one order was incorrect. The manager couldn't even apologize and comp dessert correctly. Just terrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonton soup was quite strange. Wontons were overcooked. Egg roll had no flavor. Will never order from again  [END]
[BEGIN] Mediocre at best. Empanadas were tasty ... We tried all kinds. The Cuban sandwich was very good. The roast pork was a disappointment ... The meat tastes old. Food was served on paper plates and plastic silverware. Restaurant has potential but they can do much better.  [END]
[BEGIN] No where near as good as the old Kool Korners. I feel this place's bad vibes just for marketing themselves as a replacement for the awesome sandwich shop that used to be. The only thing worse than their questionable marketing is their sub-par sandwiches.  [END]
[BEGIN] Place is a dump! Stay far away. Dirty, service is bad, food no good and they have the nerve to charge 200 per night. Would never stay here again nor another holiday inn  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced and not worth it and the people are very rude. I can't figure out why I keep going back here and just keep going to the new 7 11 that just moved in right down the street is a much better deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awfull experience. I'm surprised there were no bugs in my bed. We paid $300 per night for two night and it couldn't get any worse. Sink was plugged everything is very unpleasant and jail like. Very negative experience. Don't stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ive been sitting here for 15 minutes and no one has come to serve us. This food better be good, no one has even checked up on us. Customer service here is wack.  [END]
[BEGIN] Literally the WORST Brazilian I've ever experienced. Too hot wax. Double dipping in the same wax pot as a friend I went with. Left over wax on skin. Lack of privacy. Extremely painful. I would not suggest coming here for a Brazilian ever  [END]
[BEGIN] when we got there service was good but the food wasn't that great ( salty and the water taste really bad)  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm going to havevto disagree here. I walk in, the restaurant Is a mess, the food is mediocre and I can only have water as the soda machine Is not working, very dissatisfied, employees walking out the bathroom with out washing their hands, and handling the chicken wings  [END]
[BEGIN] Room had been spayed to cover the smell of smoke. Yes in a non-smoking hotel. Great fragrance gave me a migraine!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very bad service and food was served cold. They don't take order in time or serve in time. Even beer was late and served after appetizer. I am visiting from California and I have never experienced a poor service like this before.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food and atmosphere are equally terrible. This establishment has gone way downhill and I will not be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] 15 minutes and no service, place is dead. Got mixed drinks before the beer pitcher. Salad came, no silverware and waitress took off before we could ask, and hasn't come back yet. Sitting here now while writing this. Will not come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude blonde young hostess. Needs to work on her people skills. I understand it's summer and busy but she could've said her two word answers to my questions a little more politely, maybe with a smile. It is after all her job. I wouldn't want this person representing my establishment  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is great if you like paying $3.25 per adult to sit and watch your child play games.  [END]
[BEGIN] This used to be my favorite place for a sinfully delicious treat, sadly it's changed. The cherry bomb cupcake had strange colorless cherries with an odd texture within it. The frosting was greasy, salty and just not yummy in any way. I miss the old Tea and Cakes.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't know how can anyone can rate this place more than a Zero? Most tasteless food EVER!! Ended up paying over $18.00 for this plate and a bottle of water. Highly NOT recommended  [END]
[BEGIN] Place used to be great, but after closing and reopening it hasn't been the same. Smaller portions, lower quality food ans service isn't the same. Unfortunately not a place i would recommend any more  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service. I was sitting at my table for 15 minutes before my waiter showed up. Do not go to this restaurant. It is a waste of time and money. There are so many other restaurants that are 10 times better on south congress that would be a superior choice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Never again will I ever step foot in this horrific institution that they call a hair salon. Rude and even Ruder customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff but the skill set is not there and tend not to listen to the style you want  [END]
[BEGIN] Cashier is rude, service is worse, and burger sloppy. First time here & figured I'd try something new. Bad choice!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just sat here for 10 min after being seated with no service. No drinks no introduction nothing. The host seated us and gave us menus and we just sat. Decided to get up and leave. Won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude server. Not baby friendly restaurant. I do not recommend this restaurant if you have a baby less then 2 years old. They are not accommodating. Food is average nothing special.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not do the buffet, ordered dishes instead. Food was very bad, not authentic chinese taste at all. Always seems to be very empty  [END]
[BEGIN] NEVER GET IT DELIVERED!! Only good when you Dine-in ..food is completely different!  [END]
[BEGIN] The guy told me a lens was $1599 and looked online at Canon itself selling it for $949. Definitely don't shop here!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to go here all the time as a kid. I used to drive up to the back window and order reasonably priced rock shrimp. This place is now an over priced tourist trap. No thanks.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is at best badly managed, at worst running a scam. Pre charged me for extra services, didn't do them and now I'm left chasing them for a refund / disputing charges with my credit card. Fast Park across the freeway has far superior customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had these guys cater as part of Fooda. It was the saltiest worst food I ever ate, made me embarrassed to have brought friends to try Indo chinese. Never again  [END]
[BEGIN] This KFc is the wirst. They would not let me pay for extra cheese. How stupid. I was told there's no button on the register. I even spoke to the manager Marco. I wont spend my money at this KFC ever again. Just plain rude.  [END]
[BEGIN] The customer service at this place is so poor. They change their hours at will without posting them, so when you walk in a good thirty minutes before the business closing time printed on their door they can turn you away. It's a shame for them, losing money and business  [END]
[BEGIN] The beer was good. I had a Caesar. It was wilted. I had the pork. It was fatty and flavorless. I tried the burger. It was grey. Enough said.  [END]
[BEGIN] Walmart used Newgistics for shipping their online sale to us. Very poor packing practices, basically crushing product with no concern for our needs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered meal delivered at 7pm on a Monday night, it arrived at 9:45pm, after being told twice it was out for delivery. No email listed on website and person who kept answering phone was clueless.  [END]
[BEGIN] If I could give 0 stars I would. Their express wash is an absolute joke. Wasted every penny spent there. Poorly washed, poorly dried, minimal effort on the staffs part. I'll never return.  [END]
[BEGIN] The first room they gave us was already occupied by other guests. The second room's carpeting was soaking wet and they wouldn't give us another room. Plus the bar across the street played loud live music until 2 am  [END]
[BEGIN] Crappy place. Draft beer means Bud light. Sllooowwwwww service. Blah blah blah. Cramped pack with 2 person tables. No elbow room. Big line at the bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Update: I have called to speak to the district manager at least 4 times and have yet to get a call back. Then they decided to turn me over to collections. Save your money and go to a dental office that knows how to respect their patients.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow. This place has changed since they moved from west broadway. Now terrible service, terrible food. Terrible everything. Almost like they didn't care. Also out f lot of stuff. Completely dead. West broadway location used to be packed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sub-average quesadilla. Got the chicken one and was severely disappointed. Not tasty, similar to a Taco Bell quesadilla except for the fact that this was $9. I'd rather eat Taco Bell, at least they know their worth.  [END]
[BEGIN] Waitress passed by our table three times. Waited on the people that came in after us and ignored us when we asked for a menu. We were the only African-Americans there. Racist establishment. Avoid it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here with a couple friends and the food was cold and they took back the food and the food was hot but the cheese steak bread was so soggy so it just picked off the cheese steak pieces and eat it never going back  [END]
[BEGIN] The place and food is correct but I ve never have such a bad experience in term of service. A waitress absolutely unbearable and they change the 1 for a 7 on my tip!! I highly recommend to avoid that place considering all the nice restaurants just nearby  [END]
[BEGIN] Mears sucks. I just spent over a half an hour trying to book on-line. Nothing but problems. I can imaginge what their car serivce is like.  [END]
[BEGIN] Personally insulted. A rude lady with blonde hair decided that our group wasn't worth their time. It was unusual and sad. I felt bad for her she was clearly dealing with things not related to us.  [END]
[BEGIN] I put a 'hold' notice on mail from April 5 through April 10th because I am out of town. I received an email confirmation of the hold. On April 7th I got an email from USPS saying a package had been left on my porch!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just threw out my food I wanted chicken fries not cold chicken nuggets. There IS a difference. And you didn't add the chili on the whopper dog. I would call and complain but I don't think anyone would understand me. Sucks, man  [END]
[BEGIN] Used them once, lost the pants to my $700 suite. They didn't follow up with their cleaning factory or call back. Had to track them down and still don't have an answer.  [END]
[BEGIN] One star is too high of a review for this despicable restaurant. Everything about this place is horrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst shopping experience I've ever had! They have a horrible return policy, rude employees, the manager is zero help, and the store is a cluttered mess, and it smells.  [END]
[BEGIN] Disappointed in this place. Picked up a bunch of sandwiches for my colleagues and they would only let me get credit for one sandwich on my frequent diner card. Will do all my future group and catering orders from places that appreciate my business like Boloco around the corner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst selection for its namesake that I have ever seen. Embarrassment to the word Whiskey. That said. The service was not bad at all. They did the best they could with what they had to work with.  [END]
[BEGIN] 服务员态度极差，说话阴阳怪气，侮辱客人 差评！！！！对待客人特别不友好，饭菜口味一般 不会再来第二次。让服务员倒杯水都不情愿，反正就是差差差差差差！！！强烈不建议去，最后给小费嫌不是整张的是乞丐 找零还回来 我真的是无语 第一次在美国遇到这么态度差的餐厅 。  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was terrible as the Treehouse, and even worse as the Burke. If you like miserable food, sub-par service, and clowns for owners, this is the place for you!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just chatted with these guys online...they told me to go to a local store. I have a virus on my laptop and need memory. Thought it was funny because their website tells you to choose them instead of Geek Squad. I guess I'm going to Best Buy now....  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst breakfast I paid $35 bucks for 2 in a long time. Avoid eggs Benedict and corned beef hash.  [END]
[BEGIN] So how long until this is an empty, closed up building? I've been twice now, the last time only to walk through to the other bars. It's so sad how cheesie and bad this place is in comparison to how awesome and great BBQ was. Sad face.  [END]
[BEGIN] Called ahead and asked if they could rotate the tires on my Pilot, said they could. After they changed my oil they let me know the could not rotate my tires but graciously would not charge me for it. Unbelievable...  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't eat at the restaurant there! I just witnessed this lady put chicken tenders in the fryer that someone took bites ok and everybody there has a piss poor attitude  [END]
[BEGIN] Not good at all. Service lacking food very average too many other decent choices in the area. No Italian feeling to this place at all. Like a bar that had an afterthought to try and serve Italian food. Won't be back  [END]
[BEGIN] Long lines, only one polite employee, so unhelpful! Only one person mans the front with 20 people in line!  [END]
[BEGIN] With change in ownership the food has gone downhill. It's terrible and I won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Complete disaster. Waited 45 mins for dessert before walking out. Don't waste your time  [END]
[BEGIN] this place is pretty cheap, but not worth the savings. I've tried a manicure here twice since it's a very convenient location for me, but both times I've left with a bloody finger. employees are too rushed and not at all professional.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately, this place misses the mark. The food is overpriced, and the service is very slow. We live in town, and are extremely disappointed, as we had such high hopes for a "Tavern". We won't return.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were really excited to eat here; unfortunately, we received horrible service, food came out cold and under-seasoned, waitstaff was rude, and manager was even ruder. We will never come back here.  [END]
[BEGIN] This location is terrible. Rude manager works there. No doubts they have no success at the location. We like Winners, but something should be done there to improve Customer Service.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm not sure if I can really add more to what's already been said. I've used these guys twice (I try to give people a second chance) and both times were truly awful. Incredibly rude, late, lost, etc. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place will not even answer their phone... Alleged to be the beat florist in Texas!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Super slow service...don't go here for lunch if you're on a timed break!  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful cleaning. Nothing ended-up to be clean, dirt everywhere, carpet, windows, dash, no exception. The work was done by teenagers, and probably had no training and no equipment. I didn't see any trace of water been used. https://www.facebook.com/pages/US-1-High-End-Auto-Detailing/1652225861675637?sk=timeline  [END]
[BEGIN] For those looking for a great watch buying experience, I'd suggest paul duggans, bobs watches , and bernard watch. These are businesses I've done business with and have had great experiences with. They all will take in trade for purchases that will give you the most for your watches value.  [END]
[BEGIN] We order an appetizer while waiting for our food. $80 for a seafood tower. well i was quite desapointed. there is nothing that looks like a tower!! then we waited 90 min and when we asked, they didnt even start our food. Not a great experience as expected!  [END]
[BEGIN] The eggnog was spoiled and I have a stomach bug that will last me through the new year. Happy New Year?! #rolltide #ew  [END]
[BEGIN] The guy is a asshole. Every time I've seen him interact with anyone he's yelling. Been to the food carts multiple times and it never changes. Angry old man.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered pickup twice this week. Today I found a bug in my salad. I probably won't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible customer service! Heavy set man who works in the office was rude and condescending. I had a hard time doing the self checkout and asked for help, he was being really rude during the whole thing. Never been to a place with such poor service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Almost literally half of my orders the times I have been here have been wrong. I used to think it was a language barrier but even ordering food online is the same way. So inconsistent. Either the staff or the chef's do not understand what's on their own menu  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered food for delivery. It arrived super late and when I called to enquire about the order, a very rude person answered the call.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered food from China Wok one week ago and got so sick I ended up going to the ER. Hospital told me I had salmonella poisoning. Please keep this in mind before ordering from this restaurant. I don't want anyone else getting as sick as I did.  [END]
[BEGIN] If I could give less for customer service I would.. they tell you all kinds of things when u ask questions and the reality is opposite and later the staff actually tries to prove you wrong when u tell them their statements!  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad, rude service/low quality sushi/expensive. Don't waste your money here, it'd be more satisfying to burn it with a zippo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible teenage chefs over cook not-so-fresh seafood. Service was lackluster at best. Pain to get to as you will be frisked by homeland security. I had better food at a Red Lobster - now that's just sad isn't it  [END]
[BEGIN] Customer service was excellent but the food there is horrible for my opinion maybe I ate too much but as soon as I got home I threw everything up  [END]
[BEGIN] Wrong delivery day. No vase included, which I paid for. Third call to customer service answered after 17 rings. No callbacks yet, after 7 days. Would never recommend-will never use again. Worst floral experience ever.  [END]
[BEGIN] Received the absolute worst customer service experience in a long while from the night shift employee named Patrick. Extremely rude on the phone with a completely unwarranted attitude. That's not how you treat customers. I'm never staying here and if I could submit this review with zero stars, I would.  [END]
[BEGIN] We ordered the number one with combo. Tasted very normal. IT'S JUST A NORMAL HOTDOG. But more expensive. The fries was a failure. McDonald's even taste better than theirs. Place wasn't clean. The table was dirty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely horrible service. Staff is slow and very cold. Makes the atmosphere awkward and unwelcoming.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrrible!! Waited 90 minutes for a 5 min ride!!! The inside where we waited was exciting than the actual ride. What a waste of my time. If the wait time is more than 10 min. Skip it please. Save yourself the disappointment!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ew, I hate Spelp. In case my previous reviews weren't really clear, this is the worst doctor, with the worst office and worst staff, I've ever been to. It's a den of horrible. Take it from a real person, not an Orangehead.  [END]
[BEGIN] They did not treat me well, I feel they saw a younger female and decided not to try with me. Never heard from them again. I have experience and I write 50 wpm. I am not a waste of time.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really wanted to like this place after reading the reviews. I got the combination plate to taste a bit of everything, but it failed miserably. Forget what you heard, definitely pass on this.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't know where these other folks went...mediocre service and they could not get the order right on several folks. Including me twice. I am not coming back here for " the best burgers in Atlanta " the place is pretentious, underserved and truly overrated  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible pizza, poor service. Grilled chicken on the Caesar was good. I think this place is one way Boston puts one over on unsuspecting New Yorkers. The pizza here is not even close to good, traditional NY pizza. NY should sue. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely dirty, slow service. It's a shame really because we use to love SteaknShake.  [END]
[BEGIN] Showed up for an inspection at 5:30 and the guy told me that he had just turned the machine off. Why advertise with a giant STATE INSPECTION advert if you're going to only have it open selected hours that don't match the hours of your business.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was mediocre at best. Why do they soak everything in soy sauce? My sirloin tasted like shoe leather, but the good thing was that they gave me a boat load of rice and noodles. Don't bother with this place, just go to your favorite Chinese fast food place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful. No flavor rice dry and old. How in the world are they open. Windows and chairs are filthy.  [END]
[BEGIN] They sent me a bill for three separate co-payments that were already paid at the time of service! Luckily I saved the receipts. They tried to blame my insurance but even my insurance said, "they're trying to double charge you." After the third "mistake," I am skeptical of this establishment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Currently sitting in their parking lot after wasting $60 on awful soggy fish that I couldn't finish and didn't even want to take home, really gross and really expensive. I wouldn't recommend this place at all and will never be back  [END]
[BEGIN] They never get our To Go order correct. I'd rather drive a little longer to the Westminster IHOP for better service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just like acapulcos but with much higher prices but the same food. Not a place I crave to return to..ps, service is appalling.  [END]
[BEGIN] The place was a dump.What a waste of time.Cheap food,cheap taste.Tables and chairs were old and broken.Not a good place to eat,will not go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Shouldn't the drivers keep their eyes on the road and not be flipping through the passenger tickets while driving 50 miles per hour on the expressway and only one car length away from the car/truck ahead???  [END]
[BEGIN] What a dump. Even if i was in college - i wouldn't go here! The stench when you walk in is terrible bathroom is taking your life in your hands!! So many other dives that aren't so scary.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a party here. Catering menu is overpriced. Guac was $600 for 3 bowls. Plus bad service. Mediocre food. Don't bother. There are so many other good food options in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude and aggressive manager, awful pizza and greasy arancini, avoid this place, for late night food and pizza head to bova on salem st  [END]
[BEGIN] There brunch is horrible for an outside patio they sure don't use it that well. And what a great location all the restaurants and bars next to the place has great food the food is horrible there for brunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] This company drives me nuts! It's a RECYCLING company in PORTLAND that still relies on paper invoices, and snail mail. No online bill pay, no payment over the phone by credit card, and no paperless options. It's the only bill I still have to pay the old-fashioned way. Grrrr.  [END]
[BEGIN] This ride deserves no stars... my tv at home has better graphics lol... such a bad experience,  [END]
[BEGIN] If you really want to have food from here, make sure you make it to go. Horrible service. Also I saw a customer getting kicked out from the restaurant for complaining. Lots of drama here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food could have taste better if heated properly. Gujju food pretty bland. Surprised how this place still running apparently after 13 yrs in service...  [END]
[BEGIN] Flavourless. I actually lost my appetite. And when I asked for my money back they refused saying it was against policy because I already ate some. Well obviously. I bought it to eat it. I had two bites and called it a day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cold food! Tried to charge for extra packets of BBQ sauce for their cold hard chicken tenders. I realize it is fast food, but cold food is unacceptable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the worst experience at this hotel from the second I walked in the door. They caused such an inconvenience for me and I will not be visiting again. Ever.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would be able to review the food, however we sat for 10 minutes without even an acknowledgement. To bad we were excited to try something new.  [END]
[BEGIN] We came here for a two small plates and waited about 30 mins for the food to be ready. Definitely not coming back, although the food was okay, Id rather a place with better service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not buy a mattress here!! My mattress started sagging but not enough in their opinion for them to replace it or offer a refund. I spent almost $3,000!! Totally disgusted!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Another update - they price gouged during the hurricane FYI. This is an awful place to stay, done give a dime to them. GREEDY  [END]
[BEGIN] So the bar staff was cool and the band played some great songs. Problem is, the overanxious bouncer crew messed up our entire evening. They were unnecessarily rude and obnoxious, and we will never go back there. Avoid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't like this place. I went a couple of times, pedi was ok, but the ladies seem arrogant and I can tell they are talking smack. Just made it uncomfortable. Rather give my money to someone who appreciates it  [END]
[BEGIN] The older blonde lady with short hair is so rude! I made a mistake in ordering and when I went to get the right one within 30 seconds of it she gave me such attitude and was extremely mean about it. I'm just human mistakes happen. I won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] NOT A REAL INDIAN PLACE. Food is very much fusion. If you want to try real Indian food go to Swad for South Indian vegetarian food or Taj Palace or any other places in Austin where they have North Indian Food. Over priced for the quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ridiculous wine prices. They sell you on a glass of wine without disclosing the price, which is outrageous to begin with. Avoid  [END]
[BEGIN] If I could give a 0 I would!! I've eaten here before. NEVER ever again!! The chicken taste like water!! Called in to let management know. The lady was so rude!! Get online, and see similar reviews! Horrible customer service and poor food quality/taste!!!! Save your money  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a hot dog. the worst part was the sausage was from oscar mayer and they didn't make it. I think i can have a better hot dog at home from a better sausage than oscar mayer.  [END]
[BEGIN] 1. The sushi was warm and sketchy looking. After my 2nd piece, I had to go to the bathroom because I thought I may throw up. 2. They gave me IMITATION crab as one of my sushi pieces...wtf. 3. See #1 End of story.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charging a $20 cover to watch a rugby match on TV is criminal. If you want to be extortionists, at least put it on your website ahead of time so people don't bother taking the train into the city first.  [END]
[BEGIN] There's nothing like driving halfway across town only to find the doors are locked. Please update your hours.  [END]
[BEGIN] Run by a bunch of bigots. Go to pollo tropical ... Or hell go to KFC. Anybody that sells white meat will have better food to digest than what this joint serves up with their discriminatory marinade.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only place graduation weekend that had a reso for 6 at 6:30. Now I know why. Decent food, but there is definitely better. Fiery owner who apparently not only doesn't know how to speak to guests, but also has never heard "The Customer is always right."  [END]
[BEGIN] I just ordered online on Yelp and they called and cancelled my order. They refused to deliver because I am "way out of their area"! am exactly 1.8 miles away!. So irritating!  [END]
[BEGIN] Drivers leave you behind and when you try to reschedule they wanted me to wait an additional hour so I would be cutting it close to missing my flight. Paid for a cab to ensure a peace of mind. Drivers also heavily hint and pressure you for a tip.  [END]
[BEGIN] You call this a deli? no pickles extra charge for onions, 95% bread, processed turkey meat that feels papery, low low low quality, high prices, run  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizza and 3 salads took TWO hours to arrive and when it did, of course it was cold!!! When I called, didn't even get a simple apology!! My company and I will NEVER order from here again!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible... I've been to many buffets in my lifetime and this was the worst. Couldn't even finish a whole plate. Egg drop soup was a gross pale color. The food was cold except the sushi it was nice and warm (grosssss)!!! Would not recommend to anyone !!! Waste of 25$....  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for the first time last night and a fight broke out and my friend who happened to be nearby was stabbed in his leg - scary to think that people in a drinking environment are carrying around knives and pulling them out. Won't be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] First timer - ordered one thing, received inedible other pieces. Paid too much for nothing. Glad we only lost $4.00 instead of what we usually buy - the Colonel's bucket!! Rude manager!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is average at its best. Ordered three dishes the fresh summer rolls have nothing but cabbage in it and the flat rich noodles with veggies was pretty bland. The veggie pho in chicken broth was decent. Order delivery was quick.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love French toast, and so it doesn't take much to satisfy me. I actually had to send mine back because it was soooo dry. Then they brought it back soggy and disgusting. What the heck is all the hype about with this place? #portlandsheeple  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible! Play LOUD music at pool area till 11pm. Toilet did not flush. Dirty rooms. Horrible customer service! Would not return even if stay was free....  [END]
[BEGIN] Gave it a try... twice. Shame on me. Not very good BBQ. Unfortunate as I live across the street. Will not be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Walked in the back and it smelled SO BAD they never cleaned they're bathroom or have a sewage problem but it was so gross I left. Can tell you about the kinda place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not call that number. It's fake. It leads to a motor club ad that wants you to sign up with them and never goes to BCBS  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is dirty. One of the booths smelled like vomit. The bathroom has never been remodeled since it opened. Nasty dirty. Complained to corporate no response. .. I guess they don't care. Friend got SICK. I THINK BAD MEAT!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Literally the worst Raman I've ever had in my life. Raw chicken and pork. Over priced appetizer. The pork in the Raman was all fatty and inedible. I was hoping to find a good new Raman place and this one just isn't it.  [END]
[BEGIN] They were out of several of their most popular bagels at 10am. They obviously don't know how to forecast sales because the man ringing said "yea those are our most popular bagels." so if you know that, make more initially. So you don't run out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible, horrible service. Probably one of the worst Chinese restaurants in Vancouver. They do have nice congee but why bother coming all the way here and paying for the bad service that will upset you for the rest of your day?  [END]
[BEGIN] When I called them the first time to check about the menu, the man who answered my phonecall replied that "you can go to my online menu" and then hang it up rudely. This kind of service does not even deserve one star.  [END]
[BEGIN] Steer clear. They lie and don't care. Consider yourself warned. Have had two shady dealings with this store. First time shame on them. Second time shame on us. We should have known better. They are not even a real Verizon store and it shows.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor shuttle service; expect to spend at least 50 minutes waiting. Don't book through DTS.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the absolutely worst Starbucks I have ever been too. The drive thru people have no people skills and the makers clearly was not taught how to make drinks properly. Go somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] This visit confirmed that qdoba is better every day of the week. Also, not kid friendly, no changing station, ridiculous rules for getting a "side", can't move the tables to accommodate groups, and finally 10 bucks for the smallest of portions.  [END]
[BEGIN] I observed an ugly incident early one night and the manager handled it about as poorly as it could be handled - he showed a sad combination of ignorance, a hot temper and complete lack of respect for anyone. Avoid!  [END]
[BEGIN] Can I give it zero stars? Living here was one of the worst experiences off my life. Beware, it is very unsafe. If you have any questions feel free to pm me  [END]
[BEGIN] Zero service, Zero cleanliness. 1 hour to get food after you order. 30 minutes to get a table. So avoid!  [END]
[BEGIN] My first attempt to go there - epic failure. They weren't open even though they were supposed to be. There's a Dozen Disappointed lost customers this morning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Most disgusting place I've been to. And staff doesn't know anything about the product they are clueless  [END]
[BEGIN] No matter what we try the food is terrible. Miss Geo's Too bad Riverwalk took this spot two. Now there are 2 of these terrible restaurants!  [END]
[BEGIN] The 500 block rooms..smell like mold...sheets are old some of the hallways smell like urine  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything in this place is overpriced! They will charge you to print a label-even if you have a QR on your iPhone- or close a box with a piece of tape! I couldn't believe it. Never again/  [END]
[BEGIN] We want to see Ivanka Trump's line. Why deprive customers of what they love.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the employees inside claimed that I gave him a fake 1 dollar bill , who even makes fake 1 dollar bills ??  [END]
[BEGIN] Southwest needs to hire more people that have charisma and love customer service. Delays are expected especially during holidays. But there isn't an excuse for horrible service from desk agents and ticket takers. (SWA orlando intl airport)!  [END]
[BEGIN] horrifying sushi. how can this kind of place be in business? the sushi rolls looked like a 4 year made them. rice was undercooked.. don't go.  [END]
[BEGIN] Order through UberEATS. They sent the wrong order and called to say they were redelivering it. 2 1/2 hours later I was still waiting. Despite the manager insisting they were coming, they have not.  [END]
[BEGIN] 01/13/2018 came in at 6am the male cashier was extremely rude and rolled his eyes at my very simple order. I don't even want to drink my coffee now. You're supposed to come here to start your day, not cool.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is atrocious for the price!! What a pity that both dosa factorries in newbury street and cambridge sucks!!! Rude staff.. and they wont even follow up on online orders!!! outrageous to say the least!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been to multiple red robins and this one by far had the worse Service. all the waiters/ waitresses just hovered by the bar and talked while ignoring the customers. And to top it of my food was cold!!!!!!! Stop talkin and do your job!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I would give this store zero stars if it were possible. The worst customer service I have experienced. My girlfriend and I were treated as if we were dirt on the bottom of the staff's shoes. These sales assistants need to be taught some basic manners.  [END]
[BEGIN] Expensive! For a restaurant that has view of gas station... Not much flavor and not your typical turkish place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service, pricing and food terrible! Double ordered a side, paid double for food (spring rolls) but couldn't get second sauce or fortune cookie. Contacted corporate - also useless. Go someplace else or go hungry would be better choices.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible. Sit for an hour, then when your shuttle does come ride around for 2 hours to get to hotel ten minutes away. Straight junk, avoid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst service I've ever received. Bartender was outside for 20 minutes smoking and then when returned said it was time to close. If you had customers, wouldn't you serve them and at least have the curtesy to say something?  [END]
[BEGIN] this place was not good at all. i had a tamal that was so dry i could not eat it. i ordered chips and salsa and i am pretty sure it was Pace salsa from the jar. very disappointed i had high hopes.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have to give them a star? Worst service I've ever had. The evening manager was rude and ghetto. I work near here and vowed never to go back. I go to the Groveport location down the road and have no problems.  [END]
[BEGIN] HOW does a cockroach fall onto my plate??????? Your food is too good to be a victim of a health violation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay away from these crooks. Spend the extra $10 and get your iPad fixed at a legitimate place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went to the pizza patron 3 today on Ross av for lunch, an when I picked up the slices was just limp it wasn't tasty it was a mess ,I was on lunch I didn't have time to take it back I was so disappointed Ms.Lewis in Dallas  [END]
[BEGIN] Bumper magnets showed up extremely grainy and difficult to read. We reached out to customer service and they responded asking for photos of the dissatisfactory product. It's been over a week and we still haven't heard back. Would love to hear back from this company and get this fixed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizza is always cold and delivery takes to long. People could be a bit more friendly but Im never eating that trash again so it does not matter to me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thick fatty slices of overcooked roast beef....and overpriced. What happened to the legendary Kelly's? Go to Harrisons.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Service! But where's the fish?! Our rolls lacked fish. At least they didn't skip on the avocado, but I didn't come for California Rolls, won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a fan, sorry. The Mexican cafe with Tienda across the street and east a few blocks, is a much better nosh for the price, and always tables open, including a couple outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the girls on my softball team was turned away from the bathroom. Apparently the gallon of water, the squirt of soap and the square of TP was deemed too expensive in support of youth sports. I'll be taking my business elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] worst foodhorrible tasting and really bad cheap quailty tih spalce should be closed  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced junk and one of the rudest managers I've ever encountered. Don't waste your time or money!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had takeout last night, chicken fingers weren't cooked and gross. Crab Rangoon's tasted like they were made last week. Why can't you get good Chinese food in South Boston!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible unless you want to order something and eat in pitch darkness, try and then give up, and only hear butt jokes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible layout in the bar area with no space. Sat at a table in the bar for 15 minutes without being acknowledged before leaving to go somewhere that could take time out of their busy schedule to serve us  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh Service is just awful, server spilled our drinks on the table not even sorry gyoza is cold on the inside Ramen broth is cold Never coming back  [END]
[BEGIN] Honestly saying this place moves at a glacial pace is an understatement. Terrible service and generally slowww even when using the kiosks. Not to mention the numbers duplicate so you could be number 75 and so could someone else waiting on their food. What the hell. Just terrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] What the beck happened? This use to be the go-to spot for killer Chinese. My experience this weekend was beyond disgusting. Every dish was loaded with so much grease. There was oil every where. I suspect they changed the cook. I would avoid all cost until the reviews improved  [END]
[BEGIN] Please don't go here. I got eyelash extensions from here and my own lashes got ripped out because of it. My lashes will never be the same. When I would get my nails done they would constantly try to upsell me and then I would leave with streaky nails.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is amazing - hostess has to be one of the rudest people I have ever encountered- service at tables is minimal at best.  [END]
[BEGIN] Warning: do not use this company. They cancelled out on us (over 150 tents) one week before the event with no excuse. They are disorganized, unprofessional and horrible to work with.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food always great! Service sucks.... After waiting 15 min to have a server come to table, it was another 20 before we got drinks..... When confronted was given such attitude..... Not customer service focused.... I was told I was being rude for questioning if there was new management.  [END]
[BEGIN] 10 minutes before the store closed I tried to try on clothes and the attendant was so rude and barked at me that there closed which the store was not! They just lost out on a sale!!! Oh well I'll just go to another Pink store where I'm treated better.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have my own insurance but This Place charge me extra insurance and didn't tell me when I picked up my car , don't come here again ! The agent will cheat on u , very bad  [END]
[BEGIN] Over priced and over rated, just like VooDoo. If you're trendy and have more dollars than sense, this is your kind of place.  [END]
[BEGIN] If I could leave a negative star I would, worst place a person could ever go! They are extremely irresponsible, they lost my blood test results and said they were not responsible for that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bummer. They're closed and I never got to try them. I got a notice from my Amazon yesterday that they had refunded the cost of my coupon for Hank's because it's now out of business. Eater Austin has stated that they closed at the end of December.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible service, girl behind counter doesn't know how to make any kind of sundae and way over priced 2 scoop sundae 5.50. Save your money and get ice cream from gas station for 2.79 and get twice as much. Smh, Baskin Robbers  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and got very disappointed :(. Didn't seem and didn't taste home made at all. Maybe the rest of the dishes are good but unfortunately not pizza!  [END]
[BEGIN] Over $16 for two sh*tty small plain cheese burgers & stale a$$ fries??? F*CK Smashburger! NEVER again! WAY overpriced for what you get! #AVOID  [END]
[BEGIN] This place sucks.....super attitude from server staff...but food or service can't back it up!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Are you kidding me ??? this drive-through looks like it's an abandoned old town ...you pull up there's no menu you get to the window and you're sitting there for 10 minutes to wait for a personal pan pizza ....now I have to go walk inside unbelievable  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm sure all of the dishes couldn't be bad. My friend's Vickie's chicken was good; it was the worst veal piccata I've ever had. I deleted my original review, lowering my rating from 2 stars to 1 star for use of fake reviews. http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2011/09/23/cornell-researchers-work-spot-fake-reviews Nuff said.  [END]
[BEGIN] the worst food i've ever eaten. how do they stay in business???? probably because they are in west roxbury, and people here don't know good restaurants........ greasy food that all looks/tastes the same. the egg rolls are filled with soft mush, horrible!!!! don't waste your time/money.......  [END]
[BEGIN] If u want to try falooda don't even Waste your money here ...total waste of money on falooda I would rather buy a gallon of milk and put some rooh afza  [END]
[BEGIN] WORST SERVICE EVER!!! The Manager seems like she doesn't know what she was doing, bunch of employees who's still in training, the lady at the front register wasn't approachable, like I swear WAITING FOR 30 minutes for 2 sandwich!!! NOT COMING BACK AT THIS STORE!  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible business, prices are not always visible if you ask 2 differents persons in the store, you'll get different prices. I 'm in favor to support local businesses but not when they care very little about their customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Breakfast was so bad my family and I had to go to Dunkin Donuts, wouldn't recommend this hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] Chicken/shrimp Fajitas were a dissapointment (I kid you not they served 3 pieces of grilled chicken and 4 tiny shrimp...) slow service, overpriced. Go to Chili's across the street if in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] worst service ever. Inattentive bored staff hang out together instead of serving customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Caliga often ties up dogs while gardening and yells at them like misbehaved children. She does not appear to rigorously exercise the dogs and generally has several dogs in tow.  [END]
[BEGIN] I agree with Tom's review. We all wish Luigi's would come back, but it's not. My hubs and I were hoping this was at least comparable; it's not. It's awful. Don't go here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst customer service ever at the airport! Promised 30 minutes or less, but sent us to the wrong place and didn't tell us we had to sign in. 66 minutes later and I'm finally on a shuttle--right after I complained. What a coincidence!  [END]
[BEGIN] im from sourthern california. this is NOT boba (the tapioca)!!! its waaaay overcooked, and the tea tastes...bland/lack of taste/whatever :/ no bueno! :( i dont get why it has such high rating...  [END]
[BEGIN] This place sucks. It's gross cheap fast food that is over priced for sure! Idk why but as a kid I remember this place being better than it is now. The quality isn't there anymore and we won't be back here ever.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am not going to comment on the food as there are a bunch of cheats. Bill was $251.xx, I added tip to make it $290. They charged me $306 themselves making the tip more than 20%. Had to call up the bank to dispute the additional $16.  [END]
[BEGIN] service was very slow we waited 20 minutes for two beers ended up paying and leaving after one drink then went to Ricks Cafe Walked in and it was busy still got a drink right away. love this place it is going to be our new hang out  [END]
[BEGIN] Bar tender had an attitude from hell. Sheesh I guess it ruined her day that I asked about drink specials and too see a menu smh..... definitely not returning sheesh feel the unwelcome smh byeeee  [END]
[BEGIN] I called to move forward with purchasing my leased vehicle. I have since then left a voicemail with a finance employee and have yet to receive a return phone call.  [END]
[BEGIN] For $7 to get in the door including adults than more money to ride some of the few things they have skip it and go to Leeds farm.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful service.. slow!.. couldn't get refills like asked.. feel we were ignored! Won't go back to this location.. Garlic butter fries were dry  [END]
[BEGIN] AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!! They call you once every 2 weeks trying to get you to come in for some service. Their billing department is atrocious. They send you bills months later with absolutely no explanation on them. Avoid this place like the plague.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just went to get my acrylic nails off. She used a fake nail to pry (rip) them off. When she slipped and cut my finger I walked out. I will be going to Bling nails from now on.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not a Barnes & Noble!! Tiny!! It is a GA Tech bookstore w/ a very small B&N attached. Terrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst service ever.... Last minute cancellation multiple times!! And now they are trying to charge me $150 for cancelling a service they aren't providing.  [END]
[BEGIN] The last time I ordered the pad thai I felt gross afterword. I think I am done with this place. I would rather eat the stale crackers in my pantry.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had multiple bad experiences with this vet. They truly don't care about what is best for you or your pet  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst service ever. the restaurant owners will yell at their customers. their food is incredibly mediocre. used to come here out of convinencw, but after getting yelled at by The owner will never come back  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst experience Food came in late and was cold when it came. Least responsive staff. Ordered sauce for fries and waiter disappeared. Not coming to this location here  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably the worst meatball sub I ever had. Meatballs seemed like they were previously frozen, very dense, very spicy, and inedible. Had to throw away. Haven't had their pizza in several months, but recall thinking it was average at best.  [END]
[BEGIN] Saturday before noon counters were clean and only one flavor donut left. The maple bacon. Grabbed from the tray under the counter. Nothing special and over priced. A swarm of people walked in after me and walked right back out or bought coffee. Disappointment  [END]
[BEGIN] Order was filed up, no silverware or napkins into our room,this was supposed to be room service. They then made promises to make up for the lousy service, which they did not keep. Never again. Decent food, lousy service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Customer service so bad. New staff very impolite very rude. The young lady and manager they didn't help anything.  [END]
[BEGIN] This location is going downhill fast. Arrived about 6:30 tonight. We were the only customers inside. Lots of servers milling about, but none came to our table even after we sat there nearly 10 minutes. Finally walked out and ate elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst Chinese food I've ever had. Never coming here again. The waitress is nice but the food isn't worth the cost and the food tastes stale.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped in for a fruit smoothie. It ended up being a quarter of a very rotten banana and 3 small strawberries. Mix in a ton of ice and syrup and there you go. Nasty. Wouldn't recommend this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really wish I could actually give a negative star rating for this particular location, we had our holiday party here and the service and staff was mediocre AT BEST! NOT for large gatherings !  [END]
[BEGIN] Super frustrated with this store. Been trying to call them for two days and no one picks up the phone. Tried operator extension and different departments and no luck. I guess they don't want my business or anyone else's.???  [END]
[BEGIN] Disgusting service, horrible food, not Vegetarian friendly at all. They have no clue of the ingredients they are using, whether a dish has fish sauce or not etc. The owner is very rude and unaccommodating. Do not visit this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was great! The food is straight trash water, the turkey patty tasted undercooked and was chewy. Sautéed mushrooms looked straight out of a can garlic french fries were pathetic and greasy no good never coming back  [END]
[BEGIN] Bland food, not coming back. Taste like what I ate in college in my dorm room. Head to San Francisco or Jean & Lee Kitchen in Newton.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor overall, Use to be good. Think I will go to the places up the street. Much better quality and service. Can only blame management, cooks and bartenders.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only thing I recommend would be the shrimp. The crabcakes were small and slimey. Not a lot of flavor. My girlfriend got fried oysters and she loves them, but she couldn't even eat 2. We were decieved by the yelp rating. Not a classy place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have had their weekdays buffet earlier and it was good. However had a disappointing experience over weekend.. got a boneless chicken biryani and it was definitely stale and not freshly made. the chicken was tasteless and too hard to chew instead of being tender and juicy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Showed up at 8:55 PM on a Friday. When I tried to open the door it was locked. The two employees looked up to see me but then quickly put their heads back down as if they didn't see me standing there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a godawful experience here where the sushi was warm, the waiter was an ass, and service sucked for no discernible reason- barely anyone in there. It was bad enough to warrant updating my initial review. That's pretty damn bad. Will not be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are ever looking for a fine establishment where you can find a 10-pack of generic trash bags for over $6, this is where it's at.  [END]
[BEGIN] Why is the shrimp from Thailand? And not local...... :( That should change for such a nice restaurants  [END]
[BEGIN] Waited over two hours and never got pizza. Tried calling back and call would not go thru for over 30 minutes. Get pizza elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lady serving the food at chipotle had a bad atti and made me repeat the Oder several times then she backs annoyed with me very unpleasant meal I asked for double meat it was a tiny bowl n I was hungry  [END]
[BEGIN] Almost walked out because we waited so long to receive our food. Friendly servers. Plastic cups. Asked twice for side of olives. Prices a bit too high. Decent menu. Not fresh cut lamb. Small portions. Not good for kids. They have the potential to get better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst customer service, avoid at all costs. Careless and rude staff. Never coming back!  [END]
[BEGIN] I was promised delivery today. For reasons they can't explain. It's being delayed even though it's in stock. Poor customer service. Won't buy from them again  [END]
[BEGIN] One more place that doesn't brew decaf. They also can't do a pour-over. I know some will say, "Have an Americano or a Latte", but I don't like my coffee watered down.  [END]
[BEGIN] Century Link provides the worst service in town...Plus their customer service is completely unfriendly and useless...  [END]
[BEGIN] i bought a car here in april 2013 its been giving me problems since!!!! i will not reccomend this place to anybody! spend your hard earning money eleswhere. worst car dealership in malden. never again!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Really gross! Meat I am not sure which part of cow was it but full of fat! Will never try again any Vietnamese in Vancouver again!!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like INSANELY loud music, waiting an hour to be seated, waiting another hour to get your sub-par bar food, and dealing with rude servers, than THIS IS JUST THE PLACE FOR YOU! Y'all. DON'T GO.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible sandwich. The bread was super stale, probably baked in the early 90's. The tofu must have been prepared weeks prior. Avoid this place at all cost.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't understand the hype for this place. I ordered a latte, and it was lukewarm at best. I couldn't taste the espresso- it tasted like overpriced lukewarm milk. I ended up tossing it and going somewhere else :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Sitting at the table as I writing this. It is Disney not known for there food but I'm just disgusted that they would charge the prices they do an not make an attempt to serve better food. It was frozen no taste garbage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not use this service even if you buy a groupon deal. They no showed and never called me back to reschedule or follow up about why. Terrible way to do business.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was inedible! Tasted expired and everything was either undercooked and mushy or over cooked. They really don't seem to care about guests because they refused to do anything to make it right. I spent $50 on a pile of crap. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] 4 people in the store staring at computers. Won't go back. Less attitude please and more customer service. Immediately got problem solved at Lamps Plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here and I was really excited. The food was really tasty and my entire table was pleased with it. But we all ended up in the bathroom for the rest of the night. Thanks for the food poisoning. We won't be coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Customer service was horrrrrible. One girl got really nasty with us. It was boring not a lot to do. We ate there as well and they gave us a server that wasn't even there yet. It was awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dosa was dry and brittle. Chai was just warm, not hot. Couldn't order Punjabi coffee because I guess they are short-handed during lunch buffet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible service..I didn't even get my nails done after waiting 45 min and them taking three walkins before me that came after me. .never again will I ever go back !  [END]
[BEGIN] The portion sizes are very small. The duck was burned, the lobster ravioli was mushy. The waiter was a jerk. The restaurant has the potential, it just needs a visit from Ramsey.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was not seated for 30 minutes when we had reservations. Food is underwhelming and overpriced. The female manager was not helpful and downright rude. Clearly not up to the standard of prato and luma. Don't waste your money here folks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Your app totally sucks, card information is compromised, and there is no sense of urgency what so ever! Take uber as a last resort!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very slow service. Doesn't make much sense to order on Yelp for pickup and arrive, only to find that after 10 mins of waiting upon arrival, they just submitted the order. Poor customer experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Actually 0 stars. I had the worst experience. Dirty community bugs,worms everywhere. Rude management team, maintenance, and neighbors. Dark apartment a lot extra fees that supposedly were included and don't even look the trash shut. Never rent those apartments. You pay twice the agreement.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude Owner kicked us out a minute after closing telling us we do not pay his electricity so get out and fold at home. He was also yelling at the employee Extremely rude!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had an appointment and they didn't even show up. When I called and left a message, they didn't even bother calling back. If this is what kind of business they run, i'm glad I didn't hire them. Totally unprofessional.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow. I haven't had such awful customer service in a hotel ever. Cancelled my reservation after a flight delay and will not reinstate my stay. Stranding me in Orlando on a business trip? What type of establishment would do that? Not on I'd ever use again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor floor plan leads to accidents, super slippery tile floor leads to accidents on rainy days, very basic customer service, loud, and the food's not that great at all, especially considering its price. Steer clear.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not go here for wedding makeup and hair you will get bumped to a different time and artist/stylist at any moment. It's about them $$ not you.  [END]
[BEGIN] How do you only cook one side of the steak and then serve it with the raw side down? No kidding I thought I was on candid camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] At this location I received a haircut from Talia, the haircut was so bad; I have decided to cut my own hair. Guys' check out on youtube, cutting your own hair. With a tip I use to give, I save over two hundred dollars a year.  [END]
[BEGIN] It took 20 minutes to get the attention of a server. Then we had to send back our drink order. Once we got our pizza it had hair in it. Zero stars! There is one star, otherwise I couldn't post this.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are coming for an oil check, plan to be here for the entire day. Pretty bad customer service and really long wait times  [END]
[BEGIN] The chopped salad isn't chopped! And it was all lettuce. Place is pretentious for a tiny pizza too. Need to bring up their game! We had the lamb sausage pie. Otherwise tolerable. But I can't get over the salad.  [END]
[BEGIN] 服务态度很差，早茶也就那样吧。Just so so，food is not very good as a Chinese. The service is very bad. Won't come again  [END]
[BEGIN] Do NOT waste your time with this facade of a company and don't read any positive reviews. Move on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor and rude service. This is not a place to spend your good money only to have poor service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very, very poorly run and equally disappointing produce. There were numerous problems with getting my delivery and when I would get it, I'd have to throw out part of it because it was rotten and moldy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food cost $53 to feed our family of 7. Employee made very rude comments to my Mother with head manager right there. Salad was nasty and food cold. Used to love Wendy's but this one is awful. Won't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't care what your beer selection is, if you only have one toilet in the place I won't spend my happy hour here, cause when a girls gotta go a girls gotta go. PERIOD!  [END]
[BEGIN] I was shocked at how terrible their customer service was. The woman I talked to was very condescending and even told me to go somewhere else when I was just hoping to have a vehicle inspection before driving across country. I am definitely taking my business somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place sucks. I had to go all the way home because they decided that shorts wernt "appropriate" for the club. Duck 5hat. I just wanted to wear shorts because its to hot to wear pants. Wtf  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst ever. I appreciate local stories, urban legends, a little tasting.. I am not looking for professionals like Guy Fieri with lots of food of 3D quality. Just help me like you. But NO. They are a complete waste of time, money and worst ever, mood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Incredibly horrible and disrespectful service from the floor manager and one of the female servers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow what happened to the seats? They are extremely uncomfortable and definitely not worth coming back!  [END]
[BEGIN] NO go some where else any where else there is a jack in the box not to far. unless you want your diet to be lard fat and corn  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible place. Would never go back there. They told us in line it was $20 and then after waiting in line for over 30 mins and then change the price to $25 once we get to the front. They were extremely rude, terrible customer service. I will not be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst pizza I've ever had. The dough was thin and undercooked and there was alot of cheese and it was so greasy  [END]
[BEGIN] The chicken biryani was OK but the chicken tikka masala was horrible i won't come back again  [END]
[BEGIN] They don't put prices on their beers. That's just sleazy. And their selection is mediocre. Service is lazy and indifferent. These slugs will absolutely never get my business. What a bunch of louses.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible service! They sent us a free pizza coupon but then refused to honor it. On top of that was met by extreme unprofessionalism by a woman working on the phones. Will never use this establishment after the the way I was spoken to on the phone,  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm happy to announce that they paid for the towing of my daughter's car and gave her a $50 gift card for her troubles.  [END]
[BEGIN] They're upping the rake again. $7 max plus 2$. So bad for the poker community. The management doesn't give a shit about the players. It's pretty obvious, they're trying to kill poker.  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely rude staff at the shipping and mailing department. After too many sour interactions, I'm not going back there anymore. I will say the older man who works there is very kind, but will drive farther for consistently better service!  [END]
[BEGIN] It took them 2 hours to deliver my food was cold and nasty I had to begged them to come up to my apartment door Never again  [END]
[BEGIN] ghetto!! DIRTY!!!! The water is disgusting. Avoid this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst service I've ever experienced.They looked like I was bothering them or was asking for free food. The food was served cold  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely rude, and appalling low in professionalism, run business like a mafia  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't do it. Don't. Do it. Two hours after ordering my pizza I call and I'm told, yeah we can't do that now. And then I'm hung up on. No lie. Don't even look at this place when you're thinking about ordering pizza. They don't deserve your consideration.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went to this place last night for my birthday it was so crowded could barely move wanted to play pool but that place was so packed was not even going to wait so we left what a waste of time  [END]
[BEGIN] We have given them a lot of business, but will no longer. They damaged my husband's military uniform and were accusatory and non-apologetic in response. Terrible customer service - not the way to run a business!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just called to get a price quote and talk about unfriendly. I'm sorry am I bothering you by asking questions? I told her no thank you I could tell by her unfriendly and put out attitude that I wanted nothing to do with them.  [END]
[BEGIN] 我今天带着一家人去吃饭，也是第一次去那边，因为是武汉人，别人推荐那边有不错的热干面和各种卤味，到了那边开始准备点单，结果也先付钱还有小费，想着如果一家人来吃就没有计较了，点了一份热干面，一份玉米肉粒饭和一份辣鸭脖，结果上菜的时候让我惊到了，玉米饭就是一层玉米糊肉放上面，跟什么一样，我跟我老婆看了一眼简直不能看，我想着竟然点了别浪费，最后确实事吃了几口实在太恶心了吃不下了，热干面呢不说难吃吧，反正作为一个武汉人是我长这么大吃过最难吃的了，鸭脖还是不错的，最后我们也没有胃口准备走人了，结果告知要自己收拾桌子，麻蛋的，我自己收拾那看你们小费干嘛？顺便说一下，连水也是要了才干的，我去，这个店发誓以后再也不会光顾，也不会推荐朋友去，没有服务就不要收小费写出来好吗？不正宗就留着忽悠忽悠老外，不评论了，花了30几刀吃了一肚子气！  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible customer service!! Had a $1000 disappear due to a system glitch on their end! Still waiting for it to be resolved 5 days later! AVOID AT ALL COST!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered pick up for two nights ago and got sashimi dinner and it was awful. Of the 20 pieces, only 3 were remotely edible and it was unbearably fishy smelling. Anyone who eats sushi knows that it should NOT smell fishy I had to throw it away.  [END]
[BEGIN] I honestly had really high expectation goin here because all my friends seems to love it. I was very disappointed, our Thai spicy noodle soup was very water down, I'm just used to a lot of marination to my food so this wasn't the place for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Uncle Mickeys is so sub par. I live right down the street and the pizza was cold and my greek salad had no feta cheese and they gave me a tabelespoon on dressing and yellow iceberg lettuce  [END]
[BEGIN] Avoid, rude waitresses... could not be bothered to show me the menu, told me it was out of her way. Get some new staff Pelons.  [END]
[BEGIN] The security guards are absolutely brutal. Rude, and out to get people. Facility is good not great. Very small.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food isn't that great. Seems like it was reheated. Definitely overpriced for what you get. I tried the ravioli and was disappointed  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst experience at an einstein's. Always out of Cinnamon Sugar bagels and are very rude when asked to make more. (Manager explained once that it is easy to make them if they are out) Terrible customer service, dissapointing to see it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Crappiest service ever. The lady on the phone was super disrespectful. They don't value customer service at all. They completely disregarded people's time. Overall, they should be shut down. Nobody should have to deal with this.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chinese restaurants are known for not being too clean, but this one is the king of them all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Given this place 3 chances and each time it gets worse. Service is horrendous because they are always understaffed during busy times, food is mediocre or will make you sick, and unless you are standing at the bar good luck getting a beer in less than 10 minutes  [END]
[BEGIN] It says it's open until 9pm today, but it was closed when we arrived at 5:50pm. Disappointed  [END]
[BEGIN] If there is a fast food bakery, this is it! Unappetizing bakes goods. No tea. Plastic boxes and foam cups. If you are in the area just drive up 15 minutes to Alon's bakery to better pastries, cakes, and breads as well as much more pleasant atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is terrible my nails where shaped so ugly too when I said I wanted stiletto nails and way to expensive never again!!! I'm sorry Kim but you lost a customer.  [END]
[BEGIN] I recently learned that route 87 service to Arlington Center ends at 7:40 PM on weeknights and Saturdays, and that there's no service to Arlington at all on Sundays. I think that merits a two-star deduction. Not cool, MBTA, not cool!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is clean and nice enough. There is nothing free included - parking, breakfast, etc. There is a small bar down the street about a block that played loud music until late in the night. I would not recommend this place on the weekend.  [END]
[BEGIN] horrible worst customer service. they deliveryed a damaged chair that cost over 8000 dollars. its the third day and they refuse to fix this problem.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here recently and had mild wings and fries. The wings were so soggy they taste boiled and they also had no flavor. The fries were not crispy. I would not recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] Never going there again. Ordered a dish with scallops and thought they tasted a bit off. Got food poisoning later that night from my food. I refuse to eat there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was the worst Taco Bell I have ever experienced! I do not expect Taco Bell to be great food, it is fast food. The shells were stale, chips are stale, the chalupa shell had not been fried and was cold. It was not editable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hostess was rude and made the process of seating customers extremely inconvenient. Their menu could also use some modifications  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely horrible! I waited 40 minutes for a frozen margarita which was melted by the time I received it. Then, I had to wait an additional 30 for my receipt. HORRIBLE SERVICE!  [END]
[BEGIN] I had really bad experiance today 3:30pm on 8/13/16. The server she has black hair &very bad attitude. She made it very unpleasant dinning experiance for me and my family.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time using mears. I bought a round trip ticket that was 36$. Once we stood outside to wait for the ride the employees were rude and also very disorganized. It took us about an hour and a half to get to our hotel. I wouldn't use this service again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Coffee and sandwich place. I had a turkey sandwich, which was pretty good. Went to over a Latte after lunch at 2:52pm (they close at 3pm) and they told me no, because they already cleaned the machine :/ one star for poor customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wanted to try this bakery because It was around the corner from my hotel. As soon as I walked in the smell was really bad I didn't want anything from this place...it sure didn't smell like a bakery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does anyone know where the old owners of Frosted Nails went? I went there after the new management took over and did not love the vibe and quality of work.  [END]
[BEGIN] update: the day after eating there I was vomiting all day. it had to be their food because it's all I had to eat that day. I feel horrible I think it was the collard greens as they had a funky taste.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is very average. They have very few options served for the buffet and not worth for 15$. Pani poori and bhatura are good. Interior decor is good except the Ganesha artwork near the Bar area. Definitely not a place for authentic Indian food !  [END]
[BEGIN] An absolute dump! And a shakedown to boot. After booking online they demand another 100 bucks from you at check in. The room is clean but the carpets are dirty.  [END]
[BEGIN] I won't be riding this again until I have kids who may enjoy it... Definitely not worth waiting for...  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks for responding as the new owner, but I don't have my fur babies anymore Wish you success Had to pick a star to post Nothing to do with business  [END]
[BEGIN] The service and food are both unacceptable. I have been there 3 times, none of them is satisfying. Last time, I ordered yam fries. The fries seems from yesterday, and they also served my BBQ burger with cold beef inside it, which made me so upset.  [END]
[BEGIN] i was is love with chick fil a but the company is tricking with the menu size. Next time open your sandwich and see that the piece of chicken is 3/4 less than a year. Drink size is smaller and the portions. Is business only. Pay more for less.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was very disappointed with everything here tonight. My party of 3 all received the wrong order. I was served the most slim turkey burger that Boston restaurants have ever seen. Service was very slow, unattentitive, and lacked luster. No positives at all with my experience whatsoever.  [END]
[BEGIN] I pass this location all the time and decided to give it a try this time, and the food wasn't the same quality expected from Krystal's.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delivery took two hours and the food was terrible. Worst pizza I've ever had my life. Would not recommend or order from here again  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there to have dinner. It was hot as hell in there. The bartender said"A/C is broke it is a problem all the time". My wife and I left without trying their pizza Pretty sad that ownership knows of the problem and does nothing.  [END]
[BEGIN] It took over half an hour to get the food. Twenty minutes in a line of 5 people. They got my order wrong and forgot barbecue sauce on the burger. Huge disappointment going half an hour out of my way to get here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just don't go people. Horrible wait time, horrible service and horrible drinks ever-time we've come here. Don't go  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was rude, came on family night and they wouldn't take my coupon and coupon didn't say can't be used. Food was bland and not ready when we arrived. Ugh won't be coming back  [END]
[BEGIN] Still very slow. One cashier on the weekends as the other workers are doing something else of a lower priority.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm 9 months pregnant and all I wanted today was a meatball. I ordered takeout and was so excited to come home. When I opened the bag I was so upset that I only got spaghetti. No meatballs even though that's why I paid extra!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food violation tickets issued by the health department. Need I say more? Just take a look at Fraser Health's website for Violation Ticket Offences Issued Against Food Facilities.  [END]
[BEGIN] Serious Customer Service issues at this location. Never had such a blatantly rude server in my life. If you are an airline employee staying at the attached Comfort Inn and Suites, don't bother with this place, they'll treat you like vermin.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible customer service. Been trying for 30 minutes now to make an apt for a stereo installation. Trying option 3 for Sales Associate and option 4 for Geek Squad. No one answers either line. I literally started calling at 12:00 and it is now 12:25 and still no answer.  [END]
[BEGIN] I called and left a message on a machine that said they'd call back in 15 minutes. 20 hours later and still no call. I'm moving on but company with a 5-star rating does not ignore phone calls. Who is writing these reviews?  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a donut and that's it. Lemmings line up to wait for no real reason.  [END]
[BEGIN] Insofar as this is a terrible bar, I furthermore assert that my friend shan't not have been exiled from their premises.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would recommend either delivery or take out for this restaurant. My sister and I tried to go here twice both times the air-conditioning is not working on severely hot days in the month of July I would suggest that the restaurant get their air conditioning fixed !!  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow. It's like Hotel California. You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave...because you'll never actually make it through the checkout.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst chipotle ever! Dirty, bad balance of ingredients, and bad flavor. How is this possible??? Also, this one doesn't sell beer. I shouldnt have eaten the burrito......  [END]
[BEGIN] Ticketed for parking in a restricted area although there were no signs ($55). Five other cars near me suffered the same fate. Total scam by the city.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered rotisserie chicken, more like a damn pigeon, server was slow to take care of us, but quick to grab the check, never again  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered Dukboki with cheese but there wasn't a shred in mine Not the same without cheese  [END]
[BEGIN] We live in Lexington and bought a solar system through Astrum Solar last summer. We've been waiting since then for Nstar/Eversource to connect us to the grid. What a disappointing waste of time. One more reminder of the horrible service within monopolies. I'm about ready to call the AG.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought one drink here. They took the liberty of tipping over 100% on my card. I had to call my bank and get the charges reversed. Scam!!! Terrible place. Watch your credit card statements.  [END]
[BEGIN] I cant recomend this place its anti gun I value my safety Other places are gun friendly  [END]
[BEGIN] This was probably the worst mexican food I have ever eaten. Everything was incredibly mediocre and bland and the service was terrible. Never had such awful refried beans. Will not be coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just one employee to help 15 people jn the line. This is sad!! Tuesday, 9/6/2016. 4:30 pm  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible customer service. Nobody acknowledged me when I walked in. Slow service. I was going to get my nails done and I waited 20 minutes and nobody helped me. This is a really unprofessional salon. Avoid it at all cost.  [END]
[BEGIN] Careless and dangerous advice given. They solicit business in any way they can. (You'll notice other reviews suggest aggressive sales tactics too.) Store manager denounces modern medicine in favor of herbs. Beware.  [END]
[BEGIN] Boring, expensive, small portions. "Homemade" syrup tasted like rotten fruit. Service was mediocre and entitled. Your s*#! does stink employees of Sanborn's FYI...  [END]
[BEGIN] This target is the WORST! I've had to see customer service the past 3 times I've checked out because the items were scanned wrong. I've been over charged or had items doubled. Make sure you're checking your receipt if you go here!  [END]
[BEGIN] I agree with the person that complained about alterations. They completely ruined a pair of jeans I was having patched. They also run late and didn't have my dry cleaning there when they told me it would be ready. Disappointed...  [END]
[BEGIN] The service and welcome was very very bad. We went for lunch, rather than asking us to wait, the waiter said, it's gonna take 15 to 20 minutes.. He was not polite also. I won't recommend this place  [END]
[BEGIN] Waitress took a twenty dollar bill and never came back with the change. She assumed it was the tip on a $40 bill.  [END]
[BEGIN] Placed an order both stating "NO BROCCOLI". The meals were covered with broccoli and the flavor was awful. Both meals were thrown out. Garlic bread was burnt as well as the mozzarella sticks. Was a total waste of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible service. We ordered food and 1.5 hours later it still had not arrived. I called and the lady kindly offered me a refund. That was her definition of customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was gross and bland Orange juice wasn't orange juice that's was sunny delight Slow service!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] the chips and salsa were 10 times better than the food ... Bland , bland. Bland - don't order the ahi tacos - sucked big time - get Asian nachos from turners seafood in Salem to compare  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolute trash. I'm not sure who DJ's but he/she isn't good. Your job is to read the crowd not play trash all night.  [END]
[BEGIN] If your into fast food places with an Ethiopian menu, Desta is for you. I expected a more classy establishment, instead I found a tourist attraction more in the style of a Golden Corral.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far there's a whole lot of waiting going on and not a whole lot of transportation. Not exactly how I planned on starting my vacation, so hopefully when they actually let us onto a shuttle the ride itself will be spectacular.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really liked this place until I found out they lie about there glass and manufacturers and up sell cheap crap. Don't waste your money on liars looking for a buck.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sadly i used to be a regular. Dropped in one night for some chicken teriyaki waited ten mins then walked home. The chicken I got was not even cooked! I couldn't even bite it. Totally bummed, this place was once great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst customer service ever! Scammed us when I bought my wedding dress then got me again when I had to buy a dress for a friends wedding! Terrible business!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very racist staff. Will never go back. Staff was very rude and didn't serve to people of different races  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst service I have ever had. We were never assigned a waiter. It was fairly busy and every server/busboy completely ignored us. Food was ok. They comped us desserts because of the terrible service, then put the desserts on the bill. Definitely avoid this place!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been to several nail salons around the country , but I've never been to one where my fingernail bled for 10 minutes and turned black. The manicurist suggested I get a dark red to cover up the cut and bruising, and I was still charged for the manicure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just wonder how they even stay in business. Have tried to call several times, left messages, and have still never spoken to anyone with a couple of questions I had. If they don't even answer the phone, I don't think they could be a very legitimate business.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible. The General Gau's chicken was fried fat and skin. The crab rangoon was all cream cheese, no crab. And all of it was over priced. Cost us $70 to feed 4 people and none of it was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just want to let everyone know that I was completely correct in that no one from Lucky Strike had contacted me to apologize for our terrible experience. We will not be visiting them again and will ensure that we let anyone know who asks how terrible their service is.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have really slipped ... service was poor , food was blah ... what happened ???? Red robin was a fun place to go ....  [END]
[BEGIN] Deplorable... absolutely disgusting conditions. The restrooms in foreign countries are cleaner than this one on 185th in Hillsboro. And to think that the staff use these same facilities... than go back to serving food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not great customer service in their service department. They probably get away with it due to being the only Honda inside the perimeter. I'll be going to Carey Paul (AWESOME service) or Gwinnett Place Honda from now on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not stay here! Construction everywhere, they gave me a room that was already occupied, very embarrassing. 6am jack hammers and people outside working. Gym is not functional. Even if there was no construction the walls are paper thin, I can hear every move the people next to me make.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor service, attended a rock concert past Sunday. The clientele has totally changed. It seemed to go downhill where all the thugs hang out. Employees looked demoralized and most of them could not speak English. Tanks where the dolphins and orcas looked dilapidated. Don't think I will ever go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were seated in 10 minutes. Then no one took our order no one even asked us what we wanted to drink and they aren't even that busy. TERRIBLE SERVICE!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is probably the worst Mexican I've ever had. I came with 2 other people and they both said the same. The chicken was watery and had a weird texture to it and the overall taste of the food was not that great..  [END]
[BEGIN] Why are there so many damn flies? Can anyone see this? Nobody seems to care. It's disgusting. Drinks are fine but who knows how many flies have walked all over the food and drinks. I've even seen bees inside. Even sitting outside you have flies on you. Just horrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] They charge for water cup. Stale doughnut. Sassy attitude. I don't normally take my time to write reviews but this was exceptionally bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service and not so good food. I was really looking forward to this restaurant and all my excitement was shot down as soon as we walked in the restaurant and had our first interaction with the staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] This used to be a nice hookah lounge. However, I recently went and it was super GHETTO! The service was terrible also. I won't be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] RIPOFF! Paid over $10 for a bowl to go that was only 16oz and even though I paid for extra chicken it hardly had any. It was 90% spinach which costs next to nothing. NEVER AGAIN!  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible terrible terrible food and service!!! This is my most terrible restaurant experience in this area. I have no idea how they got four star on Yelp. This leads me to doubt the credit of Yelp.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff is not bad, the nurses are the worst they aren't very educated in pain management.  [END]
[BEGIN] When you are charging $16 for an entree and $3 for a naan...make sure to deliver a quality product. Crap entree with old pieces of chicken reheated...tikka masala tasted like some spices cooked in a lot of cream. Wouldn't recommend at all!  [END]
[BEGIN] you will get sock water instead of coffee here!!! worst coffee I have ever had.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst Hawaiian food ever! I ordered their Moco Loco. The rice wasn't fully cooked and my hamburger patty was tough. 30 minutes after eating it, I was rushing to the bathroom nauseas with cramps. It looks like other reviewers had issues with their beef, so watch out!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I got e-mail from them yesterday telling me that they are going entirely out of business on June 30. What is going to happen to their Wi-fi service?  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was ok for the price, but the pillows all smelled really bad and made it hard to sleep. I would not go back here, as the pillows really ruined the experience for me. O body wants to smell other peoples sweat  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a chicken bacon panini seriously There's 10 % of chicken on this meal 6 dollars for this  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got one of the worst haircuts I've ever had. The guy used scissors on a fade, I had to go home and use my shavers to fix it. I wouldnt recommend and won't be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice guy at the window. The food was cold largely do to a woman in front of me who had a "complicated order".... They should tell the to pull up. Not acceptable.  [END]
[BEGIN] OMG, took at least 5 min to take each order, couldn't find any items on register, didn't know what came on the burger....hope you don't have a flight to catch anytime soon!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Two years ago when I first tried Mel's it was surprisingly good, came back this year and it was awful, food was like a high school lunch, tasteless bland and expensive for the little food you get, staff was rude / uncaring, very disappointing  [END]
[BEGIN] Which idiot put the address of the RMV in the middle of government center? Isnt this RMV at the chinatown stop? Where is the RMV, at the chinatown stop or in the middle of government center?  [END]
[BEGIN] Barely any Skor pieces in their McFlurry! So Cheap!  [END]
[BEGIN] Absurd yuppie outfitter. Very expensive. Come on down and pick up a designer hand bag and a.....hatchet??!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just stopped by to get a thai tea n the lady said they dont have to go cup and unbelievably saying "we're not starbucks u cant sit n drink u have to eat" im like........... seriously lady?  [END]
[BEGIN] Just another side note.. I requested a refund for food I never received and of course my card was never refunded! This place is unbelievable! A call to the health department should be made!  [END]
[BEGIN] I asked for a trim and got a major chop plus thinning of my already thin hair. Hello 1994? It's the Rachel haircut and I could cry since it will take me another year to grow my hair out!! WHY DON"T SALONS LISTEN  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't come here if they aren't answering the phone - they close the kitchen prior to what is listed online and on their door. I got here at 9:30 pm and the door was locked even though there were people inside and the sign was listed as closing at 10.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got cussed out by a waitress for accidentally turning off a few lights on a power strip. Seriously? Walked out and she was still cussing me out? Will never be back and I've been here probably ten times this year easily.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not much "in stock" as far as furniture. Not very friendly either. Will shop online and elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] I came here because my usual pho place was closed but I just needed to satisfy my pho craving...big mistake! I found a dead cricket in my food and it instantly made me lose my appetite they were acting rude after I told them too. Never coming here again!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Never called my number during a rush. Waited almost an hour for two chicken bowls. Late for work now. Looked like it had come out with a larger order and was never called.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was really good, waiter was nice, but not even five minutes after finishing our meal, the owner walked over and said we need to leave so they can seat more customers. I guess we can't allow our food to digest and finish our coffee. Won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] No bueno. The chicken tasted very cheap and strange. My husband is not a very picky eater but he barely touched his food. Service was great but I can't come back to a restaraunt based on good service only. I need the good to be somewhat decent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Over hyped like others said. $7 for a shortcake!!! $4 for one canolli and I have had good canolli but this one was not good at all. I rather have Publix bakery. Sorry, not impressed at all! I won't do it again  [END]
[BEGIN] On my recent visit to Austin I revisited this restaurant, may I say the service and the food were just not that good. Tip look else where for good Indian food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirty.sat 10 min no one would help us. All tables were dirty. Bar top dirty.dont wast your time  [END]
[BEGIN] Chicken was good. But I totally got food poisoning from this place. Can't say I'll be going back anytime soon  [END]
[BEGIN] GROSS&GREASY I ordered take out from here and was very disappointed. I ordered General Tso& egg rolls. The chicken was heavily breaded& large. The egg rolls were super greasy and had no flavor. Major let down 2 entrees and 4 egg rolls was $30  [END]
[BEGIN] No hostess to seat us. Waited to be seated 5 min. Finally someone comes over. Ordered food as soon as waitress came for drink order. Waited 45 min for food. Will not go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] No outside beverages allowed. So we took our coffees and went to Base Camp instead. Much better choice.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are going here for the juicy pork belly in the other pictures you see on yelp they don't serve it anymore. They only have these dry deep fried strips. Its just bland unsmoked bacon. Nothing special. Shame, I bet this place was great once.  [END]
[BEGIN] The name has changed again, but the service has not improved. Or perhaps they don't like single diners because other tables seemed to get more attention.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only vegan option I can find and y'all won't place a to go order on game day. What's the point of being open? To top it off the "host" didn't even acknowledge me until one of three people standing at the front told him to turn around. Completely ridiculous.  [END]
[BEGIN] 很失望，广告发了很多但是东西都不入味，感觉不像炒的，是不是东西就煮了一下然后倒点酱汁上去就完了。重点是我们点了3磅虾外带店家只给了1磅。回家后发现了打电话回去居然要我们再开会去拿，而且一直强调自己order的没问题。。。也是醉了好么  [END]
[BEGIN] Just stopping for dinner waited an hour then skipped over not sure the reason why bad service could be an issue or maybe it's our color  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at Rosen Centre for 2 nights in Feb 18. Horrible experience. Tried to extend my check-out time by only 1 hour because traveling with 2 small kids and we needed some more time to pack up. Was denied by mgmt. Food not that good either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Referred here to have wisdom teeth extracted. I have called the office 9 times today, a Tuesday, only to receive an answering machine each time. We will be looking elsewhere for care. I have heard amazing things about this practice. I wish we could have experienced the same.  [END]
[BEGIN] Long wait, very slow service, overpriced bad food. Definitely not worth it, wouldn't come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the food but they have kept us waiting over an hour past our reservation the last few times we have come. Yes you are popular but you need to manage your limited tables better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Every person except two who work at the pharmacy is completely incompetent. I have ran out of essential prescriptions with no notification that I was running out. My doctor and all other health professionals that I spoke to said to transfer my prescription because of their in professionalism.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered shrimp scampi takeout - tiny flavorless shrimp - angel hair pasta stuck in clumps - minimal sauce for $17.00 - very disappointed -  [END]
[BEGIN] Stop calling and snail-mailing and offering me the paper.  [END]
[BEGIN] I didn't feel safe here as a solo woman traveler.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have a hotspot there, everything going well, 5 hours later getting very bad diarrhea..... Definitely something not clean....  [END]
[BEGIN] The slowest service. I was visting the area for the second year in a row and had the same slow service. The barerista looked like see was day dreaming the whole time and acted like it was the first time she had seen coffee.  [END]
[BEGIN] A man came out to give us an estimate, looked around, said he would email us an estimate and we never heard from him again. Thumbs down.  [END]
[BEGIN] We waited over an hour for our food, which is itself frustrating, but their customer service was bad. Not once did our waitress check in or bother to communicate the ETA of our order. My friend was so mad we nearly walked out. Worst ihop experience ever.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went through the drive thru. No napkins, no straws, no receipt and cold fries. They need 3 windows. One to pay, one to get your food, and a third to get your order fixed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used to really like this place. But, New menu. :( Prices went up. :( Food stayed the same. Disappointed. Tiny Queso dip for $9.99. Crazy. Bad service. Taking this place off of my Mexican list.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lousy club! And extremely overpriced for what you get - ceilings that leak continuously, equipment that's been broken for 6 months, nasty locker rooms, b*tchy staff. Given that it's inside the Sheraton Hotel one would think it'd be at least half-way decent!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was ok, customer service was terrible. I couldn't tell who was an employee and who was a customer with people going in and out of the kitchen and dining area (without washing their hands, gross). This place needs new management.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place sucked. I had a terrible mixed drink and when I wanted to leave, they said they couldn't close me out for under $10 with a credit card. Also, if you find hipsters as annoying as I do, this is not the place for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prices are too high for what you get. Asked for them to substitute my steamed rice for fried rice on my $15 dinner, and they said no. I would have to get a separate side of it. Also doesn't come with soup or egg roll. Small portions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Found a dead ant in my double bacon cheeseburger - was it better it was dead or cause for more worry?  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered to-go and my meal was given to another person while I was sitting there. Didn't ask anyone's name just handed my meal to another person. I'm literally sitting in the to-go booth waiting on my replacement food for the past twenty minutes.  [END]
[BEGIN] NASTY, NASTY, NASTY Bathroom had hairs all over the place, extremely hot water in bath tub. Not a place i recommend. I would not be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is gross..the chicken in several of our dishes tasted freezer burned..and the rice was gross..how do you screw up rice..I am originally from San Francisco and I know Chinese food..this was horrible..I threw away $40 worth of food and made my family spaghetti instead..so bad..  [END]
[BEGIN] Maybe it was off day but, after reading the reviews, I decided I needed a sweet fix. Very expensive, small selection. Brownie was overly sweet. Blueberry muffin was dry and actually bitter. Oh well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beyond terrible, no clue how they stay open with pizzas this bad and subs are awful as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] They messed up my order and when it was delivered I asked the cashier who told me to bad we are not going to fix it  [END]
[BEGIN] I got a yelp account just to say this is the WORST thai food I have ever had. and a little over-priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] Crappy staff attitude. Botched order. Shitty location. Won't be back. Staff all look like work release.  [END]
[BEGIN] They water down their alcohol. Food is always subpar and service is not to a high enough standard. They like to have nice looking staff, who are also incompetent. Too many other restaurants in this city to have to settle for Earls.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chips and salsa was the highlight. Chimichanga had what tasted like velveeta cheese on top (trying to be queso). Came with white rice (odd for Mexican food). Water was so bad I brought bottled water from the car. Not recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was the worst ever Marriot experience that I've ever had. How is this place even a franchise??? Took 4 plus weeks to resolve my overcharges then they want to argue took over 8 phone calls at 35plus minutes to resolve! NOT A HAPPY PLATINUM MEMBER!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Epic fail in every imaginable way 1) meat-cheap, flavorless, and grotesquely greasy 2) fries have no potato flavor and the crusty stuck on seasoning 3) Pepsi products 4) ridiculously overpriced-$20 out the door for lunch 5) bacon-undercooked and fatty. Will return when it snows in Miami.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst place ever. After sitting down for 15 minutes, a waitress finally acknowledges our presence. The food was bland and not very good. Very bad customer service. Won't be coming again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought a Groupon for this place and have called 3 times to make an appointment. No one answers the phones and no one returns voicemails. I called Groupon and got my money Back. wasting of time.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have ordered from here for last time. Worst Panera out there. They never have my breakfast. They never put food on shelf. I'm contacting corporate about management clearly I'm not the only one with an issue with this place... reviews are horrible!  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was terrible. 45mins for 1 drink. Ordered food at same time and it came a hour and 15mins  [END]
[BEGIN] Our takeout order was half wrong. Food was missing, portion sizes were wrong. If it had been busy, I might be more forgiving, but the place was empty. 10/10 would not recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beware! Place was way too loud, wait staff sucked, food was awful and very expensive! Couldn't even get a glass of water to drink in under 40 minutes  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff is horrendous at taking directions or being of any service, slow, overpriced for sorry chain food. Wouldn't spend a dime here  [END]
[BEGIN] Not only is this business homophobic but also the staff seems to have gone through a training on how to be the most unfriendly at their job. Put your money to a business with better ethical standards. Turned around after I ordered.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time we ordered pizza guy to us late and cold, even tho we're just around the corner Second and last time We ordered I got 2 hairs in my crust. Will never order from this place again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst experience. I just moved to the area. I ordered 2 shakes and they both looked and tasted like milk. We waited 15 min for these 2 shakes and they were awful. The employee did not apologize for slow service. Will never come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am from Fort Lauderdale Florida...went to this restaurant while on vacation. A complete tourist trap. Food was retro 1965 awful. This landmark needs to be completely refurbished!  [END]
[BEGIN] don't waste your hard earned money....very greasy food and whatever dish you order expect very little chicken or beef. The food lacks flavor and is just plain distasteful!  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst Chinese food I've ever eaten and overpriced to boot. Not one dish hit the spot. I left hungry, with no leftovers and a big bill. Ambiance is also off. As others mentioned, dishes came out at very different times. I'm not wasting any more time writing. Just avoid it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not trust the approximate wait times, it started 30 minutes, after over an hour of waiting they took so long i wasn't able to take my cdl test! Go to any other dmv, they are so slow and incompetent here  [END]
[BEGIN] kingsway location: ordered the $34.99 hotpot beef with long string noodles,was too sweet ,would not recommend it. Service is horrible,have to ask for basic essentials,such as a tong to pick up the beef bones. The house tea looks soapy!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Standing here right and your staff STILL sucks!!!!!! How hard is it to greet your patrons and say hello?? Yall are terrible!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] We waited for over 10 minutes without anyone coming to attend to our table. When we left, I mentioned this to the hostess and she was completely indifferent.  [END]
[BEGIN] They close at 10pm on a Saturday. Service was absolutely insulting. I wouldn't recommend going to this place even if the food was good. 0 out of 5 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is very Americanized! Two out of three non-spicy dishes were simply too sweet! As a Chinese, I would not recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The greenery is beautiful, but I found the particular employee I was interacting with to be especially unhelpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible customer service. Rude employees, unorganized team of support staff. Don't go here; you'll wait a long time, and nothing good will come of it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went to get a coffee from this Safeway Starbucks... I couldn't seat down and drink my coffee. It is a Homeless shelter. Not trying to act hillarysh or diss but it is BAD!!!! Bad smell and uninviting!  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible, Terrible service. The first time that I went, the food was terrible, but I decided to give them another chance. It was terrible the second time as well. The fries are gawd awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and fries. I was given a lukewarm sandwich with the spiciness of a kids meal. The cheese, $1 add on, wasnt melted and still cool from the frig... Come on guys??..10 bucks for this...unimpressed and I wont return.  [END]
[BEGIN] The whole experience was bad. We had to wait in line forever to pick up the tickets we had already purchased and the entire theater stinks terribly. Do not recommend at all. Stick to Regal Westgate.. Way better theater.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful food! They have a buffet which offered runny eggs, cold cereal, bread, horrible stale pastries that were wrapped in plastic. They did have some freaks fruit though. Terrible service. Expensive for what we got.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst sandwich that I think I've ever had. They "toasted" the spicy chicken sandwich for me- it was hard brown old sub roll on the outside that was semi-warm, and ice cold on the inside. Rude cashier to top it off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wells branch location. Has the worst customer service at the front desk. I came in for an oil change the guy at the front desk tells me "oil changes are not their priority They only do important auto repairs"! Would a call from owners. Thank you  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst chai latte I have ever had. It tasted like boiled puke water. Never Again  [END]
[BEGIN] Status update: The sign on the window that says they plan to relocate is subject to the owner finding a cheaper and smaller space according to her associate. No location has been chosen yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place really is bad. Bad service, looks nicer outside than inside, hilariously overpriced, small menu of things I should have just made at home. Now we know, and now we won't be back. Sooooo many other places to go, save yourselves!  [END]
[BEGIN] Iced coffee tasted off and when looked inside cup there were pieces of napkin. Gross!!! Stay away.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service they woman who was taking my order had a serious attitude problem and on top of that after I placed my order she started asking if they even have enough chicken to complete my meal. Never have I experienced such bad service two thumbs down  [END]
[BEGIN] Their buffet is a waste of money. Don't even go there, and the food is horrible. I didn't like it.  [END]
[BEGIN] They didn't put onions like I asked and it's burnt to crisp, burger taste good but so dag small,,,the shakes are amazing but burger was disappointing  [END]
[BEGIN] CLOSED. Too bad. We could have used another good Indian eatery in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nasty food. Dirty. Good ice cream. No bathrooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] The tacos are a good choice. The Beef ribs are gone and that was major disappointment. If you are into Carpaccio, go somewhere else. They are awful, and they serve it with fruit. The look is nice and service is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible! Small beds, couldn't get the heat to work properly, nowhere nearby to go for dinner. Will not be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wish i could give this establishment a zero. An employee here, this evening, called me a CUNT. Classy establishment. Enough said.  [END]
[BEGIN] http://www.sushi-time.com/index.html Is this your website? Because it says "fresh sushi" and what I got today is loaded with preservatives.  [END]
[BEGIN] This review is for their Ob/Gyn through Harvard Vanguard. It is a very unprofessional office, stay away.  [END]
[BEGIN] First the appointment was rescheduled and I was not notified. A really great way to to treat a new customer. Not happy i bought an extended warranty for my new Samsung range if this is going to be how I am going to be treated. This really sucks SAMSUNG!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I didn't even want to give one star employees were rude and as soon as I sat down roaches appear i was so disgusted!  [END]
[BEGIN] Chicken lollipop is really like fried pakoda. Schezwan rice is not upto the mark. I won't recommend it to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered a large dark combo, and the chickens were swimming in oil. There were so much oil that even after the toast on the bottom was soaked, the basket was filled with it. Same with my coworker's basket as well. Others got the sandwiches, and they were okay.  [END]
[BEGIN] The ambiance may look appealing but the service is very poor. If you liked to be ignored this the place to go. Bring your friends and neighbor wallet way too pricey for what they serve. Limited menu and poor service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful. Pizza sauce tasted like it was from a can, "garlic" bread had no flavor and the salad we were given was full of wilted old lettuce and hair. GROSS! Don't go here, the restaurant is run down and scuzzy. Will not be going back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality of food is good but a rip off, just be beware if you order food to go, your California rolls will hardly have any crab in it. They stuffed in too much cucumber and avocado in it. Also, the tuna rolls were not fresh. SMH.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is not that great, but they are charging you like crazy people. They will give you a check with 17% tip added on top of taxed total, you don't even have a chance to express how disappointed you are at the food on the tip  [END]
[BEGIN] The problem was not 2 yrs ago. The problem was 9 days ago. But thank you for reviewing my post.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was really, really bad. I ordered the the Chicago combo. Cold, squishy bun. Barely warm dog. Ice-cold relish and tomato and pickle, couldn't find the sport pepper. Fries limp and cool. I ate about a third of it and tossed it. The Diet Pepsi was pretty good, though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Would not recommend this place. Crepes dry. Rushed service.. first and last time. If you are looking for sit down, table service and traditional crepe, this isn't the place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Arranged a cab to the airport for a specific time and they never showed up. When I dialed the number it transferred to a cab company in Boston. Won't be calling lucky 7 again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Even for resort food, this was TERRIBLE! Everything from the food to cage fighting on the blaring TV. Would expect more from a Sheraton.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great waiter (great personality) "Rell" but food was very cold both times he brought my wings and tacos out. The manager was very apologetic but overall the food was grossly disappointing!! I will definitely not be returning to this location!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't understand how you make it to eighty years old without learning how to talk to people. Old African American woman needs to get out of 'customer service' and learn common decency.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wanted tacos. Ordered tacos. Tacos came out cold. How do you fuck up tacos!? On a Tuesday? At Mexican restaurant? Made by actual Mexicans?  [END]
[BEGIN] Would give 0 if the app allowed. Through course of week, they straight didn't show for 3/4 calls and were 30 minutes late on the last. Ended up tipping the concierge extra to use a diff company  [END]
[BEGIN] This is probably the worst casino I have ever been in, very poor service only one place to eat. I would never gamble here nor will I ever go to another show here  [END]
[BEGIN] Management acts weird when i walk in all he did was keep looking at me like i was going to do some kind of crime after that never went back  [END]
[BEGIN] Sunday night disaster! Cook staff completely incompetent. Worse burgers in history. Sorry, you lost us as customers. Was here once before and it was great, tonight was a deal killer. Owners of Oaks Bottom - fire your Sunday cook staff. They screwed up 2 burgers! Not rocket science!  [END]
[BEGIN] Service: poor Atmosphere: poor, loud, messy People: impatient Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst couple slices i've had in Austin thus far. Maybe i got the leftovers being it was like 2:30? It tasted like day old frozen Za. If they had a public restroom i'd pull a top-shelf.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not authentic at all, chicken shawrma taste random, i even cant taste the chicken Plus tooooo pricy !!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for the Sunday brunch and there was plenty of food but it was a buffet, as one would expect, but the food was cold and tasteless. Have had better dinners there than the brunch experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has no redeeming qualities. Everyone says it is good for when you're drinking, but if that is the case, I am going to consider quitting drinking. This was possibly the worst prepared food I have ever purchased.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for massage. Don't think the therapist had any clue what she was doing. All I got was a good slathering of oil. Complete waste of time and money  [END]
[BEGIN] The retail store is fine, but for some reason they've given the login and password of their social media presence to some pro-Trump, alt right white supremacist. It seems "off brand" to me, for a record story in a progressive place like Portland.  [END]
[BEGIN] Never came to took order. We have 2 babies and waited and waited. Walked out There are plenty of waitresses there too! One even came by to tell us to move from our booth. This place is small so it's not like there are a lot of tables!  [END]
[BEGIN] We found some sort of bug in our room. We woke up with bites all over our hands and faces. The management was unwilling and uncaring in regards to the situation. They told us we were overreacting and that they had no obligation to make our stay more enjoyable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bleh, awful Americano. Sour sour sour. Bitter bitter bitter. And the ultra weird thing is that it tasted a wee bit spicy?!?!  [END]
[BEGIN] No customers in the store, but there were a few employees. I wasn't acknowledged by anyone for the ten minutes the lady at the front desk was on the phone. When she got off the phone, she was snappy and gave me attitude.  [END]
[BEGIN] So apparently you can not order a pitcher of beer or a bucket if you re not sharing it with someone. That's just unamerican. Wow.  [END]
[BEGIN] There was a homeless person standing facing this store location's entrance, holding a sign in one hand and a box cutter in the other hand. The guy behind the counter said this was normal. I did not feel at all comfortable being there so I left.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been to Qdoba frequently, but I will not return to this one. Rice was either leftovers from the previous day or not completely cooked and the pinto and black beans were hard.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was terrible! We overheard the other waiter mentioning specials that ours didn't say. When we inquired he sounded annoyed. We waited forever for our check while he bussed empty tables. Not a good experience at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was just average. The dessert wasn't just average...it was awful. Brought it to the attention of the manager...who didn't care at all. I was born and raised around good kheer and gajar halwa. And Cumin had awful dessert with terrible service. Never going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ur there for a view. The food is as bad as Applebee's. It's over priced and like many of the reviews before the service is bad. There is a great restaurant next door I would recommend instead.  [END]
[BEGIN] They broke my gears board and scrached my car. I paid for the most expensive interior/exterior cleaning, but the car looked almost the same as when I let them to be "cleaned"  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not take state IDs and lets busted people cut the line but deny entry for men with boots? Trash!  [END]
[BEGIN] I stopped in here quickly to get my jawline and chin waxed I thought it would be cheap because it is an Asian place. The lady charged me $40!!!! I was ripped off, but too shocked to question it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude waiter. Bad food and small portion. Asked for a cup of water for the kids and we were shouted back. Will never come again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible. Totally unprofessional and does not know what she is talking about,  [END]
[BEGIN] Update: They ended up selling the car for even less than I had offered... and I had cash in hand. So, they aren't paying attention. Use that to your advantage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty sure Anthony at the take out register in kitchen called my friend a n----r tonight. Either that or MAYBE he was singing a song lyric? (Doubtful.) Loved Santarps before tonight. Won't be going back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok food. But no Chocolate syrup to make any kind of chocolate shakes..slow service. Place could use a good cleaning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dishes were dirty, even after asking for clean dishes. Food was terrible. Fries and onion rings were burnt. Shrimp salad was disgusting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unwilling to do stand behind their work...After 3 years of giving them a lot of business they compleletely blow us off after the 1st disagreement regarding a Warranty Request. Very unprofessional.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow, we decided to try rr hamburgers, not a good idea. Also tried spinach dip., ok nothing to write home about. Ate hamburgers up all night sick. Still ill next day, dont know if meat or spices, but first time last time going there. Do not recommend...  [END]
[BEGIN] Not ready for business,no parking, no service , no english, not very impress for new opening of a grocery store.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here on a slow Saturday refused to play the any college game said it was the owners fault. Received poor service considering there was only 4 people in the bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably some of the worst service I've had in a while, they over stuffed my burrito and made absolutely no attempt to fix it when I asked. Will not be giving this location my business at all from now on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible. Not sure who shit in the bartenders corn flakes. Below average food. Over priced. Arrived in a great mood, left wondering how this place was still in business.  [END]
[BEGIN] food. normal prices yet small portions with small food quality drinks. ok meh, this place has changed for the worse, go elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] I never would have ordered food from here based on my gut instincts. But a friend was visiting and she didn't know any better. Epicly bad food. I'd consider Panda Express to be five stars when compared to this "food"  [END]
[BEGIN] Terribly disappointed with this place. I had the wrap for lunch and it was like dog food; mushy, steak not edible because of veins. Waste of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] The course was in terrible shape whenwe played on Saturday, it was overbookedwith no rangers out to keep play moving. Iuse to play there twice a month but not now until they repair the course.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sadly it turned out to be another Mexican restaurant wannabe with tasteless bland enchiladas. Even the "salsa" they served at the beginning was bland...absolutely no Pico in that gallo.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is pretty good, definitely not cheap, and I've seen mice there. Many times.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor service, mediocre food and beer. I have been her 4-5 times and every time it been the same. The bartenders were arrogant and opinionated. Not worth the time to stop  [END]
[BEGIN] Got all my fluids changed here on my Subaru 2009 less than a month after my engine is blown now looking at a new car or over $7k in engine replacement work stick to Tire and Batteries here!!  [END]
[BEGIN] service was mediocre, menu was limited and no one in our group of six even remotely enjoyed their meal. would not recommend or ever go here again. For $30 a plate, there are much better options around the corner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looking to do a cleanse? Great news, this is the perfect place to get food poisoning and pass everything. Seriously, I've been here twice and my wife and I both got really sick. This place is dirty and terrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very unhappy with service here!!!!!! Not so much Ned, but the other a-hole with the accent. What a jerk!!! I would never recommend this place. After going back twice to remedy a newly defective LCD cover that they installed, they told me they wouldn't replace it. NOT HAPPY!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] My sandwich was awful. $10 for a tortilla, cheese, old cucumbers and sprouts. The staff was friendly, but what a waste of money. I won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fake "mexican" food (again, picture me making air quotes), made by underpaid white people. It's trying to be an upscale version of taco bell. Totally gross.  [END]
[BEGIN] My smoothie had far too many seeds. The cashier ignored us when we told her to have a nice day. The smoothies weren't that good either. Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Last time I checked it wasn't hard to look at a list of items and place them in the damn bag. However McDonalds ALWAYS seems to mess it up. It's very frustrating. Check your bag before you leave  [END]
[BEGIN] I was not a happy employee when I worked here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible lamb, looked and tasted like lunch meat. Pricey for small gross portions. Server was not too pleasant. I will never go back here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wanted to try out for dinner. Went with 45 minutes till closing and they told me all they can make we're fries. So if you are hungry and it is almost closing time don't even try.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oh my god worst ramen ever. Nuff said. Taste like the ones your next door neighbor can make. Do not come here.  [END]
[BEGIN] This store smells, the checkout lines are long, and has over all appearance of being run down  [END]
[BEGIN] By far the rudest bartenders/hosts in Atlanta fine(ish) dining, I expected so much more, we decided to not even stay for dinner after our initial impression with drinks and apps at the bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here before but it's gone so down hill. Paid extra for breast that was the size of a large wing It was overcooked and puny. I gave it a one because the pie was at least good  [END]
[BEGIN] Unless you are willing to wait 20-30 min for a drink, don't come here. Literally 5 people in front of me waiting for a drink and it took that long.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst customer service ever. My agent is useless. She never returns my calls and took 3 months to apply a routine discount to my policy. Such incompetence.  [END]
[BEGIN] Asked my server for a non-traditional Rye drink. I Was informed that they can only make manhattans and old fashions. I ordered a Manhattan. Turns out even that was too ambitious. It had dry vermouth and a lime! Could not send it back because We were ignored by wait staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Regardless of the food quality, making your customers wait over 30 minutes for their food is inexcusable. You're in a central business district. Really dissapointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I called to as the price of the Satsuma body gel and scrub. The person who answered the phone was laughing and then she hung up on me. Very unprofessional and I'll go to another store downtown. At least there I know they know how to run a business.  [END]
[BEGIN] Manager was apathetic and totally unwilling to accept responsibility for items missing from my order. Instead, she said I had to contact UberEATS and request a refund. I won't order from here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Skippers has changed their breading. It now features some strange, wrong-headed, off putting spice. Won't go back. AVOID.  [END]
[BEGIN] The short chubby female hostess who works on Sunday's lied on the phone about availability, then was rude upon arrival.  [END]
[BEGIN] Manager is very rude! We asked for him to put a game on and he told us no and he does not care of we come back. I have lived here a long time and have always come here and supported this place but his attitude just changed that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bye-bye nasty, tiny, dirty, disgusting Safeway! They came and tore this mother down and are building a new one from the ground up. We looked at the specs for the new construction and it's going to be sweet. Can't wait until fall 2013 for the new Safeway to open.  [END]
[BEGIN] This s**t hole sucks!!! Don't come here. The service sucks and for the money that they charge it's not worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this pizza place but the owner (old lady) makes the whole thing unpleasant... Rude on the phone doesn't appreciate her customers...  [END]
[BEGIN] This place will bill you even if your food isn't delivered. BEWARE! Delivery guy was also super rude. Guy legit yelled at me after handing over the food. Just give me the food and walk away, seriously. It's the terrible attitude that motivated me to leave this bad review.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude owner named Chen, my clothes got ruined here, the place smells like dog feces, they don't like white people here either, one day Chen tried to take money out of my purse  [END]
[BEGIN] It may be the beer talking Judy, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They've got those big chewy pretzels here they're all blthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh $45 DOLLARS FOR A HAIRCUT!! GET OUTA HERE!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Cardboard crust Friends and I found a hair on one slice with a random collection of fuzz stuck to a slice of mozzerella on the other So gross save your time  [END]
[BEGIN] The chicken smelled funny and was tougher than shoe leather. I tried something new and will not be returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here last Friday. The staff pretends not to speak English. No one is really helpful in any way and the food is probably the worst Mexican food north of the border. Save your money and go to Taco Bell.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful service. Not friendly. The most over priced coffee in the world. Will never come back. Sorry!  [END]
[BEGIN] JULIE was nice but everybody else was no help. I paid for a rush order and didn't get a notification that it was ready until it was too late and completely pointless for me to have the shirt done. Never coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] My son hairline is SO crooked and jacked up, do NOT let Shafiq cut your hair at all!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very expensive food, two dishes and rice ended up being about 45$. Masaman curry was cold when it arrived with a hot bowl, seemed like it was old. Would not recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bizarre no purse policy and hostile about using the bathroom even though we were going to buy drinks and snacks. Sort of stuff you see in rough neighborhoods but not this area. Won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful in every way. Friend actually sent back nachos. Horrible yellow awnings out front. Hope it goes away and they put something good in this location. Oh and maybe they could quit it with the blaring ACDC headbanger music also. Lord....  [END]
[BEGIN] Overjocked, pretentious, snotty employees, stupidly pricey sandwiches, usual douchenozzle Back Bay snobbery clientele. No.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is mediocre. The service is terrible. They messed up everyone's order. No one refilled our waters or brought out more bread, despite asking multiple people multiple times  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably the worst liquor store I've been to- both in terms of selection and service.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was suck. I tried the hotpot and the foods was disgusting Almost 20 bucks for the broth and 2bucks per sauce for each person. Around 16bucks for the beef which was just few slices. Overall: super expensive and the foods did not worth the price!  [END]
[BEGIN] I left with a cut on my toe and my manicure started peeling off within ten minutes. I went because it was suggested by my regular salon which just lost their nails person. And several nails were filed unevenly. I won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I recently boarded my dog here. She has had diarrhea for 3 days since I picked her up. Now this will be an expensive vet trip for us. I also picked her up at 8am and I was charged for that entire day. Really not happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] At 7p, I walked in for a haircut, as the call ahead list was booked. The receptionist told me they weren't accepting any other patrons for the night. They don't close until 8p. Receptionist didn't offer anything except to try the downtown location, which closed at 9p.  [END]
[BEGIN] AWFUL!!!! Most of the employees have zero customer service. They were extremely rude and disrespectful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came by just now about 9:15 on a Wednesday. Posted hours on door state they close at 10 pm- just like Yelp: however their doors were locked and employees watched us try the door and stand there without letting us in. Guess they don't like having business? Won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] We tried this for the time and did not like anything about it. The food was not good tasting and the service was really bad. Unless you really love Iranian food you will not t place. Not recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a scam for people with bad or no credit. I wad sold a lemon and feel like such a sucker. Do not give them business, they will lie to you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible....uverse TV was MUCH better. Better channels, not so many adult entertainment channels (I have preteens), and I didn't have to disconnect the Direct TV connection to access Netflix via WiFi on my smart TV. Suuuuuuucks!  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible food. Chicken dry, prime rib raw, fish dry, crab and lobster mushy. Asked for prime rib to be cooked a bit more and got a bowl of meat that looked like it was microwaved to death. Expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] They are rude, expensive, and not really organic because i was personally told by the owner that they spray and it was dangerous to eat them too soon after, even though people were doing so.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible ...incredible view ...terrible staff...terrible food. Don't do it unless you are drunk and have no other place to go.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible. Did not install the check valve on my sump pump, and laid the drain pipe on an uphill slant. Bunch of idiots working for this company.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wanted to come here because of the outdoor seating listing. Been beautiful warm and sunny, and perfect for outdoor eating. However, the patio is only open "May-Sept". for shame...the dichotomy of what Portland says and what it actually is.  [END]
[BEGIN] The order was wrong. They tried to substitute a cheaper item without telling us or refunding.  [END]
[BEGIN] They left my lights on draining my car battery which i did not notice until much later, also they drove away with my car without showing proper ID, meaning anyone could pretend to be a saftey inspector and drive away with your car and steal it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Heard that this is a very popular place in Boston. Went there on a Friday night. The bouncers were rude and racist. Not a ideal place to get inot the weekend mood. With so many places around, would recommend going to the other places around  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is way Over Priced! $77 for an oil change and Tire rotation. I was going out of town and needed the services, won't be going here next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered dinner here last Tuesday and I'm still waiting on it. Horrible service and the kitchen staff cook at the same pace as senior citizens having sex...not fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Store.......BUT, if you don't shop there for 6 months, all your loyalty points get nuked....a pretty RAW deal. For an added bonus...no empathy whatsoever from the management there.....I'll stick with Liquor Mart....  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service every time. But its the closest and not as packed as the others. Orders take long and are usually always wrong for some reason.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are into bland over priced taqueria food then check it out. The quality has dropped off of a cliff. Never again. Check out Burrito Azteca instead. Sorry Cha Cha Cha. Bye, Bye.  [END]
[BEGIN] My time at AMLI South Shore has been so ridiculous that I was compelled enough to start a blog about it so that hopefully others don't end up stuck here like I have been. You can read it here. www.lifeatamlisouthshore.tumblr.com  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has the dubious honor of making me throw up every time I have consumed their food in late night desparation. I think they use ipecac in their soy sauce. Even Red House is probably better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Warren Rader is a complete jerk and has no people skills. I am surprised he is still in business.  [END]
[BEGIN] Shitty, shitty coffee. Ordered a mocha, but it tasted like chared toast - not sweet, not coffee, just char.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible service from the hostess (hard to even use that title); more like a cold person. Went in to have lunch with my family and she was so rude I walked out and did not even eat. We purposely went to this location to try this restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has racist policies. I was escorted out because I was cold and wore a hoddie. If I wore anything else including an item that covered my head because of religious beliefs I would have been fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got first degree burns from a brazilian here. Not super comfy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst fish and chips i have ever had. Poor service. Couple next to us also had a very poor dining experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a big fan. They never seem to have the dollar drafts they advertise about. The small dance floor upstairs gets crowded fast,  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank God Bass Pro bought them out! Horrible customer service and won't be going back there. The lady was so rude to me while I was trying to pick up my package I had ordered offline. Think I may actually cancel order and reorder from Bass Pro  [END]
[BEGIN] Okay service, but it takes forever to get the food. I order the salad and it was more like a soup. :( It had so much ranch it was nasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't know what all the hype about this place is about. Below average pizza and even lower service. No water offered to drink and poor service. Went there for the tandoori chicken pizza and was disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seriously over rated. The burgers were only ok. The service was terrible. I do not understand wanting to wait in line for a burger that you could get hust as good, if not better elsewhere. So dont waste your time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Half of my order was missing, wonton barely had any filling. Sauce was tasteless. Sadly not my cup of tea and wouldn't recommend eating here  [END]
[BEGIN] 1 hour to get chicken wings, really. Place was not that busy and a table next to us just left after 30 minutes of waiting with no service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is less than ok, characters don't really come around as much, and we had a cockroach crawling on our bench which is an indication of a filth. Waiter came over and killed it for us. Don't waste your money or time.  [END]
[BEGIN] We've missed bugaboo since they closed most of their locations but saw this one is still open and stopped in. Service was slow and inattentive and the food wasn't anywhere near as good as we remember.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dry Bar never replied to me even though they told me to reach out to make it better. Bad customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Grimy place. I mean it, its dirty... Mac salad was not the best. My chicken was really fatty Friends beef was way under cooked. Probably wont come back  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not go here!!!! Super expensive and not good food. Portions are really small for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Be very careful with your phone here. I know of multiple that have gotten their phone stolen here.  [END]
[BEGIN] this company dispatched Action Road Assistance (Cary, NC) and the idiot that arrived said his name was Al Saunders, physically assaulted the female driver and left before the police arrived!  [END]
[BEGIN] Couldn't order a sandwich because their credit card terminals weren't working. Stupid way to lose business.  [END]
[BEGIN] This restaurant was the worst service ever waited for 1 hour and 30 mins to just get the seat while waiting for all other people who came after us get the seat again. Never come here on Tuesday for wings.  [END]
[BEGIN] No, NO..NOOOO! I went there only once. I was seated and a roach scampered across my table. We called a waitress over and were moved to a diffrent table. Are you kidding me? Walked out, repulsed.  [END]
[BEGIN] the service is deplorable. the food is sub-standard -- the girl working the desk is actually a very horrible person. never go there  [END]
[BEGIN] Bathrooms were disgusting. Order was wrong. Food was burnt. Over charged for the Monday special.  [END]
[BEGIN] More like NEGATIVE 3 stars! Horrible service waited 45 min when we were only 2 of 5 people there and enough staff for 40! Left cancelled order  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful after a reservation at 1:45 I have been waiting for 45 minutes it's not 2:30 I will never come again to a place that does not respect costumers  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was bad, the bouncers were dicks. There is absolutely no reason to go here, there are so many others bars in the area that are so much better  [END]
[BEGIN] i ordered some sushi and the raw stuff was warm. Raw Sushi should never be warm. My stomach is turning and I want to hurl but can't at this moment. Will never ever go there again. Yuck! Beware of the warm Sushi that is raw and should be cold.  [END]
[BEGIN] The age limit feels a bit ridiculous... I'm a teenager in the neighborhood and my friends and I were turned away (from beauty and the beast?) earlier because we "didn't have an adult"- whatever, their money to lose I guess. Galaxy highland 10 it is.  [END]
[BEGIN] The most horrendous service! Better restaurants out there for Peruvian food, dirty and the quality of the food was terrible! Its a cafeteria at best with prices of a real five star restaurant. will never go back!  [END]
[BEGIN] No water fountain in a sports facility? Trash cans continually over filled? Benches littered with beer cans from the night before? Welcome to Pilgrim. On the positive side the guys in the shop are friendly. I still hate going here.  [END]
[BEGIN] If I could give it a zero I would. Everything was awful. The worst Mexican food I've ever tasted. The service was good however.  [END]
[BEGIN] food was fresh, service was excellent. If this was cajun food, i'm santa claus. this more like thai food, which is NOT what i was expecting. unless you know what you're getting yourself into here, i would suggest choosing another restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't like the place. Ordered fish and chips, taste and texture was as if zapped in a microwave. I don't get it. It's supposed to be fresh fish. Instead it was soggy  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay away!! One order of chicken tasted like chemicals and the other order was soaked in oil. Absolutely disgusting, and no one cared. Still got charged for both orders even though food wasn't touched.  [END]
[BEGIN] They've doubled the price in the last year... only to cut the number of bounce houses in half.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely gross. I got two slices finished the first one out of pure barbaric hunger and tried to eat the second only to find a huge black hair in it. Stay away from this place. stay away  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't go if you have kids. We went and they refused to serve us because they had all the tables reserved in the family friendly areas and the manger was rude about it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have you seen Zootopia? The sloth? Yeah, you'll be dealing with that when checking out along with rude cashiers who hate their jobs. Dear Officemax, in a world of Amazon, online shopping, and customer-centric competitions how in the world do you stay in business?!  [END]
[BEGIN] Descent food but appalling service. Kimberly was very disrespectful, slow and was rude when we asked her to correct our order which came out incorrectly. The manager was equally awful. Never going to this location again. Unimpressed  [END]
[BEGIN] 5 cars from our group were broken into. No security cameras they said there was security staff but we saw none to speak of. Second year in a row this happened. Police say this is there normal beat on weekend mornings. Stay here at your own RISK!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food amazing and service! But....Saw the bartender break a glass over ice and not clean out the bin. I couldn't see from my vantage point but i would have cleaned it out just to be safe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible tired store. Merchandise is out of date and they have a terrible return policy. There are much better places to spend your money and get customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] In a word... Nasty. Garbage was piled sky high on top of garbage can, and huge mess in front of soda machine. Never seen anything like this at a McDonalds and makes me wonder what is going on behind the counter. Oh yeah, and the employees are extremely rude.  [END]
[BEGIN] I found the owner to be arrogant and not professional in any degree. The offices are An absolute pigsty. I would be embarrassed to bring anybody into that sort of environment. A very dismal experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Short.... Because this place isn't worth much. Delivery. Almost 2 hrs!!!!! Gyro was decent.... My sun chips came completely smashed. Wtf pita pit?  [END]
[BEGIN] WORST SERVICE EVER! I tried to buy a 30 dollar bottle, the cashier gives 10 dollars short of change, when I complain she denies it, and she refuse to check her tilt. I try to talk to other employees with no luck, they plainly stole 10 dollars in my face......  [END]
[BEGIN] We love papa Johns. Used to come here every week for a year until we had an awful experience that they refused to acknowledge.This location is the worst, the employees are clueless. Try dominos on Airport Blvd.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rudest waitress or waiter I honestly couldn't tell. I'm adding to the many others who say the same exact thing here. The food is not good. This place is dirty. Go to Trinket instead. This place is GROSS.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped in for lunch and I will never again. The food was cold and the beer was warm. The service sucked. I would recommend going down the road sum place else.  [END]
[BEGIN] We came in at 9:50 and they told us they're closed and not taking orders Told her the website says you close at 10:30 she said no that's not correct!! Seemed she just wanted to be done and Go home early. Definitely Not going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only because -5 stars is not an option. These low-life's left us standing at the lot gate for over a half hour in -1 degree weather to pick up our car that was towed during Boston's worst winter storm to date.  [END]
[BEGIN] These guys are still rude idiots. Use the COOP for the free bathroom. Buy books through Amazon.  [END]
[BEGIN] I called over a week ago and left a message to schedule an appointment. My call has not been returned. I was looking forward to a nice treatment (per reviews here) in a convenient location but it appears I will have to look elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not visit this hotel during hot summer months. The pools get super packed with guests and locals and they get absolutely disgusting. You may even catch a disease. Try April, May or September but stay away during July & August. Everything else is ok, nothing extraordinary.  [END]
[BEGIN] Visiting from California, walked inside with a party of 11, five of which were children. Server told us he was alone and could not serve us. Boy, business must be good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I definitely went to Cherry Systems and was quoted an outrageous number for work they could not do properly. My yelp user name is short for my actual name, so no you haven't seen my yelp name as a customer of yours. But yes it was me.  [END]
[BEGIN] this is not real mexican food...watered down salsa with a buncha salt! Cheap but not good. I got tacos and they sucked. sorry but it's the truth.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a burnt bun. Wtf. The bun was also crusty and stale. It wasn't good at all, if I wanted shit food I would have gone to burger king  [END]
[BEGIN] Came in towards the end of the lunch buffet. Couple of hours pass and I'm puking yellow goop up on the side of the road. Must have been a meat dish because my vegetarian friend is fine (he said it was good).  [END]
[BEGIN] The ramen was way too oily. It wasn't served hot enough either. I'm rather disappointed. I love my ramen but not at this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here twice before. First time with a fly in the soup base...decided to give it another shot yesterday and the waitress gave me the wrong bill. Staff aren't very friendly either :/  [END]
[BEGIN] Gave it two chances. Slow service both times and everyone left with an upset stomach both times.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too many rules, surly staff, average beer. Felt like I was having a drink at a convent.  [END]
[BEGIN] I work near this restaurant location. This is by far the worst experience ever with a McDonalds. The service is always bad and the food is horrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food but, when your sitting there and a cockroach comes running down the wall it makes me think of what I just was eating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a good gym! Equipment types are very limited. Staff are unfriendly. This is great place if you are over 60 years old. It is clean though!  [END]
[BEGIN] I just left store after going all the way through it without one person asking if I needed help. Of course there was an attractive lady who followed after me who received service right away. This is a customer no service store.  [END]
[BEGIN] entered park with clear skies got to the water got kicked out due to storms in the vicinity. didn't get refunded. total time in park 15 min. just salty ig  [END]
[BEGIN] Chili is disgusting, steak is dry, nachos are gross, pulled pork is mediocre. Nuf said.  [END]
[BEGIN] The bartender was a total douche, seemed annoyed and snobby, not going back to this place for sure  [END]
[BEGIN] I work down the street from this "restaurant" (to use the word loosely) and have tried their food 3 or 4 times. Each experience was worse than before. Unsanitary, often undercooked, strange tasting and totally unpleasant. Avoid at all costs!  [END]
[BEGIN] $110 for two tickets to a show I usually pay maybe $75 for, $20 parking, $25 pedicab ride because they make you park so far away, $10 beer, $4 water... See the theme? Austin has plenty, and much better, venues to see music. Last time I come here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there for dim sum on a Monday, assuming the busy weekend would clear out the stale food (classic Asian). Should've turned around as soon as I set afoot...restaurant smelled oddly musty and damp. Service was slow, and everything we ordered ranged from mediocre to spoiled. Very disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible guac ! I got the plate and the gauc was almost frozen. It was really, really cold. Ruined my lunch basically since there's no microwaves around  [END]
[BEGIN] 2 main reasons never to visit this place 1 Gun Free Zone 2 No Credit Cards I dont buy the donuts for me so when i go buy them its more of a promotion of your goods that im doing  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't waste your time stopping. They don't have what they advertise, and don't answer the call button.  [END]
[BEGIN] The vegetables are not fresh and the food seems like it's microwaved. Some of it is cold and some of it is warm and some of it is very hot all in the same dish.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wasn't happy with the service tonight. Sorry my wife isn't drinking. No reason for ignoring us all night. The wor wonton soup was boiled to death and the shrimp was too old. Not happy here tonight.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible food that is overpriced, and when I told the manager/owner about it, my comments were met with silence- they could've cared less what I thought. Don't waste your money.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'll start off by saying we had four drinks and it cost $52 with out the tip. I received one of my drinks in a glass that was never washed. The bartenders try but the place is so poorly managed they have no chance to succeed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just because I'm using Groupon does not mean you make me wait for 10 mins... Even if I got the Groupon deal, I still paid for it... And I always stop by and buy without using groupon anyway...  [END]
[BEGIN] Ignorant, classless place run by the same kind of people.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered the noodle with pork & egg rolls, & Thai iced tea. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling really nauseous & threw up....it must have been food poisoning. :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived early and waited for their 11:00 opening time. At 11:20 and still not open, I ate at a different food cart. At 11:50 when I left, there was still no sign of life. Good luck if you go here.... Might be open, might not.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has so many cockroaches they were in the lobby, bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. We were first on the 1st floor when the roaches started appearing then we were moved to the 5th floor where the roaches continued to infest us.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful though we didn't eat. we were told to get a table and then no one ever can to bring menus or help us. Eventually we left and no one eve said anything - like they didn't even care.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lets just say that I only eat here if I'm starving and this is the only place open. Sushi is mediocre and the service isn't the best, but also isn't the worst. Go here for a quick and cheap fix.  [END]
[BEGIN] I installed yelp and created an account and wrote this review about the time it took to get a taco...all while waiting for my taco. Terrible slow service.  [END]
[BEGIN] One star is most generous. I cannot comment on the food because it never arrived. After waiting for 45 minutes, we left. Worst. Service. Ever. There are too many other good choices in the area. STAY AWAY!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not visit until the remodel is done, apparently expected to be done in March or April 2013. It is too expensive ($160/n weekdays) right now given the fact that the remodel prohibits them from offering any amenities. Stay at the Fairfield Inn just one block away for $105  [END]
[BEGIN] Selling expired milk, soda, among other goods is unacceptable. This isn't a one time thing either.. It has been multiple occasions now.  [END]
[BEGIN] wow why! used to be good when I was a kid, not going to get poetic or jaded either not worth my time wow why!  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible experience. Food takes forever and it's not even good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very unprofessional. They did a sloppy job on my manicure. Did not bother to properly take off excess nail polish from my fingers. The manicure was rushed. The nail polish was globbly on my nails. Woman who did my nails was unpleasant. Never coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely slow and don't know the difference between Taro and Thai iced tea. Staff seemed to not care at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have come to conclude that all Steak and Shake restaurants are the worst Steak and Shake restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn't deserve to be in the North End. Customer service is awful and food is subpar. Frozen seafood and undercooked pasta... go elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was my first time & I am very disappointed. Ordered a veggie bowl with double veggie (added 2$) & for $7.50 get this. Not to mention it was served cold. Do not recommend this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was very mediocre and waitress was occupied more with talking to the other staff. The air conditioning was not on so it made the place feel very stuffy. Portions of the food was vey small for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Um, yeahhhh, this place is scuzzy, and not in a good divy way. The bathrooms are disgusting, and the rest of the place makes me feel like I'll get Hep C just from touching anything.  [END]
[BEGIN] Be careful, this place pretends to be "Austin" and instead turns into Dave & Busters (on a bad day). Nobody there from Austin Nobody there has a soul And the entire place smells like urine  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered from this place tonight. I ordered 2 Cokes and got 1, asked for bacon on half my pizza and got it on the whole thing, my pizza was borderline burnt, and my mozzarella sticks were undercooked and floppy. Very gross, and will not be ordering from here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Would like to go but I won't because I'm always concerned when you can't find an online menu WITH prices! There are too many other restaurants to choose from in Atlanta!  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm from TX & 4 dinner I didn't want to go out to eat, so I decided to order from May's. My friend & were so disappointed! The food has no flavor! The egg rolls don't taste like "normal egg rolls".  [END]
[BEGIN] If I could give no stars I would. This place sucks almost as much as the snobby owner does. Matt has a hard time putting his money where his mouth is and fails to deliver basic customer service every time I come here.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went with my husband & sat at the bar but the environment was weird. The bartender was rude so we paid & left.  [END]
[BEGIN] world famous? never heard of gus. never again... only difference of gus fried chicken and kfc is spicy, yeah, i like spicy, but any world famous?? and beans and piece of bread, aahrrr... it's no worth a try  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was horrible. Service was absolutely terrible. Forgot my sons drink, appetizer, salad,.... People around us that got there after us had their food. Told us they lost our ticket. Just paid for the drinks and walked away. Will never be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is awful. If you enjoy ordering a Jack and coke and being ignored for 12 minutes when the the bartender finally acknowledges you again as you request the same beverage and the response is "you can see we are busy" that's a joke. #shittyservice #attitude #terriblebar  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff is overbearing and seems more interested in signing you up for a credit card than helping you select the right jewelry. It's clear that they are compensated more for these credit card sign-ups than they are for sales commission. Kay is a financing operation disguised as a jewelry store.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been there a few times and each time the meat has tasted old (chicken and beef). Also I paid $1.30 for 10 chips. C'mon at least give me half a bag. I don't think I'll be back to this location again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The website and front doors of this place advertise hours of operation that the business does not keep. The place is managed like shit. I can't imagine it will stay in business unless they either shape up of fire the managers and hire new ones.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the worst brewery in Portland. The food was garbage, the beer was worse, and the service was on par with an angry McDonalds. Great outdoor seating though!  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible! The food taste terrible. It all smells completely burned, and the waiter was extremely rude. Also the sauce put on the meat taste terrible  [END]
[BEGIN] Out of Business in Oregon due to franchise going bankrupt.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service, they are never in a good mood and have their "favorites" they choose to give better service too. Sad because the food is decent. Not good enough to put up with the poor service for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thought I'd give it one more chance. NEVER AGAIN. Crap food, crap service, lousy beer selection. Took 15 minutes just to get the check. It's an AIRPORT, PEOPLE HAVE TO CATCH A PLANE. Just should have walked off.  [END]
[BEGIN] shower head broken Shower backed up (gross) Dirty floors Discussing elevator floors/ walls Windows VERY thin so you hear the planes taking off - airports close Pros: Potential if they just learn how to CLEAN!  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not make items not on the menu. My friend and I went to get the infamous Quesarito and employee said they knew how to make it but denied our request.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced food, run by an american company that clearly doesnt know what these chains need, and they cant seem to nail the service. Ive had some lovely servers, but overall, it seems like this place isnt run very well. Will never return.  [END]

[BEGIN] We bought a chocolate peanut butter pie, which was a multi-layered combo of instant pudding, store bought crust, and a strange peanut butter custard. It was a big gelatinous mush. It's one use may be to throw in people's faces...  [END]
[BEGIN] Used to be good; now not so good. Waiters and waitresses seemed like they wanted to be anywhere else. Food was meh and overpriced. Screwed up my friend's bill and no apology. I'll go around the corner to Tip Tap Room; nicer wait staff and nicer food.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have cute stuff, but in my many times stopping in I have never bought anything because they want too much for it. There are many furniture consignment in this 3 block radius, they need to compete with the other shops for customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered the clam strips, they're awful. I looked for any actual clam, and most were just breading. The fries are not good either. I genuinely feel like I wasted my money. I won't be coming back!  [END]
[BEGIN] imbibe is weak on drinks imbibe is lacking flavor imbibe is overrated  [END]

[BEGIN] The b team came in that night and ruined my burrito. Terrible service and no coke from the fountain machine. This place is terrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good pizza, terrible service. Staff acts like you are bothering them when ordering from the counter or asking for anything in general. Also, their ice machine has mold on it. Disgusting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went in there earlier, and was "helped" by some one named Preston. I say "helped" because he was a massive jerk. Needless to say, I promptly left. Never going back there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bunch of douchebags work there! They argue with you when they F up. Food sat there for 15 minutes they never call your order then they want to argue with you that they called your order several times. BS!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the Southern Fried Chicken Salad. Wasnt very good. Menu says it has a chicken breast on it.. Ended up with just chopped chicken fingers. Very disappointing and menu is not accurate.  [END]
[BEGIN] IT TOOK FOREVER! The lady seemed very confused. She didn't really comprehend what we were saying and messed up all of our orders  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced, many poorly-made goods, unpleasant atmosphere. I've been to all or most of the Kitchen Corner locations and always leave empty handed. No reason to ever go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely HORRID service. Sat at table for 15 minutes before I was even acknowledged. When asked to order, I got the "wait a minute" finger. 15 minutes later I walked out. It wasn't busy. The wait staff were milling around, Avoid unless you have no other option.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wish I could give this place 0 stars!! Hands down the worst bbq in the world!! Yes not just in Portland but in the world!! It is clearly obvious to everyone else also because this place Is ALWAYS empty!  [END]
[BEGIN] The bus never showed up. It was major hassle trying to get to and from the event, because we were scrambling. What make it worse is the folks I spoke to on the phone didn't seem to care. I am doubtful I will see any restitution.  [END]
[BEGIN] vacation place over priced high. 4 What you geto passable  [END]
[BEGIN] rip off price!! for me and my husband to share - we ordered rock n roll and tiger rolls -- got 6 each and it's really small. too expensive!! I was still hungry after that. :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Yuck. Not sure what all the craze is about, but this place was not good and was also expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] You guys really need to make sure you pay attention to the temperature setting of the soup. I get it that you don't want anything to grow in it, but if the customer burns their mouth even after a long walk to the office, that's not cool either  [END]
[BEGIN] Got my hair blown out and the stylist did a decent job. However the woman at the desk who claimed to be the manager was rude for no good reason. Would not go here again just due to the terrible customer service exhibited by management.  [END]
[BEGIN] Would love to give it a zero. Poor service. Warm beer. Orders messed up. Bad food. Yelp won't let me post this as a real review unless I write more stuff so here you go words words words words words words words  [END]
[BEGIN] We had dinner here. The rice was not cooked -as in very hard- and looked like uncle bens. The curries were ok, nothing great. The rice !!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is one place in town that so far I did not like at all. Service was amazing but if i could go here just for those doughnuts and coffee I think that would be good but nothing else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was terrible. Food was cold and took 45 mins for 2 burgers. Even took 20 minutes to pay. Next time I'll take the extra 5 minutes and walk to cactus club around the corner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Made my reservation and was told my certificate is expired. As you can see there is no expiration date listed on the certificate but Anna told me the company has a list of expired dates. That would have been nice to share with the customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] BREANA is the worst at costumer service!! She always looks like she doesn't wanna be there!! I hate when I have to order from her.. She take forever and she looks mad  [END]

[BEGIN] Service sucked, food always good, waiter was more interested in the tv and clearing empty table than refilling our drinks  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't want to get good service in here The boss only want to earn more money. Why I get one more sauce , I will pay 5 dollar. You know the other hot pot restaurant is free. Don't try to eat in here. It's bad  [END]
[BEGIN] The restaurant was really cold so we asked to be moved to another section that wasn't as cold. But the staff said our food would take even longer. I definitely understand that it was busy but he could have put it in a nicer way than being passive aggressive.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time trying this out. So, there was a Hair in my nachos, chicken wings were cold, beer tasted like they didn't wash the cup out so modelo tasted like blue moon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good luck cancelling here or any other LA Fitness location if you join.  [END]
[BEGIN] Picture an assembly line of ladies handling meat. laughing speaking in their language while they do your pedicure. You are the piece of meat !! very impersonal !! Place smells of cigarette smoke ! No thanks, theres lots of other places to choose from.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Safeway is a war zone. Avoid if possible. There is a plethora of homeless, drugged out both inside and outside. Hardly any selection and long lines with funky smells.  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst BBQ sausage I ever had. It was dried out and all they gave you was a chunk of bread with 2 hot peppers. If you want good pizza go to prince pizza. No coffee no butter for the bread. What a disappointment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nahhh..u can give this one a miss..10x times better places around. Even though the buffet price is reasonable u can def get better stuff else where..quality of food and hygiene is very poor. Their falooda(sort of a milkshake) was tasting sad! Wont go bk :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Needed my tires rotated. Not only did they not do it but the weights on my tires started falling off. Then to finish it off they lost the key to the lug nuts on my tires so now I can't get my tires off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible for oil change! Set up a reservation online for a fixed time, but apparently that means nothing!!! Still have to wait for more than an hour.. I went to waffle house across the street, waited in line, ate breakfast, got back and they still hadn't started on my car!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the Miga Burger, no flavor. Had The Kimble cocktail, awful. This place is on the list for top places to skip in Austin.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not play the slot machines,.it. Is programmed not to hit at all. Just go to the cashier and give them your money,.stop wasting your time. I been through a lot of casino and by far, this is the worst.  [END]
[BEGIN] I didn't like it as soon as I walked in the floor was so slippery like the mopped it with grease I slipped inside on the floor the food wasn't great either and not much choices either I'd rather eat del taco  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst pizza I have ever had, doesn't even deserve 1 star. The presentation was awful it was cold, pretty much just bread with sauce & some cheese thrown on top. Nothing about this pizza was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible. Can't keep up with service even when crowds are slow. Need to shut down, fire everybody and start over.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not enough staff. On person helping customers and another making the food. Line of 20 people during lunch hour. Bad staffing.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a complete waste money and time, 368 dollars was our final bill and the only thing good was the lobster. Meat items were raw, non juicy, and overcooked. I would not recommend this to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Are here for dinner, as recommended by reviews. Flavorless and touristy food which is overpriced. What a shame! Rice, beans were lacking any spices. Fried snapper was overdone and flavorless. Chicken a laplancha left a lot to be desired.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're going to call yourself a sports bar put the relevant sports on, ever. It's beyond embarrassing that your customers have to tell the staff what channel to put it on. This place is an absolute joke  [END]
[BEGIN] We thought we'd try this McDs again. This time we went in. We ordered 1 sausage McMuffin and a soft drink easy enough. It took 15 minutes to get it.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place makes no effort to put out decent food. The food is dry and tastes bland. They also screw up on the ingredients and make orders incorrectly. It's worth the short drive to the Bethany TB. MUCH better food there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude hostess when we called on Sunday morning. She should not be working in customer service. We chose another dining option due to her unprofessionalism.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got to the mini golf course tonight at 10:40 because Yelp says it closed at 11:30, but the employees were headed to their cars. The lights were out and our plans for the night were ruined. :(  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst airline I have ever been on. Overcharged for ticket when changes flight, they keep you on hold for at least 40 minutes. Their website is not helpful. Very disappointed I will never fly them again. i give them 0 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] I found this place to be so unspecial-- expensive and a meat market. If you are looking to meat someone who will never ever call you again, be sure to check out Daisy's.  [END]
[BEGIN] They never answer their phone nor return any of your voicemails. After losing an item there, I reached out every day for 4 days with no response. It's a pity because I really like the place.  [END]
[BEGIN] My boyfriend got food poising from this location. We know it was here because this is the only thing he had to eat that I didn't. He was throwing up for 4 days and had to miss work. AVOID  [END]
[BEGIN] Watch out!!! I ate there 9/29/16 and had my credit card information stolen and used from there. I asked them about it and they claimed they knew nothing. It happened in less than 30 minutes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretentious and pricey. Noisy chefs bar. Couldn't hear each other or the chef. Spent a lot, left hungry. Food was good. Attention to presentation but I've had better sushi elsewhere. Valet parking was rude and ridiculous.  [END]
[BEGIN] If your going to advertise as an Irish bar, be Irish. Wow the expensive prices are outrageous. Won't be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was the most expensive oil change I've ever had AND I was told that multiple parts needed to be replaced when they didn't. Beware!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Maybe the food is great, I wouldn't know. They decided to start just closing early for whatever reason, a special surprise for my wife, which I live in round rock and made the trip down here turned out to be a huge waste of time. Thanks for nothing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst tin drum I've ever been to. Under staged and the little staff they had was terrible. Ran out of many food options.  [END]
[BEGIN] Girls are so rude when you try and sell back they were short with me and acted like I was bothering them. I think the oldest girl working there was maybe 21? They need someone a little older to manage them! Also, the place has a distinct musk.  [END]
[BEGIN] They say they r open until 1am but they really close at 1215. You've been warned. Total crap.  [END]
[BEGIN] For a grocery that advertises as a farmer's market, their produce section is sure disappointing. Not so fresh, limited selection and way over priced. I wonder how they keep their doors open.  [END]
[BEGIN] If I didn't have a cart full of things I needed and took an hour to gather ...... I would have walked out! Three lines open with more than 6 customers per line. Ridiculous. Customer service sucks at this location!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I sat in the drive thru at this location on a Saturday morning from 11:00-11:38 am. That is just ridiculous to sit in a drive thru. Apparently they were training, but the should probably consider another time to do that. Don't know if I'll ever be visiting that location again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Make my appointment online, come to Mr tire, but Manager said no email about my appointment and couldn't help with my oil change. No problem Mr. Tire, I will never back. Just BAD customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not order the pasta dinners from this place. If you're looking for good Italian pasta dinners I highly suggest you look elsewhere. The marsala here was more disappointing than the 3-1 lead the warriors blew in the NBA finals.  [END]
[BEGIN] Waited in drive thru for nearly 5 minutes this morning and nothing. Called and no answer. WTH?  [END]
[BEGIN] Found a long black hair in my veggie wrap. They gave me attitude when I pointed it out to them. Do not eat here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst car rental company ever. Dirty cars, rude customer service, and watch out for Sun Pass traps. They charge you 5 dollars extra per toll if you ever take the Florida Turnpike by mistake without a sun pass.  [END]
[BEGIN] Can I give it less stars? How can a restaurant NOT have a washroom? And then ..order yourself? U ot stay home and cook then? We left and won't go back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just drove over to this location to get a balance and pedicure. It was 6:45 on my cell phone. Employees were in the parking lot and asked me what service I wanted. I told them and they said, "come back tomorrow!" What?? You post your hours as closing at 7?!?  [END]
[BEGIN] Closed at 1230 on a Saturday just because - honor your hours. This is embarrassing and I will Never come back  [END]
[BEGIN] This is probably the worst Waffle House service ever. Waited for 30 minutes with only three others tables only to hear that it would be 30 more minutes until they would start cooking our food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst customer service. Service and management staff needs retraining. Consider alternate location, really...really. Pay an extra $ it will be worth it  [END]
[BEGIN] Food took two hours with no explanation. The waitress snapped at us. I've never been somewhere that has treated poorly served customers with such disrespect and inconsiderate manners.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amanda was so extremely rude. Never returning here again and I am going to tell everyone I know to go elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] We drove miles to have a family dinner just find them closed at 7 PM for no good reason. A big waste of time.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is pretty bad. Expect to be waiting an hour after your appointment time before you see the doctor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Warm beer. The pork sandwich was awful. Supermarket bag french fries. First and last time I go.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered late night delivery. I'm pretty sure they sent me the donuts they were going to throw away. All stale and tasted similar surprisingly. Probably won't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just wanted to make a simple tutu and the staff was incredibly rude. One team member told me "If your question is quick I'll answer it, I'm busy". Ended up leaving with nothing because no one would help me find the items I needed. Heading to Micheal's instead.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sorry, I really wanted to write a good review but our service was just do bad that it tainted the entire experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] tried multiple times to book an appt--phone is always busy or mail box is full. DO NOT USE  [END]
[BEGIN] I wish nail salons would bother getting the proper training or just a quick know how for all their employees when it comes to doing gel sculpture don't offer a service you don't know how to properly perform!  [END]
[BEGIN] Lunch buffet wasn't good they don't have a big selection of dishes, the food was cold and not to spicy i didn't feel like im eating indian food, the service was just fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Waiters were good but that's where it ends. Found hair in our food and if that's not upsetting enough they tried to bill a part of the "sorry we messed up " desert on the check. Do not waste your money here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst service ever. Waiter complained about having to bring us food. Told us we didn't order things and wasn't sure what kind of enchiladas he brought out. Thought it was a prank. Do not go in here to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was terrible and the kitchen "forgot" my order, everybody from my table Finnish all the food but my food doesn't come We won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] BBQ pork (char Siew) is terrible...probably the worst in the region. But groceries are great!  [END]
[BEGIN] If I could zero stars I would. Asked for pizza extra well done. Raw mushrooms. Raw onions and no sauce. Would have rather eaten a baby hippos diaper after a day in the river. Little Caesar's is gourmet compared to this.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is gross. My 4 year old niece can make better pancakes than this shithole.  [END]
[BEGIN] It took almost an hour and a half to deliver ten minutes away in Somerville...came with no rice...greasy and bland...and they got the order wrong! Expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just had the worst fish and chips I've ever had in my life first of all the French fries should be steak fries and everything was way over cooked  [END]
[BEGIN] Came in and orders food waited 1.5 hours and never got served. Questioned why we never got served and we were told that it was on its way. What a joke! I will nver come to this fast food establishment again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible place would recommend steering clear. Very rude and inhospitable employees that are an atrocious mix of dirty hippies and pretentious hipsters. Would not recommend anyone go here and support these rude employees. Coffees okay though. Get the Venetian cream  [END]
[BEGIN] management...please tell Sandra at the front that if she wants that $15 an hour, she should at least try and put a smile on her face. super rude and obnoxious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Slowwwwww :) Yelp wants more details so... I don't see anyone working here that seems motivated by lines...  [END]
[BEGIN] If you love day old donuts and blaring heavy metal, this is your place. The donuts look amazing but aren't better than Donut Palace or Shipley's.  [END]
[BEGIN] Based on the customer service of their store manager, I recommend going elsewhere for your home/garden supplies. I try to support local/small business as much as possible, but unfortunately there is anything but a "customer first" mentality here. There are a few other similar stores nearby that I'd highly recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried the hamburger. I'm not sure it was even real beef. It tasted more like a sour and beef combo. The service was horrible and the prices are outrageous.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's infested with ants our room was disgusting, we had a hard time getting our money back! We were in room 75. Staff is rude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is disgusting. It's actually dirty in there. I was appalled when I went into the waxing room. It should be spotless and sanitized in rooms like that. All they care about is your business. The girl butchered my eye brows. Just awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Order through uber eats. Short handed at work and couldn't leave for lunch break. This place is right down the street. Food came cold. Burgers burned. Reached out to uber eats and no help. We spent $28 on awful food. Last time!  [END]
[BEGIN] Memorial Day ... and only 2 cashiers open - who also work at a snails pace with an attitude. They like to not look their customers in the eye and really enjoy chatting with each other. I won't be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is total CRAP. The venison is poorly cooked. Service is neutral at best. 2 meal credits is total cabash. Not a single good thing. No ice water. Dessert is even boring. A true African meal of sticks and meal worms has to be better.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've always loved this place. Until today. :( There was hair in my food. And it wasn't mine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably very good coffee. I wouldn't know though since they refuse to divulge what the 7(!) mystery ingredients are in their "milk." No thanks.  [END]
[BEGIN] NOT a good experience. Asked for a trim, and got 2 inches cut off. The women talked amongst themselves and even cursed to each other, totally ignoring me as their customer. I do not recommend this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Zero stars if I could. Terribly rude. Puts you on hold without even saying hello. "Everett Taxi, hold on"  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm from Connecticut... the Chili's at this location is definitely not up to Connecticut standards... The food was atrocious the service was nonexistent the table sticky and I still left a 15% tip avoid this place at all cost!  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirtiest, filthiest, nastiest walmart I have EVEzr been to. No carts. No lid to the sanitary wipes. The isles were full of boxes, couldn't get through the isles with the cart. There were 9 employees outside sitting on the curb, some smoking. No carts!!! Will not be back EVER!  [END]
[BEGIN] Waited for an hour even with appointment! Doctor was kind of rude and unprofessional. Never suggest this place for eye exam or prescriptions  [END]
[BEGIN] Very loud place which is shame cuz the band is nice and the place is great to dance but too loud  [END]
[BEGIN] Yuck. Dough was too sweet, sauce was too sweet. We got a pepperoni and black olive pie, and the only good part was the pepperoni. Not good.  [END]
[BEGIN] All I can say is a smile goes along way, I think the bartender was Caitlin. Look a bit more excited on game day girl  [END]
[BEGIN] Slow to seat (despite ample seating available) Slow to serve (despite not being very busy). A poorly managed restaurant. There are better options in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their name should be 3 month blinds. They first didn't properly measure my windows and after ordering and reordering my blinds they're still not installed. Given the cost, you'll be far better off ordering window treatments online and hiring someone independent to install them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Disgusting food! The pork dumplings and the fried chicken were terrible. The ribs and the rice were pretty good though. The mai tai was ok. It is so expensive here don't waste your money. It was my last night in Boston and I was disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst McDonald's on the planet. By far the slowest service and worst experience everytime I go no matter what time of the day it is. I have literally fallen asleep in the drive thru waiting on food before. HORRIBLEEEEEEEE get your shit together for real.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst pad Thai of my life. Gross gross gross.Worst pad Thai of my life. Gross gross gross.Worst pad Thai of my life. Gross gross gross.Worst pad Thai of my life. Gross gross gross.Worst pad Thai of my life. Gross gross gross.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ruined post-May 2011. Once a dive with character is now nothing more than another crappy Allston bar. The awkward silence in there wasn't even worth a full beer, which I drank as quickly as possible before leaving. Basically an atrocity  [END]
[BEGIN] Long term customer - 90 minutes and no food. 'Steve' claims to be the manager then admits he's not had no explanation why we don't have food at 9:35 pm. 8:02 order, 30-45 min delivery, 9:35 no food, canceled order.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible customer service. Employees behave like indentured servants. "Uniforms unkempt" would be complimentary. Machines in poor repair. Went to 8 redemption machines before I got one that worked. Low expectations for food were not even half met. Toy prize fell apart within seconds of opening. Boo...  [END]
[BEGIN] Bartender today was a complete jerk. He was so arrogant and rude I will not return. The girl working yesterday was lovely but this guy was super rude. Ugh. I used to love this place....  [END]
[BEGIN] Who knew you could wait 45 minutes at lunch in an empty bar for a hotdog and 12 oysters on the half shell. We left before the food arrived, avoid if you don't have an hour to wait!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] If I had a choice this place would have zero stars!! The food is so awful and so bland. It is way overpriced for what you get and not even worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Old, dirty and run down. Plastic covers on mattress-and still paid $94 after fees and taxes. Stay anywhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Place smelled like ding dong. Never coming back here. I told the cashier to have a good day on my way out and she completely ignored me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff regularly not at the front desk and when they do finally come to check you in they are more often than not very grumpy. Clean facility, expensive and very unfriendly employees.  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely disappointing. This was our 4th time there and it seems to get worse each time. We're done.....no more twilight for us. This place is in serious need of adult supervision!!!! The food is good for the most part, but the service is terrible!  [END]
[BEGIN] Avoid this Starbucks location at all costs! This is a franchise Marriott unit, but the line was insanely long. The staff does not seem to care about customer satisfaction at all. Stay away unless you want to wait more than 40 minutes for your morning brew!  [END]
[BEGIN] There were maybe 8 tables in the restaurant, yet the waitress was too busy talking to her buddies to assist us. Food was horrible! My daughters honey bbq wing sauce tasted spoiled, and the Thai curry sauce was sour, not sweet as the menu synopsis stated. Yuck!  [END]
[BEGIN] Disgusting! I went 12/20/2016 and paid 13.00 for food that I waited forever for. The rice was not fully cooked. Shrimp was raw in spots and steak was so over cooked. I wouldn't feed that to my dog! Needless to say I won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got dinner here General tso with fried rice This place seemed good Till my brother throw up all his food! Gross  [END]
[BEGIN] This place sucks. And a gross girl with the nasty arm tattoo is rude. Yelling at me because she "called me for my sweet potato fries three times" I was seated outside.... really dumb crew with overpriced crap food taste like spiced old meat from torchys down the road.  [END]
[BEGIN] I know somebody who was a waitress at another Applebee's and she confirmed that their food (at all locations) is FROZEN. AND MICROWAVED. The bread that they give you with your meal is that Texas Toast that you buy in the frozen section of the grocery store. C'MON!  [END]
[BEGIN] Showed up here during hours and the place is closed. If they are no longer operating they should update their website to say so.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is THE WORST! The rooms are dingy and old. It needs to be renovated ASAP...The rooms smell disgusting. The lighting is Sooo dim! This is one place I would never come back to. Yuck!  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely not what I expected (from the show). They only have cupcakes and cookies. And a few pathetic looking cakes. Service is standard Mall service and people there "just doing their job" Not overly friendly. I walked out  [END]
[BEGIN] Would love to say this is urgent care. I would rather go to an ER. WHO WANTS TO WAIT OVER 2 hours to see a doctor about swimmers ear????  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered a hot grass jelly milk tea , Luke warm drink with few piece of grass jelly doesn't worth to paid $4.75 , I won't come and recomanded here  [END]
[BEGIN] Not upset just disappointed. We waited over an hour for rolls and a few apps. The fish and soy sauce had little flavor and the rolls were very very small. Left hungry and sad :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Four attempts to contact over the period of a month. 3 calls, 1 email. No response, ever. Seriously?  [END]
[BEGIN] Skip this place! Worst manicure experience ever! On top of that I paid $50 for the worst gel manicure I have ever had. This place is tiny and Loud, no relaxation! The lady who rushed through my manicure, coughed on me and was shouting The entire time.  [END]
[BEGIN] The music does not stop until at least 2am and is obnoxious which is crazy as right next door Torched Hop which seems to be a more respectful to its neighbors .. this club is ridiculous w bums sleeping outside daily...  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service, food, and wait times. Management at it's worst is the definition here, the head manager here did NOT care for the customer and maintains a dirty and slow work environment.  [END]
[BEGIN] This restaurants need not represent Jamaica or Caribbean, and refrain from using both terms in their company This food is nasty  [END]
[BEGIN] Menu and food quality was changed and is getting worse, poor service quality, servers are not friendly and no experience enough to work there Very upsetting  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a dump, complete pompous rudeness and inflated prices. The menu claims to be Canadian culture, but is far from it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn't get a chance to use his services, he didn't show up for the estimate. no call or anything. If they are like this in the beginning I'm glad I didn't hire them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got two sandwiches the pork and the pulled chicken. Pulled pork was ok but the the pulled chicken is terrible! It is so bad that it makes the the whole experience 1 star. Don't get the chicken.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bleh. Yes it's fried chicken but not very great. Generic flavor and really no seasoning on the outside. If your going to be unhealthy at least have a product with good flavor. I would take Publix, KFC, or Popeyes fried chicken over this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] ugly don't name your drinks after immigrants! typical tone deaf portland. and choose better beers!  [END]
[BEGIN] The owner can keep his house and his rules. You would be a fool to eat the garbage they call food. It's a joke and a sorry excuse for a restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went to print shop area to print and bind materials. Service was poor and attendant made no effort to accommodate simple requests. Once is enough for me to never go back. Found a motivated local printer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unprofessional, disorganized, got the wrong tacos and they blamed me for getting it wrong  [END]
[BEGIN] I order a drink and could not finish it and I ask the server to pack my drink for to go, 5 mins later that server hand me a styrofoam box.  [END]
[BEGIN] In this circus of a dealership, they will waste your time, never follow up, hold your keys hostage if you've got a trade in... a very unpleasant place to do business.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered takeout on Grubhub. Never got any updates from the restaurant. Called the restaurant before closing 30 minutes after estimated delivery time and no answer. Food was never delivered. Enough said.  [END]
[BEGIN] So let down. Food totally missed the mark - which unfortunately has been a theme. Cool place; but the food was also cool-no, cold. Time to move on...  [END]
[BEGIN] Please dear god clean your draft lines and stop washing beer glasses with dawn. Mixed drinks or bottled beer if you come here  [END]
[BEGIN] So sick of this place, and after getting ripped off again on developing film I had to give them a bad review.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not much to say, over-priced, under-sized. Broth not hot enough, will not go back. Need to find more food after eating there, is it a good thing MacDonalds is just across the street?  [END]
[BEGIN] They suck!! They had me waiting for 8 hours to receive a tow!! They need to lean how to communicate & be responsible!  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived 20 min after they were supposed to open. No one bothered to show up for work I guess.  [END]
[BEGIN] Showed up a 10. Left at 10:25 as no one showed up ! Gas station guy next door said they seems to show up when they want. I will take my business elsewhere where they are open when they say they are!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like a pet friendly reastaurant, don't go here. You walk forever to the bottom of the low lake to be confronted with a sign that says "no dogs, even service dogs. And don't ask." Save your gas!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok, so I ordered fried ravioli, they came un-batterer, confusing right and well not what I ordered. Also, I ordered stuffed shells, so it comes with garlic bread right...or so I thought, I got just cold plain bread. I wouldn't order here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] My meal was missing multiple ingredients. It was supposed to have carrots - no carrots. It was supposed to be a ground pork sauce - instead it was a few giant hunks of pork fat. The noodles were cold and straight from a package. This place is awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately I cannot give Baraonda a great review. The service was horrible! From the time we entered the door, to the hostess to the bar. The staff was rude! We even asked for the manager who had the same attitude.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mr. Donair is officially CLOSED as of December 1st 2012.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered fried chicken dinner. And it came to my house with 3 pieces of chicken on top a bed of fries. I'll stick to kfc next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst food... Ordered Ghobi Manchuria which is half cooked and order chili chicken Appetizer which turned out to be a chicken curry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a professional atmosphere at all! The salon itself is beautiful but the customer service sucks. Take my tip and go elsewhere!  [END]
[BEGIN] DONT go here! I hate poor service an food!! The fountain coke was DELICIOUS! The fried rice,chicken broth soup,steak and chicken was not good. Never going in there again. :((  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is TERRIBLE. If you're thinking about moving here DON'T. I can't wait till my lease is up so I can get the heck out of here. Ever since the complex was purchased by another company everything has gone downhill, and on top of it management is horrific.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've gone back a couple of times and the staff just keeps getting more rude every time. Too many other places in the area with the same kind of food to be treated rudely. I will NOT be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst burger ever!!! We had the primetime, eldiablo and truffle fries. The food is not as expected and the experience is horrible by all means. I really don't know why people stay in long queues.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is our favourite ramen house,eventhough always busy willing to wait just to eat here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst food quality and service....Found dead bug in the food..Be aware it seems they dont keep kitchen clean and food is not at all fresh...!!!! Please check your CCTV for September 7th around 10pm!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] WORST TACOS EVER. I order the steak tacos today and it consisted of 1 cup of cabbage per taco, and a tiny bit of steak. nothing else. what a waste of money !!!  [END]
[BEGIN] My review below still stands but their HR department did reach out to me for this. According to them, the issue was discussed but they were not able to tell me what conclusion they came to. I appreciate Jan's reaching out but nothing felt resolved on my end.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was so excited to go here. The games are great but the service was terrible. The drink menu looked good but I didn't have the chance to try the drinks because no one came to serve me. There are better arcade bars in Orlando with better service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered off foodler. They cancelled it because I'm to far away (four miles) I asked them to confirm my address because I've already ordered once before no problem. The lady on the phone refuses. I guess 2.14 miles is not worth their business. Overall rude customer service and useless...  [END]
[BEGIN] Sorry Charles Street Market. You are getting demoted to one star. Why, you ask? Because your baked goods are always stale and your cashiers don't seem to care. Fix it, plz.  [END]
[BEGIN] Out of 10 buffet bars to choose food from, including a double sided sushi bar & hibachi grill, my favorite item was tapioca pudding & I don't even like tapioca pudding. My dining partner's comment: "I will eat Del Taco before I ever eat this again".  [END]
[BEGIN] Their beignets shouldn't be called beignets! It was literally a powdered donut that had a hint of lemon to it. Gross  [END]
[BEGIN] The one in Saugus on route one is horrible As a Latino I am used to real food; this includes Mexican,  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst lazer tag ever. Put way too many rules and certain ways to lose points making it too complicated. I recommend lazer quest in San Antonio much more..... Got two games and didn't even go to 2nd game it was so shitty  [END]
[BEGIN] Made an appointment, I had a Groupon. Then never heard from them again! I even tried to confirm the appt. No answer.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a Groupon so the price was right for a pedicure & gel manicure; however you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, my fingers & toes still hurt after 6 days! She cut me several times while doing my cuticles. I will not go to this place again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Go to Starbucks if you want a "decent" expresso, notice the quotes for decent, went inside thinking I could get a good expresso reminiscing Italy, but was served an awful expresso. Save yourself from the trouble and go somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Is this business, still in business? I've called and left a message twice and they don't call back.  [END]
[BEGIN] it was awful. terrible. horrific. bad management. bad service. food- ok. drinks- puke. if you like your margaritas to taste like lime kool-aid with battery acid, then this place is for you. this is a mexican restaurant, get your margaritas right.  [END]
[BEGIN] I flew AA after a long hiatus. Hostile staff, terrible planes abysmal seats. Goes to show you how bad an airline can be. Boston needs a better carrier  [END]
[BEGIN] Never again. We picked up a suit after 4 days. We realized once we got home that it had not been cleaned up... Same smell, same stain. And of course we paid for it. Please don't go. If you do make sure you check everything at pick up.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly enough staff and a wide variety of toppings, but I found the yogurt subpar and definitely not creative flavor wise. I've had far, far better. I wouldn't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] This group has plastered their marketing stickers all over public property in NW Austin. Shameful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seriously, save your money. Store bought tortillas, chewy fajitas, tamales are bland. Sorry, but this is pretty bad food. My son got the burger and that wasn't bad, that should tell you a lot... Sorry, truth hurts.  [END]
[BEGIN] Aweful Aweful Aweful service!!!! Rude hostess, she was dismissive and didn't care for our business so we went elsewhere. Band sound great while I was there waiting on hostess for short period..  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is overhyped. Yea the smoke is cool and all but it takes out all of the flavor of the cereal. It tasted like air. Not only that, but they were stale. Also, customer service sucks. She was facetiming someone and didn't even stop when we walked up.  [END]
[BEGIN] please adjust your business hours. we were searching for an open now restaurant, found your place on yelp, walked in the rain to you and you had already closed. the times on yelp are wrong as we saw on the door  [END]
[BEGIN] Not what it used to be. Most of the food is frozen now. Food was piled up waiting to go out, but waitress was to busy on her phone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible customer service!! They are rude and not well trained, I'll spend my hard earn money some where else! I'm so upset that these people are not professional at all, very uneducated in what they are "trained" to do!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has nothing on the other eating establishments in the area. You would think that with so much potential business lunch/dinner clientele during the week, the Blue Wave would try to get things right. Your lunch break will be over before the food arrives.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sushi was terrible and the regular bbq fare high-priced. Service was barely decent and the location is without life. Strictly a one-time affair for me. Also, the noodles portion was too small. i had high hopes from the other reviews but seems like this place is more of a hit/miss.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the SECOND time that I've left this restaurant with part of my order missing. I paid for a number 2 Dinner and only received the chicken. Where is the side?? This is ridiculous and this establishment has really gone down over the past few months  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the worst ever Chinese restaurant experience in any reasonable city. Pork ribs without any trace of bones and taste just like deep fried rubbish. The shrimp also taste not fresh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was looking forward to nice yummy tater tots and a sandwich and received dry over cooked food with metal chairs. Fast food chain with a half ass attempt to draw in vegans. Ha!  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff is really rude and obnoxious. They're not attentive at all, so even if the coffee was better than average, it's not worth going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The pricing here is off the charts, the employees give out false information on the phone, or "neglect" to tell you everything; calls are not returned. I have had nothing but frustration with not only State Farm but this office. Best for you to look for another agent.  [END]
[BEGIN] I believe this is the worst food I have ever seen. I ordered a bunch of items from them and I didn't eat 10% of it. Everything was soggy, oily, tasteless, or tasting something it shouldn't.  [END]
[BEGIN] bootleg security, bad sound, and the worst crowd in a hot minute.  [END]
[BEGIN] When you see the exit for Woburn off 93-just keep driving. New Hampshire and the Internet are minutes away.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad service I will Never come back with the black lady holding the door and it is empty inside and she was putting people in front of me and I was here 1st  [END]
[BEGIN] Who doesn't include tartar sauce with a 3 piece catfish dinner? I specifically asked for it and drove all the way home only to have my whole meal ruined due to lack of condiments.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lame ride! I want the 2 hours of my life back! If the line is anything more than 45 minutes, don't bother. This 5 minute ride is mildly entertaining at most.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food court is ridiculously expensive for a food court. The food isn't even that good. Better off going to a nice Indian restaurant and spending the same (or even less) amount of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] We waited 45 minutes for our two pizzas, which cost $50. The staff was polite and gave us a bogo coupon, but It's pretty excessive to have to wait that long for pizza this expensive. Hot Lips is good but not cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] We used to LOVE this place! However, due to change of ownership I guess? They have gone WAY downhill. It's a great loss to us, and too many, many other people, I'm sure!  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm not a professional golfer, but wanted to try something new with my friends who are regular players, we had a good time but their staff weren't very friendly and mostly rude. I definitely like to learn more but won't go to this place to be treated so poorly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went there on my friend's birthday dinner, and the waiter spill the oil on my back and pretended there was nothing happen. We ask the manager came and just gave us 10% for 2 persons. He said that's all he can do, What the **** is that? Shitty service.  [END]
