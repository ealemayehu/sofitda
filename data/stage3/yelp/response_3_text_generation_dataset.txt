[BEGIN] One of my #1 places for brunch! LOVE any of their options with lobster, almost always paired with a mimosa :) Great spot for dinner too, their staff is always great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent service and delish food. Good size portions and yummy. Friendly staff and excellent service. Yummy!  [END]
[BEGIN] I gave 4 stars for food, entertainment, and drinks the service sucks like hell!!!! We paid $5 to only have to wait 30 mins for food appetizers and drinks smh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Generous portions; prompt service; hot food. Busy place even in the middle of the week suggests that the locals really like it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm very happy that I've found this place. The staff are friendly and my nails always look nice. The salon is clean and conveniently located for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a really good place for pho soup. Nice and clean and nice sized portions. It is close and convenient to the office. I come here at least once a week and have never been disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice store! Every few months my mom will take us here and we'll get craft supplies. The checkout employees are always ready to help. There is a whole aisle of stickers (my favorite part!!!). There is a huge selection of beads. This is my favorite craft store!  [END]
[BEGIN] Always stop in each season. I usually find something to buy. Not trendy clothes but comfy clothes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Classic local diner kinda place. Coffee ain't Peet's but above average trick stop blend. The pancakes rock. The huevos is my favorite. The breakfast burrito is above average and large. Main thing here is the service. Fast. Pleasant. Love it. Oh, and it's a clean joint too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good, thin, not-at-all-greasy brick oven pizzas. Good salads too (although salads are not dinner-sized).  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is dark. This place is jazzy. It's a great after-work place and a great date night place. The service is up to par, but I wish they served food!  [END]
[BEGIN] Visiting Orlando we found this place on yelp. Had a craving for wings being from Buffalo I have to say they were very very good the mahi-mahi appetizer was excellent, two-for-one drinks, final word, recommend this place great if you're in the mood for a good All-American meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have had the blessing to have eaten here a couple of times. Really good food and service (by the owner and his wife is the cook). Very pleasant dining at reasonable pricing. We are going back!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's great! I found out about it on FotoFood - Boston's Facebook page (facebook.com/pages/FotoF...) after they posted a picture of food from the restaurant. It was GREAT. The wait staff was a little slow, and one woman was rude, but overall, it was a good experience, food-wise. I'd recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] My favorite of the 3 pizzerias in Bexley. Pizza by the slice, and a nice assortment of pizza types. The staff here was extremely friendly. I will definitely revisit and try some of the different selections they offer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Reminds me of my moms Tortas growing up except the portion is much larger. Very delicious and authentic. I would certainly be returning soon!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place. Old school - reminds me somewhat of the Northend joints in Boston. Very good food and very good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is yummy. I have eaten here for brunch, lunch and dinner. My favorite meal is the migas they serve during brunch. The people watching from their over sized windows out onto Congress is very entertaining. I look forward to my next meal here.  [END]
[BEGIN] B&G is delicious. I went with my parents and got the Lobster Roll. Pretty pricy but the seafood is very fresh. Props to Barbara Lynch.  [END]
[BEGIN] The shrimp pho is FANTASTIC! My favorite pho ever! The vermicelli bowl with pork and spring rolls was delicious too, but the pho is the best. Atmosphere is a bit like a cafeteria, but the food is great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good food. Only issue is ordering food. People at restaurant seemingly avoid answering the phone to take orders. But when you get the food, it's very good  [END]
[BEGIN] I've eaten at this restaurant several times during the past two years. The food is good quality, service average. I was hassled about not leaving a tip on my last visit...which will be my last visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have pretty creative dishes that taste great and can be enjoyed in an upscaled ambiance. They also have excellent service, although that evening there was a new and unexperienced waiter who had coordination issues pouring water into our cups.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the grilled Caesar, was excellent. Staff was great and the place looks very nice, will definitely be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great chill spot to grab drinks with friends. So many options on Rainey but this place had a great vibe. Nice bartenders and good stiff drinks. A great Austin bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool little place! Smoothies were pretty good but not any better than what I can make at home. Still, I really enjoyed it during my trip to Orlando. Love the location!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great, comfortable spot with nice drinks and good food. On weekends it can get ridiculously crowded which for me, so ain't worth it. Great on Sunday evenings or mid-week, even Thursday. But I'd avoid it like the plague Fri/Sat. Nice staff, too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Casual little Italian restaurant. You can seat yourself at a table, bar or even at counter top in front of the open oven pizza stoves to watch the chefs prepare the food. The food was top notch and easy on the pocket book.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for lunch. The food was really good and tasted very fresh. Had the chicken sandwich. My only complaint was the food took a lot longer than expected. Very nice presentation, especially the tea selections.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here several times both for dine-in & takeout. Good portion and quality for its price, especially their mala pot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun, lively place with good music. Great to take visitors to, right on the water. Can be hard to hear and is always crowded, so expect to wait. Lobster with a clambake (mussels, corn, potatoes, clam chowder added to your lobster) is always a good choice...  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good quick service - everyone who was working there was quick to take a plate or bowl and replenish our drinks. The pho was as good as the next guy, same thing with the price. I primarily like them because of the great service!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a fun creative place to go for super sweet and gooey donuts. I had the captain crunch vanilla donut and it was amazing and super sweet!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. Love the teriyaki sauce they use on the rib dish! Also like the choice between white or brown rice. A nice go to for lunch in downtown Vancouver.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great local spot in Southie. Large U shaped bar with attentive staff. Great food - pot pie, nachos, any special dish!  [END]
[BEGIN] Burger was a solid 4. Service was a 10!! Emiani and Alex were outstanding!! Greeted me at the door and continued from there. Never waited for anything. Definitely recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely selection of traditional Spanish tapas. Great menu to order multiple items and for sharing. Nice wine list. Laid back atmosphere. Certainly worth the visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're in the mood for some papusas this place will meet expectations. Good. Affordable. Great place to meet up with a group of friends for drinks and filling food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bring your dog! They have a dog menu, so cute! A clean and well lit restaurant with a huge selection of breakfast foods. Cute chicken decor all around. Staff was friendly and provided great service. Lots of business people on a Friday morning.  [END]
[BEGIN] everything in one place. My husband loves Demi-Sec champagne. It's hard to find. But Kappy's always has it. Along with anything we are looking for and some other things that are much more rare. What DSW is to shoes, this place is to alcohol.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just back from taking a group of 21 for a lunch. Service and food were excellent. We got charged a 17% service fee for group which they clearly explained ahead of time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great breakfast place with quality ingredients. The San Antonio Skillet was great. Another person had the eggs and pancakes. That was a great choice! I would like try brunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] The new S&S in Roslindale is sooo much better than the old one that was replaced. It feels good to have a nice place to shop in your community. Although this S&S is not a Super S&S, they do have a bakery, and a decent deli.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered to go and picked up for my family while on vacation. Excellent chinese food the fried rice was super soft and very tasty. Lo mien, and hunnan beef both terrific as well. I'm not even much of a Chinese food fan but I enjoyed this.  [END]
[BEGIN] Why not. The waiter/bartender was super friendly. The food was okay, but really cheap! Scorpion bowl and platter of fried food should be something you'd crave for. Their $1 happy hour menu was good too.  [END]
[BEGIN] New takes on classic comfort foods that were well executed, particularly the mac and cheese. Minor criticism is limited beer selection and more of note, noise that can at times be deafening and make it impossible to speak with your dinner party.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good sandwiches and usually quick. Solid spot for lunch although they can get busy so I usually just call my order in ahead of time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hit or miss on the food selection but overall pretty good. The servers are SO friendly here. And for the amount of food I usually eat, it's worth the price. Come hungry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Some of the best burgers you will eat period. Only knock on any of their locations is the seating. Great food, service and speed  [END]
[BEGIN] After having breakfast at some of the top rated breakfast restaurants in Vancouve and being very disappointed, this was a pleasant surprise. Great breakfast and service.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is super close to Northeastern and has really good desserts. A huge peanut butter cup, all warm and gooey. Delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great, original food. Cool ambience. Fun location with lots to do close by. No sushi on the menu though if that's what you're looking for. I would highly recommend to any foody portlander.  [END]
[BEGIN] friendly atmosphere. live music. killer location. great prices. nice range of beers. lot of rock music and super fun place to hang around or to pub crawl.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good tasting pho, adequate portion, pleasant service, good decor. I eat pho 2 or 3 days / week at numerous establishments. I recommend this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Burgers were out but blue plate (fish-n-chips) were tasty  [END]
[BEGIN] Very unique way of dining. Delicious food! Expensive Ethiopian beer. For 3 of us with $16 meals, the bill was $120 total with a total of 7 beers.  [END]
[BEGIN] The place itself smells pretty funky, but the portions and taste from what I've tried so far is very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location of this awesome sandwich chain.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has great sushi! So I give them a 4. They have recently moved to a new location, and no longer offer half off sushi on sundays....total disappointment Nevertheless the new location is beautiful, more attentive servers...good spot for a casual date night  [END]
[BEGIN] Well kept, open, peaceful one of the North Shores best natural places.  [END]
[BEGIN] The views are awesome. The food is good, a little pricey. Staff is great. Definitely a good local seafood restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the best Brunch.. I have ever eaten. Great food and service hands down to South Congress Cafe.. I will see you soon to explore other items.  [END]
[BEGIN] Alright service and prices. More casual and sporty compared to finding something really edgy or elegant. Pretty comfortable and decent quality. Organized and clean price and a pretty well decorated store. Nice simple or brighter colours are available  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is good. Its one of the coolest dive bars. The customers are in control of the music, so come prepared w cash to put into the machine lol. FOOD IS GREAT for a dive bar  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice and clean place to eat. Loved the atmosphere and music. Service was great and the food was the best part! I wasn't sure my kids would like it but they really loved the food!  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome atmosphere. Food is limited, but atmosphere makes up for it. Really enjoyed the hotel bar and games. Really a fun place!  [END]
[BEGIN] I go on Monday nights and sometimes on Sundays for poetry nights. Great vibe and the owner is really cool with great music. The jerk chicken is really good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice little hotel. Rooms kind of on the small side, but well taken care of and clean. Desk staff was helpful and kind. Great free breakfast and a really nice surprise of free dinners with beer and wine. Overall, I was very happy with my stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Currently awaiting my yummy nachos! If youre not ordering the nachos you should be ordering the cheddar jalepeno fries! Good service, creative appetizers, cheap drinks (even top shelf) makers mark is $5! Go! Just make sure you go in the right door, its basically unmarked haha.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to go on a warm night. Love the super chill vibe of picnic tables and live music. No food experience. Beers are cheap. People seemed pretty cool. They have bathrooms (warning if you're really tall...you will tower over the doors on the stalls). Overall fun atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Salmon tempura is soooo delicious! I also had the crab meatballs and fried cheesecake- all extremely tasteful. Drinks are strong and they offer a great variety-flirtini is my favorite. Only downfall is limited parking on the street, especially with the snow.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sushi, salad and cookies are delish. They are not rude or irritated when I have a complicated order due to my pickiness. The wait can be long so I usually order ahead for to-go.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Pho is really good! The only downside to this place is it can be quite noisy, sort of a cafeteria atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is located at German Village,which has great bratwursts and cream puffs.Servers are enthusiastic, good for both families and friends. If you want to experience authentic German culture, there is no better way than eating in a German restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great gluten-free options for the gluten-free foodie. They have a section of gluten-free dried goods and also frozen goods. Prices are fairly reasonable (or at least on par with typical gf prices). Usually they have some great discounts for gf foods.  [END]
[BEGIN] Spacious, decent parking, and good tea. The place shouts Decatur coffee shop. But not literally, cuz it's pretty quiet. It's the kinda place where people actually get work done. I do wish they had more power outlets.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time visit for us. We really enjoyed the food. Husband thought portion size was a little smaller than he's use to. But overall the food was delicious. We definitely plan on going again.  [END]
[BEGIN] My family and I have been coming here for years, and have never had a bad experience. Drinks are a little on the strong side, though. I also love that they have salsa dancing upstairs!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was delicious and service was great. Little neck clams had a little sand in them but not enough to ruin the taste. The steak tips were fantastic and cooked perfectly. Great meal at a great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I have never had a bad experience here. We love their breakfast menu and their bloody mary's are pretty tasty!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good. It's cheap. And portions are monster-sized (as in bigger than my head). I was obsessed with the tofu spring rolls and the spring noodles.  [END]
[BEGIN] Finally, a restaurant on the Drag that doesn't suck. Daito is among the best Japanese food in the city. They specialize in udon, which typically gets overlooked in the shuffle between ramen and pho offerings in town. The sushi here is well prepared and the sake options are many. Kampai!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good flavor but I like my acai bowls COLD, especially in the heat of Austin. This tasted great (I got the Chuck Norris) but was more like acai pudding. :( Fruit on top was very good & fresh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Crab Eggs Benedict Florentine... was OK could not eat potatoes way to hard and over cooked... best part were the mimosa and time with mom... breakfast for two $50... t  [END]
[BEGIN] The pan seared corvina was really good. My chanchito was pretty tasty especially the fatty pieces. Ceviche clasico was too acidic though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing special but good enough. I like another one much better in Dorchester, but hardly get to that area, so Le's is my goto place for Pho  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast food and you know your getting with Chick-fil-A  [END]
[BEGIN] Drinks were amazing, food was really good/different. Downside: pricey! (like $100/person for 5 course and some drinks) Special occasion restaurant only, but it was fabulous.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere and delicious food. Bartender lied to us about their being no happy hour or I would've given it 5 stars  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food and wonderful service. Hubby and I only tried buggers but with such an extensive menu we have many reasons to return. Wish I remembered our server's name but she was such a joy! Love when good food is accompanied by a great experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered fish and vegetables dumplings steamed 4 stars Peppercorn shrimp 5 stars Egg pancakes 4 stars Pan fried pork and shrimp dumplings 4 stars Pork soup dumplings 5 star rating Service is super friendly and fast served in 4 minutes Definitely going agai  [END]
[BEGIN] Had to give it a 4 because I grew up in Paraguay, South America and Ive been to Argentina. I really liked their empanadas. I want to try the milanesa napolitana next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this new restaurant in our neighborhood. Great food, friendly service and when the weathers nice their outdoor seating doubles the restaurants size. They bake their own bread and offer wine and beer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Having tried a number of chowders during our trip to Boston, this little Irish pub surprisingly had the best one. The music was festive and the beer cold, and isn't that all that you can really ask for from a place like this?  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there the other day and ordered a couple of Shrimp Tacos and a burrito. Real good Mexican street food. Service with a smile. I wll be back soon  [END]
[BEGIN] Plan on going after the show starts at the Fox. Then tables can be had pretty quickly. The pizzas are excellent!  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for the monday special dosas.Got the gunpowder masala dosa. It was quite good. Service is fast too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a leak in my tire and thought I needed a patch. I called ahead. They had me and out in the time they told me. They did the patch, didn't try to sell me anything, and didn't charge so I think they are great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bring your student ID for a 10% discount! A penny saved is a penny earned ;)  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing Donuts, but long lines. Its hard to improve upon their model, but if they could make the donuts slightly cheaper and shuttle people thru a little faster during rushes i would visit more often.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a poached egg on portobello mushrooms and truffle-lemon hash browns with hollandaise sauce. It was very tasty but a bit expensive. My friend had the chicken and waffles, and she thought it was alright. Tables are a bit crowded, but the place is clean and nice inside.  [END]
[BEGIN] i LOVE bluehour! everything was amazing from the foie gras to the perfectly cooked salmon to dessert! i am from california and nothing compares to bluehour. portlanders are bit harsh when it comes to yelping restaurants. :p  [END]
[BEGIN] An adult hot pocket... I love the concept. I had the Cuban and it was really good. The staff was very friendly. The owner of the establishment took my order. I'll definitely be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Tin Shed is now one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast in the US. Decent prices, good music, perfect portions, and damn delicious food. You will most definitely run into a 15 minute wait, but it is more than worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Bloody Mary is DELICIOUS!!! I had the salmon burgers with brussel sprouts. The salmon was great, a little more seasoning is needed on the brussel sprouts.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you don't order the pork empanadas you have made a terrible mistake. Great service, and some of the dishes are truly amazing. Tapas menu is awesome. Lost a star only because their cocktails aren't strong enough for my personal taste.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our favorite pho restaurant! Why? Convenient location, good pho noodles, friendly service and very decent price!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place. Could use a little more spice on the lamb but great chicken and veggies!!  [END]
[BEGIN] My fresh seafood go-to place. The best, best, best prices for crab in the Metro Area. I've been there when the coolers were being unloaded into tanks of crab FRESH from the Pacific Ocean docks that morning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice option for an upscale, semi-pretentious meal that's actually pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went during lunch hour. Quiet atmosphere. Waitress was attentive. Food portions were OK, but the steak was AMAZING. Will come back when I need my steak fix.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was quick. Staff was friendly. Food was very good. Serving sizw was definitely good portions. Food was very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome food! A quaint little trailer but worth the travel. Try the fried momo!! Be careful about the hot sauce. It is really spicy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for brunch buffet. Good food all around, and attentive wait staff. Could have done with a little more spice in some of the things but being a buffet... not bad at all. Service and decor are fantastic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Returned today. Great service & food. Sea Scallops were perfect. Goat cheesecake was delish. Expensive but in my opinion worth it as there is nothing else comparable in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Noah provided smart, personalized, and fascinating tidbits about Harvard history, culture & academics. He's also on the football team & taught us Ivy League fun facts! Noah '19 rocks!  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the better motels in the area right off of I 95 good for families convenient to the Space Center recommended. Get discount at Denny's for breakfast  [END]
[BEGIN] Luciles is awesome!! The biscuits and gravy is the best in Denver/Boulder, for sure. The service is less-than-professional, but it's college kids and a casual dining experience, so it's okay.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is excellent, the Benedicts are an amazing experience. The service was a little slow to start but still recommend it  [END]
[BEGIN] Good is consistent and this they certainly are. I noticed they do party trays also, good to know. The inside is traditional. The variety is what I truly appreciate  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was great and very affordable for late portions. Additionally our waiter was amazing, He took the time to explain the various menu items and what our options were. Def somewhere I would go again!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Brought the visiting family for a shrimp feast and everyone was happy. Delicious shrimp, chicken, crab cakes and of course the cornbread. We left there very full and extolling the virtues of Stonington's.  [END]
[BEGIN] wings was great and friendly place will def visit again... i just hate it's in a ghetto area...  [END]
[BEGIN] I am from California and though I haven't found a Mexican restaurant yet that measures up to what I'm used to this place is pretty close. Also the service is always excellent so points for that. My favorite is the Mexican pizza.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you happen to be in Wellesley (admittedly probably not a daily occurance) don't miss out on this fantastic pizza  [END]
[BEGIN] Cold cheap beer. Free range burgers and great roasted turkey sandwich. What more can you want!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is worth stop. The pizza is really good. The service is great. The owner stopped by and checked on us a few times. This is a neighborhood place with just that type of feel. The pizza crust is as thin and crispy as you could want! YUM  [END]
[BEGIN] Just went there for the first time and got a chicken gyro combo. It was delicious. Something I could eat every day. And less than $8 for the whole thing. And the menu is huge. Highly recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Ethiopian spot in ATL. Very clean which is something that is an absolute must for these types of places (eat with your hands). The food was good. I wouldn't say great though. Portions were large so I'd suggest getting some kind of combo and sharing.  [END]
[BEGIN] The prices and portions are awesome. I've dined in once, but prefer to order delivery and they always arrive quicker than the estimated time given.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty decent thai food. Not the best I've had but it definitely satisfies my cravings. Thai iced tea is pretty good from here. The portions are decent sized and the prices are just right.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of our favorite Salem restaurants nice atmosphere great deck dining and service Fun all year round  [END]
[BEGIN] I've gotten Thai food from here a few times, delivered. It was very good, that's why I continue to order. It's also pretty cheap in comparison to a lot of other Thai places in my area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yum! I always try something different and have never been disappointed! Fresh, delicious and fast. It's definitely not your traditional burrito place, so if you are a purist this may not be the place for you. Smoothies get a thumbs up too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great brunch. Solid cold brew ice coffee. Unreal smoky bacon! Walked right in no wait!  [END]
[BEGIN] We tried both their pastries and their chocolates!Hands down their chocolate is 5 star! But their pastries have a lot of room to improve!  [END]
[BEGIN] Trying to find a seat is nearly impossible but they have the best beer happy hour in town. M-F 4-8, huge draft selection, half price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great outdoor bar...cute staff and even better cocktails make the landing my favorite bar in Boston! And, they even take credit cards!!! Trust me, you will not be disapponted.  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably one of my favorite places, I loved the brunch so so good, the service was really good too, their bloody Mary's- amazing :) I had the Brie sandwich and means my friends shared the dynamite roll and the ahi poke as appetizers and it was delish! Highly recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a great neighborhood spot. Truly good Thai food. Imagine my delight when I found out that now they deliver. Yay! My favorites are their tom ka kai -- heavenly soup -- and their green curry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ate here tonight and the food was great! I had the bean curd and shredded pork and my dad had the beef with mushrooms and bamboo shoots. Would totally go back again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was great and service was good. They're still getting things settled with their alcohol supply but they have ~90% of the beer / wine on their menu. They have all the classic tapas and the kale salad is tops.  [END]
[BEGIN] Blue Fin is a great sushi place. It's reasonably priced and has great sushi. It was a bit crowded when we went and there was a 20-minute wait, but it was worth it. Lots of other shops to peruse while you're waiting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Local Portland Brewery Stopped in for a brew on the way to somewhere else, was tasty, left and returned to have another the same night!  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm pregnant so I cannot speak to their drinks (soooooon!) but I really enjoyed my salad and 2 - yeah I had two! - doughnuts. I took home leftover yums and my husband was delighted. Very fun and indulgent concept.  [END]
[BEGIN] Brit Night on Thursdays is when I like to bring myself, and my inner MOD to The Cellar. Ok, so the medieval-like interior is better suited to a goth party, but whatev. Still fun, and that's all the counts. Drinks are cheap too.  [END]
[BEGIN] cool place for college students i had a fun time  [END]
[BEGIN] Great variety of cupcakes, and they have frosting shots! Very cute shop too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Woah so good. Would eat this food every day...and we kinda have this week! Service is a little slow but the music videos in the corner tv keep ya entertained :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Rasberry Rosemary and Poppy seed Lemon are the best ones out of all the ones i tried!  [END]
[BEGIN] I came here a long time ago with some friends from work. The place is small but quaint! Live music is AWESOME and the drinks are good! What more can you ask for?!  [END]
[BEGIN] Super nice, great deal, fresh, etc only complaint? one of the four people chatting behind the counter when it's was slow, should clean the tables and floor..place was a bit dirty  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the Papis Sandwich with black beans and rice ... Very good! My Bae had the Same with the Manduros (sweet Plantains) ..she gives it a 4.5 & I give the same ... And my fish bowl blue curaçao was on Point! I will be back  [END]
[BEGIN] Pie! Open late til 11:30. 3 chocolate creme pie was rich, crust flaky, and huge portion! Fun place to get dessert  [END]
[BEGIN] best service ever. 5 star for sushi and soup but some dishes doesn't taste as good as it should. Well, still my place for sushi  [END]
[BEGIN] Fuel has the all-time best fruit and yogurt parfait! It is huge & always fresh! I ordered it on a whim one day and now it's my regular order. Coffee here is definitely good, but have to give Fuel overall four stars just for being a tad bit pricey  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was good overall, had the fried chicken tenders, mac and cheese and beans, the beans were way too sweet for my liking but overall a decent meal with good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great donuts! We LOVED the apple cider fritter, and we also liked the Dulce de Leche & Hazelnut donut as well as the Valrhona Chocolate Crunch. Fast, friendly service and reasonable prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is so good I would give a five but service horrible. I arrived early. Waiter was chatting with others took 10 minutes to take drink order. No one else in the place. Sloooooow service entire meal. Fix your servers!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] From NC, we had a day to kill in Vancouver and asked a random local what she suggested after spending some time at Lynn Canyon. Great, hip place with very attentive service... super nice people. We really enjoyed our lunch here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very busy! But the food was amazing! One of th best eggs Bennies in Vancouver! I love how they do the hash browns with lemon juice and truffle oil! Big fan!  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good desserts, but probably need more chairs than tables since many of the customers can find tables but not seats. Heat lamps outside  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a great experience at Minero! The service was a little slow, but the place was PACKED when I went. The salsa trio with housemade chips was fantastic! My wedge salad was pretty great too. I'll definitely be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service. Also offers a 10% discount to students.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food here is epic. I also love the half portions if dinner entrees. Dessert was underwhelming, but I would order anything sauced on the menu and prepare to be wowed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious sushi, but a bit overprice because portions are quite small. Very very good though, worth going. The place is extremely small so get there early or be ready to wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] We got the honey cinnamon latte which was not very good, but the expresso con panna (whipped cream) was delicious. Service was friendly and prompt, and the ambiance is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here with a party of seven and ordered tons of dishes. The tandoori prawns were spicy and flavorful and the curries (Methi Chicken, Paneer, and Bhuna lamb) met my spice level (hot and flavorful). The only thing lacking was service but other than that, I recommended it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quintessential Portland beer shop. One of the best selections in town. The staff tends to exude a pompous I-cant-be-bothered-by-your-trivial-inquiries kind of attitude, but if you can overlook that aspect, then this place is worth a visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place just got revamped this year with a much spacious second floor. It gets crowded really quickly with many Harvard students attempting to do work there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Geez after reading the past few reviews I am a little scared to say that I like their chinese food! haha and since I am a kid at heart they have really good Shirley Temples. I havent been in a few months so maybe it has changed?  [END]
[BEGIN] Always stay here when I'm in Boston for business. Nice rooms. Decent internet speeds. Unless you want a nice dinner there is nothing to eat on this side of town after 6.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got the Shakin' Jamaican cold brew (unsweetened, with milk), and it was good! Perfect for a hot day.  [END]
[BEGIN] We ordered delivery and everything came as expected and on time. My boyfriend got Ravioli di Aragosta and I got Pollo Farcito, both very yummy! Our meals were a good portion and it came with yummy bread. Definitely would order from here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really cool ambience in a renovated train station. Service was a little spotty but our waitress apologized for it afterwards as she WAS slammed by a number of tables at once.  [END]
[BEGIN] Interesting drink/cocktail choices that rotate. Their pour over was good. The space itself is also very nice, good for relaxing or studying.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yum yum! Lovely fresh seafood. However, been here a few times and service is spotty. When service is good, this is an amazing restaurant. When it is poor service, I wish I had never come. But the food is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is good. Food is okay. I did not like rice here, feels too sticky for me. Noodles are gone. Vegetarians be careful with what you eat, o found myself s piece of meat from others selection in my bowl once.  [END]
[BEGIN] Huge portion sizes here, you may want to share a few entrees amongst friends. Casual dining experience with friendly and informative staff. Try the Vietnamese coffee, it's a fun interactive experience! Our food was yummy and rather inexpensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went here through a groupon and got a body scrub and facial. The body scrub was so-so, but I have to say this was one of the most amazing facials I've ever gotten, my skin was absolutely glowing afterward. I would definitely go back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Owner/Exec Chef Ron is AWESOME! A truly down to Earth guy who tries to serve the freshest, tastiest food every day. They support local and sustainable food. This place also has an EXCELLENT drink menu. Try it for Sunday Brunch...but get there early, they get packed!  [END]
[BEGIN] The queso is the best I've had in Austin and their margaritas are really good too! I'll definitely be back again soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little pricey, but the food was excellent. The salad bar/buffet was higher quality. All of the meats were delicious. The best were the crispy lamb chops!  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome food at cheap prices in a good setting and a nice way of serving!  [END]
[BEGIN] Best prices for emissions test w/o skimping on service. Wait was a bit long, but papi who did my car was funny and very nice. I brought my other car the the next day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Surprisingly good For a theme park fast food joint, they have very tasty food, we recommend it on your visit to Universal Orlando  [END]
[BEGIN] Breezy helped us with our order and made recommendations, which was very helpful as I have never thrown a large party before. There was an issue with pick up time but that issue was rectified. Would use them again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered 1 meat bbq plate. I had the pork ribs, mac and cheese, corn bread and butter corn. The ribs were delicious. The corn had too much butter.  [END]
[BEGIN] We lunch outside while at the convention center for a conference. Our server was exceptional as she wanted to meet our needs. The polenta with veges and the beet salad worked well with the fried cauliflower. Nice to have the online description match the meal! Delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food only reason I did not give 5 stars is because staff was not attentive. It was a little busy but there were plenty of seating available. Shockingly it took a half an hour with seating available.  [END]
[BEGIN] Come for the food, stay for the head. PIGS HEAD TACOS THAT IS!!! Other than that was a huge fan of the biscuits and the crudo. The meal ended with quite the tale. PIG TAIL DONUTS THAT IS. 4/5 to the Ravenous pig. 5/5 this review.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hair snobs unite! This is the best place I know of in Harvard Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice course conditions for late-October. Fairways and greens in excellent shape. Walked the round on a Friday in 3 hours. It does not get much better!  [END]
[BEGIN] The donuts are delightful, but overpriced. Be prepared to spend over $20 for half a dozen. Also, it's weird that their Mississippi location doesn't open until 9am.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic food, great prices, perfect for watching the Hawthorne weirdos walking.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super healthy Thai food that keeps me coming back. Fresh veggies and dishes that aren't dripping in sauce.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had brunch here once, and it was divine. The place is a little cramped, but you can get over that when you taste the food. I haven't eaten there any other time than brunch, so I am not an authority on anything else!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's not a complete spa experience, but I haven't had one massage therapist that I didn't feel was excellent. I talked my husband into joining after a miserable 18 month experience with Massage Envy, and he's been very happy with the massages, as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummy breakfast! Seating is a little crammed but the food was great and enviroment was fun. Would def love to come back  [END]
[BEGIN] Donuts were great. Pretty dense but delicious. There are a good amount of options that you can choose from. Pretty pricey though--about $3/donut. Not much seating in this location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Date night. Had the crazy roll with the happy hour special, hot sake, yellowtail and salmon spicy roll. Definitely coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best Mole I've ever had. Seriously. The Enchiladas Alliende are no longer on the menu, but they'll make it for ya if ya ask nicely. I like to get one mole enchilada w/ chicken and one enchilada alliende so I can double my pleasure. Their margaritas are decent too.  [END]
[BEGIN] The most authentic Italian pizza Margherita I've had in the states. Exactly like the pizza that my wife and I had at many cafes in Rome! The salads are fantastic as well with very fresh ingredients.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful building and spacious. Wish more choices for food though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thought this may be a tourist trap but was pleasantly surprised with the Happy Hour menu and the food was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely lunch spot. Quaint and quiet. I was very impressed by the lunch bill, we had a party of 6 and the bill was only $80! I was reminded of England, which was nice :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service! I really appreciated our waiter- he was attentive but not overly attentive- He let us really take time to enjoy our meal and the warmth of our environment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Found cupcake wars on the food channel. I yelped gluten free and I found the yum yum truck! Yummie!  [END]
[BEGIN] They do a good pedicure. I like a thorough exfoliation and cuticle clean up. I find a lot of other places don't do this.  [END]
[BEGIN] I drove past this place for years. I order take out a couple days ago This places pizza and buffalo wings are amazing!!! The mozzarella sticks didn't have any cheese in them  [END]
[BEGIN] My dogs loved it here! We arrived around 9:15am on a Saturday morning and there was already a line backed up for parking. Get there early! :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Interesting mix of pan Asian foods. Surprisingly, the Korean food is mediocre (I believe the owners are Korean), but I do like their Crazy Noodles (Thai).  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, solid italian with friendly, efficient service. Pizza, pasta, salad and a few appetizers. Nothing out of the ordinary but everything is fresh and well prepared for a good price  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a fuckin' Wendy's. Parking does suck, but the food is as good as it is elsewhere, and the staff remembers you - that's rare for a fast food chain.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yum! Ate here for a friend's wedding reception dinner. It was quite the feast, and we got quite the show with the flaming cheese. The service was great and the food was tasty! The restaurant has some charm to it, as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice atmosphere, good enough food with huge portions, definitely big enough for two. Our waitress was very friendly. First time I see an Asian restaurant bringing you bread before the meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little Chinese takeout place. Always quick, tasty, and friendly. I have lived near by for 6 years and the food as always been consistent. Very lucky to have a place like this nearby. I would definitely recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Uber expensive, but a great place to browse for the latest men and women fashions and quirky accessories. They have a great eye-wear shop too. Fun and modern harbor-front location. Much nicer than their old stuffy Newburry St haunt.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice casual day time bar. Great on a summer day to just kick back, grab a drink with a few buddies, and people watch all day. It's reasonably priced, good beer selection. You can't go wrong.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, but this location is usually slammed during lunch hours. Oh, and keep in mind when you're admiring how good you've been that receipt nutrition facts can be misleading. They don't count dressing, extra toppings, byo, etc. correctly.  [END]
[BEGIN] very solid corporate breakfast spot. Surprisingly good eggs Benedict dishes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great burrata ap and Meatball ap. Pizza's are solid. Atmosphere is nice good at night. A hidden treasure in the north end. Easy to walk by and not notice but worth stopping in and eating there. Enjoy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent food and great service. Had the halibut, which was soft as butter! And a healthy side of spinach and Kale. Pleasantly surprised as dining options at the hotel are limited.  [END]
[BEGIN] We came here on our last day of our vacation. The decor is very nice inside and the staff is friendly. We tried the dim sum and overall about 8-10 dishes. The quality is good and authentic but a little on the pricey side. I would come back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems like a fun place. Drinks are good, food is like any other bar food. I guess if you wanna party you come here, since it turns into a club later at night.  [END]
[BEGIN] The fish and grits was excellent! 4 stars for not offering at the bar bottomless mimosas...like seriously wtf?!? ‍. The drinks are good...bartender is on fire Atmospheric awesome....music something you can vibe to...changes from old school to trap to hip hop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lunch with fun fab service. You can create your own pizza. We had a laborer pizza and a terrific gluten free pizza.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a great breakfast here and friendly service. The waffle bar was probably my favorite. I want to go back and update this review more.  [END]
[BEGIN] The dan dan fries were amazing. I can't imagine a more perfect drunk food. The fried chicken sandwich was too big for my mouth but tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a seafood platter... scallops, crab, cod were all done up nicely. Fries were crispy. Sauces yummy. Good prices for Granville Island.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for breakfast. Chicken and waffles looked really good. But I only had the simple 2 egg breakfast which was perfectly done. No wait on a Sunday morning was a big plus too. Highly recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there tonight with the family for dinner. We ordered grilled pork chops, buttered beef, shrimp and spring rolls. We enjoyed everything and the owners went out of their way to please us. Service was great. The vietnamese coffee was exellent! I would go there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] We ordered their Greek pizza and very much enjoyed it. The ingredients tasted fresh and the service was very friendly. We will be back soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was fine, but it looked as though vampires lived there. So, in conclusion, if you like nice food more than you like being attacked by vampires, make a reservation.  [END]
[BEGIN] I go here quite frequently, and the wings are always great. They make your food when you order it, so expect a little wait (~10 min). I highly recommend the honey bourbon wings and the tator tots. Like many food carts in the area the service is friendly and personal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow! I just had their amaretto almond and it was stellar!!!! The girl at the counter must havebeen new. She was a little slow and there was a long line but it was worth the wait!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been working with this firm to process my legal documents for a few years now. They have been prompt and able to file my paperwork on time and kind to respond to my one of legal questions now and then. Good firm to work with.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for a quick and low cost lunch!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love there service......they always remember my order and my name......good memory X-SITE GRILL  [END]
[BEGIN] My previous negative review of this restaurant was intended for the Northbound Rt 1 McDonalds, not this restaurant. This restaurant seems to do a good job, and has attentive and responsible management.  [END]
[BEGIN] Traveled with my dog and it was a great experience. Fast and friendly. The flight was smooth and stewardess were very nice. I didn't have any issues flying with my pup but the $90ish fee both ways is a little high considering he's on the floor. Overall great experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] I always like this place when I want some traditional food! The xiaolongbao is amazing. However, the service could be better!  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummmmy. I've been there twice and it's been delicious both times. We had the O-Ring Shorty for appetizer, Oh WOW!!!! I had the turkey burger and was phenomenal. My kids love the gourmet cheeseburger and arctic cod fish & chips.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here a couple of times and just got delivery from them. Food has been great every time. Service has always been good as well. I think I have a new go-to Thai delivery place.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was really fresh and really flavored, healthy yummy breakfast.. But it took a while to get our checks unfortunately.  [END]
[BEGIN] The was coffee good and had a cranberry turkey sandwich. Love the outdoor seating area overlooking the lake and hear the sounds of the kids playing in the fountain next door.  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried their appetizer sampler, hummus plate, and scallops with risotto. Both appetizers were great. The scallops were good. Friendly service and very attentive.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best pancake I've ever had. We went there for brunch and we truly enjoyed. The egg sandwich as well the other sandwiches was perfect. Great cocktails.i will definitely returned.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good pizza. Not overdone. I ordered the deep dish with my own toppings that took around 20 mins. Needs 2-3 to finish. I also ordered the Sicilian cheese bread that was quite good. Not very expensive. They also serve a buffet in weekdays.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place on park ave. seated pretty quick on a Friday night with a reservation. Our server was Turkish and was attentive and pleasant. He had good recommendations for us. The pita with hummus was awesome. Nice environment. Food was good and prices were fair.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food and service are first rate. Easy to miss in a strip center but with the trip. Had guacamole and trio tacos (shredded chicken).  [END]
[BEGIN] Nutella + Burnt Marshmallows Milkshake is a must try. If your in a burger mood, try one of their different creations like the lamburger or cuban. They have some great sides and a very tentative staff. During beautiful weather, there is a nice outdoor seating area.  [END]
[BEGIN] People on here complaining too much. You getting probably around $50 worth of food for 25 bucks. Sure the place can be a bit cleaner but then you gotta pay more to eat here, and I am sure people will complain about the price increase if that was the case.  [END]
[BEGIN] Can't go wrong with a bahama mama and finishing your meal with a giant cream puff!  [END]
[BEGIN] Really cool vibe and interesting decor. Drinks and food were both very good and the prices were not outrageous. I would recommend this place for small groups as you can chat and catch up.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sausage buffet... not much else to say. Best thing and best price at this place. Great atmosphere and service every time I've visited. Always a wide selection every visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've only been here once but we were very happy with everything! The service was fast & friendly, the food was super tasty and had enough leftovers for dinner the next day. Also, the decor inside is really nice, almost feels like Cactus Club. We'll definitely be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious macaron. Great dessert and you get to take a walk if you had dinner inside the market.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great, friendly service by wonderful Japanese staff. Quiet, comfortable atmosphere with free wifi. Breakfast at a great price. Waffles are very tasty!!! Eggs are always cooked properly, coffee is tasty. My new favourite breakfast place for sure!  [END]
[BEGIN] The supreme Stromboli was one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of eating. I read this restaurant four stars only because I have yet to try the pizza. The service was fast fun and friendly. I recommend everyone try this place at least once, to see for yourself  [END]
[BEGIN] For German food and great beer, you can't beat Columbus original Schmidt's. The only reason I don't rate it a full 5 stars is due to always being bloated after eating there. For an all you can eat buffet, or great traditional German dinners, it just doesn't get any better!  [END]
[BEGIN] I would recommend. I thoroughly enjoy the bourbon and dark chocolate gelato shake. It comes in this cute glass "mason" jar. I've had it now about 4-5 times since PCM opened and it's always been a sweet delight.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been to this place a handful of time great view of the water. Delicious seafood I particularly enjoy the salmon.  [END]
[BEGIN] If I could give 4.5 I would.. Really really well priced. Nachos great. Tacos we tried (4) all tasty. Only one we didn't love was the catfish. Bit too much mayo based sauce on that one but all in all excellent and will be heading back to try more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Honey chicken is really good. Definitely recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] This car wash was horrible. Wash Service and customer service have majorly improved with the change of management! Mark (the new manager) is super!  [END]
[BEGIN] They were good. A little slow but that was my only complaint. I liked that you could kind of custom order a breakfast. Well worth going and the patio is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oh, and went back for a Panini. V. Good. The ingredients were very fresh and the finished product was not a smushed greasy mess like most Paninis. Try the turkey and sundried tomato.  [END]
[BEGIN] My second visit to Gene's, and can't wait until My next Boston trip so I can visit again. The lamb cumin noodles are exquisite. Worth the trip -- from NY!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent quality and freshly baked. A little pricey though. Brioche bread to die for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service and good food. The pretzel bites were wonderful as was the smoked pork. Definitely, stop in and enjoy a good meal and a drink!  [END]
[BEGIN] Best club in Atlanta for EDM on Friday and Saturday nights. They have great lasers and steam machines. They attract really awesome acts like Paul Van Dyke, tiesto, above and beyond and tritonal. Great food truck outside after dancing  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid place for solid food! The Staff is attentive & friendly. The place always seems busy and it shoukd be as the food is really good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious, healthy food... Reasonable prices. Killer home-made fries and barbecue. Nice micro brew list. Only negative: no AC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little brewery- had nice IPA and lagers. 3rd floor desk is awesome with fantastic view of lake and a firepit. Did not try limited food menu but it looked good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool place. The tea we had was a little odd and way too strong, but that makes me believe we have the chance of getting an espresso of some quality on our next visit. We shall see!  [END]
[BEGIN] For coffee, wifi, good atmosphere, and cozy couches, there's no better spot closer to UT. It can get a bit crowded at times, but it's well worth it. They have seating both upstairs and downstairs, and the view out the front windows is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lamb noodle soup was good, very flavorful broth and the lamb is delicious. Iv never had these kind of noodles before and they weren't really what I was expecting, but they were good.  [END]
[BEGIN] We was looking for a burger spot close to our hotel. They had very good burgers but I love their shakes.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have had Gus's Chicken at 4 locations including the original and the Austin location is on par. Nice relaxed non rushed location. Frequent stop when in Austin.  [END]
[BEGIN] It has very nice atmosphere, kind of dark and the wall was lined with wine bottles. There were plenty of seats with a few tables available outside. The service was good and the menu has a nice variety of food. All in all, it was a nice experience!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, decent prices. Definately not gourmet, but a good family style neighborhood takeout pizza and sub shop. The employees are friendly, they have a pretty good selection, and they deliver.  [END]
[BEGIN] The beef lo mein and egg rolls were to die for. Feed family of 6 for under $35 and this great for Disney World standards.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city. I love the buffet option and the Wonton soup. It's my favorite in Orlando!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Best thai food in the vicinity of Porter Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think I would order this again. However, the beef shwarma that we got was pretty dry and hard to chew. A little disappointing, but they give you a lot of food for your buck.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were very satisfied with the service and the Food, I think if they expanded the place it might loose something, I had the ribs with sides, potato salad, candied yams, Mac n cheese, string beans and cornbread. Dessert ( Butter Pound Cake ). And Peach Cobbler ( Wonderful ).  [END]
[BEGIN] Not for the faint of stomach, Republic Cafe dishes the greasy, crunchy slathered-in-that-weird-red-sauce American Chinese food that's gonna land like a ton of calories in your gut. And I don't recall any signs about no MSG. I love it. The service is pretty good, too.  [END]
[BEGIN] very delicious. the spicy okra entree is the best--not gooey. a la carte dinner menu is better than buffet lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place for cofee any time of the day  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very good option in the neighborhood. The miso soup is excellent. The shrimp shumai is "good" but not great. The sushi is generally good although the pieces of fish are quite small. The donburi bowl is very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is awesome. It is one of the best breakfast places that I've been to. I always try to come here when I am in the area...and the line can be LONG but it is well worth it! George is an awesome guy and everyone loves him!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, great service, hidden gem! We've eaten here twice and plan to return. Authentic Italian dishes at a fair price! We've ordered pizza, pasta, clamari (fried and grilled..get the fried) and have tried two of the house red wines. Delish!  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the food, glad to see that it's prepared after ordering and not just sitting in the kitchen waiting to be served! Got the lamb plate, and really decorative Turkish coffee.. Very satisfied. No better way to kill time than in a well kept family run restaurant!  [END]
[BEGIN] I've used Peace Frog twice and have been very happy with their service. My carpets always come out looking great even though I have two dogs. The technician was on time and finished promptly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great huge place to bowl and play billiard with large groups of friends. The atmosphere is awesome and it's a very clean and decorative place. Awesome place to hangout in Boston !!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped in for a late dinner. Food was great and a very impressive selection of craft beer available. Many on tap and mostly local. Definitely check this place out!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great date night location but also looks good for groups and families. Very good flavor to all of the food. Cheesecake definitely a must to get.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I tried 3 seafood and 3 vegetable dishes. Every one was delicious and different. The service was excellent. On a crowded Saturday night, however, the restaurant was very noisy, the only reason for giving only 4 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been supporting them and their competitor across Killingsworth now for several years and I still can't pick a favorite! The chille relleno burrito is my top fav and if you want to get cray order it with all the extras and smothered!  [END]
[BEGIN] Frozen ice at it's best. Great flavoring goes through to all the ice. My pick is the Black Cherry. Or the Dreamsicle with cream!  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I had our date night at Pelon's for the first time. Margaritas were great, beer selection is small. We had the queso, guacamole, shrimp tacos, and the mini tacos (pork, chicken, beef) everything was good. I'm glad we tried it!  [END]
[BEGIN] The specialty tacos are great! But, if you want an every day breakfast taco your better served to go elsewhere.PRICEY other wise!  [END]
[BEGIN] The ice cream here is undoubtedly good, but for me it's missing that wow factor that they've got at Rain or Shine. So if you're deciding between the two, I'd go to Rain or Shine instead. The reusable glass jar thing is pretty cool though. Yay environment!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ton of food for a good price. Used the scoutmob deal and got an even better price. We split the jerk chicken and chicken curry plates. Both were great. Comes with rice and beans and cabbage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as crowded as the AMC at Disney but just as expensive, nice theaters.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kick ass fish tacos. Good drinks. Water! This place is great, the view is great. Good prices. And water!  [END]
[BEGIN] What a fun place. Brilliant location. Directly on the water. Great views of the city. The food is delicious. Fresh, tasty seafood. The atmosphere is light hearted & fun.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place for chiropractic adjustments if you don't carry insurance. Call and ask how much per visit; I think it's pretty affordable. After about 4 visits I started to feel better.  [END]
[BEGIN] My new favorite nail salon.. reasonable prices and friendly staff. Everything is very clean and sanitary.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is awesome. Delivery is slower than slow though. Took over an hour. And when ordering in restaurant usually takes up to 45 minutes. Definitely call ahead and pick up.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stumbled upon this place as I was walking to the park to watch the eclipse and I'm glad I decided to eat breakfast there! The service was great - polite and attentive. The food didn't take long at all to serve.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for neighborhood meal with the Fam. We ride our bikes.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you have enough time 1.5hrs, GO!!! waiters are super friendly and it doesn't even feel like you are at the airport.  [END]
[BEGIN] I remember great times there and when knowing what to expect its a great day out with kids or family. Prices are still reasonable and parking is no problem. Go check it out.  [END]
[BEGIN] It looks cool. Normally has long lines, so go during the week. Their season pancakes are a good choice. Better for smaller groups.  [END]
[BEGIN] In search of the Holy Grail of Cafe's, I stumbled upon @neverlab simple selections and amazing flavors. Definitely one of my new spots to start my morning. Ordered the "Holy Grail and and Gluten Free Banana and Chocolate muffin. Good vibes.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is where all the Portlandians go to have their bowl of Pho! Really busy place during lunch!! Good prices and service! Pho Oregon Restaurant is where I go when I'm in the area and craving some yummy Vietnamese Broth! Anytime is a good time for Pho!!!! :D  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is pretty pricy its kinda small but all in all kids loved it. The lazer place was actually pretty cool it just needs more space where the arcade is at.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place. Great atmosphere. Great lunch specials. Great steaks. Nice big tvs around bar area  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pie. I kept expecting Tony Soprano to walk in. Authentic. Family. Local.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a pretty big mishap, however they handled the issue the best way they could and gave me a refund. Their drinks and service are usually really good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pizza, excellent cocktail selections and Frozen Custard. Not crowded and great service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good bar food at a good price. The bartenders are great. TVs everywhere. It is a really nice sports bar with a great crowd of sports fans.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wait staff is a bit slow but the food is good and my drinks were a buzz for real lol I was only in town for the day and needed a fun place to day drink for a few hours lol  [END]
[BEGIN] Veggie dumplings are so good!!! So is the almond milk bubble tea! Delivery was a bit long, so only 4 stars but otherwise great!  [END]
[BEGIN] The corn beef and hash is excellent. Great bloody Mary as well. Staff is very friendly. More of a hipster kind of vibe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped in a whim to watch Sunday Football. All the games were on, and they had the volume at the perfect level. The bartenders were super nice and attentive. Great craft beer selection. They also have a nice selection of bourbon.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best $4 you can spend is on a jr. roast beef at the Alamo in Medford Sq. If you want a snack, then enjoy this treat. It's worth every penny & more. Probably the best "cheap eats" around!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here one night......appetizer, dinner and dessert. All of it was great and the waiter gave me some club soda when a drop of food dropped on my shirt.....Great service ..wonderful food. I had lemon parm salad, seared tuna and some amazing liquid brownie.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is downright amazing!! Great service when u go in or pick up.. Just DON'T bother with delivery .not worth it. I live a block away and it takes them 2 hours each time I've done it. I still eat there, just don't get delivery!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good, fresh food. Small Place, family owned, and extremely friendly. Would recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly service, a fantastic beer selection, good hearty pub fare and a nice atmosphere. I love that they have an outside patio with a fireplace. It's an easy, go-to place if you're in the mood for all of the above.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a little farther than I like to drive but the pho is really tasty. Big bowls of tasty pho mmmmmm pho mmmmm so tasty!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is amazing!!! We went for the buffet and were not disappointed! Very reasonably priced, fresh and authentic. I can't wait to try more of their signature dishes!  [END]
[BEGIN] My experience was fantastic. Single diner at bar. No wait at prime time in summer. Nice people. Fab bartender Jim. Lasagne perfect and good size. Why complain about silly things? You are at Disney. It's magic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really do like this library. The people who work there are very helpful and knowledgeable. Different selections of books for all age groups. Also, great place to go if you need a computer to use. Have not been to an Austin library that I did not like.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing like Kelly's to cure a hungover ! My go to is grilled cheese with tomato, one of the best grilled cheeses I've ever had. Also the burgers are great too! Nothing like good solid comfort food especially when you can drive through - doesn't get much better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Large menu with large variety. Good for a neighborhood Chinese restaurant. It is very nicely decorated with a comfortable feel. I have eaten there as well as ordered take out several times and have not had a bad experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] cheap, great vegan food and it's collectively run. they have awesome anarchist events. it's the wayward cafe (in seattle) of portland.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute space and very friendly servers! They have the best quiches. Every time I get one it's delicious. Edit- I've started to order the Mexican mochas and it's soooo delicious. Quiche and Mexican mocha is my new go to combo!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is tucked away on Far West. The pastries are yummy and the place is always clean. Friendly service. I think it's a little over-priced. However, the food is good. I liked the grilled cheese. Yes, I have the palate of a 3 yr old.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had the Farmers salad, fish tacos, and cheese pizza. All were decent, not over the top but decent. The restaurant was clean and service was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] When in Columbus, check out Columbus Brewery. Great food, beers. And "Kate". Sit at the bar for Kate. She knows her stuff. Ask for the calamari. & get extra fresh jalapenos. Lightly battered, super tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun place rockabilly honky tonkish. Good ol Johnny on the box and Stubb's BBQ on the side. Love places like this. Sat outside on the patio and had some good Q. Great lunch spot out of the norm. Right across the street from El Arroyo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes, this place is best when it's hoppin' and on a sunny afternoon the patio is the target place. Right on Broadway so your friends won't miss you when they walk by! Good fast bar service. Friendly staff that seem to know everybody.  [END]
[BEGIN] Affordable french food is a rare thing in Colorado. I love this place, I just wish their lunch menu had some of my favorites from the dinner menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fabulous cut of meat in the burger and the crispy onions gave it a nice crunch! Yum... My only beef is with the bun; whether the brioche or the "skinny" bun: their usually soggy. How about a crispy whole wheat sesame kaiser Romer?  [END]
[BEGIN] Shocked by the negative reviews, been here a few times and the food is very good, I agree about the quality of the wait staff is not the best but we have always had very high quality food, best Asian food I have had in this area.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the salsa but the chips were not very great they were partial chips the chicken enchiladas were delicious but I did find a bone in there and they Baracha beans were tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] By far one of the best Mexican places I have been to. I highly recommend it, great menu and nothing greasy or odd. Give it a shot, you'll be happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love me some Fellini's Pizza. Some of the best pizza in the city. Best value For the price vs quality an quantity. Just wish they would turn the music down by half. Often hard to hold a conversation the music is so loud.  [END]
[BEGIN] Walked into the first coffee place I saw when leaving the courthouse. Got a salted caramel affogato. So good I'm almost glad I got called for jury-duty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Jamon iberico is fabulous. Food, service, atmosphere is great. So many options for paella and so thoughtfully prepared. Delicious, wish it was next door to me!!!! Come to Dallas chef Daniel.  [END]
[BEGIN] I mean it's a subway, right? This place is better than many other subways I visited. They also deliver and I love the patio seating outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Your standard Chinese place. Pretty great for the price. The main dishes come with an egg roll too which is pretty awesome ... They also delivery FREAKY FAST. I mean freaky fast. Was impressed and happy my husband and I stumbled upon this place on yelp... Especially in starving desperation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great find in Cambridge. Excellent service, and food was tasty, particularly tonight's special: bacon-wrapped meatloaf with a smoky BBQ sauce. Loved the grilled cheese sandwich with spicy tomato soup.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious! Beautiful spot! Service was great! Food was better than delicious! I think this may be a regular stop for me in my new neighborhood!  [END]
[BEGIN] Better than average Wendy's, especially since the remodel. Fast service and the guy that manages the dining room for weekday lunches is very helpful and friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice spot, quick friendly service and fresh ingredients. Trendy music and simplistic scene.  [END]
[BEGIN] Variety of choices for any meal. Great place to sit and chill. Staff were nice/helpfull and the prices were good too.  [END]
[BEGIN] food was delicious! i had haddock imperial and there was a lot of crabmeat in the stuffing. my husband had the lobster carbonara and he said it was wonderful... we will go back again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean nice place the price is a little high but your are 1.5 miles from OSU campus. Great Mexican restaurant right in front. They do have a bar and grill in the hotel. Shuttle service to activities around the Columbus area.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I have used them twice. Both times we had knowledgeable and friendly sales staff to help answer questions and work within our budget. Checkout was fast and delivery came to our home within 3 business days.  [END]
[BEGIN] Biscuits and the jam were amazing. I had the catfish and waffles and my wife had a scrambled egg biscuit thing. All was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was very friendly and gives good service. The service is better than most places. Good bar food and fairly priced for the Emory area. I would like to see them stay open later, but I guess they have to center their schedule mainly around the students.  [END]
[BEGIN] More of a place you go for the decor and ambiance than the food. Speaking of which, the food portions are small, but inexpensive---difficult to make a meal of it however.  [END]
[BEGIN] Right smack in the middle of South Station a little grilled cheese oasis. They have several varieties of breads and cheeses. Only downside is they are a tad overpriced for a simple food, but when you're sick to death of Macky d's, you'll have no problem paying a bit extra.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice amenities, always clean. Good service whenever needed, fast and efficient! The community activities organized by the office are always a nice plus!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was okay, our concierge suggested. The sushi was fresh and tasty. The only downside was I would have preferred simple rolls and not all those different combinations. I would go back but only for hot food.  [END]
[BEGIN] I give it 4 stars due to the fact that yes I agree that the taco salad is mainly lettuce and hardly any meat. Yes it is very simple ingredients nothing fancy but good taste and good prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the better Chipotle's in Austin. I got a steak burrito and it was huge! Chips and Guac were good. If you aren't down for other Chipotle's in Austin go to this one on Stassney.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great local sports-bar-esque food. You gotta eat somewhere, and they need the money!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had so much fun, meeting new friends, coloring and enjoying my new favorite coffee! Looking forward to another adult coloring event. I will defently go and bring some friends. Even thro my friends couldnt make it today I went anyways. So glad I did.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really friendly staff and the food is tasty. Everything came out fast and they've got a good variety  [END]
[BEGIN] We went there for Sat. brunch. Really good guitarist playing live. The coffee was good too. The omelets were light and nice, and the home fries not too greasy or salty. Didn't try the waffles or pancakes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious biryani options, totally justifies the word "Biryani" in the name of restaurant but not "Corner" for obvious reason. I always had biryani here and Gongura biryani is my favorite.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great stop for sushi. Don't miss the volcano scallops - delicious. Very quaint setting and wonderful service, though the bathroom kept it from 5 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] 50 cent wings on Wednesday. Big fat juicy ones none of that scrawny organic my chickens name is Timmy stuff. Delicious and the service both times has been awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Likely the friendliest staff in Atlanta. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food which rivals other local establishments like Bone Garden on taste! Definitely our new go-to Mexican restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love having this store in the area. I miss Steven, the guy who used to work there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been coming here for soup often during the winter. Teriyaki chicken also pretty decent. Can't speak for the rest of the menu  [END]
[BEGIN] It's what you expect for the price you pay for a ticket. Checked bag being free is a plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] No cover, great beer selection (only surpassed by Sunset downstairs), not too crowded, good pub grub for reasonable prices. We had a waitress who was very on top of things, and they let us throw all the tables together for our big group.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't underestimate the burger! I'm not one to promote a hamburger, but when I stopped in to grab lunch while running errands, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this burger was! Additionally, served with my favorite shoestring french fry... I left quite satiated and satisfied!  [END]
[BEGIN] Always a sure fire hit with my two teenage boys -- Max is vegan and there are PLENTY of choices -- the naan is incredible -- we especially like the kind with peas & potatoes and LOVE the appetizers ... pakoras, samosas etc !  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a great experience at this bar when I went- good music, lots of dancing, but not too crowded. Drinks are overpriced- but they are everywhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great place for Sunday brunch. The view from every table is spectacular. If seated next to the bar it can get a bit noisy depending upon the crowd.  [END]
[BEGIN] The fish tacos, pulled pork tacos, and chicken tacos was generously flavored and delightfuly satisfying. Very good price and atmosphere. Will definitely visit this place again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good brunch, something different than the norm. Poached eggs were perfectly cooked. Accommodating to menu changes/substitutions and good atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fresh pond is at the end of my block. It's a great place to take a walk/run and my neighbors walk their dogs here. The atmosphere is very peaceful and there seems to be a basketball court nearby... Nice  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place! The food and service are always exception and they have a great wine selection. The only downside is uncomfortable seating and close, crowded quarters.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sauce on the fish pontchartrain is delicious, so I think it's safe to say this is good New Orleans style restaurant food! It is a little pricey, and service was kind of...off, but I'd come back. The atmosphere was nice and intimate--good for a date night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place.loved the energy and the atmosphere. They had great sandwiches as well. The staff were very friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place. A little pricey and nothing super fancy. But great drinks and fried seafood. Lots of options. Skip the fried shrimp for the price, but the clam strips and the scallops are awesome and more reasonably priced for the amount you get.  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely a hole in the wall. It's a family owned business owners who are nice. So far I've only had their mofongo with chicken. What I love about their mofongo is how moist it is so you don't necessarily need anything to dip it in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was so good! Definitely try out. Would have given 5 stars but the "parking police" was a little strange. There was a guy that was standing in the front and would awkwardly come out and stare you down if you parked in a tow spot  [END]
[BEGIN] Outside is dated. Inside is updated and very nice. Each room has a keurig coffee maker which I thought was a nice touch. Shower was nice, beds were comfy. Has a fridge which was helpful. This hotel is in a great location and definitely has an island resort type feel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The winners: fried chicken. Just juicy enough. Just sweet enough. Beef brisket. Tender.good portion. Mussels. Steamed with a beautiful soup. We drank the soup up afterwards.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent omelette - potatoes not crispy enough for my liking - very nice coffee drink - the line outside begins to form @9 a.m. / I would eat here anytime.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love grilled cheese and this place is all grilled cheese! They have so many different options to put on your grilled cheese. I prefer cheddar, bacon, and avocado!  [END]
[BEGIN] i am a huge fan of Wahoo's. This place is really chill and has some of the best Fish Taco. Thier seasoning and sauces are excellent. I highly recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Go late at night Produce is fresh, bulk bins are full I love to wander around; people watch Lets just say the clientele is never dull  [END]
[BEGIN] What a nice surprise! Very busy during lunch, but quick service and delivery! My salad was covered in chicken and delicious--will definitely return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great historical ambiance. Paul Revere's favorite tavern, named for a hero of the Battle of Bunker Hill. The tavern is in the shadow of the monument for the Battle of Bunker Hill. Delicious spot for lunchtime tavern favorites. Would be great spot for dinner as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have always ordered their pizza for take out. This is the real deal, the pizza is heavy, loaded with cheese, so delicious. The two of us usually order two medium and have almost a whole pizza for leftover.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious food! Fast and friendly service. Beautiful outdoor dining area and some tasty coffee too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was good, but slow. Obviously understaffed on servers. The food was good - highly recommend the quattro formagi pizza as the best use of gorganzola cheese I've ever had. A little pricey for food quality, but it is in Disney.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great, clean, and bright environment. The redfish ceviche is bomb. The Gorgonzola bruschetta was super yummy! The Asian salad was a little too salty and over dressed. Definitely coming back for the bruschetta!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great quality food. Curry was very well made. Pad Thai was a little too spicy but also tasty. Pineapple rice was on point.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great servivce, food and drinks. Wait staff told us all about the different tequilas when I brought my mom for her birthday. We got the tequila flight and the snow cones Everything was amazing. Highly recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't drink wine, but love to go here to meet with friends. Good atmosphere and staff. Wonderful addition to Vancouver.  [END]
[BEGIN] The vegan pizza here is quite tasty (tons of veggies, just the right amount of daiya), though it could use a little more salt. Oh, $1 pints?! Awesome! It's neat they deliver to nearby parks too; that would be fun.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for the dine out menu, the best pig skin I've ever had, and the tuna appetizer was really fancy. The main courses were alright, nothing really impressive. Staffs were friendly and offered recommendations  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good. Not sure why it was rated so low but we were here for our anniversary and had dinner her and at Hawks. Really enjoyed dinner but someone at our table ordered the Tuna steak and it was huge. Will definitely get the tuna next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered a burger and fries, very good! Fresh fries, yum! And the burger tasted great, fresh veggies. I enjoyed it! Drive thur took a lil more time than I wanted but i was still happy with my order  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried this place for the first time and it was delicious! Natasha was excellent and knowledgeable on the menu, being my first time having ramen it was very helpful. Will definitely be coming back!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is super convenient for me because it's literally my next door neighbor! It's your typical Thai place and the food tastes pretty great and authentic. Their pad thai is my fave here. So if you live near the area, I recommend this place as your "go-to" Thai restaurant  [END]
[BEGIN] It's like having a friend who loves to make soup and sandwiches and keeps her fridge stocked with luscious goodies and who invites you over for a meal every week. You go. You always go. Just like Brown Bag. You can't help yourself, and shouldn't. Just go and enjoy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Eggplant parm is great. Buffalo tenders are pretty good and huge. Pizza is really good. Service is awesome almost every time. Great quality and service at an affordable price. Atmosphere is almost like eating at home.  [END]
[BEGIN] This store is fantastic. Excellent variety of spices for a great deal, lots of exotic tea flavors, and they make amazing chicken curry! You can't find this stuff at a regular grocery store.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really enjoyed the rolls and share plates. In particular, the Rainbow and the Boston rolls were very tasty. The sashimi was lovely and fresh. Good drink promotions to make a Saturday evening more interesting. Overall, good value for money!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place. Clean and new. Very trendy location and provides a student discount. We enjoyed the white open interior. It felt a lot like a glamorous ikea! Lol we were on a time crunch but they got us out on time. Overall a nice place!  [END]
[BEGIN] There is always a wait here, but it is worth it. Especially if you can get a seat outside in the fall/spring. I love the sandwiches here, so many options and they are all super fresh and filling. A great (somewhat) healthier alternative around the commons.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unbelievable pizza and sandwiches. Great location -- within walking distance to Commuter Rail, Pickering Wharf and touristy stuff. Pretty cheap too. Stay away from the barbeque sauce fries. I know, right?  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best sushi values in town. Our current favourites include stone rice bowl, crispy calamari roll and yellow town roll. giant sashimi portions as well :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent lunch for food court food. Diablo chicken had fresh veggies with it. A nice break from fries and sandwich. Big portions.  [END]
[BEGIN] 5 stars for the drink menu variety (fun, fruity, many to choose from) 5 stars for the outdoor seating (lots of it!) 3 stars for the food. It was good but not spectacular considering how there are so many great places to eat in the South End  [END]
[BEGIN] Small place with a great selection. Sushi was well prepared and presentation was pretty cool. We ordered the sushi boat and loved every part of it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Enjoyed the Hibachi for a quick lunch while in town. Chef and service was great and the food was cooked to order...no complaints. Better than any the Hibachi restaurants here in Dayton. Very clean which is a plus in my books!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great restaurant in Portland, Alberta Arts District. Cool neighborhood and shops. We shared two dishes as seen in the photos. Both excellent!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great new addition to town. Spicy dumpling were to die for. Wonton soup was awesome on a cold day. Fried rice was a little bland. Coming back soon, maybe tomorrow  [END]
[BEGIN] Surprise happiness. Funky and interesting neighborhood. Plenty of street parking. Good vibe inside. Very tasty coffee drinks and friendly, warm, accommodating staffers. The food looks great, though I didn't try it yet. I'll be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun hibachi style. Long wait though even with a reservation. Food was excellent. Pricing a bit high. Would recommend if you're not in a hurry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stumbled upon Posto while visiting a friend in Somerville. Surprised at how delicious the food was! The short ribs were so good that I dreamt of it for days! Even tried making it at home but it just wasn't the same! True hidden gem!  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried a "coffee soda" for the first time today - delicious. Espresso, seltzer, and simple syrup. Who knew? Going to have to check out the movie night here on Mondays!  [END]
[BEGIN] Waitress was funny and engaging and helpful. Recommended the curry seafood dish which was delicious. A really wonderful dish and a lovely authentic feeling restaurant in the middle of Animal Kingdom.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a good place for a quick decent sub and the usual suspects of fries, rings and other sandwich shop stuff, but I like my pizza with a thin crust.  [END]
[BEGIN] HAVE AGAIN: very good blue cheese. The turkey sandwich was good, but the zucchini & manchego cheese sandwich is the one to get.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tap selection is local and great. We were hoping to get sushi for lunch and did not realize that it wasn't available until after 4pm so that was a bummer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good Mexican food for not bad prices, the fajitas have great flavour and spice along with the chips and salsa, quesadillas, fries and so on. Anyone looking for good Mexican food in the area I'd suggest a visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hanging out at Browns getting drunk with my buddy. Oh yeah the have good food too. Guineas is $8 but served cold so definitely a North American establishment. I do remember getting massively wasted on their Shooter deal so check those out too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice Americanized Chinese on Buford Highway that delivers! The spicy Hunan shrimp was really good, and delivery was quick. Will definitely go in to the restaurant for the lunch special.  [END]
[BEGIN] Arguably the best late night pizza in Vancouver. Not the cheapest slice, but their signature slightly burnt extra-thin crust is always a delicious alternative to the soft and soggy options that most other pizza joints have to offer in the wee hours. Highly recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] The brisket and pork ribs at Terry Black's rival that of its sister restaurant Black's, and the mac and cheese is dreamy. Grab a booth, and enjoy a nice view of downtown Austin.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nine months after moving to Winthrop, we finally made it to Santarpio's. Love the sauce, like the crust. I was surprised to see this is actually a sit-down place with table service. Our waiter was excellent. We got here just before noon on a Saturday and walked right in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ate here twice while in Portland. Reliably good, hearty breakfast food. Lovely chorizo sausage and they were very cool with me ordering a bunch of sides, which sometimes annoys people. Great staff, who offered menu recommendations, good coffee and attentive service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prices are good and staff seems knowledgable. They always walk me through the issues on the car. Waiting area is not that great, but I would rather pay less than finance a fancy lobby.  [END]
[BEGIN] In here for dinner tonight. Had the Coast salad and some house white which was sweeter than I'd typically go for, hence 4 stars rather than 5. Food was delicious, especially the addition of grilled prawns. Service was lovely and friendly. Would eat here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wasn't expecting much in the tour but it ended up being very entertaining and informative. It lasted about 50 minutes and included a chocolate tasting. The tour guide was engaging and the information was bizarre. Look for coupons or it's $18 per person.  [END]
[BEGIN] My first visit was on last night. I loved it! Service was good. It was crowded but we were seated in a fair amount of time. I will definitely return!  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfectly fine airport hotel. Regular Bus to and from airport. No restaurant inside but a couple across the street (and liquor store open till 11). Exceptional breakfast in quality and quantity.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just went.... great place... try it!!!! Looks pretty new and great "50s" bathrooms.. Don't be worried, the hamburger rolls are not really a sweet dough-not. We all liked it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went to our third show here this weekend and really like the venue and the quality of the shows. Got last minute tickets this time and even their 'worst' seats are pretty darn good. Seats have enough room and are cushy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid new steakhouse in Atlanta. The filet was phenomenal, lobster tail well above average and the remainder of the dinner very good. Overall experience was very positive with great service, great drinks, great steak and an overall great experience. Highly recommended for a new steak house.  [END]
[BEGIN] They got a wide variety of fabrics, from cotton prints(a huge lot!!) to colorful felt, from sheer silk to warm wool - they really got a lot. And they categorize everything very neatly, so it's very easy to browse through. And yes their price is very fair.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great local place for Thai food. The staff is very nice and friendly. The restaurant is very clean and food is good with a large selection. The menu also notes what is considered gluten free.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sometimes good sometimes fair. Lately they have have been right on. Old fashion style Chinese style.  [END]
[BEGIN] Much improved service. Probably the best in years. Current manager seems to be on top of things. Takes charge, handling the lunch time orders himself. Someone even cleared my table. Happy because the service here used to be so inconsistent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here on a Sunday to grab a few drinks they have good music, yummy margaritas and they Close late ! Although it was chaotic our server was really attentive and made sure we were happy  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent brunch place, I had the Benny duo. The caprese Benny was delicious, the heirloom tomatoes were perfect. The Bella Bella was kissing something, but overall it was great. Would recommend for the people that love brunch!!  [END]
[BEGIN] We hit cravings after the Duck Walk and continued our enjoyable evening here. Creamy ice cream. Customers and booths gave off the friendly neighborhood feel. The service, well, left much to be desired, but hey, surly teenagers are part of the summer ice cream experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] I appreciate that I was treated like a queen and walked out with the best haircut I've had - Natalie is wonderful and gave me exactly what I asked for, a cut that was sassy, smart and still feminine.  [END]
[BEGIN] I LOVE GARLIC and that gives Shwarma king 4 stars. Great wraps, plates and desserts. I always go with a chicken shwarma wrap and cocktail juice (homemade!). The falafel is better at Rami's but the chicken shwarma is mUCH better here. Oh don't forget the cucumber and mint yogurt...mmmhmm.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here today with family. I had a latte which was very thick and warm on the rainy afternoon. I had an almond croissant which was delicious. I shared the pistachio sour cherry with friend and taste was gorgeous!! Nice decor and service. It was very busy though!  [END]
[BEGIN] We love this place. It's intimate, unassuming, and cozy. The service always welcoming. The wine selection is wonderful. They have a few good food items which are also very good. One of my favorite little spots in Vancouver.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here during a busy time so the wait was a little long but once we sat down and ordered the food it was great. They have breakfast/brunch and lunch items. I loved how everything was homemade (even the ketchup), and was fresh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny place, decent selection of food, reasonable prices. Nice portions, tasty food. Kind of a small dinky place, but I found it was good food and good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not your typical Mexican restaurant. I would say more Mexican inspired. I had the Adobo chicken. It was good, not great. Service is a little slow.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was uneven. Some things were great like the smoke cobia. The hen of the woods mushrooms were cooked perfectly in the black grouper main course; the fish itself was good, but not special. The Pork Porterhouse (their specialty) was dry and tough.  [END]
[BEGIN] Panlasang Pinoy! I bring my family and friends in this joint everytime they come to visit me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dr. Rozina worked on my young child after a car accident. She was quick and professional, and had a range of devices she could use for micro-adjustments for children. I would recommend her to any families.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this spot! Service is awesome,the avocado margaritas are amazing but pricey. I really enjoy the salsa but the chips could be better. BREAKAST PLATES FTW!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Same menu/owner as Umaidos in Suwanee. I went during their soft opening and the service was very good. I had the Tonkatsu ramen and it was very good, just like the one from Umaido's. They don't have the liquor license yet but I was told that we could BYOB.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was excelant , as was the sushi we ordered ! The yakatori chicken was very grisely & unpleasent I would return  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent place, may lead to a "judgemental" side while serving, depends on who is helping you!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service after I had to bring back a an avocado morning wrap as it was over heated with hard to chew wrap. They replaced it right away and friendly staffs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow! This place was awesome! The steaks, the mofongo, empanadas, rice, beans, flan.... everything was absolutely delicious! I do feel the waitress could have been a little friendlier and attentive. Had she given wow service, I would have given them 5 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] they had a choriqueso there that was delicious. for some reason people like to drink at these establishments. I could never figure out why.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious old (but not ratty) men's clothes! Last I was in there the didn't have anything sized accurately (just in S-M-L, no measurements) so finding the right fit took a while, but I've found some staples to my wardrobe there for some sweet prices. Go!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a duck breast and French cheese board. Both were good. Would have given 5 stars if there was an expresso machine. The place is also understaffed. Saw some good looking pies; if ever nearby, will try! Also, the bread was amazing!! Totally worth paying extra for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems like good rates for Auzzie currency compared to competitor. Awkward transaction but clerk was very accommodating. Nice that it's in mall & feels more secure. Will go back, if I need. Btw, there's a nominal charge per transaction.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great family place for breakfast. Long waits though. A ton of retirees most the time. Food is really good and consistent and so worth the wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hipster is a misused word Come on a night when there's a good food truck out , order the 'saison of the western ghats ' and have a good time with your friends -closet hipster (flannel from target)  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute, quaint divey bar/restaurant. Great bloody Mary's and fish dip. Loved that this place is tucked away behind boca. Great for a nice quiet, chill day or evening to chill.  [END]
[BEGIN] food was great, wine selection is great. The spinach salad is amazing. I will say it smells kinda funny in there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Um, I just realized there's a whole 'nother side to this place where some crazy dancing occurs. Yesssss...... Not to mention I came here the other night and my gin and tonic was 90% gin and 10% tonic. Another big Yesssssssssss.....  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has great toppings and the dispensers are always clean. I always get the green apple and the original. I mix in chocolate chips and nuts. It is a winner every time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Can't think of a better burrito place downtown. The lineup is what it is and it's worth the wait. On a nice day, I usually just go and sit on the seawall about 2 blocks away which makes for a pleasant experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've eaten here only twice or so and honestly can't remember if it was good/great or average. I can say that every year I come and drink the DELICIOUS PUMPKIN SPICE BEER! Just try it!!  [END]
[BEGIN] A friend recommended that I go and check this place out. The line up was daunting and long, but the food was well worth the wait. Interesting dishes and good wait staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very insteresting and great for kids! I recommend getting there early as the parking can get filled quickly. Parking costs $5. The exhibits are interactive which makes it fun for the whole family. Definitely a must do if you are in Portland!  [END]

[BEGIN] Allergy? Welcome to JP Licks! They have Vegans, Gluten free, dairy free hard ice-cream & soft serve. Fresh coffee, nice fresh pastries and delicious bday cakes. The ice cream, frappe are all great like all the others chain. The staff are friendly. Great location!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere; unique menu; awesome tasting foods, though a few are hit and miss. Takeaway the Krispy Kreme shake please. I'd go again if I feel like spending $20 for a decent burger!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean gym with better than average equipment and a friendly staff. The parking, however, leaves quite a bit to be desired. I don't live near by, but tried the gym before meeting some friends for a night out. I'd definitely come back and workout here.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just went here on a whim. The stylists are really friendly. Sam did a great job on my hair, while multitasking a pedicure and manicure.  [END]

[BEGIN] Really like this place, best Chinese food that I've had in a long time. Fast delivery too.  [END]

[BEGIN] I really love their lunch buffet here. There's a great selection and the meats are really good. I love their chicken. Super moist and tender. I love coming here for lunch when I'm in this area. Definitely check it out. You won't be disappointed.  [END]

[BEGIN] Support your local businesses! What's there to say? Been around my whole life- always reliable, meticulously clean and reasonably priced. You can get great deals if your order online for in-store pickup. One of only two delis from which I will buy sausage in town- Edelweiss is the other.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super interesting. Check out the indoor garden and make certain to see the Titian.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was good. It's a great place to work. I sat in the back and got so much done. The ambiance is nice. I parked on the street. Thanks dancing goats.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went here for the last two oil changes and have no complaints. Very convenient that I can stay inside my car while they preform the oil change. Also they are straight to the point and efficient. I appreciate the quick service and no pressure sale.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have eaten here for years at this classic Chinese American restaurant. Tonight we ordered to go - Spring Rolls and Egg Rolls, Combo Lo Mein, Vegetable Moo Shoo and Pork with Garlic Sauce. Got house made sauces on the side - no packets. We ate well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great deli style sandwich shop... was very busy but our order of 4 sandwiches didnt take long...great spot to people watch on weekends....downfall____ not sure if they have a/c... it was a bit warm inside and the can pop wasnt very cold.... besides that great place  [END]

[BEGIN] For the price of the brazillian eat all u can this place is amazing. Staff are so nice making sure u have all u need and the meat ohlalalala just great food  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a great meal at Bartaco on April 12! I took a suggestion from Southwest Airlines' magazine and had a great experience. Really unique flavors and ingredients and a cute, comfortable atmosphere. Be sure to try the wild boar or the pork belly tacos, and the CLT!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place and nice service. But most importantly, I can get northern Vietnamese dishes like cha ca la vong and bun cha hanoi without going all the way to San Jose. And that is awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] We really liked the food and the service was great. The Tandoori prawns were excellent. My only complaint was that the music was very loud which made it difficult to hear my boyfriend sitting across from me. Otherwise it was a great atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] I absolutely recommend and endorse this place. The Banh Mi are excellent made with the best mini baguettes I have ever tried... To die for, seriously.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic fried chicken sandwich (comes with mayo, pickles, and slaw, plus delicious poutine --- great atmosphere, friendly folks, good beer. Not huge and would be tough for more than 5, but will be someplace I recommend to anyone going to Boston  [END]
[BEGIN] Highly recommended for all occasions. My visit was greeted with great customer service and a highly knowledgable staff. Salads were great, drinks were fantastic, and overall the place is very comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great fried chicken. It has a nice spice, but not overbearing. Prices are reasonable and is probably the best fried chicken in a 50 mile radius. I will definitely go back. if you are from Houston... Frenchy's finally may have some competition.  [END]
[BEGIN] I only bought the blank cards and envelopes, but I like them a lot. They're $0.50 each regardless of size, but there are a variety of colors, so I like to mix and match.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prom Dinner Success The staff called to confirm the reservation on early Saturday. That was a great reassurance for me. My son and his date were very pleased with the atmosphere, location and food at Capital Grille. Happy Mom!  [END]
[BEGIN] This pizza reminds me of eating pizza in New York. Bottom line. I'll be back to try every slice they come up with. Perfect amount of sauce. Beautiful, crisp, delicate crust. Open late. No frills. Simple, quick, counter service. I'm in love.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap and delicious! A bit greasy but hey you can't beat $6 for lunch entree with rice, eggroll,soup, wonton chip with generous sweet and sour sauce on the side.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is delicious!! Very tasty and healthy. Price is a little high, but worth it! Service a little a tad slow. But I'm not in a hurry. I shall be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The people who work here don't really care hat you're here....because it's so delicious you'll cum anyway. But seriously, at least say hi.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Thai fusion place. There curries and noodle dishes were great. The Japanese items they have like sushi and yakisoba are good as well. The service is helpful, however they are busy quite often do to the good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were still jet lagged from our honeymoon in the Azores and this place really impressed me, not only because they were the only place in the area open after midnight but the pizza was fantastic! Thank you, Emilio's!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place to get the underground bar experience in yaletown. It is pretty small and gets packed. The music is hip hop/rap. They could do better with the music for sure! I loved their spinach pattys, soo tasty!  [END]
[BEGIN] great food but bad location. We tried the seafood linguini. ravioli, seabass and crab - some of the stuff can tend to be bland but great flavour overall. The live music in the background was lovely.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. Unexpected for airport. Salad was a bit salty but the trout was amazing. Good French press coffee. Server John was a true professional.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location with outdoor seating. Tasty beer and a simple steak salad made for a nice dinner out after work. Service good. Will be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little Indian place in the HEB parking lot. The food was wonderful. The service was good and the atmosphere was nice for a casual Indian place. I will definately go back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Wife had the vermicelli lovers and liked its freshness with its vegetables. I had the gang dang and the curry was tasty. If you don't have to be there right at lunch, go a little later and the wait is less.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quick service, fresh food, polite servers. Will be back!! Ordered the beef brisket hotpot, Shanghai thick noodle, Sao Ching chicken this time. Delish that is all!  [END]
[BEGIN] Prices are a high. Food ok. Beer is good. If going for craft beer alone.. you'd hit the spot. Unless your significant other doesn't like. Then there isn't much variety for them. Wait staff is friendly. Place is clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good! I got the burrito.The best part of the meal was the ranch dip. And the churro brownie was delicious!! In total I spent around $9. I don't know what people were expecting for the price point.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've had better bubble tea, but this place is a great location and has lots of options to satisfy you (including those with dietary needs). The tea itself is refreshing but not the most flavorful. Been meaning to try the mochi - so many flavors!  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I had a nice dinner at Brasserie Ten Ten. Our service was great - just the right amount of attention. I had the steak frites. While I enjoyed it, overall it was too salty for my taste. My husband had the seafood boulaibaise that he liked.  [END]
[BEGIN] Devon and Katy are amazing. My daughter and I go to Evo regularly for facials, laser hair removal and various other services. They are accommodating with appointments and close to home. They are knowledgeable and professional, I highly recommend these ladies,  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent service, wonderful eye doctor in house, very friendly while remaining professional. Glasses are pricey but that's to be expected. A very good experience here. I would return anytime I need an exam/new glasses!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good burger, loved the bun, good meat flavor, cooked perfectly. Fries and onion rings ok, nothing special. One of the better burgers in central florida. Service was very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ate at the cantonese seafood restaurant and it was really good. The portions were reasonable and the taste is like the upscale dim sum restaurants in LA. The XO sauce that they gave also complimented all the dishes!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good sushi, creative presentation. Cocktail menu was pretty interesting as well. I wouldn't say it's a good value as the plates are even smaller than what is normally implied by tapas. Sushi plates are regular size, but others are TINY. Service is pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was so tasty! Their premium bacon is to die for! The staff was very kind and helpful. They also have breakfast and lunch quinoa bowls that are great healthy and delicious options.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great services/management! Drinks were delicious and the food were spectacular, however, the only 1 bathroom were very small not meant to accommodate for everyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is great. Yummy cocktails, cheap good eats, helpful and friendly bartender. Looking forward to coming back soon!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love love love Soul Cycle. It's fun, motivating and addicting! Staff is awesome and always makes you feel welcome. The only reason it isn't 5 is because of the $$$$.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was pretty good, service was good, and the music was very relaxing (the Shins, Ray LaMontagne, etc.). Can be a little tight when you sit at the bar, but overall a good option if you're in this section of this frustrating airport.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really friendly staff, quick service, great food (for I-hop). Also probably one of the cleanest I-hop locations I have ever been to.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not in the best area of town, but once you are inside it's easy to forget. It's a nice looking place and it's great for a drink pairing. Dark lighting makes it seem more intimate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Professional and knowledgeable. Sam Lucas was the inspector. He started the inspection on time and spent a considerable amount of time reviewing his findings after the inspection. Their report is concise and easy to follow.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool space, nice products, and super friendly Alex was great. Items are a bit pricey, but not overly trendy. Classic finishes to everything, so you can feel secure that your belt will hold up for years and up to fashion snuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love hounddogs pizza. The staff are very polite and they have the biggest plate of nachos I uqve ever seen.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the place to be in Brighton if you're Irish, or just looking for a fun time with Irish folk. THey have traditional Irish food here, which is actually delicious. The patio is awesome. The beers are cheap. And of course they have Guiness on tap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Keep up the great work! Bartaco has delicious tacos and amazingly refreshing cocktails. The atmosphere that is set in this restaurant is lively and is sure to put anyone in a great mood to enjoy a meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good! Loved no. 28 (the chicken curry) and deep fried banana and ice cream. Staff are super friendly and attentive. New favourite pho place!  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice neighborhood bar. great home made pizza, beer and sandwiches. Really nice employee's. I play league pool here and really enjoy the cozy feeling.  [END]
[BEGIN] Waffle sandwiches. Yummy. Only 1 picnic table. Think of this place as food to go.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm still dreaming of that spinach/roasted garlic/olive pizza.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tasty (and cozy) brunch spot with ample parking nearby. Go hungry and try the catfish hash, fiesta eggs, or the french toast. Free coffee for those waiting for a table.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not much on atmosphere (it's a cafeteria), but try the shrimp and grits. They're great! Also, the food workers were very pleasant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Onion rings are to die for, never had better! Philly cheese steaks are good but need more sautéed onions. Staff was very friendly and bartender serves a good drink. We will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good quality of meat. Super good food. But the garlic is a bit overwhelming. I would suggest ordering without  [END]
[BEGIN] Just get the Cochinita Pibils and a watermelon-limeade and pretend like there is nowhere else to eat in Texas. You won't regret it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious and authentic! Great atmosphere and friendly service. I had the German meatloaf and it was fantastic. Next time, I'll try the buffet to try the variety of sausages.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cobs isn't quite as tasty as the bread from the bakery in Newport Village , but it beats the supermarket (with the exception of that Potato Buttermilk Bread at Save On Foods). Service is always very friendly and prompt, and my wife likes the higher fiber white bread.  [END]
[BEGIN] We visit Boulder once or twice a year, and have sampled the Pearl Street restaurants. Nothing against them, but we were looking for something new. Nice north location, wonderful staff, and interesting menu. We enjoyed our meals, and their interesting cocktail menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too many dishes to chose from...great seating outdoors, coffee or a mojito...nice place to eat and enjoy some great company!  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved it! I ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese, which was delicious and had lots of lobster meat. My wife ordered a pizza, and it was great, too! Service wasn't that great, but we were surrounded by larger groups. We'll definitely be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] good tasty Indian food. Walking distance to Harvard Square. Probably my favorite Indian food in the area. Sometimes live music. They even deliver to MIT area. Cozy and quiet for meetings. I haven't tried the buffet. Try the lamb sag!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love their rice dishes! I hope they can provide more meat for their rice dishes since they are getting mostly student customers. Always love their dumpling and sweet potatoes as 2 sides to order. They try to maintain the store clean and the service is great too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good fried chicken. The two piece is enough for one person. One star off because one of my friend's chicken was undercooked and the server was trying to explain that it was a blood vessel that popped- I beg to differ.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ever been to a bad Fudruckers? Me either! This was good and the expected service you should get here  [END]
[BEGIN] All I can say is milky Taro Bubble tea with pearls !!!!!!!! Best bubble tea joint in Vancouver hands down! This place is cash only just a reminder  [END]
[BEGIN] Jessica was a great hairstylist. She is energetic and follows directionbeautifully when cutting your hair. I definitely recommend her if you get your haircut here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Outstanding food, service and atmosphere typical for a mom-and-pop place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lattes are great here and the service is good too! Watch out for the moon creamer because even though the first few sips are delicious, it gets tiring fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everyone here is super friendly and the food and beverages are delicious. The space is clean and modern, and although it's semi-hipster, it's welcoming to everyone. I love their bagels and chai lattes. The only thing I have to dock a star for is the steep prices!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great, great margaritas and cool atmosphere, but the food was just decent for the price. Chips and guacamole were good though, so I'd just recommend this place for drinks and appetizers  [END]
[BEGIN] Took to go... Easy in and out.... Mac and cheese was alright.... Potato salad was delicious  [END]
[BEGIN] 12/29/07: great bakery for taiwanese baked treats, we picked up several buns and pastries and enjoyed them.  [END]
[BEGIN] You have to go here for taco Tuesday's. The steak tacos and the Buffalo chicken are my favorites!  [END]
[BEGIN] can you say yummy Sushi that is super fresh and not overpriced. What more can you ask for..  [END]
[BEGIN] Breakfast tacos all day! Their other tacos are good as well, but the breakfast tacos are outstanding. And filling. And cheap! Only outdoor seating which can be hard 8 months out of 12, but well worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Family friendly dining. Owned by a very friendly family of hard working people who serve with good Mexican food tucked away in a strip mall. They have a terrific happy hour and a full bar with extraordinary margaritas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing service. Wonderful ambiance. Some what costly for the quality but it's great Indian food.  [END]
[BEGIN] I continue to use enterprise for my car rentals. This location is super convenient and you've got to love the late night drop off here! Before renting here make sure to check if your employer has a discounted rate!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for you to go outside away from the tv! Perfect for place to play on your iPad or cell phone! But really the park has some really cool garden sculptures that are great for making inappropriate pictures of. For sure you need to check it out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Update to my previous review. No longer a fan of their shoyu ramen (bland). I only like their kimchee ramen!  [END]
[BEGIN] Destination donuts, breakfast bake and fresh baked cookies yum! Try the Snowville latte it's worth the extra money!  [END]
[BEGIN] These are the kinds of places that are supposed to be terrible: in a touristy mall, chintzy "Greek" font, etc., etc. ....but they have the best damn dolmades! Seriously amazing. That's the only thing I had there but, bro, they off da hizzle. Tellin you, go get em!  [END]
[BEGIN] Looking for some take out late and found this place through google Reviews were decent so took a chance Food was hot, fresh and good. Will definitely go back  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is 90% female targeted, but they also have have lots of swanky, but expensive (read $200) mens jeans.  [END]
[BEGIN] We tried 3 dishes all 3 were good. Unfortunately instead of coke we got cherry coke. I'm curry there wasn't enough meat. Over all good experience  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped here one night cause nothing else was open and it was a really good place. The wings were really good, lots of flavors to choose from and they have games you can play. Highly recommend if you're in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful very local coffeehouse with "Mother Earth" overtones. Food was very good, coffee was excellent, atmosphere great. Will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the yellow veggie curry from here!! The only thing I don't like is there's no consistency, different amounts and different veggies every order but overall delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] My go to place for XLB. Too bad the service isn't too great here, but well... I think their dumplings make up for it. Lol  [END]
[BEGIN] i find very nice clothes there on the sale rack price i am not going to mention but it is a very nice place to shop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great vibe. New spot, will come back, sucks I didn't get to use my free hookah-check in  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the location, decor, and gin bar menu. Service is great!! It's a little pricey, but worth it. It's a special place with an interesting menu and warm staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service and good selection (for beer, wine is very limited but that is to be expected at a brewery). AMAZING patio views.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great ambiance - dogs love it and they love the menu. Gets crowded on weekends for brunch usually less so during the week. Dogs eat Fred Tuesday. Enjoyed the bar menu good salads and sandwiches  [END]
[BEGIN] Great spot to get some delicious food and then walk trough this unique cemetery. Lots of history and those in the cometary could use the company!  [END]
[BEGIN] What a great atmosphere to enjoy a nice evening in the sun. All the food is great, but the hummus is better than great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great muffaletta. Very nice people.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful pub with creative Tapas. Excellent happy hour value Adult patronage. Outstanding service. I'll definitely be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their Pumpkin Chai is spot on! The music could afford to be a bit quieter but that is just a personal preference.  [END]
[BEGIN] Because it was in-between dinner and lunch, I had the Smores dessert pie and it was very sweet and delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely must come and try...no doubt...also other than their all you can eat wide variety, freshly prepared sushi is an excellent Chinese menu. Good reviews from dispatch, columbus underground and columbus alive as well as Yelp...this place is a winner...they will close to remodel in June w a liquor license  [END]
[BEGIN] Kiki got my colors right. I went from San Francisco to Portland with hesitation speaking with other colorists. I gave her my numbers and everything went great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean good Mexican food restaurant with a lively colorful decor. Lots of choices of entrees and sauces. Great location within walking distance of many Salem attractions  [END]
[BEGIN] My girls and I all ordered individual pizzas, all good. The classic, farmer's market, and meat one I believe. My daughters love this place, 2nd time to Uno but first time at this location. Service was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty yummy. Reasonable prices. Interesting dishes. The food didn't blow my mind and not as yummy as the Vietnamese food I had in Hanoi this year but pretty good. The variety of dishes and the novelty of the dishes was a definite plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wine tastings have a lot of sweet white and reds. I wish they had more dry options but overall this place is awesome for drinks, apps, and full courses. I havent had dessert just yet but that just gives me another excuse to go back :).  [END]
[BEGIN] Great sushi for North Austin. Service is a little eh but sushi itself is fresh and reasonably priced  [END]
[BEGIN] They have a fresh baked --brownie -- with ice-cream which is the booooooom  [END]
[BEGIN] The restaurant does a good job at dim sum classics, such as shrimp dumpling and shao Mai. Their curry flavored Singapore fried noodle is very unique and delicious as well. Clean dining environment and credit cards acceptance are another plus. Overall, great dining experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] neighborhood friendly place with taste exactly what you would expect. Yummy and real Italian feel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came in from out of town for a wedding and MacKenzie did my blow out. She is awesome!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good coffee, yummy breakfast tacos, long line but we got our food quickly! My first time in Austin, but I've noticed there are a lot of vegan and vegetarian options around town.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good and service was quick. Although some items are more expensive, the traditional noodles are affordable and the spices (if you ask for them) give a great flavor that complements the food nicely. Nice touch: You get tea with your order!  [END]
[BEGIN] mmm ice cream! Expensive but yummy! Really cute inside, very colorful and fun. Small kids area in back. Go to the back of the store and get in line to order your ice cream. Lots of cones & cakes selection. Lots of parking available.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best steak in Orlando (back when I ate it), all sides were fantastic. They warmly recognize birthdays/anniversaries. I wish it were not in a strip mall on SLR and the interior while "nice" isn't exactly cozy or remarkable.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is my new favorite place, those tacos are from heaven. Management are engaged music is awesome. Bathrooms were dirty though I still will be back  [END]
[BEGIN] Really nice trails, great views if you go upto Pittock Mansion. Free to walk the grounds. Great large green space in the city!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great seafood. I hate the picnic tables and always have a sore back after eating.  [END]
[BEGIN] The homemade pickles & drinks in mason jars are amazing. I also had a few good appetizers & enjoyed the music. Great wait staff with prompt service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent spot to watch the game, have some great craft beer and hang out with friends. I had great service, and the jerk chicken dish I ordered was juicy tender and tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Real good solid pizza, delivery was fast. But the caeser salad was underwhelming, didn't even have a lemon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a fantastic pie here with my son last week. Half plain half pep. This would be a standard pie on most of the east coast but here its for sure one of the better options in town. $30 for the pie, a beer, a coke and a cookie.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great theater! I brought the movie and dinner deal. The meal was ok but the theater was great. Clean leather rocking chair and the temperature in the theater was perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome! Same great taste as Boston but prices are cheaper. The dollar stretches in Peabody. Got a venti for the price if a grande. Minus the fifth star cuz there was a vagrant outside knocking on my car window for spare change. That sorta put me off  [END]
[BEGIN] I love that it's around the Buckhead area, parking is behind the shops/building (with fee). The noodles are fantastic, I love the broth, & the fresh ingredients. Yummy for my tummy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Sifrina Arapas (chicken) was very tasty. We had Yuca Fritas that were cut like French fries. A bit thin. I like them with a little more bulk to each one. Skirt steak tacos were yummy according to one member in the party. Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] If one must have breakfast at the airport, perhaps due to hangover reasons, Flying Elephants makes a pretty good breakfast burrito. I felt that their beans were, for lack of a better word, pleasingly beany (legumy?) which helped settle my stomach on a rough morning.  [END]
[BEGIN] So glad HEB opened this store with their amazing cafe near mueller! At the cafe: the ribs and brisket are very tasty. I also tried the chicken Preston pizza and it was delicious. The coffee needs work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Right next to my house, this is our go-to take out place when we're feeling lazy and wanting some good thai food! We've tried quite a bit on the menu and it's always solid! Thumbs up!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ate here on August 4th. Food was very good service was excellent price wasn't bad. Great place on a sunny summer day to get some good seafood  [END]
[BEGIN] I eat here when ever I am in the neighborhood. I just wish I lived closer. It is so difficult to find a good traditional hamburger place, but this one has stayed true to its roots. It is a blast from the past, and just wonderful.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Oregon Cherry Pie was awesome. The chai was awful. Tasted like they forgot the tea.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute and hip juice bar in a great location. Pretty big menu to choose from. Staff was friendly and engaging. Prices seemed a little high. Smoothies were yummy! Got the Pine Ango Beet Tango speciality smoothie (strawberry, mango, pineapple, beet juice, orange juice).  [END]
[BEGIN] The Steel Slider was amazing! Perfectly cooked and was one of the best tasty burgers I've had in awhile! Classic Lime Margarita tasted great as well, was a bit strong, but I like strong drinks. Great outdoor seating patio, would be an awesome place during the summertime. Highly recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] Super delicious chocolates and pastries. Their Pistachio pastry is absolutely amazing, especially with all the nuts on top. Would definitely go again to try more sweet goodies.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good haircut, clean shop, friendly service. That is what I expect from a barber shop. The price for a cut was reasonable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hands down some of the best Italian food I've ever had. Sweet potato puree with my chicken was heavenly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went on a date to the Elephant Room one Sunday. I had a pretty good time. There was a great jazz band playing. Very cool ambience and a nice staff. I will be back soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Immaculately clean, friendly staff, great food. This brings a sense of community to the growing Clermont area. The menu reflects enormous selection of breakfast items. There is coffee to go! How amazing is that?  [END]
[BEGIN] We had the chicken potstickers and pepperoni extreme flatbread pizza....delicious! I also tried the draft root beer and was quite happy with it. Great service, as well!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great selection and decent cuisine. Portion is a bit small and the lines are long. But it's usually worth the wait! Waffles are superb!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for lunch. little on the high side but the food is good. Parking is a challenge.  [END]
[BEGIN] They are typically out of everything early in the day, but if you do get there before the big rush the donuts themselves are absolutely fantastic! In terms of quality this palace beats voodoo any day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best views in ATL !!! I had floor 63 and loved it. The room is a bit small for my taste. Room service is awesome but pricey. Be aware the parking is about $20 so park in the parking nextdoor which is only $8  [END]
[BEGIN] Very unique, healthy and tasty food. The service was very good as well with the server being very helpful and answering all my questions. I would definitely go again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am always a fan of relatively new theaters and have never had a bad experience here. They also boast a digital screen, just ask them to turn the sound up a little. Great little shopping area with plenty of food options. Recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped in Fri evening, not at all busy. Staff very friendly and helpful, nice pleasant, unique interior, really tasty lamb gyro. Liked the Sangria and the happy hour pricing. The menu has only a small number of items, more lunch oriented. Will surely be a repeat customer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing to find such a gem in my backyard. Tartine was great. This place is tucked away amongst a bunch of store. Small but delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has absolutely gorgeous clothes! BUT....they're really expensive. I like to go and look at them and pretend I can by them. But seriously, around Christmas and things like that the accessories go on sale and then they can be affordable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Oviedo Marlow's Tavern is really good. Their scratch kitchen is a very nice addition to the Oviedo growth. Our 2 experiences there so far have been tasty, friendly, and very pleasant.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a huge Shaw's. It's a decent one, too, plus it has an adjacent liquor store, which is helpful. The general Shaw's plan of layouts is a bit weird to me, but aside from that, this is a good store.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere with excellent authentic Italian dishes. The sides are amazing with the main course. Great service and friendly atmosphere make it a must stop in for people that enjoy Italian.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place, modern but romantic. Good veggie selections. The arancini are not traditional but OK, the gnocchi is also not traditional but great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Usually only one waitress behind bar, two pool tables, lots of 20 inch screens where you can.t see em, and cheap drinks ONLY on Happy Hour... GETS My VOTE for best DIVE bar....! try the one North in the Domain Area TOO! Same DAMN STYLE... LOL  [END]
[BEGIN] Second best chocolate chip cookie in Boston (behind Paradise Bakery in the Prudential Center.) I prefer the fudge cookie, but you really can't miss with any of them. Better than any of the other candy stands in Quincy Market.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place to get your simple cheese pizza or pizza house Greek salad, or toasted Italian sub. Your neighborhood basic pizza place. I like it. Good Italian sub. They make it how I like it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Even though one at Polaris is closer to me. I always come here. Everything tastes better here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered 2 rolls for takeout. They were tasty, nicely portioned and the presentation was limited to the to go box , but I'll definitely come back and try other things Very friendly staff  [END]
[BEGIN] Pad Thai here was good. Very, very busy during lunch hours and on the weekends. Easily the best Thai restaurant in the area that has a ton to choose from.  [END]
[BEGIN] Saturday Brunch was great. Our party of three got three different items from the menu and all were good. My vegetarian omelette was awesome. Beverages are somewhat costly. The food was excellent!  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the Red-Headed Rita pizza. It has roasted garlic and is wonderful!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a romantic date spot, but the sushi is really good for the price. I have always had fresh sushi with top quality ingredients. The decor looks almost fast food-ish, but don't let that deter you. It is a good place to cure that sushi hankering.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best Ethiopian places in Portland, as of Feb. 2014--and I've tried most of them. Food is more authentic than at several other places, meaning they do use butter in the cooking, and they cook things long enough to let rich flavors develop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Asian food in a theme park! The ahi surely has a kick. Honey chicken was delicious. Very busy, but what do you expect? Attentive service!  [END]
[BEGIN] shocked to see some bad reviews on this place. We had GREAT meals and really good service. The beer selections were good, beers were very cold...prices are good. We have found it hard to find good places in and right around Boston U. This place is a keeper...  [END]
[BEGIN] I just finished eating at House of Kabob and was very impressed. The place is very small and kind of inset in the plaza but it is totally worth it!. The food was quick and tasty, and the owner really is very nice and conversational. Give it a try!  [END]
[BEGIN] Il Piatto is a great neighborhood Italian restaurant near my house. I've been coming here for years and never had a bad meal. I really do not understand the bad reviews. I think it's the closest in Portland to the food I ate in Northern Italy.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is true to the recipes and they make a valiant effort. The space is small, uncomfortable and hot. The Cuban coffee is spot on but the place is very basic. 4 stars just cause you actually are having Cuban food which is impossible to find in Atlanta.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice folks & nice bikes. we rented a tandem for valentine's day and they were very kind even though we had no idea what we were doing. also, excellent location to bring people who haven't biked much; it's just across the street from an easy waterfront path bike ride.  [END]
[BEGIN] It had been over 10 years since our last visit. Many choices now. Drink choice wide, everything was good. Dessert was my favorite  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place and open late. Good, fresh middle eastern food; excellent hot chocolate and espresso. Prices are reasonable, considering the location. Definitely worth a stop.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have the best soup pork dumplings in town! The service is what's expected during really busy hours.  [END]
[BEGIN] The place was awesome, the only thing I didn't like was the guy at the counter! I don't think he likes his job!!! Very unhelpful!! Guy is an ass! This happened today at around 12 to 2pm 7/14/2014. He should work at a gas station!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped by this place while walking down Soco and it was great. The place was clean and modern inside. The food was great. Service was so so but even the manager stopped by to check in on our table.  [END]
[BEGIN] A nice little shop with coffee and snacks. I was impressed with their local section particularly. A great storefront in the historic downtown.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok. While the place is modest and a little small. My opinion is that they are doing a very good job. Fresh cooked and perfectly done. And. Very tasty. I give them 4 stars!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] 4 stars solely based on the honeydew snow. It was perfect for a warm day. Great flavor and texture.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere. Been my home bar for many years. Bartenders are amazing!!!! Play pool, free on Wednesday and Sunday, play some music, enjoy some great company from the friendly regulars and sing some karaoke on Thursday through Saturday.  [END]
[BEGIN] I loved this place... Different, well priced, pretty good, and well located, but unfortunately it's closed for some reason.  [END]
[BEGIN] Large portions tasty food with quick service. Décor was cheapo Mexican, but service was fast and friendly. Good place to refuel for the parks and a lot cheaper.  [END]
[BEGIN] Me and my party sat quickly. I've eaten here before. They have delivery! All is good. 'Nuff said!  [END]
[BEGIN] This the AVEDA training salon and so it is all the benefits, yet it is less expensive. Your experience will include complimentary comforting tea or water, hand massage, scalp massage and makeup touch up.  [END]
[BEGIN] BAC is a good club. Not the high price falooting clubs like you find in Los Angeles though. But a clean club with new equipment and worth the price to stay out of the "Television" gyms like 24HR and Ballys.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there and it had great service. Food was surprising fast and good. Will be trying it out again one day. Due to personal issues I do not remember what was ordered or eaten.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent authentic Taiwanese and Chinese food. Love the lamb dishes. A bit on the salty side but that's why it pairs so well with a nice IPA.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been listening to my friends "ooh and ah" about San Francisco Coffee forever. So, this place had quite a reputation to live up to. I went. I saw. I enjoyed. Was this java worthy of the Holy Grail? No. Would I go back? Definitely!  [END]
[BEGIN] Same hooters as anywhere else, except the ladies here are SMOKIN hot. That is all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to have drinks and just mingle. New to the city so I've been a couple times alone and always make new connections.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have eaten in this restaurant 2 times. The first time I ordered from menu and that was very good but a bit pricy. The second time I went for buffet and it was not good. So eat and order from menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was everything we were expecting. Went there for lunch on a Friday and we had to wait, so expect a wait time. The Goatee burger was awesome, the heartless artichoke sandwhich was great. Definitely recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location just stones throw from TD garden , bars and restaurants every few feet not to mention super comfortable bed.newly done rooms with Upscale decor. with a little great bar in lobby. 24 hour room service and complementary loaner bicycles for touring the city  [END]
[BEGIN] This place doesn't look good but the food I had sure was good. I had the chicken (dark meat) and creamed spinach. YUM YUM! Can't say anymore about it, except that it delivered more than I expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a must try! The pork hotdogs are great. If you are in Canada you must try it. The stands are on the side of the street. They also expanded into Los Angeles (Santa Monica) as well according to the guy that served us.  [END]
[BEGIN] I always give my listings to Bayside because they are easy to deal with, thorough in checking tenant references, and have never brought me a bad tenant. They always text the existing tenant before a showing, which avoids unpleasant surprises.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came out quickly. Informative, did a good job.  [END]
[BEGIN] Surprisingly excellent Tacos!!! The place needs some maintenance for sure...But do not let that stop you to try some good tacos one of the best neighborhood taco trucks around spicy salsa. Definitely get an agua fresca friendly staff Overall I recommend it and is good to find decent Mexican food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delish, but usually really long line.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is always on point, plus you can get a meal for your furry friend. If you enjoy eating in the company of dogs, delicious food, friendly service and don't mind the sometimes 45 minute wait Tin Shed is a great option.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is wonderful The sharing tables with strangers part is a little weird but manageable. So much food. I've never been able to finish.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great juice bar that makes some really good stuff. I like the Green Energy Machine but their juices are tasty without too much filler (I am looking at you apples). Prices are reasonable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was great, the beer was cheap, the peanuts were excellent. What else could you want from your 'local' dive? Its not fancy, particularly clean or smoke free (be prepared) but I like cheap booze and unpretentious people and both can be had at The Local.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice beer. Great environment Nice people. They have different beers from evwrywhere. The environment is very joyful and fun. It is a great place to go and relax  [END]
[BEGIN] The seafood bim bim bap is good. Sushi is good and the rice cakes are great. We consistently have a good experience here. We recommend this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Corned beef hash was incredible. It came out with the top layer crispy. Eggs, home fries and bacon were excellent. Sausage was above average. Coffee was average. Toast came out dry, butter on table. Friendly prompt service and no wait on a weekday morning at 9am.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was able to get my primary coat here. Considering that I'm a little finicky with my coats, I'm happy to say I was able to find something for all seasons, something I can appreciate. I was also able to get socks here cheaply, something I always appreciate.  [END]
[BEGIN] The chicken is fried in peanut oil so it's extra crispy and light! I also appreciate the simplistic menu and old school decoration. Sounds silly, but my favorite thing there is the sweet tea.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was great. Trifongo was really terrific! Was surprised to see 15% "service charge" added and then suggested tip amounts on the receipt on the total of meal plus "service charge". Nice way to boost tips I suppose. Did not see any notice or explanation of " service charge" anywhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] just simple notary service.. six dollars, which was less than I'm used to  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped by here for a couple beers after my birthday dinner at Andina. Loved the atmosphere and the aesthetic. The view was perfect for people watching and just lovely in general. Great beer selection too. Can definitely see this becoming one of my go-to spots.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service here is phenomenal- drinks and food typical beer f what you expect in a theme park. HOWEVER, will someone please explain to me why the employees are dressed like farmers?!?this is a sports bar!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a cool new bar with great special effects. Amazing art with projections going on top of the pics, making them very disturbing...but awesome. There was a great singer there playing hits. Good vibe, quick service.great new addition to Wall Street  [END]
[BEGIN] The pork dumplings and coconut buns are delicious. Well worth the wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] A mix up on the order occurred...The manager fixed it and gave us coupons for a free meal on the house for our next visit! We did not expect that, but hey, no complaints... The place was spotless clean and busy. Well managed operation.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went here soon after it opened a few years ago. Great iced tea. That hasn't changed. I'm a tea fan, so I know what I'm yelping about in this regard. I've heard the food is pretty decent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Every thing was good but not spectacular. The only downfall was the lack of food. We enjoyed the atmosphere and playing the games.The service staff was friendly, helpfull, and knowledgeable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wide variety of brews to choose from. Oktoberfest and Boo Berry were delish. Steve and Vickie, proprietors, were knowledgable and friendly. Loved this local brewery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food and good service. Not many places to eat greek on that side of town and I would recommend this to you.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have been doing happy hour here for years. Disappointed that they added fries to the burger, But that is just me I suppose, Hard not to eat them... Happy hour wine always a good value. Pop in have snack, you won't regret.  [END]
[BEGIN] AWESOME food and ambiance!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The leech martini ROCKS! The only downside is depending which night you go, which bartender you get! I've had GREAT service, and no so great service. The only improvement I'd recommend is training/choosing the appropriate bartenders for an upper class restaurant. A+++++  [END]
[BEGIN] I loved trying out this spot! I got one of the bento boxes so I could try a little bit of everything. The sushi was great! This place has a great atmosphere and ended up being a great date spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their food is pretty good. They have both good American-style and good more authentic-style (particularly Sichuan) Chinese food. However, I don't get along with the manager's daughter, so I am afraid to go there nowadays.  [END]
[BEGIN] People working there are usually pretty friendly. Lines around lunch time are as expected and the service is usually pretty fast. I go to this location 1-2 times a week and sometimes the burrito wrapping is sub par but it usually good. Overall a above average chipotle.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had the shrimp w/lobster sauce, eggrolls, and dumplings...all were good and they provided the right amount of hot mustard on the side.  [END]
[BEGIN] Management making solid efforts to fix on site unforseen issues  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food truck. Found it while visiting Portland for the first time and loved it. Good quality food and good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly, chill, relaxed coffee shop. Good for studying, and they modify drinks and create a friendly environment. The succulents and decor really makes this place feel cozy. A great place to enjoy a drink, or get some writing/studying done.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is dark, feels kind of secretive like you've found a hidden treasure. The drinks are pricey and there's always cover ($5 usually), but the bands that perform here are always stellar, well worth the cover charge. Staff has always been friendly though over-taxed. Gets crowded fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Real quick, real quick, and then I'll be gone. Listen to everyone about the Cuban sandwich (either the traditional or not). Yelpers get it right on this one. Do yourself a flavor favor and get it because that pork is awesome opossum. Leave the tostones behind.  [END]
[BEGIN] The pork belly cubano is so decadent, you have to lean your sandwich on the edge of your tray to prevent the fat dribbling out and making the crust soggy. The shredded pork sandwich was great, too. Healthy? Uhh.. No. But worth another hour at the gym.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think it's really good. I thought the beef tendon was the best I've had in a Pho.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic selection, always incredibly clean, love taking family here for sushi. The ultimate tuna roll is dynamite!! We can't say enough about this place -freshest ingredients, happy attentive staff and reasonable prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time and loved everything including the coquito cake. Will definitely go again. It's pet friendly and that's huge for us. Food was really good, service was exceptional.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hot pot is great when you go here with it being all you can eat. But the Korean BBQ they just added is terrible. They marinate some of the meat & it's far too strong. They need to improve on it before I ever try it again  [END]
[BEGIN] Great tacos! Small menu but a very well rounded menu full of all kinds of flavors. Something for everyone! Great service and enjoyed sitting on the patio! Really enjoyed ourselves! Great place! Definitely will go again and take company!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lunch place, the pizzas are outstanding. Nice outside patio. The beer list looks good but I'm always coming from work, so I have to stare and dream. Service is a little slow, but otherwise no complaints.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a good find. Sushi is fresh and establishment is clean and well run. Has the combo and like the fact the sushi was cold. Service was good. Had a working meeting and were able to chat for a few hours. No wifi yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably the closest version of East Coast pie I've found in Columbus!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's no Peet's, but this local chain, and this store in particular in German Village, is a good cup of coffee. You can't beat the location for strolling after or before your coffee, and when in town I head straight here for good coffee without all the Coffee Table dramarama.  [END]
[BEGIN] I came here twice and every time I order the super burrito with extra beans and sour cream.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yum! The hot fudge sundae is super good. Had it with classic vanilla and candied hazelnuts, and have been thinking about it ever since. As soon as I burn off the calories I'm going right back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great ramen for a downtown location! A lot of my friends prefer this place than others. They do allow a side of cooked noodles to add in when you finish which is a great deal!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: price, location (near downtown) football game place, big screen, 2 bars, customer service, atmosphere, taste, originality of food and making it unique. Cons: Their a Chicago bears place. They can't really help that I guess.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome place to go for late night pizza. Mostly because, even if you're not intoxicated, this is still good pizza. Although, I've heard it's not authentic New York pizza... Oh well, I don't really care, it still tastes good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Outstanding pumpkin curry! The Pad See Ew was awesome and on par with our other favorite versions. Having this place be closer than our other favorite Thai place is a bonus. Outstanding, friendly service too. We'll be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Quaint, original style diner with a modern spin. Crab cakes for breakfast, robust coffee. Different take on biscuits and gravy. Attentive staff. Reasonable amount of parking in front of the store.  [END]
[BEGIN] A favorite for group meals outdoors in the summer. The things to order are the pizza and THE SANGRIA. Decent prices given Newbury St. location; and good people watching if that's your thing. Many happy memories here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good smoked chicken sandwich not to much BBQ sauce and greens and a root beer soda 10$ good deal  [END]
[BEGIN] Weekday evenings are the only nights to enjoy the loungy pillows, getting cozy with your dinner partner, under dim, cinematic lights and having a martini or cocktail of choice. Very intimate, warm and sexy. Weekends are jammed packed, still fun, but you might be a little squished.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great staff. Thirty cent wings (flavor of your choice), and two dollar drafts. Huge TVs, clean floors. 'Nuff said. If you want gourmet food and drink, keep movin'. What you see is what you get.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious and unique food!! The service and food preparation is outstanding. Make sure to make a reservation though as space is very limited. Also be prepared to pay extra for the quality. Overall I would definitely recommend for the sushi connoisseur!  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely love their garlic fish rice bowl! Won't recommend anything else - but the garlic fish rice bowl is perfect on texture and flavour - an absolute must have!  [END]
[BEGIN] A nice little brunch recently. Bloody Mary bar....yes! Try the tomatillo green juice...yumEE!! Go ahead, toss in a slice 'o bacon...mmm, good. We enjoyed the Serrano ham benedict & the thoroughly fantastical Salvaje Fideos...ay dios mio! A very busy place...duh. But worth the wait...enjoy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very tasty food and such nice people running the place. Everything is made from scratch, nothing in a hot case, waiting to be reheated. You get a lot of food for the price and I can't wait to go back for the goulash and cevapi!  [END]
[BEGIN] My first time to dine at Gusto was for our office holiday party and I was extremely impressed with the spinach lasagne and the meatballs. The staff were absolutely attentive and enjoyable. Can't wait for my next visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] The steamed chicken dumplings were awesome! Very slow delivery, but as long as you are fine with that the food is worth it. Loved the General Gau's chicken, and the beef with asparagus too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place to chill overall but not easy to find a seat. Mixed berry cake is pretty good, and I like how their banana bread is not too sweet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quick, easy, and not overpriced. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was fresh, hot, and soooo yummy. I can't wait to try something else from this restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious food! Friendly and speedy service! The bacon infused old fashion is amazing and a must a try. Reservations aren't that easy to get so plan ahead.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had my brides maid dress altered here. Was swimming in it and had it taken in and hemmed up. Wendy did a beautiful job on short notice, I had it back within a couple of weeks and it turned out great.  [END]
[BEGIN] As far as laundromats go, this one is pretty awesome. The staff is very friendly and the facility is clean and well lit. Plus, you can do some internet work while you're there! Free wifi.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bento dish was good. Kimchi excellent. The bulgogi was pretty good. My wife had the soup which lacked the oomph that we are accustomed to. Not enough veggies. Overall decent restaurant and we will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not much English speaking but for a quick massage in place of my regular massage person that is booked up, I'd go again.  [END]
[BEGIN] They expanded the church dramatically many years ago and it is beautiful. They offer a lot of masses throughout the week and there are always special masses going on. Try it out if you live in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, modern atmosphere, not like country-style. However, little disappointed with $20 platter but burger and brisket tots were good. Their slaw was very refreshing perfect amount of dressing for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food but the service is not always the best. Sometimes you get an amazing one and then sometimes you get someone who can't even check in on you even when there's tons of empty tables. The food is worth it though.  [END]
[BEGIN] AMM did a great job on my Chevy Tahoe. The quote and timeline they gave me was spot on. Per my request, they tried to find after market parts instead of using standard GM parts. But they couldn't find everything. None the less, the price they quoted was accurate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the ambience, food was great and kids want to come back! Only critique ...Some things a la carte that might be offered upon request like a small syrup (they are waffles anyway)  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is legitimately delicious! I come here every time I'm in Portland. Thank you!  [END]
[BEGIN] Happ Hour - 2-4pm weekdays - 1/2 off on ALL shakes. Worth. The. Wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was very good food. First time at this location. It was very clean and pretty fast service. We were with another couple and the only bad part about it was they switched our burgers on our trays. So before you bit into your burgers, check them.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rolls are all fantastic, and the service is remarkably fast. Just try to avoid going between 5 and 7 unless you're keen to wait in line for a while.  [END]
[BEGIN] Classy decor, good service. Appetizers and sides were very good, the steak (NY Strip) was (surprisingly) average.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good raised donuts. I tried the Sea Salt Caramel Bourbon and the Maple Bacon and enjoyed both. Both donuts had great sweet/savory components, which is a nice change from usual donuts. I'm sure I'll be back many times!  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for happy hour and dinner. Portions are reasonably priced and big--I took half my meal home. I got the fricase de pollo and it was super flavorful and tender. The happy hour mojitos were delicious, too. Nice ambiance and friendly service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Top notch kombucha brewer. A remarkable variety of delightful flavor combinations. A healthy concoction that is enjoyable to drink!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has the best sweet corn in the summer. They pretty much have everything. Prices are great too. My only complaint is there is very little parking, and getting out onto Gender Rd. from Shannon Rd. is like asking to die!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious foods using kcal ingredients! Not willing to wit in long lines, especially on weekends! Staff very friendly!  [END]
[BEGIN] Always good pizza. The wait can be terrible sometimes and the strip all 192nd location is a far cry from the old quaint Camas original. But if you don't mind waiting, it's good.  [END]
[BEGIN] We went there last night ! We had The Eastside Pizza! It was outstanding! Would definitely go again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Pizza!!! Staff is friendly and service is very good. Did I mention they have great pizza??  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely staff here - the lady (I believe she is the owner?) was so kind and welcoming. Delicious food. I had a beef donair and it was flavorful. The samosas were tasty as well. Definitely recommend! Will most likely just do take out in future.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the food I order from here all the time. If you like shrimp try the salt and pepper shrimp it is amazing and has a nice spicy kick.  [END]
[BEGIN] This places great. Sweet and savory concoctions for everybody. I had the blueberry cheesecake and my friend had the seasonal heart throb waffle. We just decided to go family style and eat off both plates.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty fresh food and great prices! Awkward entrance but it is worth it. They put onion rings in the pulled pork sandwiches!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fish tacos were excellent. Fried chunks of fish with coleslaw and chipotle sauce light and refreshing. Chips and guacamole on the side too. Kids had beef taco and wife had a chicken ranch burrito. All good here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Small Italian chain restaurant in Celebration and Maitland. I met here for a work lunch and was pleasantly surprised of the service and food quality. The food here is pretty tasty, albeit, not the best Italian I have had. Overall, the experience was very positive.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is great. Huge menu. Family friendly. Prepared to order and quick service. Gyros are outstanding, and bigger than most. Great pickles. French fries are cooked to perfection. Traditional cafeteria style restaurant with just about anything you could think of on the menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] it is a good experience for knowing and touching u.s. history, however, i think 15 dollars is fine, not worth 22.5 dollars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love everything about the renovated old house. Love that there are many outdoor seating options. Love that they incorporated games into the setting. Not so into the drinks I've had there.... Not into battling the mosquitoes outside.... Will definitely be back....  [END]
[BEGIN] Very different experience. We had multi course meal at chefs discretion. Need to like sashimi. Unique and tasty. Good service. Expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried a bunch of tapas-first time here-definitely exceeded expectations! From the bread and butter, to the fried chicken, lobster, all really great and unique! Definitely looking forward to coming back here to try others.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice friendly place. Great monster soft pretzels. Had a awesome pulled pork sandwich. They make the pork in house.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place quietly has the best butter chicken downtown. Indian owned and I ain't talking prairies.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff are so kind, it's just my first time here and they make me feel welcomed. Big thanks for them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great spot! I love the Mediterranean cuisine. If you want a taste of South Easy Asia, this is the place. The service is impeccable and they are very concerned about your experience. That pays for itself. I love good service! So check this place out and support this local business.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an awesome store. They give you big free samples of chocolate as soon as you walk in. Chocolate is everywhere you look. The milkshakes are delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a cool spot with American menu. They also offer ceviche of either lobster or shrimp Very tasty. I highly recommend the gatsby drink. Very refreshing cocktail for those summer days. A perfect ladies drink.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very fresh sushi. High quality. Friendly service. Great drink menu. Will visit again in the future. Highly recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] This was truly my best first best cuban-food experience. Their ropa vieja was wonderful!  [END]
[BEGIN] We stop in here alot and sit at bar. Good for a drink and app. The pizza was light and yummy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, I've tried Pad thai, Lo main, General Gao and a crazy maki roll, everything was delicious, highly recommended  [END]
[BEGIN] Donuts are extravagant and tasty. For $2 a donut, you get a lot of food because those donuts are large! Most donuts are way too sweet for me, but what can I say?? It is a donut so it shouldn't be healthy....  [END]
[BEGIN] An excellent meal very pricey great service great waitstaff. :) :) fresh and clean Enjoy  [END]
[BEGIN] Delighted by the quality of the food! The staff here (especially Jonathan) are very hospitable and are ready with a good recommendation! Can't wait to go back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great space for a seminar heavy convention. Well kept, clean, and comfortable. Several food places and stores for the rare break in meetings. Also, free parking!  [END]
[BEGIN] Thin and crispy crust, not too heavy on the ingredients, unlike many places that load it so heavy you taste nothing. Less ingredients like they do it here allows you to taste everything on the pizza. Prices are good, service is fast, and is a welcome addition to my neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location, but if you blink You'll miss it. Very casual family atmosphere. Food is good, usually order pizza and cheesy garlic bread. Great place to take family. Not up to par for entertaining guests, unless they are close friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped in for lunch on Wednesday. Great waiter. Had the blue cheese burger. I thought it was wonderful. Best cheese I've had in Portland. Price was right. Restroom was clean, which I thought was a bonus for a pub.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfectly good chinese chow. There have been a few wrinkles with ordering online (they didn't realize where the orders printed out), but overall it's timely and tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful dinner last night. Chicken livers, duck breast , falafel all perfect Great service. A bit over priced. We will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome authentic Mexican food, great service, cheap prices. Off the beaten path and hardly ever for than 2 or 3 other groups of patrons. I have been eating here for over ten years and the quality of food has remained consistent. I can't wait to eat here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would give it a five but they charge your for a topping if you wanna sub it. Thats pretty lame to me and just a way to nickle and dime the costumer.. But the pizza is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Certainly the best wine selection in Austin, I tend to use the place when I'm looking for a gift for someone, as I'm certainly not a connoisseur. Very helpful staff, and they offer a good collection of gourmet beer, sake, liquor, chocolate, cheese, etc. in addition to all the wines.  [END]
[BEGIN] After being rudely treated in Brookline (see Cafe Fixe review), we came here. Very friendly bearded cashier and cheerful blonde woman at the helm. Good strong coffee and a lovely cappuccino. Nice blueberry scone. Good but tiny cranberry walnut muffin. We'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Such a great place to spend a beautiful day. There are free, guided tours on the weekends, but it's easy to get lost in the historic beauty of the cemetery on your own. Completely non-morbid and refreshing to find a green space in this park of Atlanta.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went back again today... And they have restored my faith! Quick, polite service and my husband said his burger was the best he's ever had! Great choice for us today!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is great for happy hour. Yes, it's crawling with hipsters, but the servers are friendly without being fake, drinks are cheap and tasty, and the truffle popcorn is ridiculously delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best margaritas in the city!!! Fresh guac made tableside (I don't eat it) Chips and salsa on the table Fish tacos were excellent Everyone was freindly  [END]
[BEGIN] Squeeky cheese curds without flying to Wisconsin?!?!? Thank you, Sprouts.  [END]
[BEGIN] near me in south boulder, so really nice to have a store with a decently good selection, better than wf--who they pretty much put out of business at the Baseline store. they have everything WF has at a better price, but not as good as Nat Groc vc.  [END]
[BEGIN] There can be a long wait at the pharmacy for new scripts but once your just refilling the drive thru window is great. Pharmacists seem to know theie stuff- especially the one at night. I love that it's 24 hours- super convenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent pizza, and they deliver very quickly! We ordered 2 specialty pizzas and some salads that fed 7 of us very nicely. We were all shocked on how quickly the ffood came to our house. I'll be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] was here for lunc, food was good, healthy choices, i had the salmon, it was a bit dry, enjoyed the side of white bean ragout. The service was attentive and quick. Their wine list is versatile, but maybe a bit over priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] They serve the best donuts in all of Boston. I especially love the Boston Cream donuts. Their breakfast croissants are yummy! The staff is equally as pleasant. If you go here, you'll never go to Dunkin again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think what makes them unique is the quality of the bread they use. It really makes the sub special in my opinion. They also prepare and serve your order super fast. This location always gets our order out so fast we can barely believe it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place, good food, and the dancer...the music...really fun night! We will definitely come back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm certainly pleased. There are plenty of machines and it is always clean. I think they finally finished the steam room too! The staff is very nice and always helpful. I would be REALLY impressed if they decided to add a pool...wishful thinking...  [END]
[BEGIN] Although I've only been here for brunch I had a wonderful experience. We arrived on the early side so did not have a wait at all and the food was out of this world. Definitely a fun place to go when visitors are in town!  [END]
[BEGIN] Green muenster was delicious. Bacon was crisp not greasy and avocado perfectly warmed. The breads was golden brown with a side of truffle fries and a peach Arnold Palmer. What's not to like!  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome first experience, I went here for lunch for a first time experience and was really impressed with the attention the wait staff paid to customers. The food was very good and I was even introduced to a new beer by our waiter. I will definitely be taking family here.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wicked cheap cheese enchilada plate was very good but not quite as warm as it should have been. I went there at an odd time so I'll forgive them for it this once.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiffany's Nails has always had good service and short wait times when looking for manicures, pedicures and waxing. It's fun to see that they have recently remodeled with new chairs and other interior accents!  [END]
[BEGIN] Some of the best sushi I have had and it's only a mile from home. Price matches the quality and decor. I will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] finally found a decent place for thai food without having to drive all the way to portland!  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing! Green tea base and non-dairy. Pretty unique blend. Tons of options; if you don't know what to get, feel free to ask the super friendly staff! I would hang here if I lived here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Authentic Chinese food. They have roast duck in the display case out front and you can custom order whole pig. This place rocks! We like to get take out because the restaurant space is on the small side but it's really good food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent cafe place to have some good times with friends. Great environment and very quite. So far i have been several times over there. They have one of the best fruit and bubble tea. I would recommend everyone to have try their pastry and house blend coffee..  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean rooms. Good lounge bar on the first floor. The Hyatt lives up to its Rep.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decided on sushi after visiting UCF. For a take out place the food tasted better than I expected. I would definitely return if I'm ever on the east side of Orlando again. I would recommend for first time sushi eaters  [END]
[BEGIN] Went in for a quick lunch after receiving a number of recommendations. I though the food, setting and service were great, and the value was excellent. Sadly we had to go back to work and couldn't enjoy what seemed to be a pretty expansive wine list. There's always next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the burger and Nutella milkshake. The burger was excellent and the shake good. I wish I lived near Atlanta would love to go again.  [END]
[BEGIN] These folks have laid their claim as the best Mexican restaurant in the city. 2nd visit. Changed it up and the 9 of us sampled enchiladas, fajitas and fish tacos. All ample and more than generous. The guacamole could use a kick. The salsas are fiery. Recommend!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This very nice Resturant near Rocky Point park with the view of ocean. I went there couple of time for lunch and dinner. I found the was very good and yummy to 4 star level. I would return again with fronds for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] The 30-minute wait is justified by boozy coffee, dense & chewy waffles and Euro-inspired breakfast deliciousness. I'm full, buzzed and optimistic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food --- amazing! Try the Chicken/Lamb La Zeez. You won't regret it. Portions are more than generous. The owner is very friendly and the servers are attentive. What more can you ask for?  [END]
[BEGIN] Really liked the bao. The pickled onions and sriracha mayo with potato bao is very, very tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is decent, if there is ever a line it moves quickly. I'm not a fan of seeing the cooks drinking out of cans and keeping the can on a prep table. If anything runs out it is replaced in minutes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped here for lunch! It was FAST, the cashier was friendly, and I loved the taste of the food. Very yummy! I heard the delivery service is poor, but I ordered and picked up and was quite pleased. I would go again.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had brunch here yesterday. I loved the atmosphere and the spinach and lobster crepes were so good that I'm still dreaming about them. Coffee and mimosas were very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here a few times for various events: City Wide Garage Sale, Food Fests, Classic Game Fests, etc. Parking and entry is easy for the most part (depending on the event) and the events seems to always go off without issue.  [END]
[BEGIN] Insanely busy, always- don't expect it to be a quick stop! Great prices, good cuts and good no BS service. Not the best meat I've ever had, but it get's the job done for a great price and consistent quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I came here for dinner, and we had a very good experience. My wife loved the Arnold Palmer Moonshine drink-it was sweet, strong, and delicious. We also really liked our entrees. I especially recommend the Crispy Chicken Schnitzel. Check this place out!  [END]
[BEGIN] Easily my favorite coffee shop in Boston. High quality. Highly recommend West Coast sandwich.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good experience at Barista: nice ambiance, good service. However, the coffee was a bit underwhelming and in my opinion a bit overpriced for the quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Scorpian bowls, scorpian bowls, scorpian bowls. The reason this place exists is for the strong bowls that seem to erase all memories of, well, everything. This is a great starting off point, although they do have dancing up stairs if you decide to stay for the long haul.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lots of grass to throw around the ball with your dog! Wish there was more dogs and fewer homeless people but otherwise a fantastic neighborhood park!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice people at this very busy location - I get my propane tanks filled here so periodic visits throughout the year. Avoid on weekends or towards the end of the month as it'll take a long time to be served.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely atmosphere. Service was average. I do not eat seafood but took my mother and the look in her face was priceless. She loves seafood and according to her this was very fresh. Great non seafood items. Wife loved the steak tips. The American burger was cooked to perfection.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great happy hour! Wish they had more food selection than Mikey's even though Mikey's is definitely not bad!  [END]
[BEGIN] The ambiance is kinda divey, or maybe it's just plain. The food however is absolutely delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great adorable little place. I had the chocolate chip pancakes and they were amazing. My boyfriend really loves his food too. Took a little too long for the food to come out but they kept the coffee coming.  [END]
[BEGIN] All must check this out!! So unique....looking forward to going back  [END]
[BEGIN] Small mom and pop instrument shop that has a decent selection of items for the size. I come here just for pics and strings. Decent price and customer service is okay.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think they're doing some interesting stuff with their beer. Atmosphere is unique, food is good. Pro-tip: $3 imperial pints on Wednesdays.  [END]
[BEGIN] All natural and organic, so don't expect a huge portion, but what you get is tasty and good for your body. I took their suggestions and was rewarded. (Have them use the panini press) (Ask for a sample of their organic soda)  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the red curry this time as well as pad Thai. The red curry was amazing but wasn't impressed with the pad Thai. Very dark looking and didn't taste very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bombay Bistro has become one of those "treat ourselves" places. The food is good, the service is friendly and you forget you're actually sitting in a strip center. It's not the most authentic Indian food you'll ever have but it's an enjoyable experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their pizza is good, but not the best in German Village. The service was quick and we picked our food up in less than ten minutes.  [END]
[BEGIN] I use them for most of my care and am satisfied with the doctors and the medical center.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their annual Chinese New Year celebration was good. Lots of food, lion dance and other performing arts, etc. Parking was extremely difficult. Probably one has to park in the Marta parking lot which is about 2-3 minutes walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good. Nice atmosphere. Taste good and pretty healthy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing friendly, good for groups or just hanging out with a friend. The food is fresh just like being at home in moms kitchen.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had an absolutely delicious breakfast here. The mushrooms were very tasty. The waitress was very professional. I beat the wait by eating at the counter.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food and atmosphere. Service usually on the slower side. You think they would pick up the pace since you are at the airport and may have a flight to catch. Last visit it took right around 25 minutes after finishing our meals to pay and get going.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic brisket. Taste is delicious, but value could be better. Long lines and no waiter service deducts a star from this otherwise fine establishment. Would definitely eat here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid choice for Korean food in JP. Yummy bibimbop served in the hot clay pot. Service has been kind each time we've been.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good pizza and a great staff. Just down from NH for the winter and grabbed a pizza after the long drive. Hit the spot. Has become our weekly local spot for a quick bite to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Get a sloppy joe or the Rachel- hot pastrami, cole slaw, cheese, hot-pressed rye bread. Wow.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the leather recliners. Beer and wine are available in addition to normal movie food & beverages.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to spend a summer afternoon! A little pricey, but nice atmosphere!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a great place for dessert, though often very busy. I find you get a larger portion eating in than taking out by quite a large margin. If you're looking for tasty, fruity, drinks and desserts, you're golden here. Cash only.  [END]
[BEGIN] Restaurant is cute, has a back covered patio that has extra seating, and the entire time we were here, no one had to wait to be seated. Prices are very reasonable, and quite a bit of food in each crepe. Fruit was really fresh also.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of nicest facilities around. Great location. Nice, new equipment. Bright lighting vs some that are dark, dank, musty. They have pretty much everything you want.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great store for unusual gifts and fun things for the home. Always a hit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good! Food is fresh and tasty, service is good and friendly. Chips and salsa are delish, as is all the rest of the food I've had here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good and the selection Is large. The cleanliness of the resturant has gone down hill.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really great meat and 3 place. Tasty food. The beef tips and rice were super good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place, The closest that I have gotten to REAL Asian food in Austin. Their spicy fried rice is literally heaven. It is very cheap, the staff is nice, and it is open until 2 am. Sounds pretty good to me.  [END]
[BEGIN] So yummy. Love going there for their roast beef sandwiches, or their french bread, or their chopped liver. So many great choices and consistently high quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] two words: cheap beer. Eat and drink upstairs while watching the game..or just drink downstairs by the bar...gets crowded at night though... surprisingly when i went a couple of fridays ago. It's a bit cramped though..  [END]
[BEGIN] Really tasty chocolate chip cookie. Macarons are awesome and apple tart is good as well. Glad that I found them  [END]
[BEGIN] We went for lunch. We had burgers and beer, and we were very pleased with the size of the portions and also the attentiveness of the staff. Our order was taken quickly, and our drinks never got empty. We will be back for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been back to Loops numerous times, they are always friendly and pretty quick, all items cooked to order. ALWAYS delivered HOT as it should be! They are not shy with the protein portions....have yet to try something that I did not enjoy..they are talking about a 2nd location....  [END]
[BEGIN] After a long week I decided having a foot massage would be best for uplifting my spirits. The last time I went was okay but I really miss Mickey. He was the best!  [END]
[BEGIN] Chinese comfort food. Good enough to order home once in a while. They also indulge special requests (ex. extra curry sauce, etc.) Good portion sizes. Love the curry chicken!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just like your average Panera, but with friendly and helpful staff. I hang out here occasionally when I have breaks between business meetings. It is a nice place to get some emails done.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Food, VERY fast delivery great for late night snack if you are staying in a hotel they deliver until 3 AM which is a awesome  [END]
[BEGIN] Try the Greek lemon pasta. I didn't think I'd care for it, but it was delish. The lemon was not overpowering. The mushroom soup was to die for. Not salty or greasy. Dunk some sour dough bread and enjoy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place! We were directed to Side Bar so we walked in there first. Immediately walked out. Stumbled upon this place and it's awesome! The set up is great and it's not loud to where you can't hear the person you're with. Excellent food.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is where we hangout along with my grandchildren Missy and Robert. Missy loves the pistachio while Robert loves chocolate and my favorite was cheesecake. There's a lot of toppings to chose from and most importantly they are also cheap than the other Yogurt houses.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm still loving this place for my meatless days. My fav so far is the one with potato in it. Delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] 1A has great pizza, but it takes a while. Their subs are great too. Not much else to say about this: It's a regular Greek pizza shop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely outdoor seating on the Willamette. Water bowls for dogs brought table side. Noon to 5 happy hour with a sumptous french and Italian favorite selection. Homemade pesto made from marcona almonds.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ça reste du fast-food mais on ce trompe pas avec BWW la nourriture est bonne, le service décent, propre... Bref un sports bar qui répond aux attentes !!  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome food, good service. The food was extremely creative, well paired, and absolutely delicious. Service was attentive and well thought out, though we helped correct a couple of communication details. Ambiance very chic, quiet, and cool. For a hotel restaurant, I will definitely return.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've come here for a couple years on Record Store Day and the service is always great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the food here. I've always had the empanadas but today I tried the Colombian burger for the first time. Best burger ever! The only thing that could be better is the wait time.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of those places where you get outstanding crafted culinary delights. The staff were so accommodating and fun. If you go see if you can sit over by the kitchen window to watch the chefs prepare the food. Great fun and great owners and staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super geeky and lots of gf and vegan options. What more do you want! It's a fun hangout to meet up with friends and play a few games over nachos and drinks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great tap selection and huge bottled selection. The bartender always seems to be super knowledgeable about the offerings. I'm obsessed with the vanilla clove cider they've had for the last few weeks. Great little spot!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the double bacon mushroom and Hawaiian pizza! Timely delivery and pleasant staff. $30 for 2 large pizzas seems reasonable to me.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got a great haircut. The shopping center it is in is slightly sketchy, but the haircut itself was great, and my hairstylist was lovely and made sure to cut my hair exactly how I wanted. I am so sorry I forgot her name, but thank you!  [END]
[BEGIN] had their american Sub. Really good bread, meat, and cheese. put too much mayo on it but that is not a deal breaker. perfect food for watching a game  [END]
[BEGIN] On vacation, this was across the street. Decided to check it out. The baked ziti was pretty good. Everything was a little on the pricey side but overall not too shabby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good beer, great wings, pizzas, and pulled pork, French dip had a ton of fat and the au jous was flavorless. Atmosphere is fun and its a great place to watch sports games.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for lunch and had the shaksuka. The bread was great, and the skahsuka was huge. It was a little spicy for my tastes, but I'm guessing most people would like that, so I won't knock them. Next time I'll try an egg scramble.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid bowl of ramen for a reasonable price, broth was tasty and cha Shiu was plentiful. Above average ramen spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really great place and tanning was smooth applied. I forgot the name of the technician but she did great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have a serious soft spot for old school diners. The prices are great, the food was solid, and the service was fast. If you're expecting a fancy brunch, keep looking. However, if you love the simple straight forward diner experience, then I'm sure you'll find a winner here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location to eat healthy but not sacrifice any taste or experience. Love the seasonal menu. The desserts are delightful and just the right amount to curb a sweet tooth but not throw your diet.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best Thai delivery ever! So quick and huge servings. Highly recommend for Hotels around the airport. Beats hotel food any day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Honestly the cilantro garlic sauce is what makes everything taste so delicious. Whether I choose to get a wrap, grilled chicken, or ribs that sauce will make miracles happen. Everything else tastes fine but I am highly recommending that sauce to go with most meals here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great happy hour! Yumm fire roasted hamburger for $6. Great quality martini at only $5 during happy hour.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered the chai icecream drink, it was very cinnamon-y the service was great! Good study place to keep you caffeinated. Would come again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice decor, good food & service. The servings are big, so it may make sense to split an entree. I like how they had coffee & chairs by the door for incoming customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was delicious. The standard chicken tikka was tasty. Daal was good enough, but not amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chocolates were amazing They have so many chocolates.The tour was not my ideal but I tried so many chocolates at the end that I changed my mind. I enjoyed the white hot chocolate it was delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] You come in always expecting the perfect customer service which this store was no exception. I love their chicken sandwiches, their waffle fries, and dippable ketchup packets, all things that set them apart from other fast food joints.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing food. Superb service. Beautiful interior. Only issue is it was very loud and a bit hard to have a conversation with people even if they were seated across from you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped here to meet family, Sharon our waitress recommended the homemade hash, and she was right, it was awesome !!! All of the food was great and service was excellent, especially Sharon !  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a must! I recommend the lobster roll (Stuffed lobster in bread)! I'm so glad I got to try this place out!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great option for veggies! I had the BBQ tempeh and was very happy. If you're a vegan, make sure they take off the cheese. There are chingos of options, so definitely go if you want a good sammich.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good pizza if slightly lacking a bit in taste. Toppings were first rate and service was good( slow lunch period on a Thursday)  [END]
[BEGIN] The cookies were good and they warmed them up for you, but I thought 14.00 for a dozen cookies was a bit much. We bit the bullet this time, but prob won't do it again.  [END]
[BEGIN] All you can eat lobster and crab legs??? This was paradise for the hubby. Everything else that's offered is just bleh. Come here for what they're named after. Nothing else.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've driven by this place dozens of times and we finally stopped in. I was pleasantly surprised! We ordered fried provolone and a Joe's Pile of Protein pizza to share. The pizza had pepperoni, sausage, salami, ham, ground beef, onions, and diced pepperoncini. Very delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice surprise! Was in drinking some great drink specials, decided to try the 2 for 1 entree special, was excellent! Scallops were cooked perfectly, definitely fresh and at 1/2 price you can't get a deal like that I Boston!!! Nice dinner, great prices and worth a visit  [END]
[BEGIN] Erica did my Health and Fitness Assessment before I begin working with a trainer. I was pleasantly surprised that she spent a long time with me. She is so friendly and professional.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ramen ryoma is possibly the best tasting ramen in portland/beaverton area. It is definitely not the most authentic and traditional, but tastes much better. Portions are also big and price is reasonable. Broth is a bit fatty and toppings are added onto ramen straight from fridge so they are cold.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the LongHorn Trio and the fish was cook perfectly. I absolutely love the salmon, but the steak was a bit overcooked. Their key lime pie dessert was awesome too.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was cute and the food was good. We got 4 dishes and spilt them family style. I'd probably get two of them again. The wait was 35 minutes but once we ordered it only took 10ish minutes to get our food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered on a whim the steak caesar salad and fried wings with a side of honey mustard. Meh kind of dressing for the salad but it was edible. Honey mustard was on point with the fried wings. I'll get the wings again, no so much the salad.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time there today. Loved the atmosphere, very eclectic. Dessert stand looked amazing. Ordered the Amazing Basil Lemonade. Very very good but tooo sweet for am taste buds. I see me sipping on this in the hot summer afternoon. Good job. Will be back!,  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun inside atmosphere with a wide selection of savory and sweet crepes, baked goods, and friendly service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank you Dr. Bendall for your response. I did respond to e-mails as you posted, however I was suppose to get a call back from your assistant and didn't. She was suppose to check with you if you would still come out. I just never got a response.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have awesome (delicately grilled, not fried) fish tacos and the salsa is just like my host-mom made in Mexico!  [END]
[BEGIN] mmmm great sushi good sake and OYSTER SHOOTERS. they have some very unique rolls. i would def give it a try if you are a fan of sushi and sake.  [END]
[BEGIN] Zen always delivers. Some of the best Takos (that's how it's spelled) in Austin.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a favorite of mine for breakfast, esp the oyster omelette. It had been 6 years since I last visited and still delicious and just as I remembered.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great, solid food here. Got the honey duck, pad see ew, and massaman curry. They were all reasonable in price and super tasty. I have had some more complex and flavorful Thai food but not at this price point. Also they deliver and some days that is so very necessary.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have to give this 4 stars for overall quality and service. Oysters excellent but $'s. Fried fish ok. Louis salad outstanding. Fried oyster roll delish. Nice bellys. Clam chowda looked great. Good drinks. Bloody Mary bloody good. Crab cake decent. Ceaser Salads with grilled seafood was huge.  [END]
[BEGIN] Although there were new employees being trained at the time, the food was still great as usual. I love Chipotle!  [END]
[BEGIN] The best Lanzhou Ramen is Austin I had. If you are the first time visitor, you should try Beef Hand-pulled Noodels.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great breakfast selection and decent coffee cheaper and better than hilton hotel. Short walk to sw park and you are at taylor st. Atmosphere is light and pleasant and easy to access.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid food and atmosphere. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Definitely check it out if you are looking for a good Italian meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary in Orlando last week and attended Earls for dinner and we enjoyed it. The place had the perfect "date night" vibes. The food was pretty good even though the portions were small. I would definitely visit Earls again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice job, Anh's! The Pho broth is complex and combined with the extra onions and tender filet, this is a definite redo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sushi sushi sushi!!! Very Clean and a great place to have some Japanese Food. Very tasty, quiet, and inexpensive. Sushi was good by the soups are even better for some reason. i would rate this place a 4*. Thank You Sushi Katana!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] real neat idea, not very many places you can get sandwiches conceptualized by some of your favorite chefs around the area. Real good specials, keeps things interesting with simple and honest to fancy and complicated sandwiches (that is if there is such a thing as a fancy and complicated sandwich).  [END]
[BEGIN] The ingredients are always fresh and I really love the empanadas. Service is a little iffy but at least its consistent, and its a suave place for a small party. The music is a little... bossanova though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have been coming here for years and love the food! It doesn't get any more authentic than this Cuban food. Great sangria, toasted Cuban bread, empanadas, chicken and rice...so delicious! Be careful if you order the chicken and rice, as it does have pieces of bone in it.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a wonderful little neighborhood bar! My wife and I stopped by here in November, having just arrived in town for a weekend. This was the only place open. It felt a lot like home, if home were, you know, cool, and had great cocktails.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really cute spot in a nice market. Only disappointment is the food is pre packaged and can only be ate there in a nice bowl during lunch. The burger is incredible as well as the zoodles and beets marinara. I adore the brownies as well for pre workout snacks  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow the food is awesome! The atmosphere is great. Both indoor and outdoor seating is nice. But the traditional bibimbop was soooooo good! Also got two sushi rolls! Wayy too much good for one sitting but awesome as leftovers!  [END]
[BEGIN] Place is always excellent!!! Great food cold beer!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The ambiance isn't great, but the food and service are. The authentic Pad Thai is a perfect mix of sweet, sour, spicy and peanutty. The curries are traditional and delicious, but the duck wasn't anything to write home about.  [END]
[BEGIN] While the lines can be insanely long, the burgers are always amazing. If you want to go all out, get one of the milkshakes. You won't be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wasn't aware there was two locations as the first location I went to on Stark street i wasn't impressed. Went to their second location in Pioneer Square and ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and it was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of my favourite Dosa Houses. Always delicious always friendly kind servers. Great choices.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice establishment for some evening cocktails and dinner. Haven't had the food yet but I've been to the one in Dunwoody. I think once they get the ambiance right with the music and live performers it will definitely be even more of a hit. Nice wide bar and upscale  [END]
[BEGIN] I avoid Starbucksy type places because the pastries and coffee are usually shiite. This place brings it. Pastries and french press spot on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well-made mocha frappuccino, not too icy or liquidy. And we were able to use my Starbucks gift card. Awesome find inside Animal Kingdom!  [END]
[BEGIN] I do love the food here ,but you have to check the togo orders before you leave. They have gotten it wrong twice now so be careful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quick, Friendly service! I stopped in while in the area, ordered the lamb biryani + veggie samosa, for take away (ready in 10 mins), and both were very good, and the medium spice level I asked for was spot on!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a cute sandwich place that sometimes has live music. It has a coffee shop feel and you order at the counter. I enjoyed my grilled cheese there a lot! Yummy and standard.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's been quite a while since I've visited Papi's but I remember having awesome food and an awesome drink! Parking is a bit insane but I would brave the parking a lot again for those black beans!  [END]
[BEGIN] Located in the Atlanta Marriott Marquis hotel, high speed as the crowd never ends. Want food? Time it right. This is Starbuck's coffee. Salud!  [END]
[BEGIN] Most amazing chicken pita I ever ate. In fact calling it a pita makes it seem in significant. The food was divine - absolutely fresh and delicious. I highly recommend their food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beer is good, solid stout & nice pale. Food is inventive, a little heavy on the Sriracha but good. Oh & growler fills are $10!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Chill spot. Lax atmosphere. It gets smokey...  [END]
[BEGIN] They have walk in workshops and you can watch the workers make glass designs right in front of you! It really makes you appreciate their craft!  [END]
[BEGIN] I love Red Robin every time I go. Always the same good burgers cooked right and some of the best fries in the business.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here the staff was wonderful and the food was very well prepared and tasty. I am very particular about Italian restaurants and this one is very good. We will be back often I am sure. The only problem I see is they might need more room very quickly  [END]
[BEGIN] Imagine if P. Terry's grew up a bit and started making adult money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little joint to grab a cold PBR and listen to a local band. Pretty dang fun place to chill at if you ask me.  [END]
[BEGIN] We've been back a couple times since I wrote my first review. The dinner service is much better than the lunch was. Maybe I just caught them on the wrong day. Anyway, four stars for the dinner shift.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been getting my hair cut here for almost ten years, I'm not the type that has a fancy haircut, but these guys have always done a very good job and they use a straight razor on your neck when they are done.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was definitely an experience! A little pricey, but I get why. The show itself was really cool and impressive. You get to see so many different parts of Canada all in one trip. I'd definitely recommend for anyone visiting for Canada for the first time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful decor, love the creativeness of the menu created by the chef. While the flavors fall a bit short of a homerun for me, it certainly is a place I recommend trying and finding your favorite. Some might complain about prices but it's fairly priced for the experience you're receiving.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a cold brew (they use a Toddy) and it was delicious! Good ambience although slightly pricier than in used to.  [END]
[BEGIN] The burgers are amazing, lots of interesting sides. The drinks are a bit on the pricey side but will definitely be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] 1st time here and the food was really great! Had the bruschetta which was wonderful, the house made bread was very tasty and our mains were both delicious. Service was prompt and friendly. Would go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome pizza and great beer list! My boyfriend and I hiked here in a blizzard for his birthday dinner and it was so worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Can be crowded and slow on weekends, but the covered patio is a relaxing place to enjoy a local brew and great pub food. Their burger and fries is delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] We tried Xinjiang stir-fried chicken and steamed soup dumplings. It is pretty good. The price is okay. But too many dishes are not available in the menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] Old school place with great food, what's to go wrong. Def recommend if you looking for a great breakfast at a great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Update: Had their margaritas. Holy jeebus, it is amazing. From now on, definitely getting guac and margaritas from now on!  [END]
[BEGIN] I liked this place. Very chill attitude. Awesome beer selection and very tasty burgers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good pizza my friends. And fairly cheap. If you're standing in front of BHOP for some reason, walk down Huntington to Mass Ave., take a right and walk to the corner of Columbus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good stop for brunch. The hot sauce on the table is Delish. Love the patio during summer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Never had this before, really good food- kinda back alley looking though. Saw a drug deal out the window. Lmao FOOD IS REALLY GOOD.  [END]
[BEGIN] We really enjoyed our delivery order from Rice Bowl Cafe. Ordered it online and received it within 35/40 minutes. Where we are located, delivery is a bit tough to receive even though we are still in Austin. We were very happy to have found them whilst visiting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Paneer tika masala is sooooo damn good especially with garlic naan. I love the crispy bread and sauces they serve while you wait. Cocktails are a bit pricey but creative.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food and service. Thank you!  [END]
[BEGIN] Bottles, cans and taps oh my! I love me some beer, and this is a frequently visited spot for my wife and I. Haven't tried the food, doesn't look to appetizing. But the beer, dear god the beer, is amazing. Beer!  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the atmosphere, decor, service and food. The only reason I'm not giving five stars was the time it took to get our desserts, but they did comp them for us. Otherwise, a great experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Will def be coming back here. Great for a saturday lunch and excellent service and food  [END]
[BEGIN] Casual atmosphere. Great for kids. Quick service for our party of 8. I had the grilled swordfish dinner and it was fantastic. Will definitely be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect for drinks - been there a few times and absolutely adored the scene and service. The orchiette was divine - and the drink selection is good. Perfect for a girls night out!  [END]
[BEGIN] I would definitely re-visit this place. I had 3 tacos and plantains. I will skip the plantains next time. Tacos were tasty. 1 chicken, 1 pork carnitas, 1 steak (carne asada?). Jarritos guava soda to top it off. Delish.  [END]
[BEGIN] My friend and I went here for the first time a couple weeks ago for brunch, she got the catch 122 and I got the madam croque, The service was okay... Our server seemed uninterested and not really friendly but the food was very delicious all brunch items are $12  [END]
[BEGIN] my fav place to get banh mi in Chinatown! cheap and fresh and delicious! $3-4 for a whole yummy sandwich. u can ask for spicy, less lard (!?), they're v quick and reasonable. small place but good sandwiches. love.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thinking about their chicken and paneer korma makes me all happy inside. A must are the mussels with naan. I would probably lick the plate clean if no one was watching. Actually, I would probably lick the plate clean even if people were watching.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service sometimes. Lots of value for $20 bucks. Some of the meatballs and meat didn't seem as fresh as they should be for a place serving raw food. All in all its a bargain shabu place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to get a nice salad or sandwich. If you are in a hurry, this is a good choice and the food is healthy and tasty. Friendly staff and nice soups.  [END]
[BEGIN] So happy to see this place open. Hector the chef owner is such a great guy. The food is authentic and good. It has such vibes unlike anywhere else in the battery. We are very excited to see them open near us by tech square as well!  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff. They are able to keep the line moving when the going gets busy. I like when the barista remembers my order... they are good about doing that at this location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute little pub with nice servers and good ambiance. Drinks came out a little slow, but it was a Friday night and they were quite busy. The decor is super cute, very library/cabin like. Cocktails were very nice and smooth and the servers were nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is my go-to when I'm craving shrimp!!! The seasoning and sauce is amazing not to mention the tasty green mussels. No need for forks here folks!! Just throw your bib on and get ready to get messy. Well worth it!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I found this place by accident, but their food is delicious. The people are always friendly. I usually load up on the veggies and the meat- the plate is by the pound (down with carbs). I have never eaten in, as the sitting area is very small. Great place!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice portions, GF crepe options, decent wine, lovely dessert - and vegetarian French Onion Soup. Yay! Not a TON of vegetarian options for savory crepes, but what I had was lovely and generously packed with cheese. Looking forward to returning and trying breakfast  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a good time here. Roberto was awesome, very knowledgeable, and always had great recommendations. Definitely plan on coming back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious brisket and pulled pork. The fried okra is wonderful! This is a great spot for late night.  [END]
[BEGIN] I can't speak for much here because I don't like Thai food (mostly the curries and coconut) but I had the pad thai here and it was AMAZING. I'm telling you, it was fantastic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the Lamb Shank with yellow basmati rice, it was great. The meat was cooked perfectly and rice was delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] We tried the Mango & Cheese and Green Tea Toast. Mango was okay but this green tea though  [END]
[BEGIN] They were efficient and thorough, especially vacuuming the dog hair from the carpets. We are very happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I work in Peachtree Center and am all too familiar with the "mall" food options. Tumeric was a welcome addition. I am a vegetarian and the variety of well-seasoned dishes at Tumeric never disappoints.  [END]
[BEGIN] My favorite Cuban restaurant in Atlanta. I always opt for the special rice platters, which is usually some type of meat accompanied by rice, black beans, and sweet plantains (maduros?). The waiters are very friendly and punctual. I feel like I'm in Miami everytime I stop by here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great prices and clean... Did the trick for what I needed. No complaints and if I remember correctly it was the cheapest in town. Price did go up in the year I was there but I suppose that is expected?  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is ok... but the drinks are the best i've ever had in my entire life... Soooo yummy! Love it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fish sauce wings are good but (to me) not better than another Portland mainstay. I was very happy with the luc lac. The service was prompt and the ambiance very casual. I will definitely be coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm inlove with the chicken wings at this place , amazing sauces , great appetizers and fun times :) always crowded on game days but service is always good ..  [END]
[BEGIN] After driving around aimlessly trying to find a place to eat, we decided that this place looked good.. I had the clam with pasta , that was amazing They have a great happy hour.. Downside they charge for bread at the table.. But I would recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a quick and friendly place. They are always very attentive and I've never had to stand in line very long to check out.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a funky record store that has gone a little too corporate. Once they only had a few locations, now they are quite the chain. Still they maintain an alternative independent feel. They have a good selection of music, posters, stickers, and funny nic nacks.  [END]
[BEGIN] awesome!! they were very helpful! it was our first visit and our first time buying skates. We LOVE the sweet, loving mew-mew too!! We will most def be shopping there more! I can't give 5 stars because the shop is very tiny and crowded and uncomfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Under new ownership [well, since September of 2011], by the people who own Gold Dust Meridian on Hawthorne. Dive bar at it's finest. Live bands [great acoustics in the building], cheap ass beer, nice patio. See this" http://endhits.portlandmercury.com/endhits/archives/2011/09/12/club-21s-grand-reopening  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun for the kids! We love going out for apple picking and then shopping for baked goods. Their snicker doodle cookies are addicting!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great intimate venue to see your favorite band play. I saw Sloan here (who i wasn't really into), but I can see how it's a fun place, and a staple of the local live music community.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tomatillos is a fantastic neighborhood restaurant with great people. The food is yummy and the drinks are always terrific! If you appreciate local businesses, you'll love the great value and amazing food here. SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS YA'LL!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Pretzel pepperoni pizza they have is amazing only problem is that it is rarely n the menu and when it is it is for a very limited time. The wait is always less than 10 mins.  [END]
[BEGIN] Azteca is a great place to eat. The food is much better than your alternative in the area (El Vaquero) and the prices are great!  [END]
[BEGIN] best burger in town, long long lines but worth the wait! turkey burger that is actually juicy is a miracle in its self and the fries are addicting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food this awesome.... I tried the sizzler, must try. Best chicken tikka masala. The staff is very friendly. Place is clean and nice. Manny attended us and he is super friendly. Thanks.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has a nice ambience to it. It is steeped in history and you can feel it. The food is good. The staff is friendly and attentive.  [END]
[BEGIN] My daughter set up reservations for my wife and I to dine here for the first time for my birthday. We really enjoyed ourselves and the food is delicious. We will definitely eat here more frequently.  [END]
[BEGIN] A coworker suggested this for lunch. Had the el pastor burrito with a Pepsi to wash it down. Wowza this was a bit to much for a work day lunch for $10 it was so good I regretted finishing it was ready for a nap afterwards.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great spot. Traditional German food, fun atmosphere, and good service. Worth the stop if you like good German food. I recommended getting the wurst and the Black Forest cake...amazing!  [END]
[BEGIN] Interesting environment, much larger than I expected. They had live jazz music playing which had drawn in quite the crowd, but ample space in another room for seating if you didn't want to be in the mix. The beer was great and for good prices. Very enjoyable experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Try the Lemongrass Vermicelli bowl. It's HUGE! And Delicious! And the leftovers taste even better the next day. Service is always super friendly and when I'm feeling indulgent, the Jackfruit smoothie/shake is one of the best things I've enjoyed through a straw.  [END]
[BEGIN] There best dishes are all in weekends!! And please don't order American style Chinese food like General chicken or pad Thai (this is even not Chinese food) Be sure you order like a Taiwanese, the Taiwanese breakfast dishes are the best!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere and great food. Bruscetta plate was so good. Cuban sandwich was one of the best I've had. Amazing cold brew, as well  [END]
[BEGIN] The photo shows what's left of my fillet mignon and Yukon mashed potatoes.... need I say more!.... The sourdough bread was really good nice ,hot fresh.... my Caesar salad was a little too acidic ...hence the four stars versus five... well worth the drive ...  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff here....good deals...theres always sales becaues its on Northeastern University's campus, ( you know college kids need the deals.)  [END]
[BEGIN] This restaurant served very authentic and delicious Greek food, as well as great Tiramisu. However, the only thing that crossed my mind was that it was kind of overpriced for some of the items.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Fried Chicken and Waffles is a huge serving and a strawberry butter and sweet and spicy sauce for the chicken are delicious. Are Fried Chicken was a little bit burnt but still good. The service was great and we will definitely be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been going to Lucas since Nov 2014 for haircuts and he's done a good job each time. He always takes time to listen and understand what you want and pays great attention to details. Very friendly and pleasant guy. Also, bang trims are free for returning clients.  [END]
[BEGIN] The BBQ burger (Donnie's favorite) was tasty. But the brioche roll seemed a little out of place. Some interesting items on the menu, like the "Creamsicle". I think that's an ice cream float.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very, very cool vibe here. Along with the delicious drinks and desserts, the wait stuff was fun/lively. Bring cash. Raspberry chocolate fool = yum.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have a breakfast in Medina cafe. Great waiter serviced us! Though wait for a long time, we got the tasty food and coffee. The waffles with passion fruit and Earnest Cardamom Ice Cream tastes very delicious, love it!  [END]
[BEGIN] I always get the bistec de encabollado, with rice and beans (habichuelas) and tostones. Always a great meal at a good price. The service can be a little slow at times.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place! I haven't ordered a dish yet that I didn't like. Much better than its predecessor at this location. Good service, friendly staff, reasonable prices, pleasant decor. Beware of the bamboo shoots in the green curry though. They are woody, chewy, and most cannot be swallowed.  [END]
[BEGIN] My family enjoys their Ramen bowls. The food comes out quickly and the price is pretty good. Inconsistent at times with how much pork you get in the ramen bowl. Sometimes a level 1 is not and sometimes not much at all. Service average.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good pizza, always thin and crispy the way I like it but the staff is always a bit weird.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here for lunch...excellent service and my food was delicious! I ordered the Cuts Knife and Fork...their version of the Cobb Salad with Chicken, and it was magnificent! Reasonably priced as well. I will definitely go back for lunch again!  [END]
[BEGIN] I am not dating anyone. I don't need to. I have Blue Star! And I am in love.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is fantastic. Skip the fries and the strawberry goat cheese, but otherwise really great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a bad place on Davie. Decent portion and great price value. Food is prepared right. One downside is anything roaster is a bit burnt -- wings and kebabs. Great ambience for a laid back night out with food and drinks, and can seat a bi party.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food! Worth the trek through their unreliable customer service and disorganized waitstaff.  [END]
[BEGIN] F can l. Ylou lshould thkllkkklthkllkkkllthkllkkkkkokkikikkkokkikikllthkllkkkkkokkikikkkokkikik let on ke 0 itlviovvtivlclnjniiovvtivlclnjn to me b Iliijhov. You have i  [END]
[BEGIN] good food, professional staff. I book company parties here and take customers to lunch. the menu is somewhat stagnant. I wish they would have seasonal updates. Great wine selection  [END]
[BEGIN] Good pizza. Nice geeky decor that suits kendall square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid breakfast lunch spot. This is just a feeling but I feel like the dishes here are healtiher and slightly higher quality ingredients then the other Portland comptetitors for your brunch dollar. It's a tad smaller then average and it has a lot of veg/vegan options.  [END]
[BEGIN] Here's a short review to save you time: The sushi is decent, not the best I've had. I love the atmosphere, which is why I come here. Friendly Staff. Great place for a date. Try the Kiss of Fire roll and Dragon Roll. Done.  [END]
[BEGIN] love this place. has such a great atmosphere and good, diverse selections of used records. it also seems like they are constantly getting new stuff in, so stop in once a week if you're hunting for a particular record...chances are, you'll find it there eventually.  [END]
[BEGIN] The menu has a variety of things to choose from which is always nice! The duck is a must though. Cooked to perfection. This place is so versatile that you can go for a relaxing brunch or a nice date. Recommend south congress cafe to all!  [END]
[BEGIN] JJ's makes some great sandwiches. Both on their signature french bread or the wheat, all of their subs will fill you up with yummy goodness. I really like their own salt and vinegar chips.  [END]
[BEGIN] Always fast preparation and friendly staff. Never disappoints. We always get the "quesadilla" which is our alternative to a burrito! Rolled and grilled!  [END]
[BEGIN] Owners were really friendly. I had the grilled cheese with macaroni. Yummm. Definitely not diet meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best Doughnuts in Portland! Hands above the other famous competition. Much more artisanal flavor profiles and selections. These doughnuts also are nicely presented and crafted. Great cake texture and flavor with a bit of a light crunch on the outside of some.  [END]
[BEGIN] 5 dollar Pho on Wednesday. I give four stars because I've only tried the Pho on several occasions, nothing else. Their Pho is the best in town no joke.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, good location, good sushi. You can get a great lunch special with includes 5 pcs of fiah, 6 pcs sashimi, spicy tuna or California roll, small salad and miso soup all for $13.50 Good deal!  [END]
[BEGIN] My girlfriend and I stopped for a glass of wine and ended up getting some appetizers. The antipasto was made authentically and the wine selection is awesome. I will be going back really soon!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent on the water location, and to find food that matches the location (excellent) is rare. I had the Cod sandwich, that was excellent, My wife raves about the steamers. Desert was a chocolate doughboy, it was to die for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a tune up recently. Did a great job and the bike is riding smooth the way it should. Thanks guys!  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here. Line out the door on Sunday morning. It was super fast, got right in and ate. Food was great. Great service. Servers got wireless tablets to take orders and cards.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good gyros and fresh hummus. Service was cheerful and prompt. Definitely a great spot for lunch!  [END]
[BEGIN] Still the best Soul Food restaurant in Atlanta! They are most famous for their southern fried chicken, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The food is always fresh and the dishes are seasoned to perfection. The closest thing to grandma's cooking!  [END]
[BEGIN] Buffalo Wild Wings is awesome period. I love ANY type of wings place, and I one time came here with my family and friends and we all screamed at the hottest wings on the planet!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a little far out from where I live but the people at the desk do their job, the place seemed pretty clean and the clientele seemed to enjoy the gym.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great weekly specials. Friendly staff and great service. Parking can be a pain due to the lines are not painted on the pavement. People park all over the place. Karaoke on Wednesday nights.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was packed when we came for brunch on the Fourth of July! Great coffee, friendly service, although not super quick, and yummy waffles. Definitely coming back  [END]
[BEGIN] Super friendly staff. I truly like this location. The product came right on time and it was really tasty. I loved my shake.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was pleasantly surprised to find this gem conveniently located right at the entrance of security! My server was exceptional, funny, and fast paced! My steelhead citrus salad was delicious and came our within 10 minutes of ordering! Will definitely return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty decent. Cane for a staff appreciation so I t wasn't busy. We're pretty much the only ones here so it's easy to have fun  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food. Nice atmosphere. Somewhat inattentive wait service.  [END]
[BEGIN] I dig it. Wish the bar and the patio were not so narrow, but on a slow day, it's rather lovely and the staff is great!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a top notch Zooquarium. (Zoo/aquarium) A little on the expensive side but the interactive exhibits and knowledge you acquire about the animals and ocean conservation efforts seems worth it. You can easily spend 2 hours walking around and getting an up close view.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here with a bunch of friends after our plans fell through. Good food, good beer selection, and a nice homely atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good food , complimentary chips and salsa ( chips were warm ). The fish tacos were really good so was the quesadillas. The house margarita was also very good I Will definitely go back again  [END]
[BEGIN] Place is not expensive and food is pretty good! I tried the crepe and it was really good! I take one star off because I was waiting a pretty long tone until my stuff is going to be made.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best Indian you will find anywhere.Food is aromatic, tasty and traditional as it should be.Could do a little more with the wine list but overall a great dining experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an awesome intimate venue to see bands play. I recently saw the Sterns (who were freekin awesome) and the cover was only 4 bucks. It was HOT. Of course it's loud during shows, but that's why you go there. LOTS OF FUN.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Mohawk is a good place to see a show. The bar area is a bit tiny, and can be difficult to get a drink when it's crowded. I enjoyed my time here, and would definitely go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, great food, great staff, great drinks. All in all, Watershed is pretty damn great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went in with no expectation and was blown away by the food. I had the gnocchi and it was out of this world. Paired with a nice Cabernet this was truly worth it!  [END]
[BEGIN] I really enjoyed this place! This is my favorite Ethiopian restaurant that I have ever been to. The food was good, but the service was so much better than any of the others which really made it stand out to me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hummus and homemade bread, for starters. Comfort food, strong drinks, and not too hard on the wallet! Sometimes, I want great spaghetti and meatballs! My husband always wants lamb chops, and he really likes the chops and risotto here!  [END]
[BEGIN] The atmosphere was great. Rustic and modern. The service was on par. My entree, the tortellini, was good not great. The food my family ordered was delicious. Next time I'll try a different entree.  [END]
[BEGIN] Memorable nite. Band was outstanding. I ordered the BBQ salmon, which comes smothered in a creamy bbq-like sauce that was quite tasty. But there's no avoiding it turns out you don't like it. It is COVERED.  [END]
[BEGIN] Heard about the burgers for a while, and finally went to the Ponce City Market to try one. I must say, the burger was good, the fries were great and the shake was well worth it as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service with a smile- clean, AC, & the patties all good- spice is just right! jerk chicken with rice & cabbage also delicious- Parking around back Next time I'll try the rice & peas..  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious chicken dumplings with done interesting sauces. Beef noodles were also amazing. Flavorful without being overbearing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great, authentic Italian home cooking. Albeit a very small venue, it does not feel overly crowded. It can get slow and you may have to wait for your reservation as there are only 10 or so total tables. But if you have some patience, the food is worth the wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] i love sichuan food. but mary chung sichuan food is not spicy enough to my taste. try the egg dish in hot oil. it was sooo good. it's like spicy scramble eggs with some pork in it. delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good Thai food. Don't let the surrounding area deter you from eating here. Zabelee is great, with friendly service and good food!  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks to Yelp for the event tickets. While this festival was on a smaller scale, there was a good variety of beers/ciders. My favorite item from the festival however was not alcohol, but the maple water. That stuff is awesome. I would go to this festival again for sure :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Totally dependable. It's a great place to have in the neighborhood. Nice wine list and the menu is reasonable. The service is great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Damned good burger! Got a classic burger, added avocado, bacon, and an egg. Yummers. One draw back is my burger fell apart. The meat just didn't feel like being a team player. Whatever, would come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice family run restaurant for breakfast and lunches. Their greek salads are HUGE! My mom and I refuse to get them anywhere else. Be prepared to wait on the weekends. It is worth it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food and great service. Definitely worth the try - the alternative is driving off Disney World or taking a shuttle into Disney Springs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Crispy oysters, frog legs are excellent. I took a group of 25 people here and it was a unanimous thumbs up! Service was exceptional although started slow. The drink quality and choices are very high.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had an americano on my way to my gate on my PDX airport world tour. Hit up a bunch of places here before my morning flight. The coffee was nice, hot and hit the spot. It had good flavor and not too bitter or that burnt flavor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was looking forward to this. It didn't seem as high as I thought it would be. Would love to get on at night. Great experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Both times I've eaten here has been wonderful. Appetizer and a half plate of pasta hits the spot. Great wine list? Desert was not equal in quality to the entree, especially for the price. Love the service!  [END]
[BEGIN] come here for the pie! they are unique, seasonal and simply delicious. the coffee is good too, but i preferred some other pdx varieties more.  [END]
[BEGIN] The mussels were great, as was the gnocchi. Buckhead seems to be at peak saturation with similar restaurants, but Seven Lamps did a great job of standing out with its food and good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great seafood, good atmosphere. Food was hot and fresh. Captain's boil sauce medium spicy was great. Lots of garlic, yum! Big mussels. Snow crab legs were good, shrimp excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wandered in with a friend. We shared medium frites with pork, bacon and gravy. 8/10 would have it again. The variety in the menu is very appealing and I'll defs be back to try more!!  [END]
[BEGIN] All that stuff y'all said, plus Mariachi Music on weekends, and the only Wells Fargo Bank Branch, hell maybe the only bank branch PERIOD that is..... wait for it........ ....open on Sundays.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm addicted to the dumplings here. Great bubbletea and delicious dinners for only $8. Love the late hours! Lose one star for being cash only, who carries cash anymore?!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] delicious! i recommend going simple -- though all the flavors look amazing, it can be overwhelming! cute decor too. fun to sit and play the where-s waldo type games at the bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] i love this place. their calendar looks my ipod on shuffle. five stars for constantly booking bands i like. oh, did i just deduct a star for not being able to park anywhere close on the weekends now that the teacher's lot is closed? yes, i did.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're looking for breakfast this place is tucked away in the North End Italian neighborhood. It's pretty small, pretty basic but pretty good! Wonderful, friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really liked the Bourbon and Caramel I got here. It was like a booze milkshake. I drank the whole thing and it was great. The burger was ok. I would come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great shop - service is good, but not necessarily fast Ed is a solid business owner. Check out second location on 4th Avenue  [END]
[BEGIN] I really enjoy this Italian style cafe. The upstairs of the house makes a great place to hideaway and do some work. I love that they're serving locally roasted 49th parallel beans.  [END]
[BEGIN] My family and I loved it! I recommend the Blackened Fish and Carnita street tacos! The taste is fresh and the time proves it. They took a while cooking our food but it was worth it. That was the only problem: the time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummy pretty good for the money. Jason was our waiter we had the FISH OUT OF WATER and fries with the fried Gouda Mac and cheese  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious food, attentive staff, decent prices, and cute decor. I give two thumbs up on the goddess pizza. They also have an excellent selection of microbrews!  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for brunch and really loved the unique cocktails they had. Bloody mary was super good and the beignets I got were amazing. I read the yelp reviews recommending the beignets and they did not disappoint! Seriously amazin  [END]
[BEGIN] Good bakery, great prices. I love stopping in here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Always quick to be seated. Wait staff is very friendly. Food is yummy. This is my favorite place to go for yummy Mexican up north. Great food and great prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] Update: I visited the other day and had the Italian Grinder. It was great! I also enjoyed the Hop On! IPA. The experience was even better then last time out.  [END]
[BEGIN] mmm mmmm mmmm - VERY nice Indian food, great service (funny owner but he means well :) ) We love going there - eat as much as you can and they keep piling it on.. you wont go hungry and the food is delich! enjoy!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala with an order of naan bread. I had to order it as take out, but I was surprised at how great the quality and taste of the food was after a 10-15 minute drive home. I will definitely be back!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] A friend told me to try this place out and well i was not disappointed! My usual is the cookies n cream with vanilla soft serve. They offer free samples so gives you a chance to find what you'll like. The place can get pretty busy on the weekends.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love their soul food. It outshines their BBQ. They do their oxtails & rice perfectly with a little kick of spice. Someone put their foot in the greens. For folks that don't know the saying, it's a huge compliment to the chef. One star missing for lack of seating.  [END]
[BEGIN] The car selection was fair, but checking in and then having to wait to be escorted to a vehicle took a while, and then having to wait at the exit point to wait for paper work is taking to long. Need to use a system similar to National Car Rental.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was fun had a great time.. family friendly great place to take the kids out and enjoy the sun... only wish parking was alittle more convenient when it's pack it's pack... super busy with tons of car all fighting for parking...  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfectly acceptable DD. Quick service, good coffee, and clean establishment.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a nice change from some of the other Thai offerings in Boston. Enjoyed the freshly made foods.  [END]
[BEGIN] Victor was great! Helped me out with car mats.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ended up here on accident today because I was super early for an interview, but loved the coffee and marionberry scone I had. Better yet the service was top-notch. If I get that position down the street, I imagine I'll be a regular here.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best Chinese restaurant in coquitlam. The dishes they serve are delicious and always consistent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love Devan..... he gets 5 stars. Handy has moved up to 4 in my book because of Devan. Had some bad experiences with a no show and incompetent disorganized cleaners. When you find a good one if you can keep them coming back it works great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Noodles at their finest! Love the hole in the wall atmosphere and the food is great. So much better than Chen Z. Ill make the extra drive and you should also!  [END]
[BEGIN] i like the place in the afternoon, for late lunch... cold beer.... the menu got redone a little bit ago and i am making my way thru it!!!!! I have not been disappointed!!!! Cudos kids, keep up the good work!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Their lunch bento boxes are the bomb. Kinda expensive for dinner, but reasonable for lunch. Service is slow so get the take out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Clean. Friendly staff. Great food. Tables are small for the way they serve their meals (everything on a different plate). Overall, it was a good dining experience, and I'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really cool food truck. Can't say enough about the flavor of the tacos I ordered. Plenty of spice and flavor with a little kick but without the pain. Would definitely order again if I see them around again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cleanest pho joint I've visited so far. Love how the store is bright and clean. Service was fast and friendly. Food is decent; average quality nothing too special/memorable about it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place! So close to my house I wish I went here sooner. Food was delicious and the price was great. The people helping us were so friendly. I will definitely keep coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the ambience, Decent Veggie food. The deserts were great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just went here this weekend with friends for breakfast. Customer service was wonderful, customers around me were friendly & happy. Their menu was quality and my breakfast muffin and coffee was top shelf. So happy Bob's Red Mill is in our area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very delicious. Great ambience. The servers not very friendly. Pricey!!! $47.50 breakfast for two and no, we did not order mimosas, lol.  [END]
[BEGIN] Damn good Sandwich (Porchetta) We ordered it take-away for the Plane ride back to Honolulu. They put mustard inside which was really good. We noticed Meat & Bread as we were walking back from Nuba where we had a really good lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious pizza! My only complaint would be they need a bigger space. They would definitely thrive off of more atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love love Pizza Hut. Food is delicious fresh and fax. My kid's like to eat Pizza Hut everyday Some time they have very good deal too.  [END]
[BEGIN] decent burger...not the best but I will def go back..  [END]
[BEGIN] Bacco is good. Not the best food in the world, but certainly good. I came for restaurant week, so the prices that everyones complaining about didn't factor in. The service was a little slow, but the drinks were really good, so that made up for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] the food is different and delicious Big portions and I had left overs Will come here again  [END]
[BEGIN] Post baby snack! Milkshakes on point. They were quick to give us our order. Great service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still great after all this time. It fills up fast on Saturday night so be sure to get there early (not a moment past 6) or be prepared to wait. We were five and they happily accommodated us, if not a bit squished. Great mojitos and great food.  [END]
[BEGIN] As always, oyster was very good. Fish and chipa was just average. (Jo fortes was best, personally) Mussels was also medium taste. Beer and cocktail was delicious. Dessert was most delicious one. Server was attentive and nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] The bowls are so yummy! I come here almost once a week and have never been disappointed in them! The workers are are nice as well. My only complaints: not too crazy about the tortas and as far as the atmosphere, they often have the music on way too loud.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was mediocre and expensive. Service for great. I wish I could give 3.5 stars. I do understand that its the domain area, so I may again for the ramen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, service and wine. The interior was a bit loud, but overall, the ambiance was nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] A lovely surprise. Had a very nice meal, interesting menu, helpful/friendly staff and a very good space with plenty of parking. definitely will return and highly recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Underrated little park. Nice walking trail. Decent play areas for kids. Places to fly kites or drones, and an okay dog park. Overall not a bad little spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Taco Tuesday is great deal and get yummy four rivers BBQ to enjoy. Wish you can add a side for a dollar or two more instead of normal pricing.  [END]
[BEGIN] The server was rushing us to order. We ordered 15 wings and got one thing of ranch, seriously? Then make us pay for the second one we clearly need for 15 wings. The food was good and came out fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good German traditional food plus pub food. Great selection of beers. Sports bar atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Group fitness classes with Janelle, Brad, Abe, Colleen and Melanie all rock! If you want to work up a good sweat, drop in and don't forget your water bottle. :-)  [END]
[BEGIN] Their food is always great, but I think their service could be a little better. For some reason I am never too crazy about their hostesses, but love the place anyways because of their delicious food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its always really good. I went during lunch. Super busy. It was pretty packed. I usually get a meat combo. I like their ribs and smoked chicken wings. Brunswick stew is pretty basic. They do have nice chunks of meat in there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place. Good ambience, friendly staff and good service. The food was very good. No complaints.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the rice and black beans only. The beans were really good! I also loved the salsa bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] The wings were really good, the pulled pork sandwich was good. For some reason all the draft beers were out when I came and the bottled list isn't that impressive. A for food, C for beer selection. The space is nice and they have a cool outdoor patio area.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was yummy. Servers were friendly and thoughtful. House wine was actually good. Prices are reasonable. Atmosphere is casual but not at all dumpy.  [END]
[BEGIN] They only do natural nails but they do them so well. No machines just pure talent. The free drink is nice and the shop is nice and serene. The technicians are nice and good at what they do.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is what it is. OK service, good chicken fried chicken and mashed potatoes, Ok burger. Not bad if you are in neighborhood watching movie at regal have a quick beer and walk to Cinema. Good fries tho.  [END]
[BEGIN] We see Dr. Patil. She is warm and gentle with my son and takes plenty of time to answer our questions. Her advice has been wonderful! Great pedi, we feel blessed to have her.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good property here. Nice staff. Close to the airport.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute & cozy spot for tea--beautiful decor upstairs..middle eastern /zen/traditional vibes ..perfect spot to casually meet up and hang with a friend, or solo!  [END]
[BEGIN] Chicken here was good, but didn't live up to the world famous ego. Thin coating, juicy, seasoning was meh. Mac and cheese noodles were a bit soft sadly. Prices are pretty good. Parking royally is terrible! Like I had to pay out the azz for a lot 5 blocks away.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had Chinese brunch and it was awesome~! Yum Yum. Price was definitely cheap cheap. It's a small place, and it as packed! We got there around 1:30 so we didn't have to wait long for lunch to be served. But I would go back for food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great tasting ice cream place located in the market. I'd say go with the regular vanilla and get crazy with the toppings! The employees were really patient and let us try all the flavors out. Cool spot to grab a quick cone or scoop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, great atmosphere, especially watching and hearing the construction. We got the kid's grilled cheese, chicken pot pie, and superthin choc chip cookie. All were very good. My one caveat is that this place is most definitely $$. They were small portions for a total of $38.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely love the restaurant. However, I feel that the restaurant off exit 10 on 400 does a better job. I've been to that Hajime about 6 times now, and prefer to drive further to that one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good pizza and friendly service make me happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I loved the food. We had Thai Iced Tea, Larb Hed, Pad Puk, Jungle Curry, corn fritter tamale and ended it with Sticky rice with mango. Simply delicious meal :) I want to go again!! :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to get a burger and the margarita I had was made from scratch and tasted great. Very fresh ingredients. I recommend showing up before Noon to avoid the lines.  [END]
[BEGIN] Update: Pizzas are now available for lunch and dinner for eating-in! I am so glad the business has changed their policy and I can not wait to have Friday-night-pizza-night again! Thank you for being receptive to your patrons' feedback!  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved my time at Brigham and Women's. The staff were great. They were always professional and caring. Whenever they put in IV's they were as gentle as you can be putting in an IV.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is great place to eat for a simple 'just like home' meal. Parking is a bit difficult and usually busy so anticipate waiting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here like 100 times in my life. Order up at the counter and sit down to get served, cause the pizza is great. It's also just a fun spot. Great for families or just hanging out with some friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] We get food here every week, great Chinese food, chicken wings are my favorite. Sushi is just ok. Great atmosphere and nice bar. It is one of the best foods in the are of Rt 138.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good decor, prices and quaint laid back service. I really like to huge wind breaker curtain at the door, this is something most Boston restaurants should invest in because of the windy draft when someone opens the door. I was happy with this place, great for brunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Family vibe ,bar seperate ,great specials,nice people,some days kids eat free,great parking , its quiet ,good prices, will me and my 4 kids go back yes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Burgers and Service was good. No refills on lemonade :-( The place was very busy but the service was still alright. Is return for their burgers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome chips....very light,and not excessively salty like many other places and very fresh food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Never know what you will find. This establishment had four stars on Yelp so gave it a shot. I had the braised beef in noodle soup with the steamed dumplings. Looking forward to other surprises in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] i always go here for sox games! i love it. the downstairs is the place to be and wherever you sit, you will have good view of the tv's b/c they have soo many!! service is good, and the drinks are reasonably priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good default breakfast place. There service is always very good. They have a large menu. Nothing is truly amazing here, but everything I've had is good. There is something on the menu for most people here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Whenever I fly into Portland, I take the earliest flight and drive straight to the Tin Shed. Delicious Blood Marys and very good food. Anything I've ordered has not disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere, good food, and excellent Italian wine! Waiter was very friendly, and service was excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] I came in from passing by. The location is very clean. The offer daily specials and the food is fresh as well as the salsas. Friendly staff- definitely recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty rad place if you want to see beards, tattoos, suicide girls, punks, & art snobs all in the same place. My kind of mix. Bring cash bc you cannot run credit cards.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved this Place .. Seats were kinda crappy but the food is to die for! Naked Lobster Roll and Calamari !  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place. Everything is solid, food, service, atmosphere. More like a place after your in a relationship or with friends. Good solid neighborhood sushi place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hopdoddy is a little more expensive than I would prefer to spend on a burger, but the truffle fries alone make it worth it!! They have tons of options and every bit of food we ordered was amazing. So glad they have one in Round Rock now!!  [END]
[BEGIN] My favorite South End go to! The ever changing, seasonal menu makes it ideal to have on your repeat offenders list (they change the menu every 4-6 weeks - just enough time to discover a favorite and have once or twice more). Drinks great and atmosphere very very cozy!  [END]
[BEGIN] They were able to schedule me within a week, took my insurance and did a thorough exam. They also did a great job with my filling and cleaning. Would recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] So I don't have much to compare it to, but I couldn't expect much more out of whatever one might consider the standard. THE friendliest staff I've encountered in most establishments in the city, and they all know what they're talking about.  [END]
[BEGIN] The queso- hands down best I've had. The veggie taco salad is so good and the dressing is very good. But the down side is the inside is very small and clustered. The outside seating is good though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food and drinks. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. Had the French dip prime rib which was amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I couldn't find anywhere to eat around 11:00PM in boston (Whoah, what a surprise!) so my friend and I decided to go to Stella. I ordered a burger and it was dynamite. Good service as well. Can't complain.  [END]
[BEGIN] great bread and pizza. and inexpensive too. i agree about the service being a bit odd. sometimes they're friendly and sometimes they're not.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good but I feel slightly over priced. I only come for the waffles, because they are awesome and I think their price is very reasonable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome place to start the night. Great service, good food, perfect happy hour and the ambiance is delightful. A definite stop to check out when touristing around Portland.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very adorable cafe in an Heritage House. Lovely patio outside. Good sandwiches and coffee, plus very nice staff make this a favorite of mine!  [END]
[BEGIN] We went in on one of the busiest nights of the October madness. We sat at the oyster bar and the two guys working that were fantastic. Drinks and food were slow but hey, it's October in Salem. Every place in town had two-three hour waits.  [END]
[BEGIN] I recently tried a different chinese restaurant Lee's Garden. I ordered egg flower soup and egg roll. Didn't come close to Chu's. Egg flower soup is awesome and egg roll lightly crispy on the outside and yummy inside. Always good service and plenty of food.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff is super friendly and drinks are usually cold and properly made and reasonably priced! Great beer selection and wonderful gals behind the bar!! Just what bee cave needs!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I really enjoyed this place! The restaurant itself was very nice- a lot nicer inside than I expected. The server was extremely patient and prompt. Never a long wait for anything- drinks and food were great! I will definitely be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good! Small menu but the food and service were excellent! I had the chicken katsu and my boyfriend had the takoyaki and udon soup. I recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a huge party - over 20 people, and they were more than accommodating. We had 2-3 servers always helping us and making sure we had our drinks and food. Love the wings, obviously, and there were plenty of TVs around for us to enjoy the football game on.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far I had the lobster roll, Miso Seared Salmon Rice Paper Wrap and crispy slaw. Everything is perfect. The Miso Seared Salmon Rice Paper Wrap is like a flavor explosion.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service and the food was excellent.... best place on the water.  [END]
[BEGIN] The won ton noodle soup and dumpling noodle soup was very good. The dumplings were all very tasty and very large. The noodles were firm and not soggy. The soup was a bit plain though since it only had noodles and dumplings with nothing else.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a good and intersining movie blindspotting. Staff was very good with my indecisiveness about what to order. The French toast was too sweet but the shake was delicious though. Great promos as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok, lets get through this. The pizza is on point. Its not the best in the world, maybe not the best in town even, but you cant go wrong with any pie on their list. Good service, good food, lots of parking, cant go wrong.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overly crowded and priced but still a one of the best places to a have family trip to. My daughter enjoyed the shows and we enjoyed watching her face light up with awe as she watched the animals. The dolphin/whale show is a must see.  [END]
[BEGIN] We went here to celebrate my husband graduating from college. The food was great! Tons of options for unique burgers (including bison!). Rather pricey but definitely a must try!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great breakfast tacos! The bacon is a strip instead of little pieces and the potatoes are nicely browned and a bit crispy. Haven't yet tried anything beyond the tacos but looking forward to the rest of the menu :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Aside from the icy glare of the other Asian chick behind the counter, my experience with The Meadow one sweet evening breezing into Portland was made even sweeter with some of their best international chocolate brands and tasting salts (Maboroshi Plum made to sprinkle over white fish and fruits).  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here. I had Pad Thai with Tofu. It was GOOD. And I'm picky about Pad Thai. Service was efficient and friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been many times and never disappointed. Best all you can eat Japanese from soup to dessert. Delicious, fresh sushi and everything else on the menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went with good friend for ladies night out. Great tapas..loved ambience and wine options... will skip sushi next time. Everything else was great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service, great ambiance and some pretty good burgers! I love that I can order it with no bun. They are very moist and full of flavor...not to mention the awesome fries!!! Yummm....  [END]
[BEGIN] Great decor. Great staff. Great atmosphere. I liked this place. Highly recommended for anyone who likes a bar that's a little rough around the edges but doesn't scream "too cool for school" or "ALTAMONT."  [END]
[BEGIN] My favourite ramen place. Love their miso ramen with all the toppings.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a gem of a place. Only wish they had music or something playing, but creates good area for conversations to be heard. Teriyaki chicken box was super tasty. Perfect amount of food if you have an appetite Service was on point.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'd have to agree with the general consensus. The Momo's are great (and the other food) and the service is slow. 2 for service. 4 for food.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got Burger Joy delivery and the service was awesome! It was delivered sooner than expected and it was piping hot. I got the house special lo mein and it was awesome! Decent Chinese food, affordable, and great service, couldn't ask for more for a quick dinner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Legit. Previous reviews are right in the money. Delicious with a capital D. I tried the lemon pepper and garlic parm wings and they were perfect. Ambiance and possibly cleanliness behind the scenes prevent a 5 star, but I'd definitely go back over any other local options for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a good Ethiopian restaurant. Not the best as it is hit and miss qith the food sometimes. Service ia great. I usually get my order to go.  [END]
[BEGIN] what happens to krispy kreme? i like variety of brands donuts.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great place to buy whatever you need in the north end. I also like the cat that runs around the store freely, often sitting on the counter where you are supposed to pay for your stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a very good dining experience at Myers + Chang. Pork belly buns are out of this world. Can't stop thinking about those). My friend loved the noodles. The decor is very inviting and relaxing. Excellent place to get a drink.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid Italian food, nice atmosphere. The carpaccio and bolognese were good, the homemade gnocchi was the stand-out. The only drawback here is that it gets super noisy. We had a hard time hearing our waitress and our table of 8.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered here from work once. Got the steak and cheese with mushroom sub. Portions are big. Quick delivery.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is also one of my go-to places for a burger. I love their super melt. It is like a combination of a grilled cheese sandwich and a Big Mac. Their tater tots are really good as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] The scrambled egg tortilla (I always get it sans avocado) is the best! It's a wonderful breakfast to take to go.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this Jamba Juice. Used to live rift down the road and still roll by a few times a month. Clean store. Friendly staff. Good product. I love the all fruit smoothie, strawberry whirl.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service and tasty meals..had the pancakes with walnuts and roast beef Reuben sandwhich...been here 3 times and always satisfied with the food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Brand new Ace Hardware nearby so I needed a 13mm wrench and thought it would be the best opportunity. Hey had a great selection and they even had one made in the USA with internal ratcheting. Can't beat that. I will definitely be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Port Coquitlam can be small at time, but at least there is a great, cheap, friendly small Thai restaurant. The waitress and chef are very friendly. The food is great, well cooked and not greasy. And best thing of all it is cheap. I like very much this little restaurant  [END]
[BEGIN] They have a good Colombian coffee! I bought dancing goats blend bag and it was good! The attention is great ;)  [END]
[BEGIN] Traveling through Salem, Ma, we stopped in for dinner. The food was very delicious. The presentation was beautiful. Devon, our waiter was great. I wish I lived closer so I could enjoy it more often.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this Publix. It stays very busy but still quick and easy to get out of. The keep the place clean and organized.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pleasant experience! Friendly, timely, hot food, and great taste. Had it delivered to our hotel. We ordered chicken, smoked bacon, and pineapple. So good. They even gave us plates and napkins.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything about it (service, food, coffee) is great! But waiting over an hour is just too much. Wish there was some room for reservations online and walk-ins.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is very decent for an airport. Service was excellent, the food was cooked very well and served hot, wine list is ok. This is probably the best airport restaurant you are going to hit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Family-owned Dunwoody staple. Must try the Dragon Roll! I ordered the shrimp teriyaki Bento Box, and it was the perfect amount and combination of food!  [END]
[BEGIN] One of P-towns best breakfast spots for sure. Awsome homemade hollandase sauce. As another reviewer mentioned, you have to smuggle ketsup in, but it's small beans compared to all that is good. Get the biali ... topnotch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious food! A real arabic restaurant. Taste like only the arab food tastes. The only thing that need some improvement is the floor cleaning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great beers on tap. Been a huge fan of The beer for a long time and even if this place is not that close to where I live I always make a trip!  [END]
[BEGIN] The place is very clean and the employees really try to get you in and out quickly. It is a non traditional fast food joint meaning you get a "meat and veggie" meal instead of a burger and fries. The prices are not that bad either.  [END]
[BEGIN] What can I say but DONUTS - lots of choices, some are over the top but I guess that is why Voodoo Donuts is so popular. Pricey for a donut but they are one of a kind! Definitely a "weird Austin" experience for residents and visitors.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice bartender. Can't go wrong with a beer called "Lotion in the Basket." Stubbs BBQ is in the back, which you will have to go order separately and bring your table. They have a nice patio as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well I'm back... And all is right with the world... Nice new friendly, sweet employees and my wangs EXTRA WET...  [END]
[BEGIN] Ate at the bar, great service! Very friendly! Sushi was amazing!! Find them on concourse E!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was good and the place was cozy! Definitely a small place so I wouldn't recommend it for a large group.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great option if you want something hearty yet somewhat healthy. Very customizable. Also beer and wine. Outdoor seating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried this place after seeing great reviews. Sandwiches did not disappoint. Had the corned beef #15 and smoked salmon #47 with curried lentil soup. Both large enough for two, and delicious. Would definitely come again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bae and I had the wraps, his was beef and mine was chicken. They were both outstanding! Table sauce was spicyyy just like I like it. Definitely coming back to try the rice bowls!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun place for KIDS The LAZER TAG is great. BUT , A bit pricey  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is flavorful and really tasty, price is good. Environment is a little noisy for me, but overall I think it's a nice place to eat in. Didn't care too much about their desserts though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty busy... But well organized. Everyone was friendly. I got my meals to go since I wanted some quiet time. It is a bit noisy but not too bad. I will take pics of food once I'm home and critique. ;)  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here a few times. One of my favorite is the blackberry apple. Its good and its different than your average pie. Their coffee isn't bad either.  [END]
[BEGIN] In a rush. Use slick computers to add to order or pay!  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious Green curry chicken with brown rice. Bathroom was clean. Nice, friendly waitstaff. Comfortable environment open and airy-yet a bit intimate.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been wanting to go to this place for a while and was not disappointed. Great food and service. The lamp pops are amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only had a brief visit, but it was very conveniently located and the coffee was great. Service was great, too. I'd definitely return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like this theatre a lot as they usually have all the new indie films that aren't at your usual neighborhood theatre. Also helps that there are lots of bars and restaurants nearby. Traffic and parking not great but that's what happens with trendy areas!  [END]
[BEGIN] A good place to go for a #justwannahavedinneralone situation. The owner/chief is really nice and able to customize your order for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] I liked my room, even though I didn't buy much because of the price I did like their gift shop and I stopped by three of their restaurants. I was there for a conference and I like the size of the rooms that the sessions were held in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Working in the area, I have gone there several times for lunch and have yet to be disappointed. The food has always been good and the service is consistently great! It's not too expensive considering the location, so I would definitely recommend this place!  [END]
[BEGIN] We had lunch here today and really enjoyed it! It was too hot outside so i only had a cobb salad. It was fresh. My boyfriend had a rib  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, the cheesesteak is a must. Cheesy meatball sub was a good choice too. Waiter John was courteous and funny, definitely coming back when we're in the neighborhood. Looking forward to the cheesecake brownie next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a bad experience here and they made it a priority to make it up to me. I usually stop by here for a coffee in the morning and they are very nice and even let me use my own thermos.  [END]
[BEGIN] We eat there every week and always see a dedicated seating of regular customers. Jess is great and it is a cozy and tasty change from the usual chain restaurants. They aim to please. The food is addictive and we are sure to frequent them at least once a week.  [END]
[BEGIN] The most authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Boston --and yes, it's this location only. The others are good too, but there's something about this location that's special. Plus you'll notice that it's filled with tons of Asians --which I always take as a very good sign.  [END]
[BEGIN] I miss the pre-fire set-up where you could order from your table, but this place is still great. Try the number 33!  [END]
[BEGIN] I buy my chicken food here and it's a fast stop. Run in, pay and pull around back where a guy will probably already have you feed ready to load. That's good service and that's why I buy here now instead of the big farm store in Battle Ground.  [END]
[BEGIN] I go here to work every couple of weeks when I want a treat. They have good wifi, a gorgeous grilled cheese sandwich, and a delicious coffee cocktail. I CRAVE their coffee cocktails. If they had comfy seating, I'd probably be in there every day.  [END]
[BEGIN] very nice, casual lunch. Creative pizzas and a glass of wine. Not the same vibe as the one in Charlestown, but then again, this is Wellesley and I'm not in college.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean fast service hasn't tried them in awhile still giving White Castle a run for the taste  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here twice & have enjoyed both times. Went for a girls night out and ordered a bunch of apps & drinks. Our server Mindy was really friendly & kept checking in on us throughout the night. Will definitely come back!  [END]
[BEGIN] I like Jillians for going with a group of people. I have only been here for bday partys. If you're lucky enough to get a lane, the bowling is really fun. The bars on all level are huge so it's never hard to get a drink. I'll keep going here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there for lunch and food was fabulous. Would be a five star but the wait is too long and you can't make reservations.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are ever in East Vancouver with pizza on your mind, Twilight Pizza is your go to place! The T-Rex pizza was top notch. Service was better than expected, and we got right in on a Friday night! We had a wonderful experience that will bring us back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool little bar. Nice tap and has live music on the weekends. I really like their menu. It's unique, has lobster rolls and crab cakes. I haven't eaten there yet but plan to.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best hamburger in Austin, so far. A regular medium cheese hamburger and fries does it for me. The last one I had was eaten in about 5 minutes. I couldn't believe I ate it all and so fast, but I did!  [END]
[BEGIN] The eclair was this side of heaven but still not the best part of the bakery for me. Nice booths, sunlight streaming in, comfortable, relaxing ... and then oh! What's that? A Russian lady playing traditional / folk songs on guitar? Awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Maintenance is very friendly and is always willing to help with anything needed in my apartment in a timely manner. Front office staff is very friendly. The coffee machine in the office is also a huge plus!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place to get a quick lunch for tacos! PRO TIP: They'll have a special promo on twitter, mention it at the cashier and you'll get that twitter promo deal! Some of the deals are pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] So interesting and informative. Our tour guide, Tony, was awesome. We didn't have lunch there but the menu had many delicious options and the food looked great. There were families on our tour and the youngsters were even engaged.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great beer and staff. Super dog-friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] ​Work in the area and definitely on ​the take-out list for us at the office. Fast service. Good food. It is what it is.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tasty Indian food! Would eat here again. Good portions and presentation. Delicious naan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good donuts! Great flavors to choose from. Some pretty simple and others very complex and unique. Decent part of town and very nice and clean inside! The only downside- the coffee was very bad, I had to dump it out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff is always very nice. Food is great. Large portions. They have a seasonal wine/beer permit, which isn't always convenient. The decor fits well, though I personally would of went with a darker wood stain and the bar area could be a little bigger. Minor stuff. I dig it though.  [END]
[BEGIN] considering we just came back from kyoto and osaka, this place held its own. the basic ramen broth keeps the flavor strict to its origins. the pork melts in your mouth!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is great! The tapas are generous portions and delicious. My boyfriend and I always get the meat paella for one which is plenty for both of us and we usually take some home. Great atmosphere. Even the bread and olive oil are delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool place for a Wednesday night. Live band, full bar. Karaoke guys that sang "living on a prayer" should get a record label. Seriously, that good.  [END]
[BEGIN] lovely little place from a classic Deep Cove building. They've lovingly restored the building and have built a nice little business from within. Good food, pricey, but I am so happy to have some quality food at hand way down here in The Cove! Thank you!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is awesome!!! I ate here for the first time last week and the food was amazing. Very authentic compared to other most "mexican" in Texas, which are really tex-mex. Everything on the menu sounds good and the servers were great. Loved it!  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here several times and have never had a problem. I love cinnabon, and added to the atmosphere of city walk, it's a nice night out.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stopped here today and tried the Chicken-Mango Quesadilla. Just the right amount of crispy and very flavorful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it! A must go while you're in the area. There are so many different varieties and so many yummy flavors. Be warned that if you go in the mid-afternoon the selection may be limited.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great comfortable place for wings and a beer. Staff is super friendly and the whole place has a good vibe. All walks of life are welcomed here and fit in seamlessly. Wish this chain existed in Cincy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great burgers, good beer selection. Saw a great band play recently - 3 guitars, bass and drummer, not sure of their name - but they were excellent. Pretty tiny kitchen, so I can see them getting backed up with a big crowd. Love the atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pizza, tons of different choices to choose from, will def. be coming back for more  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to chill out and enjoy few drinks and snacks with listening to live music during the weekends.  [END]
[BEGIN] If I could have their iced tea every day I would! I absolutely love it!! Along with their pineapple fried rice and their mango curry shrimp. My roomate loves the sauteed chicken and the southern pad-thai. Delicious! Totally recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool vibe, great drinks , but the food is overpriced (A LOT). Go somewhere else for dinner, but here for a chill night with some great drinks with friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff. The usual expectations of Starbucks. Pastries were better than most though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was really good especially the shrimp tempura. We also had really awesome chicken fried rice, shrimp lo mein and steamed pork dumplings. The service was great and the food was hot and fresh. I'll be visiting again very soon!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place to get some work done. Decent wifi, comfortable chairs, power available at most tables. I'm knocking off a star only because they don't have many choices in the way of tea and don't carry any kombucha.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lanche de frango excelente, vale a pena experimentar!  [END]
[BEGIN] I met clients here on their recommendation. I had an iced tea, we sat outside by the fountain. There is ample seating inside and out, I would come again if I was in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent place if you're in need of a ramen fix, but don't want to stand in the lines at the other places. Portion size is enormous and the Sprouting Ramen is delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was looking for a place to watch a Steelers game away from home. This was a great place to do so. Friendly, great food, comfortable, with all the games showing on tvs spread throughout the place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would really like to give it a 3.5. The coffee was pretty good. limited selection. not very friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have dreams about going here. Fast and friendly and the ramen is so yummy! Not as authentic as I would like, but still wicked yummy. No egg in the ramen :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Jacks is the place to be. The food is exceptional, I recommend the calzones! Or one of their funky pizza slice creations (hotdog pizza ect)! They have some good alcohol prices and a good atmosphere. During dinner it's always packed though so be prepared to sit out back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service, dogs allowed, no pre made tequila mix, and filling tacos What more can you ask for?  [END]
[BEGIN] After searching for a salon I've finally found it!! Clean friendly staff with quality products. The massages were great. Relaxing atmosphere. I would def recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place for breakfast. Personalized caring service. Food: great basic stuff. Great hash. Setting: clean and genuine north end. Prices: Very reasonable.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have eaten at the Jacksonville Beach, St. Augustine, and the Altamonte Springs locations. The menu is diverse and the portions are large. It is always busy. Worth trying!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good tacos. Reasonable pricing. Al Pastor is my favorite.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome diner with great breakfast. Never had anything bad here. Stick with the staples. Doesn't hurt that they have only attractive girl servers every time I've been in here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food!! The steak was delish!!! Food came out cold and the manage was nice to redo the dish and have to say it was very good. Guacamole was a winner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Store was clean and well laid out. Shopkeepers were very helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean operation. Professional and nice staff. Will definitely go back!  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the vibe at Judy Jetsons, and Maureen was able to give me the cut exactly as I asked for it. Very skilled & asked the right questions, not pushy at all. Paid $48, I've paid more for cuts I didn't like.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there with the wife while I was in town for work. The crab cakes were on point and the lobster roll was delicious. The staff was awesome and we never wanted something, it was brought the table before we even asked.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is so good like the waffles and bubble tea!! But the service is kind of slow.  [END]
[BEGIN] Breakfast was excellent today. I tried the Veggie omelet and it was very tasty. Our waitress was attentive and we seated right away on a Sunday morning at 11:30.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic places in NOPO for veggies (vegan and vegetarian). Even if you're in a rush, run in and grab a pre made sandwich or nori wrap! So delish, just a little pricey.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love baby greens! The only reason I gave them 4 stars is bc they are just so darn pricey! Plus the girl in the drive thru always gives my dog a treat, which makes him a happy camper:)  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was excellent and the service was on point. Very flavorful. The only thing i would caution is with the prices. It's listed wrong I think. Almost everything costs at least $10.  [END]
[BEGIN] A nice cafe setting, since there is a diverse selection of beverages too. - loud music - no milk available for your coffee, only powdered creamer  [END]
[BEGIN] Had my watch battery replaced here a few times and had zero issues. Also, the sales people were happy to answer other questions I had about some items while I waited.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been there, done that... Excellent happy hour food on Wednesdays. The price is right and the ice tea was perfect!  [END]
[BEGIN] Found ourselves on bunker hill at dinnertime. This was the closest restaurant with decent rating. Thrilled with the history of the place. Casual, great for kids, inexpensive, food was yummy, and Guinness what more could you want? Bacon,cheddar burger cooked perfectly, and shepard's pie delicious! Wait staff friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Adorei pullled delicioso , costela no ponto, acompanhamentos deliciosos, preço justo. Costela macia e suculenta  [END]
[BEGIN] MANGO SEASON!! Ripe and delicious! Stop by with the family and everyone enjoyed the Mango bubble shake. We tried bubble waffle .. little bit on the sweeter side then expected. Other then the cramped space, we love the drinks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place to grab a quick snack or drink. I have tried their teas, almond biscotti and almond croissant. A great spot to meet up with friends or work. It is lively in here so if you're looking for a quiet place to work bring your headset. Friendly staff  [END]
[BEGIN] Go for the view, stay for the food. Fish was cooked perfectly. Meal was fabulous. Cheese plate came with toasted raisin bread. Asked the server if it was possible to get a different bread. Absolutely was the answer. Out came non-toasted raisin bread.  [END]
[BEGIN] Who knew you could find nice GF baked goods and smoothies at a pharmacy? Nice austin vibe, ill be back. smoothies are pricey at 6+ bucks  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. I love the carne asada tacos. Would love an online order option.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious Khao Soi Gai soup. The tofu was quite nice in this combination (special request). Service was a tad slow for the entreees. A little bit more pricey than other Thai places, but very nice nonetheless. Looking forward to trying more. Appetizers were average (we had some triangle)  [END]
[BEGIN] Good beef and chicken sticks, great fried salmon. Price is a little high for such small portion but the taste made it for it. I would visit again if I was in the area. Good for college town food truck.  [END]
[BEGIN] We loved it. Had the lamp plate and the Mousaka plate. Both were tender and tasty goodness. Ordering up at the counter is simple style. Building keeps it feeling home like. We will be back to try some more.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best place for calamari!! It just melts in your mouth!! And the pasta dishes are awesome!! Great service and atmosphere..what more can you ask for!?!  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid sports bar with good food. The pdx (fried) broccoli was dynamite! The pork rinds were tasty, but quite large. And the street tacos had a couple extras. Almost wish I would have ordered more friend broccoli.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place for quick ramen. Selection of broths and toppings is excellent. Would recommend spicy miso ramen with spicy noodles.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tight seating but has delicious tofu soup. The spicy is more like medium spicy to me at first and the heat quickly felt like a mild. Next time I'm going with extra spicy!  [END]
[BEGIN] They recently switched the male/female sides and I like it much more. They always have a great sale items section. On several occasions, I have gotten great deals, such as full, pleated skirts and a blue fitted puffed-sleeved jacket for $20 each. Try your luck here or the Rockingham Mall.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is seriously a great deli. The sandwiches are piled high with meat. So much that it may be difficult to get your mouth around it. The staff are always so friendly and helpful, especially the server Chrissy.  [END]
[BEGIN] They took us without a reservation and it was great. I will definitely go back. I asked for massage and got head to toe pampering.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service and good food. I've order the same thing each time: the beef&lamb kebab. I get the house sauce, spring greens, cucumber, and jalapeños.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food with huge potions. Place is REALLY small though so beware you will be sitting next to a stranger  [END]
[BEGIN] The soft serve was good 'n cheap. Just what the doctor ordered on a hot summer's day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Such a good place! The restaurant is really beautiful with two huge aquariums. Staff are so helpful and give me some recommendations. Everything was nicely presented and good. In summary, good food, good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good home style breakfast. Had the Egg BLT. It was great except it came with mayonaise. I probably should have expected that, but mayo in the morning was kind of off putting. The home fries with some Frank's Red Hot hit the spot and got me going though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummy breakfasts/brunches. I have eaten there 5 or 6 times. Every meal has been delicious! The only detractor is that it can take a while to get your food, but it's always worth the wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good Thai food. Had been looking a decent place in Mount Pleasant area and here it is! Had the green curry, pad thai and coconut chicken mushroom soup - all great. The springs rolls are meh - kinda oily and a more like an egg roll.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a hidden spot soon to disappear. I love the underground short bar. Bricks everywhere ..the feeling of an old time under ground blind pig  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent Upscale Food and Awesome Bartenders and Drinks. Also, Don't forget most Friday and Saturday nights Great Live Bands.....  [END]
[BEGIN] Although I've never been big on Mexican food, I'm a fan of Sol Azteca. Seating on an outdoor patio + gazpacho + refreshing Sangria = great summer meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] used just one time my 15 shirts, press and light starch - good price $1,75 per one men shirt! pretty happy with result!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great array of food. The typical bar fare that you will find most places but good quality at a decent price. They have a great drink and beer menu with many specials. This is a great place to watch a game, sporting event or just hang out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wish I would have taken a picture to share. The Beef Pasty was tasty. Will definitely be back before we head home. Potato salad was yummy as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'n not quite a burguer person, but this place was really good. I had the burguer with kobe, incredible. Not a fan of the line system, but it was really quick considering it was a saturday at lunchtime. The service is really good. Probably will be going back  [END]
[BEGIN] Yum!! Their vegan gluten free Quinoa-Flax Bread was a surprise. It is light & airy. The vegan gf Oreo cookie was so-so. Coffee cake was very good. I'm trying the Focaccia Bread tonight and the Quinoa Bread (just w/out flax) this weekend. Will update... Girls there are very nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff were very nice. The good was also great. It's very easily accessible on Robson St and we just ran into the spot because we were walking back to our hotel. Try it out!  [END]
[BEGIN] the food is good ! nice serviced i love the mushroom satted with spinach and baby pork. Beautiful place open until 12am Abslutely be back !  [END]
[BEGIN] I went to M&D's for my birthday dinner celebration and had a fantastic time. I highly recommend the buffalo chicken dip and their fantastic mac and cheese menu. It was just all sorts of deliciousness!!  [END]
[BEGIN] A cool place for any meal. Love the funky underground atmosphere and the food is always great. Alamo Benedict is a spicy fav and beautiful coffees.  [END]
[BEGIN] As a Chicagoan, my standard for a good burger is quite high. This is a solid go to as far as price and product are concerned. Get extra house sauce to dunk those fries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible experience from last visit in January. Came back because of my friends. Huge improvement to the service & food. Must be new staff because I don't recognize any of them. I'll upload the food porn. It's a huge difference from my old ones.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love starbucks and this is great location. The staff are so welcoming and nice. they have a lot of places to sit which is good because some times it can be hard to find a table. i higly recommend this starbucks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, convenient location. Public parking located nearby, what else to ask for?  [END]
[BEGIN] Swung by Zen for a quick weekday lunch. For $15 I got soup, salad and 3 maki rolls. Food was fresh, service was prompt, will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect place to get some good snacks for those long late nights at Piedmont I always sneak out to go get me the Newport Turkey with Honey Mustard with Grapes and chips plus they have good good coffee..  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Breakfast, Pasta is like your mother made, nice people, good service..  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want daytime gyros in downtown Boston, this is probably your best bet. Zo doesn't do anything unusual, just a traditional gyro made fast and with rock solid quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there for breakfast! Very busy but great food! Definitely will go back again! Had the number three and was very satisfied.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really liked this place. The food was tasty, the service was great, and the place was inviting. The tea-smoked spare ribs were a winner as was the celery and edamame slaw. Would definitely go back.  [END]

[BEGIN] I've had really good experiences at this place, with drycleaning and with alterations too. The people are really nice and try to help you out. They don't speak much English, but that usually works out fine. Prices are about normal for this area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have ordered this late night dozens of times. Always consistently OK. However, when you need a late night craving fix..this is the place  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're craving Pho soup, this is your place. I've got them on speed dial and come at least twice a month. Love their friendly attitude. Chai (one of the owners) is the sweetest man, too! Make sure you get their bubble tea: Taro is delish!  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for two nights while in Columbus for work. Pros: -clean room -free wifi with Hyatt Gold -convenient valet for $23/night or parking garage across street for $12/night -noon checkout Cons: -new gym running equipment -gym towels not clean -small pool  [END]
[BEGIN] We've been several times at this small but very friendly German restaurant. Food, specially their unique and own creation - the dill soup - is extremely good. You will be served by Otto & Anita's daughter, as Otto & Anita never leave the kitchen were they do their magic.  [END]
[BEGIN] The long wait of twenty minutes was definitely worth it. This is the best ramen place I have ever been to.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love their burgers! Also they have amazing desserts and their ice tea is delicious. My favoritespot when I need a gourmet burger. Expect to pay up but it is worth it  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent food, spotty service. Nice decor, cool commercial complex.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent Happy Hour. Friendly service, great prices and good food & drink selection. Parking can be a pain, but if you go for happy hour and park at the bank next to UBC, after hours then it's usually no problem.  [END]
[BEGIN] Music live and cocktails this rocks the food for a small place will pleasantly surprise you I also like that the owner has a hands on attitude  [END]
[BEGIN] Had delivery and food was very fresh and wonderfully tasting. Tempura cheesecake was priced lower than other places but could taste granules of sugar! Entree was vegetable tempura and fried brown rice. That was good though, very.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service is always top notch here; Lindsey was our server and she was great. Definitely start with the Antipasto platter, the carrots are amazing! Dinners are good, portions are plentiful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Descent breakfast tacos. Had the bacon and egg, and spinach and egg. Large portions. Great corn tortillas. Self-serve salsas weren't labeled. One I grabbed was too hot, and one was too mild.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fellini's has excellent pizza! We got a couple of pies to go and they were great. The salad was average. Not too much special there, but the pizzas were super. You can count on Fellini's for high quality pie.  [END]

[BEGIN] I've been for lunch twice now and can sum it up in three simple words: fast, cheap, good. The end.  [END]

[BEGIN] Went back this Memorial Day weekend and it was just as good as ever. Excellent customer service and I just love those King Crab Legs. Their new version is a Caesar salad is amazing!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is place is easily one of my favorite spots. Its quality without pretension. The guy who holds down the fort is always courteous and friendly and just- it's refreshing. I only wish I still lived in the neighborhood so I could go more often!  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool concept. Food is really good too. I love buying the pita pocket and just stuffing it to the max. Not a vegetarian at all but if you are I think this spot is for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been going here for a very long time. The food is always delicious. I get the Migas scramble with chorizo every time. Awesome brunch and vegetarian, vegan, gluten free options as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered an omelette with grits and biscuits. The omelette was standard and the biscuits were outstanding. However, I wasn't a fan of the grits (not because they're bad, they're just not for me). Next time I'm in Atlanta, I'll be sure to visit again for a huge basket of biscuits!  [END]
[BEGIN] Came in for a quick snack and was not disappointed! I ordered the X-Everything burger to share with someone and two Brazilian sodas. Everything was very tasty and I plan on going back to try their coffee and pastries!  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved this hotel. The bed and pillows were a dream. Lots of amenities. They have a Starbucks on site, nice convenience store inside. The food for the conference was ok, couldn't tell if it was being made by hotel restaurant but it was just ok. Nice variety of stuff though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice ambiance in th dining area and also in the big bar area. Definitely a place to bring clients or your spouse. I am a fan of their flat bread entrees and they also make a decent pot of coffee.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been getting my nails done here for over a year now. They are very nice and very good product for the price. I would recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hospital with doctors and nurses that are caring and compassionate. My only issue is with cost of parking for family members who spend hours and hours there, can add up pretty quickly. But wouldn't trust anyone else with healthcare  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been eating here off and on for years. The staff has always been friendly and the food is what you would typically find in a Boston sub shop. The pizza is a great deal and the steak and cheese sub is also very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like Helser's. I like the Louisiana hot link. And the Scotch eggs, and the Dutch baby's! Mimosa's are bonus!  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummy breakfast sandwich. I took them up on the offer of free tea or soda if mentioning Yelp and asked if I could have coffee instead. They were kind enough to do so.  [END]
[BEGIN] had sum soop wit some lamms innit n' it wuz gewd.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for watching a game, especially with the shortage of good sports bars in Portland. One complaint would be that they play the audio for the commercials, which is crazy obnoxious. Please fix this! Thanks for an otherwise good football night  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid spot. The T&T burrito was delicious, but be prepared for a lot of cheese. Good chips and salsa too  [END]
[BEGIN] Atmospheres florals did a great job with our wedding. It was above and beyond what I imagined really. They remembered every detail that I even forgot on the day of. Loved it!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was awesome and affordable. I have never been to a place that has such nice staff everyone we met just went above and beyond. Family friendly atmosphere. Would go to again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Seaworld is fantastic! Definitely a place to go if you want to get wet. It has the perfect combination between shows and rides, which provides a day full of fun. The food is really good, and the park is great for all ages.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good falafel and shawarma's. Definitely among the top in Boston. Take-out is tempting, but the shawarma usually gets soggy and makes a mess on your (at least) my clothes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food and service. Beef Milanese and Duck Breast were outstanding. Baked Brie appetizer needed to bake a bit longer. Reasonably priced for what you get  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pizza, especially at 1am after a few shots and beers!! Neat environment inside, although campus isn't my favorite spot, if I'm in the area and craving pizza I'll def stop in!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a nice environment and good food but it is very crowded and needs a long waiting time. But over all good place if you can find a seat  [END]
[BEGIN] We went just for the $2.85 breakfast special. Pros... Great price for breakfast Coffee was good Cute coffee mugs Service was good Cons... Bacon tasted funny Ambiance was very plain Would we go back? Yes  [END]
[BEGIN] Vasso was wonderful. She spent a long time on my facial (much longer than a regular spa) and thoroughly cleaned my skin and offered suggestions (and samples!) of products. I would definitely recommend her to others for facial services.  [END]
[BEGIN] Grandma and I shared the green chicken curry and pad Thai for lunch. Both dishes had great flavour. Hard to find a decent pad Thai, but was impressed with it here. Busy place for lunch, all tables were full.  [END]
[BEGIN] Aside from language barriers, this place was amazing. They had one waitress that spoke English well, and she had to help our existing waitress... GREAT food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice atmosphere, decent service and very good food. A little pricey but not unexpected. A great place to bring someone special.  [END]
[BEGIN] Visiting here exceeded expectations. Good food, good service, nice size restaurant along with an all star band. The band can really play and had two good singers on stage with them. played lots of motown and blues classics. glad we visited this blues club.  [END]
[BEGIN] Finally, a real museum in Salem (i.e., one with no wax figurines)! Had a great time wandering around the galleries. There is a lot here, especially for the nautically-minded. Great specialty exhibits as well. The Chinese house is incredible.  [END]
[BEGIN] i love grilled veggies with torta and green chilly sauce.veggies r fully grilled n everythng fresh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried Flip Burger with a few co-workers for lunch. I had the Falafel, with a lettuce wrap - AMAZING. Service was great too - would definitely return.  [END]
[BEGIN] That's right: "Yay! I'm a fan". Cheap, good breakfast, good atmosphere, surly service... just what a diner should be. Ahhhh. Yeah, I just sighed a breath of relief, becuase I FINALLY found you, Breakfast Club. I will never let you go.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am back. For a while the Plesant was off their game. They must have realized they were in a game closer to make it back get back to the play offs. Goo job. Pizza was really good.hi  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the food and atmosphere. Parking and the wait can be a nightmare. Little pricey overall - but with a line out the door, the cost of the meal is not keeping anyone away.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am a fan, but I never order the pizza. People in my group always do and it's very good, but for me the wedge salad and fish tacos ROCK! Always fresh and tasty, they keep me coming back and the price it right!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very friendly, took a while but they said it was unusual - several emergencies happened at once. Took the time to properly test everything and explain results.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kind of a dive but great service, fresh food made in front of you, and the steak tips are to die for. Burgers and BLT's are great, too! Basic menu that covers all the bases...Just don't expect anything too exciting in your tossed salad...  [END]
[BEGIN] They are on Groupon so I had to try it. Sushi was better than I expected, but didn't like the dressing on the salad.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I shared a strawberry milkshake here. It was yummy. Love that it's made with coconut ice cream.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really only get one thing here. The S1 Bahn Mi and It's fantastic. I've had the Pho as well and it's quite good.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was fun. Menu read like a greatest hits. Sandwiches from all sorts of places. Enjoyed some chicken wings and a Mexican meatball sub. Seating was a pain though  [END]
[BEGIN] I have not visited this place personally beacuse, it's always seem full to capacity, however I have tries their cupcakes and chocolate fudge cake and was delicious. the manager is a person thatI know and is a very nice guy ;courteous and polite.  [END]
[BEGIN] My favorite coffee in Atlanta. The staff could be a bit more cheery but for the most part all of the folks who work there are kind and knowledgable about their products. Love the Moreland locations rustic vibe  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel, convenient location, clean. Only thing I would suggest is proving coffee pots in the room without the guest going down to pick one up. Breakfast was a little lean too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food and prices. We ordered the fajitas and pollo ala Mexicana. Both of our dishes we delicious. The woman who waited on us was very sweet and the food came quickly! We will definitely be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place, delicious food, pleasant ambience...and the best part....great service. Definitely coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] 12/26/07: Three pasta dishes (carbonara ziti, clams in spicy marinara sauce and matriciana ziti) - great place for a quick lunch - this place was one minute away from my old digs and still serves up great meals. Atmosphere is blah but food is great. Enjoy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent meal, service was fantastic. There is no excuse for anyone ever leaving here hungry. Large servings.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very friendly and professional staff. The dental hygienist that cleaned my teeth(twice so far in one year) was Cambria and she kept giving me useful information on how to maintain my teeth while cleaning them. I love her!  [END]
[BEGIN] We went here before the hockey game and will definitely return. Their flights of beer give you the opportunity to imbibe and sample their bomb sour beer offerings! Must try the Prime Meridian and the Sweet Heat, infused with hot peppers, yowza! Lots of seating and ultra cool, friendly staff!  [END]
[BEGIN] They deliver to my workplace which is awesome! Some dishes are great. Some are meh. I love the mongolian beef or chicken, the house fried rice and their egg rolls are delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] The best part of this restaurant is they have free crab ragoon, spring rolls and soups for free during the lunch time:)  [END]
[BEGIN] This is our go-to sushi spot in Atlanta. The ingredients are fresh and they have a variety of roll options! The price is also very reasonable. Knocking off one star because the hibachi and bento box items are pretty bad. I would recommend sticking with sushi.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great breakfast this morning. Loved the waffle and canadian breakfast. You have to add the duck fat fries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Make reservations! The only place to be on a Sunday morning. Every thing was delicious besides the tough sea bass. The dumpling cart was my favorite. Service was great(and I am picky being in the service industry)!  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here. Fantastic. I had the carne asada. Worth the price. Can't wait until they get there alcohol license. A good margarita to go along with the food will be fantastic. Brookhaven/Atlanta needed a restaurant to fill the void of serving great and creative Mexican food  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't be glum, chum! You're in a car wash! The Palms is fun and there are a variety of washes from do-it-yourself to fully automatic. And really the whirly thing out front is just mesmerizing to watch!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice ambiance and probably the coolest spot in Union Square for a specialty coffee drink. However it is always closed when I want to go (8pm to 10pm)  [END]
[BEGIN] The arepas are ON POINT. Cocktails were weak and my entree was boring (beef, plantains, and white rice), and generally speaking this place is overpriced, but omg I would return in a heartbeat for those arepas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was amazing.. fresh and tasty. Service was good. Downfall would be they don't like deviating from their menu unless you want to pay... $$$. No making your own omelette.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great place to walk around and absorb the historical significance. You can also visit the 3 meeting houses around the green. Very cool!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is one of few nightlife spots in Sandy Springs. It's a nice trendy atmosphere inside the restaurant bar with nice outdoor seating as well. Turns club like on the weekends and they offer hookah which is a plus. No cover unless it's a special occasion like Halloween.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was here for a Christmas party...food and drinks were excellent...the desserts we had definitely need some work...great location...service was very good  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice local theater! We saw Star Wars Solo opening weekend. They don't have stadium seating, but prices are reasonable. You can also buy dinner there and eat during the movie. Great family place!  [END]
[BEGIN] A nice Tibetan store that has a wide selection of women's styles located between Porter and Harvard. Beautiful wares at standard boutique prices. Also a nice selection of jewelry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was very good. Miso soup was amazing. Best smiso around, and that's saying a lot coming from me. Sushi was good also. Prices were great. Will visit again. :$  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service from James. Came during happy hour but couldn't enjoy the specials unless at the bar. Hence not giving 5 stars. But the stuffed shells, chicken parm and spaghetti with meat sauce were all hits. Definitely recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] i love this restunt in the mornings i get a CINIMON ROLL FRENCHTOAST of a bellgim waffle for lunch i always get a burger this place always makes the BEST MALLTES i love it  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was very friendly and courteous. Room was spacious and well maintained. We stayed in room 11 for a Valentine's overnight. The jacuzzi tub in the bathroom was great. Breakfast the next morning was delicious with a nice variety of choices. Would recommend it for anyone busting Boulder.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm updating my earlier bad review. Things have improved tremendously since my last review! The food has seemed to have been elevated, the pizza has greatly improved too. The staff is nice and friendly. I still don't think the having kids is going to go over well. Good job!  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious food!!!! Authentic ( I guess considering I've never been to Cuba) But this place gives out generous portions so it is worth the money. Some might say it is expensive. The service can be worked on a bit- other than that good food.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food here is quite tasty (no less than Shanghai River), and there's a good variety. Service is ok - the waiter helped us a lot with ordering our food, but they don't really change plates for you unless you ask for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was decent. Feels like home made food nothing amazing or exceptional. Quality is all right Would go back for a decent breakfast experience  [END]
[BEGIN] Can't go wrong with cheap beer and a vintage photo booth.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have to say that this place is good. The fish was a tad bit dry on my taco, but nonetheless, tasty. And to be completely honest, I'm bloody tired of Boulder being so pretensiously expensive, so having a six buck lunch was mighty fine by me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Living in Atlanta for the past two months, I am glad there is some sort of convenient transportation. It is easy, dependable and safe. There is also helpful staff around if you need them!  [END]
[BEGIN] The food here is definitely more authentic and tastes better than any Chinatown food in the Boston area. The place is pretty cramped though, so it's not good for large parties.  [END]
[BEGIN] They served us real fast, food was good especially the rice and beans... I would recommend this place to everyone.... Get you some papaya juice. BOMB  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean and inviting shop. Employees are always friendly and helpful-I've never had to wait for a bed, so it's a quick 15 minute rejuvenating "time out" after a long work day!  [END]
[BEGIN] Would give this location 5 stars but the guy who makes the frappuccinos was super slow, which is very annoying when you have to start work in 20 minutes and he takes 35 to make the drink orders.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here 4x now, and quality has gotten progressively downhill. Probably will give it another shot but still solid sushi when made right  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere!! And server Alex was very professional and efficient!! Very pleasant meal.. way too much food!! Share  [END]
[BEGIN] Very Friendly bartender busy Saturday here bread and butter was with chives orgeno garlic very good Ordered Beet salad with salmon excellent  [END]
[BEGIN] i always stop by early am. workers are always friendly, look a little old and ghetto, but that is to be expected at a winco. i love their fresh maple bars in the morning!!!! will deff keep coming back before work!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food! We had the lobster roll, fried chicken sandwich and cheeseburger sliders and all were really good and really reasonably priced. The ambiance was a little divey, but we were pleasantly surprised by how good the food was.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a Very tasty and authentic meal. Food was made speedy. We ordered the Churassco & Lomo Saltado. We liked their selection of natural juices, mango, guava, sour-sop & passion fruit. The Alfajor dessert however was not the best. Will be returning for breakfast. Thank you  [END]
[BEGIN] We had the pancetta burger and added caramelized onions. It was supposed to come on a brioche bun, but they ran out, so used a different bun, but it was fantastic!! The fries were really good too nice and crispy. Delicious!!  [END]
[BEGIN] awesome place... been here like 3 or 4 times now... Fun atmosphere, friendly barstaff and crowd, cheap drinks, decent music, depends on when you go, but I like the place... Allston Villagers, GO HERE... don't waste your money at lame places like The Kells or Tonic...  [END]
[BEGIN] Tuesday at 3pm fast, friendly. Good burger. Kinda pricy but has a celeb name so it's expected I guess.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the oldest BBQ in Austin area. Love the beef ribs and sausage. I didn't like their briskets, but everything else is great. Make sure you order their macaroni and cheese. It's yummy.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place only does one thing.. And it does it very well, sandwiches are not huge, but they are good! I come here infrequently.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent monster Dosas. Super flavorful and so many varieties. I could easily eat here once a week, or more. The wait staff is sweet and attentive and I never fail to have a good experience here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pleasantly surprised with this place. Girlfriend got ramen which wasn't that good and I got a bowl. I would recommend a bowl. Especially with the sauce options you get to add. It was delicious. Plus, fortune cookies really wet the whistle.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is very good the service was very friendly. I had an egg white omelette with vegan sausage and caramelized onions and cheese and it was just delightful. I wouldn't say it's the healthiest option out there but it's definitely tasty!  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a fantastic tasting, seasoned burger that I haven't had in a long time. Very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pulled right up on boat! Got great food and great service. The smell, obviously, was a fishy but that was ok. The summer time is great, not sure how the winter is. I will have to check it out  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for dessert because the line was too long (about a 1.5 to 2 hour wait) for actual dinner. We ordered sangria and flan, cheesecake, and dulce de leche crepes (everything tasted awesome) and the service was great too despite how crowded it was.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, good service. My wife and I ordered the Mixed Grill for two. The Shish Kebab was excellent, everything else was good but a bit too fatty/greasy for us. The glass of wine we got was excellent. The Lavas bread and Ezme appetizers were also very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food with a nice view. Happy hour every day 3-7 with $5 stout margaritas which is nice. Not a very versatile kitchen staff though cause they dont offer quesadillas or enchiladas but their tacos were tasty  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this place. Good pricing, very good California Rolls and their rice bowls are great. I like the Oyako Don with the egg. Great for take out as well  [END]
[BEGIN] Consistent and best Mexican/Southwest restaurant in the area. Good wolf on greens is filling and worth trying. Casual atmosphere and kid friendly. Returned the other night and nothing has changed. Good value but it can get loud  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was good. Paratha was excellent. But not much impressed with vegetable biriyani.  [END]
[BEGIN] This chipotle always works fast! Everything is made in moment and the team members are very polite!  [END]
[BEGIN] A great way to learn about the Harvard from both a historical and current perspective.  [END]
[BEGIN] it is a good choice when traveling in a different noisy City. after a day walking chinese food is perfect for us.  [END]
[BEGIN] We tried this for the first time last night after hearing about it from multiple fans. Really good, super thin, homemade pizza. They cut it with scissors which is really cool. We'll definitely go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: good food, ambiance, huge selection of beers and specialty drinks, pleasant wait staff, and a decent selection for vegetarians Cons: situated in a horribly designed parking lot. getting in and out is not fun. food's probably unhealthy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very reasonably priced. Modest/non-pretentious clientelle. Quality is on par with other pho restaurants. Location is a bit sketchy. Go during the day to avoid street scum.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for dinner over the weekend the atmosphere was great! The food was good and the wait staff was friendly and on top of things.  [END]
[BEGIN] Spicy Hawaiian Pizza - Delicious new taste, friendly stuff, good experience. Spicy Hawaiian Pizza - Delicious new taste, friendly stuff, good experience  [END]
[BEGIN] Great coffee, yummy passion fruit cream puff!  [END]
[BEGIN] Dropped my I phone and the screen shattered! Took it into iTech on Burnett and had it back withing an hour. Saved me from having to buy a new phone! My daughter was able to find a 3GS case there for under $10.00. This place worked for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Convenient location. Not the best part of town but not shady. They are friendly and you can't beat the prices. I've taken many a pet and rescued stray to them and have never had any problems.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great drinks! The food wasn't anything out of this world, tots where really good. Would highly recommend the adult milkshakes above all.  [END]
[BEGIN] I often come here when I'm craving some bubble tea, wish they had some pudding for their drinks though.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really like this place. The food is reasonably priced and tastes good. Order the bottomless pancakes or French toast for the best deal. They also offer quite a few healthy, vegetarian items as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast service this morning! Lots of parking and easy access to the freeway. This location has a drive through, but go inside for faster service. Tea and cheers to all!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good with repairs. This is the second phone I have had repaired here and the service and price is great. They get backed up in work sometimes and take a while longer, but typically have the repairs done that day.  [END]
[BEGIN] I loved it! Need to try the pho. I had B6 I believe. Their meat has great flavor. The noodles were cold but it honestly worked. It was wonderful. My friend got an amazing steak and rice entree. So much flavor and yummy sauce. Egg rolls were bomb too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little spot in Richmond. Open late, great tea and dessert and wonderful ambiance and decor. Exactly what I was looking for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice park with tennis courts and a skate park. I used it for bike trail access, which was handy. Two parking lots, easy access to the river trails. The neighborhood is a little busy, but once you're in the park it's fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lobster nachos were great! And the service was good, not too crowded but the music was really loud. I had to almost scream at my friend while we were talking. Lol  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap and cheerful hearty fresh Mexican fare via counter service by always friendly young staff. Miss the one that used to be in my 'hood (W 4th at Burrard). It was replaced by a pot dispensary. A better business model would be to have both. ;-)  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic service! It's a tad on the expensive side... especially if you're just popping in for lunch... but the food is truly excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] This coffee shop isn't as chic and dim lit as the coffee shops I'm used to in Nashville but they have a great product and a friendly staff...and friendly staffs are hard to come by.  [END]
[BEGIN] Glad I joined. I like having the ability to go to any location. There are 5 locations I switch between depending on the day and classes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice Place,great Food,Awesome Prices,Good Satff. Love it  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent! Clean and friendly. I thought the sushi was really good but I wish their kitchen didn't close so early.  [END]
[BEGIN] Some of the best Americanos/ french press coffee in Austin. Great, friendly staff. I like it when they leave the front doors open on sunny days. Really uncomfortable chairs, though, so don't plan on a long study session.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very tasty.big Kebap. Next time I'll try the beef and lamb but e chicken is really good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pasta Vino has been my neighborhood favorite for years. The food, atmosphere, and service are hard to beat for the price and convenience. In addition to the great Italian food, the outdoor seating makes it one of the most popular dinner spots during the summer in Atlanta.  [END]
[BEGIN] We love the food and atmosphere. I would really appreciate it if you could try to adopt more gluten free options. For example using tapioca or coconut flour for the thin breading on some of the specials or regular entrees.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location off the highway. Easy to leave and get back on 71. This has been here a lot of years. I have been here many times. Great drink and restroom stop. 1 dollar drinks. Next to Shell gas. Reasonably clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for Sunday brunch! The migas are pretty delicious, but there are a variety of tasty options. Staff is always friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the BANHMIFUFU and my girlfriend had the Burnside. Both were amazing! We almost didn't let each other taste our sandwiches. Looking forward to going back again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun place, good beer, food is usually pretty decent, although a bit bland at times. "Ego and the Oracle" performances are not to be missed.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was Friday night at 8 pm. The place was not filled up. The survive was a bit slow but ok. The food was surprisingly good. It is Americanized chinese cuisine, a bit like PFChang.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chorizo burger and Butcher's Cut burgers are good. You have to get the Nutella and Burnt Marshmallow shake. A must have! I plan on going back for sure!  [END]
[BEGIN] They have delicious sweet wine. Doesn't taste alcoholic at all so it's very easy to walk through a bottle. Not too expensive either! I don't drink too much and the staff is a little judge-y if you get drunk off of a wine tasting.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an excellent Mexican restaurant. The food is amazing. The service is very fast and friendly. Very accommodating server. The place has nice decorations. Probably one of the best places in Lynnfield Market Place. I will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Enjoyed the happy hour menu with a girlfriend. The service was great, food was fresh and flavorful. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes bursts of flavor with a little kick (but the bacon wrapped jalapenos have a hulk of a kick). We will definitely be going back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Burrito grande is way better than Chipotle, if not as large. Quality over quantity. The tacos are excellent. Get the three plate with one of each: steak, chicken, carnitas. Mexican food of this quality and taste is rare this far north. Go. Today.  [END]
[BEGIN] A good alternative to all the New York style wannabe's. Would agree with other reviewers, quality ingredients and great crust.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place. My faves are the green apple with kale and a bit of greek yogurt I also like the peanut butter and chocolate love smoothie. That one is also my fave : D One of my fave places. I suggest free wifi though.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here. 18 inch pizzas for 9.99 on Monday and Tuesday's. Also tried the Italian trio. Everything was great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Mediocre food. Occasionally a great bartender, but on those off nights its awful service. Depending on what you order it could be delicious or awful. I love the veggies and noodles, but refuse to order meat here. All in All, A great place for drinks if Holly is your bartender.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very hearty breakfasts, and always quick and friendly service. I eagerly await the return of the bear claw french toast -- it might have exceeded my recommended caloric intake for an entire day, but holy cow was it good.  [END]
[BEGIN] A good selection of sushi, not many other options. Sushi prepared within sight and very good. Very clean, looks very appealing and has a nice atmosphere. Staff is attentive. Conveniently located next to he Boylston station and Emerson dorms.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm no BBQ expert, but I have enjoyed the ribs and perhaps its noteworthy that they Buffalo Chicken Fingers are very good. Nice big pieces of chicken in a hotter than average sauce. Good service and self serve drink station. Use the Gemini Parkway exit to get here quicker.  [END]
[BEGIN] There are so many great spots to visit near by. We loved he old town rustic vibe of the spot and were able to grab a seat as well!  [END]
[BEGIN] Quaint atmosphere, very good food. A good place to take the family.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best chow mien & orange chicken this side of portland just beware some entrées have more onions than meat great little place inside rose city food park.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is nice but small. Smaller rooms and gym than most other Kimptons I have visited. Staff was welcoming and location is good. Able to walk to the North End or the Garden with ease.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great neighborhood dive bar with 16 rotating taps. Has liquor and food too. In the evening you can even get sushi. Love the beer selection and being able to get a tasting tray. Southern style food that is pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chicken and Waffles. Good value. Fried chicken very good! One of to beat we have had. Parking early on a Sunday morning was no problem. Good coffee. We will be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious and fresh sushi. The tofu appetizer is so good and served in a warm broth. Must try their dragon eye maki  [END]
[BEGIN] Warm, friendly place for a quick or sit down breakfast. Egg steamers are great and coffee is sooooo good. Will def. go back to try banana bread or crabapple pie.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't live here, but every time I have gone to visit friends -- it is exceptional. Clean, well mannered personnel. You can't really complain... if you can afford the rent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good and the menu is basic literally the only decision you make is the size! (And you can also have them leave out something). The sauce is yummy and makes the whole bowl.  [END]
[BEGIN] Classy place to stay at! Esp to those who have a history with this place ;)  [END]
[BEGIN] Always stocks the stuff we need - in the store on a daily basis. Friendly checkers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Three words: blueberry rhubarb pie. It was epic. I figured it could have been a mistake, so I went back for more. This time I had a Peg Leg (ginger ale, rum, lime, etc.) and chocolate cream pie. That was epic, too. Highly recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Green Chile Pork is not very good, or at least it is not as good as it sounds, but I have really enjoyed everything else I have tried. Torchy's is going to make me fat(ter) someday.  [END]
[BEGIN] I haven't been in some time and I thought to give it another try and it was worth it. Menu needs help and the decor but the food,chips and salsa and yes the margaritas were outstanding. I will be back  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome food, quick service, polite, very clean had the chicken enchiladas excellent. Tomato basil to die for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad for a pub.The donnelly group fixed this place up well and continued to let it fit well into gastown. I went to this place with a friend and we had a lot of budweiser.The bartenders were cool as well as the doormen.I would recommend this place for sure  [END]
[BEGIN] I went on a Wednesday morning just for a trim and thought the ladies were nice and friendly. The wait wasn't long at all, and the shop was very clean! Good prices, too! Your receipt even comes with a two dollar off coupon for your next visit!  [END]
[BEGIN] Too preppy for some. I say they have classic patterns that doesn't die fast. The clothes are plain and clean looking (I guess the "in thing" nowadays are dirty and filthy smelling clothes. The price is moderate and merchandise is calmer than your regular school/street brand.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing selection of wines along with tons of menu options. Excellent ambience for a date night with great music and wonderful plates to choose from. They have healthy options as well as pasta, pizza and more! We did the cheese fondue and it was amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wom Kim's peach pudding bread. Don't skip this dessert. It's a little piece of heaven.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome place, had a great Johnny Cash cover band trio on a weeknight that I dropped by. Good draft selection in Irish setting.  [END]
[BEGIN] I took my iPhone 3G to iTech Electronics to fix my shattered screen. It was done quickly and looks like new again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Such a cute store!! Lots of stationary items and cute plushies as well :) I haven't bought anything from this store though, as it is a little pricey, but I will definitely come back again to buy something later! Great store for gifts and it is very clean  [END]
[BEGIN] Love there smoothes and crepes, the crepes are a little tuff to cut, but still good, also love there iced coffee too  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good boba and thai food. The crispy chicken was excellence. I got the Chiang Mai noodles which was fantastic. Get it with the crispy chicken.  [END]
[BEGIN] Phenomenal desserts. Sausage buffet is very good although the wait can be long. Their German potato salad is second only to my mothers. The cream puffs are legendary, huge and amazing  [END]
[BEGIN] Berry Berry berry me Every lick chock-full of berry seeds Subtly sweet on fine white dusting Oh please please berry me  [END]
[BEGIN] Karaoke Friday and Saturday. Free pool on Sunday. Taco Tuesday's. Typical dive bar. The bartender's are nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is our go to spot for Italian. Meals are consistently prepared, service is always quick and friendly. I'd give five stars if the wine list was a little more extensive. Make reservations just to be safe.  [END]
[BEGIN] The turkey burgers are great and the krispy cream milkshake is to die for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Always enjoy Thai Orchid! The food is great, service is timely and prices are reasonable. Sometimes there can be a wait for a table which if you live in the 'cove is not something your use to doing :)  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a Boston bowl, decent portion, didn't exceed $10. I can see it getting old really fast since there's not that many food options. However, it's a laid back atmosphere and not bad if you're in the mood for Mac and cheese, crispy chicken, and red roasted potatoes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Free beer with an app, you can't beat that. Napolitano pizza was a nice thin crust. We got the Margherita. Kids Alfredo pasta was alright. Beer was nice and cold. Very good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Better than expected food...loved the ginormous pretzel with really good mustard! Waitress...Tiffany...was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the beer selection. Also nice because the place is huge, so we had no wait time even on a Friday night!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place. Fun backyard area. Their veggie tacos are delish!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service. Mo was awesome with recommendations and gave real feedback. Prices were decent and there was a large selection of designer frames. Would totally recommend this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here twice. Both times had amazing (5 star) food. The first time around I had some delicious sushi and the second time I had the stir-fry oxtopus that was out of this world! Service been average both times. Will totally be back for some more of the yummy food!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Blue Ribbon Grill has been in Tucker for nearly 30 years. I usually come here for lunch and get the meat loaf that is the best meat loaf I have aten outside my home. Great staff, reasonable prices too  [END]
[BEGIN] 2 floors, one chill, one not. Good variety of music and drinks. No cover on Fridays makes it even better. Always have a good time when I go. The bathroom does get a little wet... just be prepared!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is delicious, fresh and fairly priced. Service is mostly mediocre to good. Ambiance is cool and the water view is refreshing on a hot summer day. Location is wicked convenient if you work in the Financial District so the crowd is a mixture of casual tourists and finance professionals.  [END]
[BEGIN] A fantastic find, the food and ambiance are charming and tasteful and complemented by a large selection of teas and coffees. The shokshokeh/shakshuka - fried tomatoes and eggs over rice - was delicious and I am sure the other food items will be, too. Great place to study or brunch!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast service, food served at the right temperature, order filled accurately. That's all a fast food restaurant needs to be successful. This one hit all three for the most part. My wife's fresco taco had some strands of cheese in it, but otherwise a perfect visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Im sooooooooooooo excited to get these adorable rompers in that I just ordered. What a find!! I will do a follow up once I get them in and check them out.. Too excited not to post!  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderfully, fresh cuisine. Crisp flavors. Friendly, efficient staff. Will certainly be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Old school bowling + cheap drinks in small pastic cups = fun This place looks straight out of the 1970's and has a lot of charm, they even have an arcade room which hardly exist anywhere anymore.  [END]
[BEGIN] After my less than fantastic visit the first time, the other couple time's that I've been here have been relatively painless. The counter staff is a lot nicer than the check in desk staff. Virtually no wait in lines, moves really fast even when busy. Always a lot of staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful pastry with delicious fillings! A lot of new flavour combos too... Nummy! This is like the pies my auntie used to make with cooked fruit fillings! U can take a trip down memory lane with some of these delightfully old-fashioned fillings... We'll be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Glad to see it hasn't changed since I last lived in the area. It's halfway between a good Americanized place and an Americanized good Taiwanese place. It's more authentic than the detractors say, so shut up. If they have the "Chinese sausage" special, get it. Cash only. Love Central Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'll rate this place 4 stars. Been a few times but, never really been overly impressed by anything here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Knowledgeable and very helpful staff. Good prices. Uninventive name. Nondescript storefront.  [END]
[BEGIN] Whenever we have guests or family flying in or out of PDX, we ALWAYS find a way to have lunch or dinner at Stanford's and have never been disappointed. Food, service and ambiance all come together to provide a wonderful dining experience (as opposed to "just eating")!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I took my brother and his niece here for lunch. The staff was great. Food was excellent. The ever changing view of the harbor worth the trip. Raw Oysters, fried clams, chowder flights, special Italian sandwich all perfect. We will return for late afternoon cocktails. Give them a try.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is great! It is a little British oriented import shop. My friend Jim just introduced me to a soda called 'Irn-Bru' that is available there. They have drinks, candies, gifts and some frozen food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great decor, awesome vibe and amazing service. Sushi is terrible though... The rest of the menu is great though - opt for one of their bbq items and get sushi at a real sushi bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pizza and appetizers... Nice full bar and lots of TV's. I've also ordered online, their site is kinda weird but it works.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, great margaritas. Good for family outings or out with friends. Loud atmosphere. Great location!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the Bogey!! Muirfield landmark!! Volleyball leagues, food, drinks, great patio and great banquet room. Menu is better than most bars and also have good live music  [END]
[BEGIN] Best Irish pub south of Boston. While there make sure you order the steak tips or shepherds pie. You will not be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely worth a visit. They have a large selection of items in their shop. We took the tour on the oversized 4x4. Josh, the driver / tour guide kept things interesting. Would recommended doing this if you want a change of pace from the hustle and bustle of Disney.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good little semi-private course. Looks like they're pouring some money into the irrigation drainage issues that have plagued the back side for awhile. Front side has no problem with drainage. Nothing too difficult about the course but it can be a challenge if you're not a straight hitter.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizza is pretty good, Roast beef is nice - nice medium rare. Fries are great and so are the wings. Steak and chees is great. Primo's is a solid place for your typical sub shop/ pizza shop fair. Highly recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] Saus is our new spot. We love their fries and waffles!! Definitely a place to try and worth driving. The girls were also very friendly. Love the atmosphere :). Thanks for great food and excellent service. Will be back again. I've already told our family and friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] So good that our son chose TB to cater his wedding. If I lived in Austin I'd require an intervention to keep me away. Sides are very good. The brisket and beef ribs are indescribably good. Not to be missed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The atmosphere is really fun! I like the chairs and booths. Recently priced food. I got the steak ranchers! Love the red sauce!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service. Friendly staff. Tasty menu. Moderately priced. I had a solid experience! #FirstVisit  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the Sun-dried tomato rub with BBQ sauce on the wings. Total dive bar with great wings and a great craft beer selection.  [END]
[BEGIN] At first, I was sketchy about the pho in Texas, because there aren't many Vietnamese who live in Texas. I was totally wrong and there are many great Vietnamese restaurants in Austin. This is probably the best one in town. Although the wait is a bit crazy, worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place and come here all the time. The chicken is amazing, but I wish they had more delicious and healthy sides to go with the chicken.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizza was really good, the environment was really dope! Good music and good people! Would even be a great place to take the kids out to!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's Shopper's. It's kind of understaffed, but it has all the Shopper's-y stuff you need, except bus tickets.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food came quick and was super tasty I do wish our waiter was around more He kept disappearing and I had to wait over 10 mins for a refill I appreciate the chips and salsa and bean dip as appetizers Super delicious. Overall very good place !  [END]
[BEGIN] Tapas are food but entrees are kinda greasy. Highly recommended foraged mushroom and grilled outopus. They make really good sauce.  [END]
[BEGIN] My go to for cakes! The cakes are light and fluffy. Not dry and the frosting isn't overly sweet. Very reasonably priced as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lamb is great the salad bar is excellent but you can fill your self just on the salad bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] The view is fantastic. Food is ok. But the service and ambiance are what it is all about here. Where else can you do cardio and then relax for lunch right after?  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a hidden gem! It's not the most conveniently located close to the Y, but so cute and clean when you get in. The rolls are fun to watch prepped on the live TV. I highly recommend the "Lake Austin". It's delectable!  [END]
[BEGIN] What a great find. We were headed to True Food. Traffic was so bad and we couldn't find parking so decided to stop by Crate-n- Barrel. We checked the menu and decided to give it a try. Best decision ever. I can't wait to return  [END]
[BEGIN] Kids review: I liked they ketchup. It was good! It feels you up. Pickles were good. The burgers are delicious...and the fries are good. Kids are brutally honest. Hope this helps...I did sneak a bite while they weren't looking. They were good!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Dim Sum is really good. Make sure to arrive early to beat the crowds. One more thing, the hot oil looks scary but is quite tasteful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to grab a coffee and a book and relax.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pineapple fried rice was so good! My kids really liked it. Red dragon roll was also great. But steak and chicken combination was so so.  [END]
[BEGIN] Smashing decor, great jams, and they serve Pimm's! Any place that can make me a Pimm's drink, the perfect summer beverage, is A-OK in my book.  [END]
[BEGIN] Newish Crepe place that opened up. They serve more than crepes, however, just came for a basic sugar crepe which was actually really good and decent. There is some seating inside, however, I had it to go to continue on with my walk. Good prices and customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice atmosphere, beautiful view of the marina and their caramel cake is a must try. So delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Certainly unexpected flavors. Everything fresh and seemed healthy. The filet mignon tibs where excellent. Not a fan of the spongy bread though not their flaw as my opposition is to the flavor of the bread, the sourness is not my cup of tea.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is great, portions are HUGE, wait is kind of long especially lately and they flatten their bacon which I'm not a big fan of.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun little sushi bar in downtown Vancouver. Nothing fancy but was decent food for the price. Somewhat eclectic menu with a variety of rolls and some small plates. The fried octopus balls were fun. Gyoza were good too. Fish was pretty fresh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a great time with friends. Three of us had their fresh sashimi special, Vancouver roll, BC roll, kushii oysters, and sake. Highly recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food! Try the pork pastor. Server was amazing at explaining all the options. A little expensive but I would come here again. The tacos r gone in like 3 bites. But you get to try so many. The sauces r great too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Bring water and a hat as change hot. Has nice clean restroom. Dusty so wear closed toed shoes. Fair pricing for u pick. Hot cooked food available.  [END]
[BEGIN] great seafood! crazy busy during halloween time, make sure to make a reservation in advance!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very authentic Mexican. Some of the best I've had in PDX! The restaurant is clean and the folks there are very friendly. The only negative was the blaring Mexican TV program!  [END]
[BEGIN] brought our boat trailer in to get inspected--it was missing a light bulb so we had to go to Advance Auto and ended up with a full light assembly--Lambs mechanics put it on (about 25 min of tinkering), approved the trailer, and charged us the $14.95 for the inspection--that's it!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you work in the area, then you know that this is the place to go for Mexican food. I personally enjoy getting the taco plate or a burrito. The prices are decent, and you can get lunch for around $5, which is a key price point for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good service! They took great care of me at the sushi bar! The sushi chef even gave me free handroll to try! Chirashi bowl was very good as well!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Spicy Chicken Rigatoni was just that and very tasty. Thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The atmosphere was different and interesting and the Grandview area has a college atmosphere and radiates fun.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good sushi. Small seating area in the restaurant but you can sit in Roscoes if they are full. Beer menu is from Roscoes which makes it nice because they have a big selection. Definitely good enough to make me come back since the location is convenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything on the menu seemed interesting, so it made choosing a bit tricky. Everything chosen was delicious! The lobster bruschetta is off the charts, the double decker and the spicy tuna on the rocks are all must try's. Great cocktails too! I will definitely be back here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Maple bacon donut, brown butter hazelnut crunch donut=heaven. Huge donuts, friendly staff. It all makes me happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Madewell is like J.Crew's funky little sister. Fun accessories (scarves, bags, etc.) amazing boots, and fantastic denim. Prices are a little high, but you know the quality is good, and denim is priced less than other high-end brands.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have always been a Third Base fan, but ever since Buffalo opened, I much prefer to come here. It's bigger with more TV's and a better selection of food and drinks! Yes, it's a little pricier than Pluckers or Third Base, but it's worth it to me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid lunch option in NW Austin. Menu has man offerings of fresh salads,soups, flat breads, and pastas. Soup was great Arugula/beet salad was tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poké was excellent though quite small. chopped salad delicious as was the calamari that we mixed into the chopped salad! Atmosphere is a bit hipper with community high top tables as well as low tops along the windows. Located in the building housing the Hilton!  [END]
[BEGIN] I LOVED the sushi here! They have some original creations that are delicious. And the selection is huge. You will feel overwhelmed but so happy and full at the end. Plus, it's not too pricey, especially for sushi.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fresh Delicious Reasonably priced Well sized portions What else can you say that has not been said? Great place to sit down and grub on some tasty sushi.  [END]
[BEGIN] OMG! I love this place....by b/f and I decided to check it out one evening and we both absolutely enjoyed their sushi! If you love calamari, GET IT! Their big and plentiful!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service. The wait staff is always kind and funny. The patio is a great place to sit. I'm a HUGE fan of their margaritas because they're good, large, and well made. And my wife LOVES the chips and salsa.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute back patio. Tried the truffle fries and it did not disappoint. Went there for some wine and chill atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, and nice atmosphere. Chicken tempura was tasty, and the Orange Blossom roll was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a very nice place. The cookies are wonderful. The staff was so nice and helpful. I just enjoy going here. I will go back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bar Taco was really good!! My server I want to say Jermey was AWESOME!! He's definitely a great start to the team. I enjoyed everything that was played in front of me from my tacos, guac, soup, and drink!! I definitely have establish bar taco as regular place I'll visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] I must say this place has GREAT FOOD!!! It was definitely a long waiting line but it was well worth it. Looking forward to returning real soon...  [END]
[BEGIN] Great chips and salsa, and really good margaritas! I had a quesadilla that was decent and the overall atmosphere was cool.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the environment and ambiance here. Waiter was very helpful. I ordered a drink I didn't like he immediately recommended another one to replace it. Overall it is a good spot to spend a romantic or formal evening with friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dogs. Ping Pong. Hula Hoops. Beer. Booze. House with a big back yard. View of downtown skyline. Yeah, that works.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lunch is inexpensive and the options come with roll and soup. I always have left overs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had Roast Banana & Dark Chocolate($5.00), it was good! My friend had Roast Banana & Bourbon, and bourbon taste light and don't taste/smell much alcohol. We loved the combinations. They make a shake in a Mason Jar, it is thick and delicious also cute :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty nice place for brunch! The food was good, nothing great. The line can get pretty long tho. It's best to get there early on the weekend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing too spectacular, just a local pub on Charles St in Beacon Hill with good brews, good music, and darts. When I was in town this place became my hangout spot for evening fun.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful and expensive; old look but classy. Try the character buffet, they even do a little show for the audience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was great (thank you Hody & Flynn!) and the food was okay. Five star service, four star food. Garlic noodles were surprisingly very good! The shrimp and clams were okay...  [END]
[BEGIN] I feel like Barista puts Stumptown to shame. I am not much of a coffee drinker but ever since my first visit here it's all I crave. Well done Barista...well done  [END]
[BEGIN] GREAT pizza... possibly the best in town. TERRIBLE service... possibly the worst in town. get the Smokin' Joe's crust. i'm pretty sure they're open 24 hours a day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent atmosphere, great sweets and coffee. My cup did not smell fresh and went back to get another one. One suggestion will be to keep the tea and coffee cups separate as the coffee cream smell lingers around and does not blend well with teas.  [END]
[BEGIN] The waitress was extremely nice, the food was great, and hostess was friendly. We had the thin crust veggie pizza which was great. We also ordered a deep dish veggie pizza and mozzarella sticks. The food came out fast and hot. I will definitely come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best wings in the city! Takes a long time for the wings once ordered but well worth the wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the Fish it was very good. Really liked this place. Our waiter was fun and offered a ton of suggestions. Large menu and a lot of TV's everywhere you look you can find a tv. Great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very impressed. Not 5 stars because I feel like the facilities need a little work. However, even though the place looks horrid from the outside, inside is great, packed and full of life.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't really like Hotpot, but I can say this place is not bad at all, pretty crowded in the weekend. Plus, I'd recommend beef and salmon  [END]
[BEGIN] It's pricey for donuts, but totally satisfies the late night sweet craving and is definitely worth the experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went in yesterday to get new tires and had a great experience. The guy that helped me suggested a similiar tire that had a rebate, saved me 100 bucks! In and out in less than an hour. Great customer service and professionalism (did I spell that right?)  [END]
[BEGIN] very beautiful and personal collection. unique to boston, gorgeous courtyard  [END]
[BEGIN] The ingredients are very fresh, but the bread doesn't have a lot of texture. If I'm eating a bread without much texture I'd rather eat a panini-pressed sandwich than a grilled cheese. But it's still cool that you can make your own and experiment with the ingredients.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food (tried to mac and cheese, nachos, and wings during happy hour with a group of girls) and great patio space (although can get a bit loud). Moscow mule was pint size which was a bit disappointing.... maybe due to happy hour?! Fun spot, glad it reopened.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything was good and the service was excellent and friendly. The place is small and a little loud, but otherwise great.  [END]
[BEGIN] restaurant is very, very small- only ONE bathroom. a good place for a date. gets loud but because it's so small, you're more inclined to lean over all the time. food varies- but overall good. mussels were to die for but salmon was not.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely LOVE BarTaco. There is this sauce they make with cilantro mixed in and let me tell you how amazing it is. I get their fish tacos every time. The staff is professional and clean and the atmosphere is great as well. Definitely recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] The banh mi are only $3 and a tasty little treat. The pho is pretty good and you can add a spring roll to a vermicelli bowl for only $1. I've always had friendly service and been really satisfied with the food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really great white sangria. Smoked salmon frittata and banana foster French toast are delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good and authentic. Just returned from Vienna, Austria and was missing the café experience. Easy to get to on transit. Like the hole-in-the-wall style of the shop. Would have given 5 stars but found the interior to be culturally jarring.  [END]
[BEGIN] Defo great Pizza. This is right across from where I live but I've only been 2 or 3 times. Should go more. They number the pizzas I think 17 was good. Its always busy so be prepared to wait on weekend nights.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Southern style food. The collard greens were awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for a quick meal! Decent sushi and they're very generous with their servings of other dishes. Restaurant tends to be a bit on the messy side but the food makes up for it. Love that they have a drive thru for pick up!  [END]
[BEGIN] Upscale, elegant atmosphere with excellent service. We did not have time for a full meal but enjoyed an excellent soup and salad. The decor included a really cool and extensive caricature collection. I will definitely go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like dive bars, this is a good one to start at. Nothing on the walls, poor lighting, and a sketchy bathroom is all part of the charm of this nice little bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went with my family. Good portions, fair deal. I did not feel the pizza was anything special. I would skip the spaghetti and lasagna.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big portions, lots of seating, goods service. Black bear diner is a staple breakfast establishment in Beaverton. Good location. You won't be let down.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizza isn't bad. When you're in the livery business and want something to eat that's not from the roach coach or D-dognuts, this is a option. Not much parking near by. I usually will park at a nearby hotel and walk down the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great local hangout to watch RedSox game. TVs on all walls. Sports memorabilia all around. Smoking area outside. People and Bartender friendly! Enjoyed everyone's company. Will try the dining area next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Baba ganoush was unbelievable! Good variety of beers on tap. Funky decor and a cool atmosphere. Good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Although this isn't the greatest pizza in the world, it's pretty damn good. It satisfies my craving for real new york pizza. theyre pretty quick, and do deliver. I'd recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service - awesome Food - terrific Prices - you get what you pay for Small place bit can accommodate a group or an intimate date. Loud enough to keep your conversation private but not so much that you can't hear yourself think.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wife and I went on a Saturday evening. Had a pretty long wait. They offer roasted shelled peanuts while you wait. Steak was really good. Will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fish= Crispy and delicious; Tartar sauce= homemade and awesome; Fries= Not too many, but just enough; 'Coleslaw'= a bit of grated cabbage and carrots with no sauce? Weak. Love the staff, service is fast but be prepared to wait on busy weekends to be seated.  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought the burger was good, I made my own and the ingredients seemed fresh. However, my husbands burger had barely any taste and wasn't cooked as requested. I also had a salted caramel milkshake which was very good!  [END]
[BEGIN] They have average southern food but I love their drinks. They have unique drink pitchers that we tried and they were pretty good. Good place to just chill with friends  [END]
[BEGIN] I have rented cars from here and a truck and have never had a single problem. The wait is long at times bc there is light staff but all of the ladies have been really helpful. They have been upfront about everything all 4 times I have rented.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just moved to Riverside and I thought I would check it out. It had a good vibe and the BBQ was really good. The portions were smaller than what I am use to getting, but I will still be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oblation is a lovely little card, print & gift shop that we always visit on our trips to Portland because they have unique locally made cards. I always buy my mom's B-Day card here. The staff is always helpful & really nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Consistently good diner. Has a little something for everyone. The staff is polite and efficient. The place is clean. They have great cinnamon rolls and very good pies. I usually go for breakfast and I'm always happy with the omelets. My family likes the pancakes.  [END]
[BEGIN] The creamed quinoa is to die for. Creamy and soft but not overly cheesy or mushy. Just delicious! My favorite appetizer was the quail. Slightly sweet with a hint of spice. Fabulous bar and great outdoor seating.  [END]
[BEGIN] We love Zoe's. The pesto hummus is always awesome and orzo tabouleh is another favorite. We will be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for sandwiches and soup! Their cookies are tasty too! Quick service and all the staff Are friendly. I eat here weekly because I work in the mall and it is the best place to eat in the food court.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best Irish pubs around. The servers warm up after awhile and provide great service. The sampler is a great option. Bourbon selection is top notch.  [END]
[BEGIN] So glad I found this place. We use to wait in live forever at La Sirentia, but this joint is much closer and tast just as good. The carna asada and pollo burritos are both very good. but the street tacos are my favorite.  [END]
[BEGIN] the only place that sells linguica- and its delicious ! everyone that works there is really friendly and nice also  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped for coffee and breakfast on the way out of Vancouver. Coffee was good. Has a breakfast wrap which was grilled in panini press. Pretty good. Could have had some peppers and onions. Add liz said it was a qute little shop.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm never sure of a mechanics pricing... but they are ALWAYS available for their customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super friendly staff and delicious food. Asada Burrito was big and flavorful. Kids had both hard and soft tacos and ate them all up. Tamale was good. Yummy fresh crunchy fries. Heard the burgers are great, we will try next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] A solid sushi joint for take away. Glad to finally have a good sushi place in the hood. Fish and chips hand roll is yum. Great sashimi. Damn good seaweed salad. Super sweet staff. Excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] LIKE THE NEW STORE WAY BETTER. Younger, cleaner, hipper, and more reasonably priced than the old Louis. And the attached restaurant is very good, very reasonably priced, and has a great view of Boston.  [END]
[BEGIN] The usual BBT place for my buddies and I. Prices are reasonable and most of their drinks taste great! Busy most of the time and hard to find seating as it is a really small place.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were really impressed with the quality of the food, the service, and the amount of food we got for our money. We didn't expect to be, but we were. They have a good number of vegetarian options, which isn't uncommon at sushi restaurants, but it was nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like they have a large selection of different kinds of food here. Great place to hang out with friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Attractive foot massage lounge that's open late & very affordable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The sandwiches are tasty, I had the Dagwood and enjoyed it enough to go back. The wait time can be a factor so calling ahead and using the pick up window it's a good option.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is one of the hidden gems in the mall 'cause it stands out from the other stores by creating a skaters dream within a dream. Lots of selection, good stuff and friendly staff. I come here to buy skateboarding stickers since it is local and close buy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious, hot pizza the way it is suppose to be! Thin and crispy crust. If you order by the slice you can get cheese, pepperoni and mushroom, and margarita. If you're hungry I would order more than one slice.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is store has many varieties of candles, vegetables and lot's of family style foods. Every time I go there, it's always packed with people.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really tasty donuts. Haven't had voodoo yet so can't compare but these are a notch below Dough Donuts in Brooklyn if you're familiar with those. Still really good  [END]
[BEGIN] I've had both facial and massage here and they were excellent. I would recommend this facility. The tea lounge is great. Wish they had a whirlpool within this spa.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummy! I mean, you can easily find a HK style cafe in Vancouver, but this is a good spot! Cheap, and comes with a drink of your choice. Fast service and friendly staff. Find street parking and it's kind of hard to find...so watch out!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good portions on the food. Nice outside atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food and drinks. The service is good as well. Have had private functions and dine here regularly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got their best-selling blueberry and "OG" donuts. Pretty unique taste (was there lemon in the OG?), texture was fluffy, and the donut doesn't squish together after one bite. This place reminded me of Sidecar donuts in Santa Monica - high-end donuts with hipster flavors.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chicken lo Mein was fantastic with their special sauce. I've tried lo Mein in some other Chinese restaurants but the sauce available at this place and spices in lo Mein are very tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty darn good banh mi. Not your traditional banh mi, but what they offer is pretty good!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place gets an extra star because it has shuffleboards and I love playing shuffleboard. The beer and food is not spectacular but they have a lot of competition. The game will keep me returning though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sundays are extremely busy and the wait for two can sometime be longer than 15min. Food is good, service is good. Just a good local breakfast joint.  [END]
[BEGIN] 200 kinds of salt, every one of them with a different flavor. you are either the kind of person whom such a prospect bores or thrills to the marrow. as the latter, i heartily recommend. also, the chocolate selection is beautifully-curated and pretty fairly-priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food and cold beer with a great selection. Small place. Try the steak tips or fish and chips. Good music and fun.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good happy hour, and good fish and pork tacos. They are a little pricey if you don't hit happy hour, but still, it's good food. Service has never been bad. I'll go maybe twice a year.  [END]
[BEGIN] We went for my wife's birthday. Very good service. Food was delicious and well presented. Great views of the harbor and Boston skyline. Thanks for the champaign!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere! Nice environment and great services provided by the staffs. The food here is awesome! Loved it!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a litte different from the other powell's, it's smaller but I find my postcard and souvenirs here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Tripleta was amazing! Chicken and everything else very flavorful. Great latin food! Even the red beans and rice were delicious. Great lunch away from the commercial chain restaurants nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love their New England Clam Chowder. It is one of the best I've ever had. The crab cake was too salty for my taste. The service was very friendly and attentive, despite how busy they are.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charming little bakery with tasty cookies, cream puffs and my daughters favorite, Baklava! They also have plenty of exotic herbs and spices. One thing to be aware of is there are exposed nuts, so those with peanut allergies might want to take caution.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for one night. We booked a week here for some friends of ours and decided to come stay one night with them. Very nice large unit with everything you could want. Great pools and Jacuzzi. Would like to go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its like soaring over California @ Disneyland. Well its nice to see similar attraction in Vancouver. The Canadian places featured is wonderful. I have to reduce one star due to the price. Otherwise its good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Finally a great local pizza joint! One can't be expected to go to Santarpio's every time one needs a slice. This place isn't perfect but it's hand tossed, home made sauce, and an awesome creation called the Calabrese.  [END]
[BEGIN] We returned to this place because of the quality of food and helpful service. Everything we ordered was delicious - ramen, sushi rolls, and yakitori. Will definitely go back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The people who complain about this place don't have a leg to stand on. If you're looking for authentic Asian food, this is not the place. If you want some decent sweet & greasy Chinese, then look no further. They have your crispy beefs, crispy chickens, and crispy shrimps covered.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the stay here. And they offer shudle to universal Orlando. Plus free Breakfast from 7am-10am I believe I recommend this place  [END]
[BEGIN] It is okay to try Chinese Foods, I recommend General Gao Chicken. It is little bit sweet and spicy. Besides, it costs around $6.00 for lunch. Reasonable price.  [END]
[BEGIN] The sushi was delicious; the service was friendly and efficient. However, we were charged $1.50 for one tiny dish of gluten free soy sauce. I've eaten at dozens of sushi places and have never been charged for gf soy sauce. They didn't charge for the spicy mayo though. Go figure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice local Colombian style burger joint. I tried their junior cheese burger and junior hotdog. I really liked their burger but wasn't fan of hotdog. Would def go there again and prob next time instead of dog , I'll try their kabobs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, spacious, ease of entry/exit to 2 major streets, Main & 41st, unlike the Main/16th. full size convenience store. Clean washrooms too. Royal Bank ATM & chinese Sing Tao newspaper ;)  [END]
[BEGIN] Really nice place downtown. Almost commissary style restaurant, modest menu of well prepared food. Congenial staff, plenty of parking - recipe for a great place for lunch of a casual quality meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place! It's close to school, so I come here as often as I can. Only issue is I HATE how they wrap their wraps! They always end up falling apart because of the paper they put on the outside. It's not enough to keep me away though!  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to frequent this place in college, but it had been a long time since I'd been here. I was fortunate enough to have dinner here last week with some friends while visiting Austin, and wow, is it good. Hasn't changed a bit. Great neighborhood. Order some fries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tasty broth, not completely loving the noodles or toppings. Super good service and clean place  [END]
[BEGIN] I've lived in this town for 4 days and I've already been here 3 times. I haven't tried the coffee yet, but the banana cream pie and the vegan apple pecan thing was amazing! Oh, and there's wifi, hooray!  [END]
[BEGIN] Visited on 1/31/12 in the 6-8 range of the evening. We shared mozzarella sticks that were the tastiest I've had in a really long time. We ordered a roast beef club to go and it was delectable! :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great staff who welcome you and a quick box office line which is much appreciated! Only wish their old fashioned was better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was excellent. I tried the Classic, the Llano Pablano, and the Truffle Aioli Fries. Burgers were pretty good but did not have enough seasoning. Fries were awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] The tofu soup is so delicious. this restaurant match a person who love strongly spicy.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is one of my favorite places to meet friends for drinks or a casual dinner. They have a few vegetarian options including mac 'n cheese and a portobella mushroom sandwich. Their drinks seem a bit watered down, but $8.29 for a tall vodka/tonic what else should I expect?  [END]
[BEGIN] Created a build your own pizza for under $10. Many options to choose from such as crust, sauce, and toppings. Pizzas come in personal size and are ready in under 10 minutes. Location is right next to Fenway, great meal to fill you up before an event!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for a little corner store. Quick hot fresh to-go food. Decent prices for what you get. Empanadas are delicious. Pastas are overpriced though.  [END]
[BEGIN] I took clients to Eddie V's and had a really good dinner. I had never been to an Eddie V's and didn't know what to expect. We started with smoked salmon toast points. I had the Lemon Sole, which was awesome (large portion).  [END]
[BEGIN] We'll go here for business lunches and I find the meals are filling and delicious. For a more casual experience, visit the attached bar that's right next door.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service, good food and generous portions. I'll be back I'm sure!  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a groupon so wasnt sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised! Excellent service! Did exactly as I requested. Nice and friendly. Will call them again and pay full price, it's worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service. Very polite. Nice ambience. Had veg meatballs and pasta with fra diavolo, garlic bread, root beer float. Everything was good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Was looking for a decent late night spot to eat. I had a burger and fries, girlfriend had the Ruben, both were very good, service wasn't great but they only had one waitress. Definitely gonna try a rice bowl next time, all of which looked good.  [END]
[BEGIN] The vibe here is awesome! The food was really good. Ordered the plantains and an arepa. Best plantains I think I ever had. Gave it a 4 because I left still hungry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Greeted when we walked in the door. Food was really tasty. It's a good and unique change from all the standard places around!  [END]
[BEGIN] Brought my family to eat here couple times. Great environment! I forgot the name of that dish I ordered but they make really good burgers and fish. Service efficiency can be improved though. 4 stars for the food and service and 5 stars for the environment and location.  [END]
[BEGIN] The husband and I just had lunch here a couple days ago. I had the chicken enchilada pizza and Brian had the Gobble Oink Moo sandwich with skin on fries. We loved it! The food is very tasty and the portions are huge. We will definitely be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] came here for breakfast, pretty good. quite a long wait though. i had the fried chicken waffles. it was good and portion size was decent. The only thing i didnt like about it was the cost. it was a little more than i had wanted to pay but worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'd never tried calamari before because it just looked gross. Tried it for the first time here and now I'm HOOKED. I've tried it at a few places since and they've all paled in comparison. I can't wait to go back!!  [END]
[BEGIN] this is a really cool bar it has a club downstairs and a really cool lounge upstairs.. the drinks are really good and the ambient as well.. this is a really cool place to go when you feel like partying a little bit..  [END]
[BEGIN] I just went there today with my mom and my daughter. We all enjoyed the food and service. We will definitely return again  [END]
[BEGIN] Have eaten here for years, always good...my favorite is carne asada :). Located in strip mall, we usually order for pick up and they are generous with portions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Happened to come in here waiting for Playtime to open. Got a ton of veggies and canned goods. Decent place! A little dark, but friendly produce people!  [END]
[BEGIN] We've been twice and the food has been excellent both times. My very selective about food, Gujarati husband approves of the offering here. Easily the best naan we've had in Portland. Well balanced flavors and perfectly cooked dishes. Really lovely ambience and staff too!  [END]
[BEGIN] We ate here twice during our time here. It was a very busy time because of all of the events going on, however, our servers were attentive and personable. Plenty of programming choices and the sweet potato fries were very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] A pleasant surprise. I was very impressed with the set-up of the coffee shop. They had excellent customer service. The food items were very good as well. I highly recommend stopping in for a coffee and a snack if you're in the neighborhood. You will not be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think that the GSU gym is a great facility. Only issue is the whole rule on having a t-shirt/no shirts with no sleeves ir you can't workout in the gym. Where they do that at?  [END]
[BEGIN] Cupcakes are pretty darn good here! I'm not religious but this company is; I just ignored the "god bless you" during my phone call to them and the Bible quotes posted inside the shop. The staff is very nice and they have fun flavors. I would recommend these tasty bites.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place for Spanish food., while visiting Boston. The servers were friendly and the food came out quickly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I only had a cup of coffee. But it was the best cup of drip coffee I've had in maybe months. Cafe Vita coffee from Seattle apparently. Oh, and free wifi! I did have a sip of someone else's espresso, which was very good also.  [END]
[BEGIN] The breakfast tacos are good... they need to put the menu online.  [END]
[BEGIN] The views are worth the flight up the stairs every time. Even if you come in the summer, it will be worth the sweaty trio you make up the steps.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really enjoyed it. Lunch was Chicken Ginger Scallion and was too big to finish. It was all very fresh and tasy. I will return. Great place for a business lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is our favorite noodle house. Forget the ambiance - it's a dive. Service - yeahno. It's almost self serve. But the noodles. Oh the glorious noodles! The noodles with leeks and lamb. Seriously mouthwatering! Dumplings - yes more please! Dipping sauce. Nice and spicy. Delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it! Delivery is fast. The tikka masala is perfectly balanced, not too spicy but just right. The naan is really good. I've also enjoyed the pakoras and samosa.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely, as ordered- the escargot in particular was delicious. Good service, lovely mussels and frites. Very nice French country food, at a very reasonable price.  [END]
[BEGIN] My initial review was based on one delivery experience, so I decided to give this place another shot. I only order takeout now, but their sushi is GOOD. No complaints there. I still prefer my Chinese food elsewhere, but for the price, this is now my go-to sushi stop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very delicious Malay food and nice interior. I recommend the roti canai, pineapple seafood rice and sayur lemak. Making my mouth water just writing that all down.  [END]
[BEGIN] No complaints about Stinson's! The shop is clean and organized, and they serve breakfast in addition to their coffee. The price is fair and the coffee is good, so what more can you really ask for.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have great clam chowder. We went to the Halloween Tea and had a blast! Recommend this place for a cocktail & snack.  [END]
[BEGIN] very reasonably priced artisan-family italian. cute place, too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent staff and service. The owner was constantly joking with patrons. Food was delicious, as good if not better than say Olive Garden  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a groupon for $39 for a 80 massage. They give u cool robes and shoes to change into.. great customized services down to your mood music to tea vs. Water  [END]
[BEGIN] Waffle sundae is worth a visit. Chicken saté not so much. Nice selection of beer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, but wasn't full. A little pricey. Very helpful staff and friendly. The atmosphere was awesome! Tried their chef special - steak with salad which was pretty good. And ALL organic!  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a 20% coupon and I'm glad I ran across it! Food and service was great. The veggie plate and fish was amazing! This was my first time here and I'm visiting from Chicago. I will be returning here when I return back to ATL  [END]
[BEGIN] They did a great job and took their time getting the style right. Good idea to make an apt. just in case there is a school dance nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow. Harsh reviews! I've been here twice and the crew working were great. Welcoming, smiling and attentive. What else could one ask for?!  [END]
[BEGIN] Always a good choice. Never regretted anything ordered. Staff very friendly. Try the Pad Thai, Pad See-yu, basil or pineapple fried rice, spring roll, Massaman Curry ... All our favorites  [END]
[BEGIN] Love everything about bodega! This is a great place to come at the end of a night and have one last beer before heading home. They are just cool guys who know beer and want to share their knowledge!  [END]
[BEGIN] Sunday pizza delivery at Lake Forest Community pool. Delivery showed up under 30 min. Thin pizzas, hot hogies, and knots were great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Genie's was great. I went with 4 people on a Sunday and it was crowded but it didn't take too long to seat us. Pretty solid brunch choice as far as SE goes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Burrito tastes good, but please don't let the new person roll my burrito ! I paid for it so please have someone who has been through the training session to roll my burrito. Burritos taste amazing though.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's Tokyo Joe's. Healthy "fast" food. Good tasting too. I guess that's all I have to say. It shouldn't be tough to convince someone to go try a fast food restaurant, should it? We hit this place when we need food quick and don't feel like cooking.  [END]
[BEGIN] The place is quiet and will meet your expectations. The staff are excellent. The snacks were a miss for me, but that may be personal preference.  [END]
[BEGIN] The AM drive-thru staff are such sweethearts, it's a pleasure to see them first thing in the morning. This particular dunks is my favorite  [END]
[BEGIN] Great date place. Wayy better than what used to be here before....that for sure. Fun food, great service, will definitely come back again. Some of the food quality could be a tab better though. Also really appreciate the valet parking here not being a rip off!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, a little pricey for me but I'm cheap!:). I was looking for good empanada and these hot rhe spot!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Lobster ravioli is fantastic, the bartender, Craig is top notch. Atmosphere and cleanliness is five stars, of the two times eating here, three of our four items were very good and one.....not so much. Thus four stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm from rom Houston Tx, so I'm picky with my Mexican food. First test is the great salsa and chips. Chips were crispy not stale. Clean restaurant and friendly staff. Horchata was on point! Fast service. Will definitely come again.  [END]
[BEGIN] yum. in the high $ range. good service. been there 3x. hint: if there's a line, see about sitting at the bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little spot. Walked in off the street without a reservation and we were seated immediately. The menu is always changing depending on the season. I'd love to go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Indo-chinese food. Often come here when we're in this area shopping. On our mist recent visit, waiter Manny made some great food recommendations.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Vegas roll is fire!!!! I seem to always be pulled here when I'm in the area. The are always nice and seems to be helpful. The prices aren't that bad for the order size, always grab some sticky mayo to go too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything you could possibly want in a dive diner for a hangover breakfast. Eggs benedict, steak, pork chops, coffee, hash browns, and coffee.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great tacos (fried green tomato), great service, bottomless mimosas, and reservations at 12:30 on Sunday. Perfection. I'll be back  [END]
[BEGIN] Papis is really good for lunch or dinner if you are in the mood for drinks and sandwiches. I would strongly recommend you steer clear of the margaritas (they are syrupy, sour, and too sweet). However, the mojito is very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] My friends and I love ths t place. It s small and no fancy but who cares, we come for the food and it s amazing. Be ready to use your fingers to eat  [END]
[BEGIN] The margherita was absolutely delicious. Full of flavor and toppings. The garlicky flavor was a wonderful touch. The pepperoni was mediocre in comparison. Not too different from your other pizza joints. I love how the pizza slices are rebaked before they are served to guarantee the taste.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Belgium waffle really tasted like french toast in waffle form. The grapefruit mimosa divine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great sports bar with awesome beer selection and choice wings! Wait staff also quite friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Bar specials- 25 cent wings and 2.99 pizzas were very good...Bartender was very attentive and friendly, I would definitely recommend this place for a good affordable lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little dive spot near Quincy Market. The Shepards Pie and Irish Spring Rolls were awesome. My boyfriend had the Irish Steak Tips with Irish sausage and bacon. He loved it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Blue Ginger is my go to neighborhood Asian fusion place. I can and often do eat here a few times each week. The sushi is always fresh, the service is friendly and helpful, the entrees are interesting and the fried rice is the best I've ever had.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, simple Greek fare. Good prices. Ample portions. Friendly staff. Big, fat gyro sandwiches. The dolmas are probably canned, though. All in all, pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I must say, this is the better of the 3 CVS in the area. Courteous, helpful and friendly best describe them  [END]
[BEGIN] I really liked this place and would love to go back again.....Great burger in Atlanta. I love local and organic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome place to visit on a lazy day! The UBC campus is like a small town and the Beaty is worth a visit  [END]
[BEGIN] how can I get my hands on a bottle of that sauce????? I considered assault & robbery today, it was that good. simple, fresh & only $5. duh, winning! the line was not long when I went....  [END]
[BEGIN] Little hole in the walll place with just a few tables. The watress was nice. The owner was walking around talking to everyone. Excellent food. Had the mushroom swiss burger and fries. That and iced, total with tip was $13. I would definitely recommend coming here.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's so refreshing seeing something that's so unique and tasty at the same time! You make your own pizza, chose a style and all the toppings you can thing of. Even if you're vegan, you can eat here. Enjoy the goodness of a fresh, hand crafted pizza.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very satisfying lunch take-out. Easily the best fast Thai in the area. Plus, the old Thai woman who runs the show here is adorable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great meal. Tilapia with onions, tomatoes and garlic was great as was the veggie combo. Only flaw was the clearly bottled Italian dressing on the iceberg lettuce salad. Service was nice and atmosphere quaint.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good service even when they are busy. Just a heads up to anyone needing to use American Express they do not except this form of payment, all others are fine though. Will visit them again soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am blessed to live in the South End where there are soooo many great restaurants right out side my door. Thank goodness because I hate to cook. This place is one of my family's favorites. Good food, cocktails, beers, and service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Reasonable prices for great coffee? Comfy leather chairs and outdoor seating? Friendly baristas? Fast and free wifi? That's a quadruple check, this place is wonderful and the fact that it's located in downtown Decatur is extra credit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Impeccable view of the Atlanta skyline. I suggest you go at night to see all the lights. Fun 15 minute ride  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food! Great service! Waiter was attentive. We were a larger group for my friends birthday. I'd come back. Recommend checking it out. Restaurant is small though. Not a whole lot of seating. Make resos!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great ambiance, great drinks, great patio. Drinks are a bit pricey but they are innovative and worth the price! Food is pretty good as well. Fried Oysters and the Peppered Ribeye is delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] My sister, boyfriend, and I love Indian food and Masala Art is a great find. We just had a fantastic dinner. This place has the best garlic naan and veggie samosas!  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been to Anh's Kitchen twice now and have been pleased both times. The clay pot combination was delicious. My second visit I got the pork banh mi and the fish sauce chicken wings. A little pricey compared to Pho King a few blocks away but worth a visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very happy with our meal. Kid friendly, clean, good portions, fast and friendly service and yummy food!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's such a shame that this place is so hard to get to unless you're heading east on 4th in a car, cause they make a mean Americano. Sometimes I go out of the way just to get it, but I don't always have the extra time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent chicken Parmesan, fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and herb roared chicken dinners. We we searching up and down International Drive and this restaurant had plenty of seats. Great service and atmosphere in a smaller eating area. We Will definitely eat here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] We've purchased patio furniture and our in ground pool from scioto valley. Really pleased with service and quality of everything bought here.  [END]
[BEGIN] For sushi delivered quickly yet effectively, it is awesomely outrageous. Recommended to you all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rockin ruthanne, queso, the straight plate. Hands down best in austin. Kid/family friendly. Covered patio. Too good  [END]
[BEGIN] I think the description of "experience" is very appropriate for this attraction. Usually there is a really short wait for the experience so this one is great to do as a filler rider. Takes about 15 minutes all together but worth going on once.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, cheap option for a quick meal before heading for the theater. I usually get a steak taco and rice which fills me up.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would give them 5 stars, except that it is a mile from my house and does not deliver to me. Everything else is what you would expect from a jimmy johns, great subs fast...  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, authentic Taiwanese beef noodles. $10.75 per bowl. Costs an extra $1 for wide noodles.  [END]
[BEGIN] Barking crab it is a lively bar on the water. Great drinks including the crabby margarita. The Rhode Island calamari is great.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was actually a really funny and informative experience. A bit pricy maybe but worth the hour spent in the tour.  [END]
[BEGIN] They are consistently good. Excellent noodles and dumplings - which can see them preparing in house. I think their Peking Duck is consistently one of the best I've ever had; and is offered at a very reasonable price.  [END]
[BEGIN] This location is really nice. A very cute boutique with very unique items. The store is running a very good sale at this moment so got myself some cool stuff for a very affordable price. I highly recommend you stop by, you will find something cute to wear for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good. Beautiful view: ask for at table by the window when you book. Impeccable service. The lamb was amazing. The Opera desert is worth a detour!!  [END]
[BEGIN] They are picking up their speed on making shakes...nice to see...catching up to Davie St location ...nice store...great location  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely knowledgeable waitress, huge portions & great food. The pineapple cider was amazing. Would definitely recommend visiting for drinks, food & friendly atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had broccoli cheddar soup and turkey flatbread, we ordered for 3 people, wait time at the window after I paid was about 6 mins,. Food was good though  [END]
[BEGIN] Visited Mudra for the first time this past weekend and was really happy. I received a deep tissue massage from David and will definitely ask for him again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The coffee is great. The breakfast tacos are very good and reasonable priced. The staff is great. The coffee shop has a cool vibe. Good music and nice layout of place. Close to work. Overall, good experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Though the service is hit or miss, the Super Bowl is always a healthy food hit. The margaritas are also pretty good. And the back patio is great in the summer and fall. Definitely give their hot sauces a hit to add some serious zing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have only had a Cubano here so far, but it was pretty damn good. The menu looks good, sandwiches, yucca frita, vaca frita, open 7 days a week - I will be back very soon. Glad to have them in the neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great view of Buckhead ATL. Beautiful Spanish/Morroccan-themed decor. Music was wonderful. Service is okay, nothing noteworthy in that aspect. The crowd is okay, kind of all afraid to mingle. Otherwise good place to go with a group of friends just looking to share bites and drinks with each other.  [END]
[BEGIN] They promptly addressed my concern and were able to accomodate a revisit smartly. The later blow out was done really well and so I beleive they made up for the issues.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dominos has done an incredible job of reinventing themselves over the past few years. If you haven't tried them lately, you haven't tried them.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been getting delivery from here for a couple years. The food is excellent. Tasty Pizza & Subs. Friendly & efficient over the phone Great Mussels !!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good dumplings, simple because they only serve dumplings. And surprisingly no one Asian works there.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went to the happy hour here. It was yummy. Some of the highlights were the brussels sprouts and any sushi pieces we ordered. Seriously an average-looking sushi piece will taste absolutely amazing here. Go here! ...but stick to happy hour if you're watching your wallet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious Mexican food. Huge but tasty burrito. Try the red salsa. Spicy but good flavor. Friendly staff. Delicious fresh guacamole & homemade tortillas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Who knew pasta and meatballs could be so good. Maggianos is a great restaurant for large groups. The family style is fantastic. Great selection of wines. For a downtown location, parking is easy.  [END]
[BEGIN] After getting myself readjusted at my awesome chiropractor, I was pleased to discover that this place is in the same lot. Tried the ham sandwich with the gouda spread. Very tasty indeed. Perhaps after tomorrows appointment I will try something on the sweeter side.  [END]
[BEGIN] Low-priced drinks. Nice and dark. Downstairs consists of a long and narrow path. There's an open air area up stairs with some picnic tables before another dark and narrow area upstairs. We sat at the tables and there was no one around us.  [END]
[BEGIN] Huge portions. Had wings, waffle fry nachos, fried pickles, white pizza, Philly cheese steak, fish and chips and lasagne (quite the variety) and everyone enjoyed their meal. We ordered way too much!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was amazing. The food spectacular , and the price even better. Everything was on point and the service was great. Happy hour was a plus!  [END]
[BEGIN] The reviews about the workers not speaking english is really funny to me. You know you're in Chinatown right?!  [END]
[BEGIN] Second time we have ever had Thai food and it was amazing! Loved the vegetable tofu curry stew with rice and the chicken vegetable noodle dish. We are trying to find parking right now to eat there again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it, love it, love it. It was fun. Our tour guide was hilarious and knowledgeable (i don't know a lot about beer). The cheapest attraction in Boston. Well worth the trip...  [END]
[BEGIN] Really cool place! Go in and have a nice lunch with some wine and then take the chocolate tour. It's really informative and there is a little tasting at the end. Lasted about 55 min. Our tour guide Patty shared a lot of cool information in a very entertaining manner.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's great to walk in no appointment and get a pedi. Service was quality and fast! I'll be back again. I thought the price was reasonable as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tasty NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER, not too thick, but flavorful, briny broth, with a hint of bacon. CHIPS, so good and plentiful. Took home. LOBSTER ROLL, good. OYSTERS, loved!  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid fried chicken sandwich for a petty good lunch! I tried out the hot chick (*immature chuckle*) and found it perfect. Nice sized chicken, great hot sauce, amazing sweet potato fries. All in all, a great lunch if you're in the area!  [END]
[BEGIN] I rarely give 5 stars but this is dam close. Best brunch in Van and I am never disappointed here. Every dish I've had is great. Must have the belgian waffles and try ALL the dipping sauces. And the lavender mocha is tops. Bon Appetit  [END]
[BEGIN] Gets crazy busy. Opens at 1130 and full by 1145. Service is quick. Informal setting, not a good choice for a meeting as very cramped and quick turnover. Nice that you can easily order extra noodles and broth. Noodles maybe not quite as good as Ramengers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice and clean HEB! It was great. Oh and HUGE!  [END]
[BEGIN] Free beer. Need I say more!? Great gift shop and it is only a hop, skip and a jump from subway!  [END]
[BEGIN] Was there 9 pm on Sat night. Unfortunately, bathrooms were not working and they were still waiting for plumber. Not good. On the plus side: Our server was Kelsey who was delightful and attentive. Thank you, Kelsey! Pizza and salad were good, too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is great, but a little pricy for lunch. $12 for basic sandwich with fries, but it is good! Parking during lunch time is HORRIBLE. They have to be losing a huge amount of their lunch traffic because there is no where to park!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Better than Stauf's. The barista made a near-perfectly executed latte (no latte-art, though) 3/3 times over the course of two days. Wish the atmosphere was better. OK, but not great.  [END]
[BEGIN] The BLOODY MARY BAR is amazing!!!! This was my first time at this restaurant and my first Bloody Mary. I would have to say that it was delicious... yummy in my tummy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Open 24 hours a day and they serve donuts, sandwiches and pizza! You don't even have to go anywhere else, they have you covered for all of your day's food needs. Only had the donuts the other day and they were pretty good. $6.50 for a half dozen.  [END]
[BEGIN] 5 stars for customer service .waiter was very nice and welcoming. I ordered the picahna .very tender but bland. The fried yuca was delicious I may return again to try a different steak.  [END]
[BEGIN] The punk rock "Cheers." Loud music, good shows, karaoke on most Sundays, cheap beer, and a great jukebox. The place to go to when there is nothing else to do and you feel like going to a bar. Friendly staff and a No-frills approach make this bar great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Coffee was great, but the hot tea was better! the blue hot tea pot made my day much happier! Love the atmosphere here  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice mexican food in Waltham. They have good margaritas too. The food portions are enormous - you wont leave hungry.  [END]
[BEGIN] The risotto is delicious, a little pricey and if you are in a rush, this is not the right place for you. I put a 4 stars as the service is sometimes slow and some weekends you do not access to the pastries, all are gone in a hour.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really - in an airport. I go in and out of ATL a lot and I'd never eaten here. Boy, was I wrong. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced. It is a great departure (pun intended) from the oh drum airport sustenance. Good stuff. I'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] That's was an amazing cannoli! I bet it has a great Butcher. The exterior has an Old school charm to it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent breakfast. The potatoes are awesome... so is the bacon... and the eggs. That's what I had. Good OJ too. We sat at the bar and were told about Oregon for a while. That was the only downside. The upside of the bar was that we didn't have to wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this place. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS PLACE IS THE TACO TRUCK. The 3 dollar tacos are DELICIOUS. MMMMMMMMMMMM  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm one of those weirdos who go to happy hour to eat!!! I really love their chicken street tacos....yum!d  [END]
[BEGIN] Went to Olive Garden with my co workers for lunch. Alex our waiter was so delightful and accommodating. He was on time with our dishes and served with a smile. Food was good too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small little place very quaint. Unbelievably good sushi at an unbelievably good price. Great thing is I wrote the street from my house and saw absolutely be back here again. Highly recommended great service also  [END]
[BEGIN] Great dinner at the bar - very friendly atmosphere, excellent music selection, no TV blaring, good bartender. Food was delicious, spicy, interesting. Definitely recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was very good, all three of us had the filet! Service good, the waiter did not interrupt conversation and was very discreet. Excellent choices for wine. I would definitely return  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, food is above average, service is almost always excellent! The only issue we ever have is wait times for a table during lunch and dinner service. Its a good local restaurant but to busy most days to just drop in for a quick meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stanford you hit the spot! The food here is amazing. We were promptly greeted upon our arrival. The wait staff was very punctual and informative. The atmosphere was very relaxing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very friendly staff. They stayed open a little later and called for extra support staff on Thanksgiving to make sure that the patients were all seen before they closed  [END]
[BEGIN] Best wings ever! Staff is o.k. Service is o.k. Lots of sports on the televisions which surround the entire place! And they show hockey!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location, excellent menu choice and some good beer too! Wife and daughter had the mingas and really liked them. I had the classic breakfast and it was done just the way I like it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good. Great gyros and baklava. Restaurant could be a little cleaner. Broken down boxes by bathroom and the annoying fly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought a v-dub from here. Given that a majority of car salespeople are just terrible, this is as good as it gets. Staff: Polite, friendly, helpful, comedic, and not opposed to making a deal. We brought price print-outs from TrueCar, KBB, and Edmunds. We were happy with the negotiated price.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far... every time I eat here, the food never fails me. Recently we had the cubano and WOW it is amazing. The people are very friendly too. They always have new art hanging from their walls so during the day time you can see them.  [END]
[BEGIN] As a previous reviewer mentioned, this is mainly a place to come during the summer to enjoy the outdoor dining. The menu isn't particularly imaginative but the food is good and prices surprisingly reasonable given the location, especially if you go for one of the daily specials.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, reasonably priced breakfast fare in a nice, comfy environment. Friendly and attentive staff. They have decent GF options as well. Always a plus. I'd go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The remodel has made for a fancy-er Produce Row. The patio is really nice although a bit noisy. Nice draught selection. Love the Beer & Whiskey Pairings! We didn't get a chance to eat, next time!  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious roast beef! Typically order a garden salad with roast beef- delicious! Tons of roast beef on top!  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummy restaurant in animal kingdom. Chicken tikka masala was very delicious... Plenty of spicy sauce and tender chicken! Lo mein with chicken and shrimp was enough for two kids to share. Passion fruit lemonade was worth it for kids.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a burger here to try it out. The food and service was good but I wasn't particularly impressed. Would still drive out if my way to go to Yeah Burger.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent place on Sunday for a chill funday. If Tom is there, it's 5stars. Otherwise, it's a good pub to stop by when I'm downtown crossing area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Phad Panang is very good. I order it Thai Hot. It is the spiciest /heat. My teenager also orders this dish-regular and is her favorite. Can't decide, this dish is a pleaser.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic food but the line up is brutal. And why do you close at 3pm when folks are clearly still wanting to grab a bite!  [END]
[BEGIN] I am a fan & very picky about massages. This is Austin's best kept secret, needed to share!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent! Great Pizza by the slice on Congress, prepare to wait a few minutes as this place can get pretty busy, but is worth the wait!  [END]
[BEGIN] I recently attended one of the workshops, and I found it therapeutic, empowering, and informative. It was a bit lengthy, but once we got started, the time flew by. I definitely recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall, This Pizza place is very much "on the ball", whether pick-up or delivery. I really have only seen competence and good quality of food. The place is very clean and the Staff welcoming when you go in. I can only highly recommend them at this time. Enjoy!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice hotel in middle of Boston near Chinese town and theatre district. Large rooms, friendly service. We decided to take a skyview room and it was impressible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good portions. Cowboy burger was tasty. Bun was super fresh. I prefer a toasted bun. Came after the lunch rush and things were a bit messy  [END]
[BEGIN] It was really great since we were renting a house right outside the park and even though he closed at 5pm the man was very accommodating to us. The pricing could be more competitive. But we liked it and the park was great  [END]
[BEGIN] what a great place for excellent quality pizza. Have eaten their once and taken out several times. crispy eggplant pizza and chicken parm sliders to die for. Worth the trip though I don't live in Boston. Highly recomend!  [END]
[BEGIN] love their nouns and lam, delicious! it's our weekend favorite place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been using handy for home cleaning for awhile and their service is great: professional, efficient, independent, affordable. My house looks good when my cleaner leaves. I've had a few cleaners and their not all of the same quality but Mirquella, the one I have now, is terrific.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great bar, good food happening atmosphere. The margaritas are great, specially the one with the midget corona. You have to have the tequila ice shots for desert.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not much to say, we were upgraded and then service was quick and efficient. Could have used a little direction once in the garage but all in all, pretty good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yum!! The restaurant was empty so I was a little nervous, but this was the best pho I've ever had! I had the tofu pho and it was so flavorful and DELICIOUS! My bf got the chicken and rice plate which was also really tasty. Will definitely be returning:)  [END]
[BEGIN] Bahn Mi, Pho, Vermicelli. Not great service, but a great choice for Pho if you're in that neck of the woods.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered the beef and chicken yakisoba, added a fried egg for a buck. Smothered it in teriyaki sauce and sweet chili sauce. Delicious, next time I'll get half rice half yakisoba. Togo box please! Inner dining area and neighborhood is dinghy and ghetto, but fabulous food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great brunch spot. Had some kind of chorizo meatball sandwich that was one of the top ten sandwiches I've ever had.  [END]
[BEGIN] $1 oysters on Sunday from 8pm onward!  [END]
[BEGIN] Make sure you go there hungry so you can get your money's worth! Usually a friendly staff and good food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. I had the wood plank salmon with veggies. Good portion, great flavor. Whole table was jealous of my plate. Anyways, the manager was really sweet to out birthday girl! Made me a fan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quick hot and fresh. Want some actual food but are in a hurry come get a rice bowl w beef and your out the door in minutes. Fast food but good !!  [END]
[BEGIN] Muy muy rico, tanto los Friks como las patatas, espectaculares....y las salsas que las acompañan increíbles! Además tienen una gran selección de cervezas artesanales a tener muy en cuenta. Muy recomendable si estás en Boston =)  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is one of the best places to eat down park however the service can be a bit dismal at times. I have eaten at this location dozens of times and it's very good food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Few things about this place, it is very unique, few tables, very charming employees, outstanding sushi, overall fantastic experience. Amazing thank you!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great tacos, wide selection, cheap prices. Breakfast burritos are good. Nice hot sauce.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious food and beautiful atmosphere. I would highly recommend this restaurant for both it's food and service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pack a picnic & a camera and you are set for an afternoon of simple R&R.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used to be my FAVORITE place. Loved the wheat pizzas with amazing toppings. Recently the last pizza I got was WAY below par. I was actually a bit embarrassed that I so strongly recommended it for friends. New management? Bad day?  [END]
[BEGIN] Another Texas BBQ classic place Centrally located on Riverside Line at 2:30 pm on weekday illustrated popularity Had moist brisket and TASTY ribs. Sides were all good, nice beer selection Would return  [END]
[BEGIN] Quaint little spot near the waterfront. Many southern flavors-definitely a good place to try something out of your comfort zone. EMPANADAS. Did I say empanadas? Warning: the wings are tasty but greasy!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is very good. Also, the Asian / Hawaiian market next door is mind blowing good!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Got the blueberry cake donut, pbj donor, buttermilk old fashioned and a cinnamon sugar donut. The cake style ones are better. Overall delicious and great service!  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect place to have winter noodle soup & hot dumplings...All vegetarian options are yummy..  [END]
[BEGIN] This is nice, tiny place for a cozy date, but I wouldn't recommend it for a group. Not only is it a small place, but that's just not the vibe. So get a cocktail, order some bacon-wrapped dates, split a big arepa, and get sexy.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is my go to place for comfort food. The congee is flavourful and the noodle dishes are consistently good. No real complaints about the food but the service is pretty typical of any Chinese restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, but too cramped. Service was very attentive and accomidating with the menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] the boneless wings here are very tasty, crispy and have a lot of sauce on them just like I like.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dark. Cozy. $1.50 PBR pints during happy hour. Huge portions of guac/salsa/chips if you order that (and I recommend doing so). And, of course, you can pet the wallpaper when you begin to slump against the walls after all those cheap drinks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely some of the best live music in the Boston area, for zero dollars, and some remarkably hard-to-find beer on tap (you may never have had a Guinness like this outside of Ireland).  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is consistently thorough! They take the time to do the job right. My car - inside and out- always looks great without spending a lot!  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place. Their subs are really tasty. You can't compare Subway or Quiznos. The quality is so much better at the deli.  [END]
[BEGIN] I always love coming to Hyde Park Bar & Grill when visiting Austin. The service is always great and I love their chicken fried steak and awesome fries! Give them a try!  [END]
[BEGIN] Another restaurant we visited while in Massachusetts. I had the lobster roll and lobster bisque was excellent! My husband had the burger and he loved it. Service was excellent. I recommend this spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best Ramen noodles in Boston! Big Portions and great taste. (Ok, SF ppl you have much better ramen over there...I mean AMAZING, but this is all we got). Prefer this over Mei Tei Noodle in Newbury. Big fan of the Soy Sauce Noodle or the Miso. Also like the ravioli  [END]
[BEGIN] I visited here twice during a trip to Concord and Boston in 2015. Pizza was delicious, and we catered it for a small party with some friends near the end of the trip. Over a weeks period our group went here twice, and it was appetizing both times.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is for License holder only... The price is fair. They store various beauty supplies. Only one thing I have to complain about is hard to find the price tag on the shelf or on the supply. I would appreciate if they have price tag on individual supplies....  [END]
[BEGIN] Our server Nic was great. Loved the oysters we ordered. A lot of variety on the menu and a great beer selection on tap. Mango salsa swordfish and dirty rice dishes were really good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid food! Their steak was high quality, their Chicken Mole was quite authentic and their Margaritas were strong. The only thing that was interesting (not to my taste) was the pickled veggies. Overall, this place is much more authentic then the run of the mill Mexican food places.  [END]
[BEGIN] Convenient location, quick and friendly service, tons of parking, good standard food - everything that's good about Panera!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Burger Joint ! The onion rings are insane for sure. Just good food ......... puts a smile on your face.  [END]
[BEGIN] I LOVE Lady Siam. I've had their spring rolls, crag rangoon, bubble tea, noodle soup with beef and many other dishes. The food is always hot, fresh and flavorful. They are my number one pick for Thai in Arlington.  [END]
[BEGIN] Update: I am very appreciative that the management at Horizons has made an effort to address my concerns about the service that I received. Because of their attentive and friendly service, I think they deserve some extra stars. I am looking forward to going back and giving them another chance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Suan la Chow Show is what we came for. And it will always be one of our favorite dishes. We have tried (as have others), to reverse engineer the recipe. We can get close, but Mary is holding the recipe close!!! Delicious!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. Highly recommend the Grilled Cheese with smoked gouda, pesto, and and smoked salmon. That's right. Staff is super friendly. Only downside is they have horrible music playing 90% of the time. The remaining 10% is when a staff member brings in their own iPod.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice brunch spot. The berries and cream crepes was so good. I also tried the summer in italy which is french toast with fruits which was also pretty good. Ordered takeout this time but would definitely come back to dine in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have visited twice now, wonderful breakfast, try the egg pie, wonderful. Only complaint would be some of the waiter,s. If you decide to eat here often buy a cup, bring it in with you for a discount. Reasonable prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummy, reasonably priced pizza on Newbury Street. Ambaiance and decor are nice, and they can usually seat large parties or handle large reservations.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oh yea! This place is good! We came for breakfast on a weekend. Walked right in and sat right down, no wait. The food was very tasty and service friendly  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a good time at the Chinese New Year celebration. The performances were quite good. The ticket price came with several dollars towards the food.  [END]
[BEGIN] this was realllly good pho. the food came out quick, the restaurant is clean with ample tables and seating. would highly recommend if you've got the vietnamese craving.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very very clean place and yummy options in both vegetarian and non vegetarian options. The chicken biryani and curry were super yummy and the bondas and pakodas were so good too!the pineapple milkshake in the end cuaght us by surprise and was so refreshingly yummy !  [END]
[BEGIN] Piano is a little too loud. However, the food is excellent and the overall ambience is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Aside from the funny name (say it out loud and you'll get it), good food with major variety and fun combinations. Avoid it during lunch time when college is in session, too busy then.  [END]
[BEGIN] Saturday morning rush was crazy, as expected. Once we sat down we had prompt service. Drinks and food was delicious. Server recommended the black bean scramble, and I ate every bite! The scotch eggs were awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this place. The barbeque is moist and tasty. Ice cold beer. Good service I have had the sandwiches as well as the brisket meals with cole slaw and veggies. BBQ sauce is tasty with holt and mild/  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummy food and scorpion bowls are amazing! I especially love that they have a separate menu for those with a nut allergy like myself :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Outstanding pho and summer rolls. Very clean restaurant. Service was fast and the food very flavorful. Will cone back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice little shop. Stopped in after a show. Only tried the iced coffee-which really hit the spot. But all the pastries look d yummy!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pekoe offers a nice selection of teas, their coffee is also good and service is friendly. The atmosphere is pleasant with enough seating and a small patio. Light colors and contemporary, actually, reminds me a little bit of Vic's. Good option for a small break during the day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hostel was hospitable from the very friendly staff to the complimentary beverage for relief from the humidity! For one slightly past my "hostel" staying years, this was comfortable, inviting, and intriguing! The only caveat is the din from the environs is real so bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper!!  [END]
[BEGIN] We went on a 'down' time. PARKING - Easy on the street but was during 3-6pm day time. DECOR - Love the spacious couches, large windows, sectioned off areas, a pretty spacious bar area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big, gooey, wonderfully unique donuts. Psyched for this place and their recent success. Can't wait to come back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Wish parking was better..but that's the Austin way of life. Great coffee..got the winter half moon latte. Came in on a Tuesday in the afternoon and there were no seats for 3 of us to study at. Intimate setting  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful food! Awesome scenery!! Bar service was much faster than sit down portion of restaurant. The fish and chips were the best I've ever had.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, good service. Not a chain. I love it and their patio is awesome. I will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Interesting menu, off of the beaten path of menus. We enjoyed the flavorful dishes, and the drinks were superb. Perfect for drinks and a smaller appetite. Go for the unique offerings and flavors, in food and drink, you won't be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] good food for lunch break and fast serve. will definitely come back again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Another great meal at Joe's! Sam, our waitress was great and quick! 20 min wait to be seated at 5:00 on a Sunday. I didn't expect them to be so busy, but it is a holiday weekend. The s'mores dessert was yummy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the tots, hate the kickballers. Just don't come on kickball night and you're golden. Those fuckers just block every single TV in the joint and make it more like a frat party than a bar. Overall, good food for a sports bar, decent beer selection, nice location and atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bar crawl on the Freedom Trail and one runs into this place. I was really impressed by it. Typical Irish bar, nice bartender, they know how to pour a pint of Guinness as well. I would like to make a return to Boston and keep this place in mind.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is great. Space is great. Other guests? Not sure yuppie quite captures the holier-than-thou feeling I was surrounded by. Loved the polaroid pictures and would go back in spite of the fact that I was obviously beneath the company gracing me with their presence. Puh-luh-eeeeeaze.  [END]
[BEGIN] Some very tasty dipping sauces. The pomme frites and the Liège waffles are pretty good. They also make poutine, and they have a very interesting sandwich menu. Good service. Friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was great, portions were perfect for the pricing. Three co-workers ordered the salmon on a plank and loved it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Called to get them to come back and deliver the drink I ordered, but they did come back. Food tastes great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good Italian food. The happy hour is excellent. Penne carbonara was a standout. Glad to find some good Italian in Colorado!  [END]
[BEGIN] Meats are very good. I had the brisket and pulled pork sandwich. Sides are slightly above average.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best Italian food outside of the North End. With 8 tables the dining is certainly intimate. On Friday & Saturday you better put your name in and then plan to go for a drink. I'm a fan of Chicken Marsala and don't forget to order the house Merlot.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm a huge fan of this place! They have a great selection of soul and classic rock. The prices are extremely reasonable, and I haven't heard a record that didn't play terrifically. This store has a great feel and I they've won me over. Customer for life!  [END]
[BEGIN] Have come here multiple times for bites with the hubs and friends. Plump mussels, luscious oysters, cocktail specials. Truffle fries are delicious and happy hour menu is very decent. Great location and although service can be spotty, once it gets rolling it is quite enjoyable!  [END]
[BEGIN] OMG so good! Food=Delicious Drinks=Fabulous Staff=Friendly & Knowledgeable Love this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really nice looking Starbucks inside the Animal Kingdom. Staff was friendly and pretty quick. The attention to detail inside the place was pretty incredible. Even more amazing was the pricing was pretty average and not marked up because it was inside Disney (cheaper than NYC at least).  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect go-to hk-styled restaurant with consistent hours of operation. Your typical Chinese food and above average service here. A smaller place but I haven't waited for more than 10 mins whenever I come!  [END]
[BEGIN] Yum. Great Food. We really like Indian food and have enjoyed many dishes. For intimate dinning experience reserve a table down stairs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun times! Great atmosphere...reminds me of the clubs in L.A. And the bar tenders were generous!  [END]
[BEGIN] Line was long but the donuts were good and HUGE! Does not accept credit or debit cards, they do have an ATM in the store but it's better to just make sure you have cash on you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Courteous staff. Competitive pricing. I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this store 2 days ago. I appreciated their honesty and quick service. Definitely will return and would recommend them to anyone that will listen.  [END]
[BEGIN] amazing goat curry and cabbage!!! Absolutely delicious. Also try their sweet tea!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice views on the water, fun atmosphere and tasty seafood! Lobster rolls were delish!  [END]
[BEGIN] Been to Kimchi couple times for lunch. its a fun little place. Food is good, servers are friendly. I usually have their Bento boxes. Its not the best korean out there, but its pretty decent. I would definitely recommend the place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall, I liked the food and atmosphere, although service was slow. It's always a bit crowded. but the place doesn't get me excited, like some other Austin mainstays that have a more unique menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] New ownership and a helpful/fast staff makes this place a vast improvement over it's previous incarnation. They care about the quality of tires the sell and are one of the few shops open on Sunday. Tell 'em I sent you.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was great. tried the calamari, pizza and caramel apple crostata. all highly recommended. the ambience is very nice. However, what really stands out is the friendly and helpful the service. I would go back just for that.  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried their ramen with salt based broth. it was very good but I wish the price was lower and the broth would have been perfect if it was just a little bit less salty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cash only hole-in-the-wall, but their Tacos Al Pastor can't be beat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere and good eats. I highly recommend the French dip and the creme brûlée.  [END]
[BEGIN] Generally good experience with the service group. They dealt with making sure we had an appropriate loaner for the few days our Rover was in the shop. I have seen improvement since my initial review - up to 4 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tolles Ambiente und coole location. Sowohl aussen als auch innen mit schönen Sitzmöglichkeiten. Die Speisekarte läßt nicht viel Aufschluss was man wirklich bekommt, ein wenig Phantasie braucht man schon. Die Cocktails gut gemixt und mit 8-13 CAD (ohne Tax) absolut im Rahmen. Service bemüht und sehr nett.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went during happy hour. Had a salad, calamari, pasta with Bolognese sauce, brussels sprouts, bread, Crabcakes,, and a meatball.. Oh for $30. Very tasty and will return!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was awesome, only thing is , I wish it was served much hotter , some food was cold, other than that staff was wonderful and my food taste like heaven especially my jerk chicken , it was awesome  [END]
[BEGIN] Had some garlicky parmesan wings....yum and some fall of the bone ribs (honey bbq). They have plenty of varieties you can order - buffalo, bbq, teriyaki, etc. Prices are pretty reasonable. Used a groupon, but will be back w/ or w/out groupon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely a fan of this place. Came here to get our breakfast fix, and we were not disappointed. Food is great, and you can bet it is fresh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel. Pretty decent rooms and great pool area. Room service was quick but the spaghetti I ordered was not the best.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to start learning salsa. The cover is the same regardless of when you arrive ($12) so get here early (8.30pm) and take advantage of the lessons. Also, the later it gets the more the mix of people tends towards experienced dancers, which can make it intimidating for beginners.  [END]
[BEGIN] So Fish Daddy's has has a reno! The service is fantastic, the decor is great and my maragarita.. right.on.time. we ordered a sirloin , fish and chips, Daddy's Painkiller and a Daddy O Margarita that was lip smackin' good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Sports bar/restaurant with cool outside space. It is even heated in some areas but unfortunately was too cold out to enjoy. Relaxed vibe yet busy. Only four stars because not much on menu but food was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love browsing at the cool early to mid century advertising posters. Lots of cool Swiss, German, and Italian posters. Check out their website to see the collection online. They are expensive, but if you're looking for the real thing - then come here.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the few...very few...pizzerias in ATL area that you can count on the center of the pizza actually being cooked...instead of a raw, soupy mess. Fresh made, inventive ingredients and combos. Stellar Brussels Sprouts that are extra crispy. Fast, friendly, attentive service. Recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is restaurant cum fast food cum sports bar. Undoubtedly one of the best burgers I ever had...nice place quench your quick hunger.  [END]
[BEGIN] We came here for lunch. It wasn't too busy, the service and the food were excellent. If you like hot pot I recommend this restaurant. The food was fresh and the broth was excellent - fresh and flavorful. I will be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Entered very hungry, and left full & satisfied! Great Cuban and the kids loved their Ham & Cheese press. Worth another visit!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Bob's has delicious subs and pastas. I just wish they had delivery!  [END]
[BEGIN] So I really like this bar. During my visit on a weekday happy hour, the music was chill. Which was exactly what I needed after a hard days work. The atmosphere is relaxed, adult, and authentic.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think this place is ok. Their food is not very presentable but tastes good. I don't find anything too special here. There is nothing bad really just nothing going too good either. Just ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] This iconic view of portland is a must see and visit. Its what makes portland unique. It's also a great place to walk around and see the portland skyline or what is of it. It's not anything monumental but it's quite a unique bridge.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, not too pricey. Ambient was a little dark but helps if it's one of those sunny Florida days outside. You Gotta try the dumplings. Nice assortment of beers. Great service and attention from the hostess to the server.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Giacomo's alternative when you're not down for the whole line thing. Chicken parmesan was good. Not the best I've had in the North End. Same with the bruschetta app. Very good, not great. A very 4 star experience. Not 5 stars, but still much better than average.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place. Old school diner with great greasy, fattening, carb-laden breakfasts. Very friendly staff, great location in Multnomah Village that feels lost in time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great assistance and very knowledgeable, prices are really reasonable  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is very good. I prefer the steak tips myself but alot of good deals Staff is always great. My favorite server si Angie. Very attentive very friendly, very pretty and a very cool Irish accent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service. Good drinks. Why the bump to four stars? The men's restroom downstairs! This was one of the nicest I've seen. Spacious, clean and a couch and a fireplace! Good job!  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good service and good Indian food..I would highly recommend the roganjosh. A good blend of flavors with the right amount of spices. I was also surprised with the great quality of naan bread which was perfectly cooked.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cozy cafe on Newbury with tasty Vietnamese / Thai eats. Convenient location, reasonable prices, large portions. Decent pho, huge menu including boba drinks. Really friendly staff and fast service ftw. Great neighborhood option for those in Back Bay or shopping on Newbury.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food needs a bit of work on the service, particularly bar service. Loved the happy spoon, black cod and miso, and several other dishes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Visited Skyview based on a Groupon deal. I enjoyed the view of the city. It was something neat to do. It's a one time type of thing though. Good activity to bring friend's or family from out of town.  [END]
[BEGIN] If any canadians out there are in need of a poutine fix, this is your spot! Very cool and casual spot. Fries were yummy.  [END]
[BEGIN] A quick run for a Coffee frap while my clothes is drying at Washatopia. Always pleasant and quick. This place is great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I always get excellent and friendly service here. This morning is no different. The baristas are always so sweet and on the ball There aren't many seats here so this Starbucks is more of a take your coffee to go place.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff is always nice and the happy hour is very reasonable. The black bean and maki salad is so tasty!  [END]
[BEGIN] Reliable and efficient, this auto shop has a good reputation locally and they live up to it. Their service is perfectly fine and they are able to provide some good customer care. Doing business with Cooper's was a decent experience and I'm happy to recommend them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Right in Dedham Square is the Dedham House of Pizza. The staff is friendly! Also the are efficient and professional. The pizza is very good and they have lots of subs and dinners. Additionally they have specials of the day I like how the place is very clean and welcoming.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was very good and the atmosphere was nice and calming. The manager or owner lady came by a couple of times and thanked us for.coming. The only negative things were how awkward and nervous the waitress was, and there was too much pepper in the fried rice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small place with great food. It was late in the evening but the service was good and the food excellent. The salsa bar had some good stuff on it. I would go back again if I'm in town.  [END]
[BEGIN] #Yelp100 New to BJs Club, always been a Sam's club dude, but this place is nicely laid out, good selections of most items, I'm a fan of Bjs for sure  [END]
[BEGIN] Although they don't always carry donuts with ingredients that call my name, it's still just amazing what they can do. I only wish they had more choices for coffee.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sausage and maple waffle and killer espresso. 'Nuff said.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn't look like much on the outside but definitely knocks it out of the park in terms of bang for your buck. The tortilla soup is tasty, the stuffed avocado is delicious and who doesn't love bottomless tortilla chips..? Stop in! It'll make you look like a real foodie.  [END]
[BEGIN] I haven't had dumplings in years and I'm eating primarily on the gluten free ones here. They were super good!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great house beats. Tiny bar in the back. Comfortable seating, very unique. You're basically lounging on raised carpets. Only good for smaller groups (under 6).  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was great and the wait time wasn't too bad. I ordered the half rack rib meal with fries and Brunswick stew. The food tasted good, but I had to cut my own ribs.  [END]
[BEGIN] We needed breakfast quick as we were in a hurry to leave town and found ourselves lingering and savoring a wonderful breakfast! Customer service excellent great experience  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool space. Not your typical spa music playing in the background. She was knowledgeable about naturopathic remedies. She was able to spot my trouble area without me pointing them out. She offered recommendations for methods to heal problem areas.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food here is very good and the staff is helpful. If you like your pizza crust crunchy ask to have the crust cooked longer or else it will be soft.  [END]
[BEGIN] The frik is really good! I loved the cheddar one. You have to get the poutines and customize them however you like. All of the Saus that I have ever tried are delicious! Get them all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had their vegetarian combo, amazingly tasty. Really good for vegetarian people. the food is flavorful just like indian food.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is one of my favorites. Today the floors and tables felt a bit sticky. This place needs a thorough cleaning. The staff and food we're excellent and consistent. Bottomless fries always guaranty you're full.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good fresh sushi. Staff was nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved this accidental find. Freshly prepared with quality ingredients. The grilled flank steak is listed as an appetizer but served as a full lunch for me. Would definitely return  [END]
[BEGIN] Best coconut milk soup I've had. Hot, zesty, sweet and gingery. I ate the whole bowl without even noticing. I think I'll be stopping off the bus to pick up their soup on a regular basis. Good service and open, quiet atmosphere. Reasonable prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast and friendly service. Delicious comfort food. Always consistent. Mmmm maple bacon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love South of the Border foods. Gave Casa del Pollo a try since they are close to Marriott's Courtyard. Homestyle Costa Rican food was delicious. The chicken tacos were a hit. The burrito's large. Give them a try. Yummy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought 4 small dessert cakes /slices , some sandwiches and some madeleines for a bday picnic. Every cake was a hit! Especially the lemon. The Madeline was a bit dry but the sandwiches were great. Would definitely return for the cakes and sandwiches. Worth the calories and the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks "One Love Jerk Grill"-Mobile Kitchen! Thanks for serving our area at the "Resurgens Plaza" off East Paces Ferry Road near Lenox Mall. I ordered the Veggie Plate which includes Rice and beans, Veggies and Plantains. It was delicious! Mary M.  [END]
[BEGIN] After eating at the anderson lane location several times times, I retract my previous 3 star rating and remarks. The shroom burger is heavenly and their queso is quite tasty as well! Plus, gotta love a place that serves their beer in Big O's! shakes are pretty dang good too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like - def. better then the old Shabusen. better service, better food choices. love their bbq beef and shortrib. add $1.99 for all u can drink soda. Dislike - bbq chicken taste bitter somehow... hamachi sushi was not fresh.  [END]
[BEGIN] In the Shingle Creek Resort. I ordered the three tacos and they where rather good! Being from New Mexico, they stacked up minus the green chile. The large margarita was huge and I would suggest something more gourmet rather than the plain house Rita.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. Reasonable price. A bit crowded and no parking. Love the selection of salads and stews!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent food. Nachos, taco salad, enchiladas suizas, tacos, and just about everything else I've tried have been awesome. Decent bottled beer selection. Interior is nice, but we usually do take-out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food for a great price. The vegetables are always cooked to perfection and the service is always nice. Recommend if you are on a budget and want some good veggies.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had an excellent dinner of Shrimp and Scallops finished things off with an excellent creme brûlée. The shrimp and scallops were to die for - perfectly seared. The scallops were buttery, melt in your mouth goodness. Yummy deluxe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bring an appetite, Leave with a box and a smile!!!! Chicken and waffles. Yummy. Huevos Rancheros tasty. Busy but friendly service. Happy place. Highly recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] I saw this vegetarian food truck at SoWa and decided to give it a go. The vegetarian sausage in the fire wrap was surprisingly flavorful and the seasoned fries were crispy, garlicy, and salty. I consider myself an avid meat eater but I'll definitely be coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I second the review that mentioned authenticity. I wish I had somewhere this cozy in Lair Hill. Crossing the street can be a bit tricky as mentioned but the latte, the ambiance, and the service was refreshing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food seemed to be pretty good, homemade which is nice. Inside is a little old fashioned.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just moved to Columbus from SoCal, & I enjoyed seeing the animals hang out with us. I would of have given 5 stars , but our waitress was really slow  [END]
[BEGIN] Although we had to wait 40min to get a table it was all worth it. The oysters where a great appy. The buttermilk chicken and the kale salad a nice addition and the vanilla pie finished a great dinner. Cool place, go and eat!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped in based on Yelp reviews & the Cubano & home made chips were as good as others said!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for hearty breakfast. Huge pancakes and everything is big. If you are counting carbs or calories stay away. Closes at 1 but the website says 2 so that should be clarified. We've watched too many people get turned around. But definitely great place for breakfast in Metrowest  [END]
[BEGIN] First time customer. One of the BEST roast beef sandwiches I've had! The roast beef melts in your mouth.  [END]
[BEGIN] Brisket is great, a little pricey, but really good. Try a brisket quesadilla! Owner is really nice and friendly. Great place to stop for something quick.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yum! Tasty food. Fresh ingredients and a really nice staff. I will definitely return for some more bulgolgi beef (sorry if I butchered the spelling!)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for dim sum anytime! Try the house noodles hong kong style. They are the best!  [END]
[BEGIN] YUM. Everything I ate here was delicious, and the service was great, even when they were pretty busy. Good Margaritas, and of course great tacos. Their shrimp taco was my favorite. Will definitely be going back soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good but pricy when compared to the other bangladeshi place on mass ave (Darul kebab).  [END]
[BEGIN] Good live music on the weekend, fit for older couples or tourists... but a nice evening once and a while for locals  [END]
[BEGIN] What's not to love? I'm vegan and I have no problem whatsoever finding delicious foods to eat. I also love the atmosphere -- very romantic, in my opinion (but I tend to bring girlfriends here most of the time).  [END]
[BEGIN] Favorite aspect of this restaurant is that you can sit outside in the heart of Fanueil Hall. They are connected/affiliated/the same place as Ned Divines. The salads are good and oversized.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere and the food was really good. Small portions though. The whole tabled ended up ordering more food. Would come back though. The live band is fantastic touch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place. Love how it's basically a highly controlled and limited buffet that the owners have spun into some kind maternal we-cook-it-you-eat-it-no-ordering-necessary dining experience. Love the samosas and the tea. Love the proprietors well-meaning but often unfunny and occasionally uncomfortable jesting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little spot to grab lunch near the Arena District. Sesame chicken was excellent and the hot and sour soup was very tasty. Potstickers were slightly over cooked, but the pork filing had good flavor. Overall, a great find to satisfy your crave for Asian cuisine!  [END]
[BEGIN] Can't really say anything negative about a place that serves burgers with donuts as buns. Can't wait to take advantage of trivia night on Monday's. The donuts melt in your mouth you forget you are eating cake. Great for a dinner out or random desert craving.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great wine selection! The staff is knowledgeable and friendly when looking for a recommendation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great ambience during the Canada vs USA Olympics Hockey Semi-Final game! Their portions are very large too and very filling. I had the Chicken, Walnut, blue cheese salad and that was very tasty. I would def recommend this place as a great get together with friends for a sports event  [END]
[BEGIN] Very friendly staff, easy check in, affordable, and clean. The location is convenient. Yes, the decor is dated. The breakfast was standard. My family and I will return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a long wait for a table. But can't be avoided on a weekend and the staff were terrific and made it up to us in sides! Burgers were tasty, sides were good, Jens chicken sandwich was awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] We took the family to Boston for Easter Sunday. This was a great hotel for us and the kids.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place! The Warm Goat Cheese salad is a must! Although it is a bit pricey, the portions are a very good size. On Wednesdays it's $3 beer nights!  [END]
[BEGIN] Two thumbs up. I honestly think its the best Thai restaurant in Austin. If there is one that beats this place, let me know.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is quick as their name suggests express. We gave order and the food was out in sec. Sushi and entree were good. Friendly people and quick service.  [END]
[BEGIN] We grabbed a quick breakfast upon our arrival from Logan... Real quick service. Can't front. For a quick breakfast, It's a great option + open 24 hours.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything was going good until a roach crawled on me :( but overall nice cool place  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a breakfast skillet- so good. Everything on the breakfast menu sounded great! The service was wonderful and the prices reasonable! I'd recommend coming here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped while we were passing through Salem. We had the forest mushroom and the soppressata. The pizzas were delicious. I recommend sitting at the bar if seats are available.  [END]
[BEGIN] Second time coming here while in Austin, the wait is always extremely long but both times it's been worth it if you have the time. I had the migas the first time and second time the crab cake Benedict. Super yummy. I'd recommend a Bloody Mary aswell  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for 3 days last week. I really liked this hotel. Very large rooms with microwave, and fridge. HUGE bathroom, of of the largest I've ever seen. Staff is super friendly. Really nice gym and pool. I would love to stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Try the buta (pork) kimchee rice burger Back for more Okinawan Taco rice Visa, MC, debit cards accepted. Still rated high on my list for things quaint, cafe's al la Japonais! written by iphone  [END]
[BEGIN] I just moved to Dunwoody and this place was very lucky indeed. It is so delicious and generous portions make me a big fan. I love the sweet and sour chicken and can't get enough Kung powwww!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Really, really tasty hot chocolate that was oh so creamy. On a fairly cold day, this was a good stop along the way on my way through Nob Hill. Short and sweet. Enjoy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice upbeat place. A welcomed change in the area. The crepes are tasty and freshly made in front of you. It may seem pricey, but the crepes are extra large and full of goodies! Recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great addition to the area. Excellent flavors and huge portions. Thoroughly enjoy the Combo platter. And you need to get extra hot sauce. Good stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] The heating has been fixed AND there's a featured comedy night. Little Vegas in little Vancouver indeed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Favorite non-IMAX theater  [END]
[BEGIN] Sweet filling delicious breakfast place. The taters were quite good and my omelete/scramble whatever it was had lots of goodies on it. Hot, strong coffee accompanied and all for a reasonable price. I haven't tried the scotch eggs yet, but everyone is raving about them. Word.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tastes good, they have a good bogo deal but otherwise is kind of pricey. Definitely worth it for the deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great steak. Really enjoyed the meal and the evening. Very top cut steak and service comparable with high-end steakhouses. Quaint location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. Service needs some attention. Lots of bartenders, but not very attentive. Nice atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food here is just OK, and the service is hit or miss to say the least. (Sometimes its downright terrible), but that misses the point of coming here. Frozen ritas are fierce and twice as strong as most places.  [END]
[BEGIN] Always love the tacos here but they really need to fix the bee problem outside so we can enjoy the Austin weather!  [END]
[BEGIN] Gastown Classics Brunch..... Pretty busy for weekend morning, waited for 20 minutes. Standard brunch. Excellent environment and friendly employees. (´`)  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like subway you will love firehouse. Firehouse is pretty much a higher quality subway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is pretty good. Certain things need a little help. Drinks are right on. Sausa margarita all day. The carnitas is good but can be a little dry. The chips and salsa are a great start. All in all, come here for a pretty good Mexican fix.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good fish and chips. The tartar is excellent. Friendly service. Great place to see the Premiership with a pint of lager.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, nice decor, decent prices. I had oysters, chicken wings and rolls which were all great. Really good happy hour specials 4-6. Fun  [END]
[BEGIN] Downtown Crossing has lots of great places to shop. My go to spots were always Macys, DSW, H&M. There are lots of historic spots in this area too like the Old South Meeting House. You can jump on the Freedom Trail from here and follow it around the city.  [END]
[BEGIN] BEST chocolate chip cookies I've had (and I've had a lot). Love the staff. Service can be slow but they're making everything fresh and in-house - good things take time!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for food and drink. Pool tables. The staff is always friendly. Good place to grab a beer and watch a game. They also have trivia and live Irish music. Good sized bar!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent service, good food. Its a big place and it feels a little outdated. I was seates right away, my waiter was awesome and the staff in general was extremely friendly. They are willing to modify any order it sounds like.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place seems to be renowned for their appetizers which you can order right at the bar, and that seems well-founded. Portions are big, the variety is great, drinks are poured generously, and you leave on the tipsy and full side. A great place for a tipple after work.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had to stay in Orlando and essentially kill a week. Very quiet hotel. Shuttle to parks. Area is not very enchanting Food was so-so and guests from overseas, at times unbearable. Staff was perfect..  [END]
[BEGIN] Best value priced meal: half salad plus flatbread. If you eat a lot then take something else like a cup of soup. I like their butternut squash. If you're looking for coffee this is not the place.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far I am really enjoying the place and the neighborhood. The location is great and it is pretty quiet for a city apartment. Nice to have Kroger nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice ambience. Decent crowd... And a good collection of beer on tap and bottles. Do try the fish and chips!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Gyro- that about sums it up. This place is always packed during lunch hours and often runs out of supplies near closing. Either way, if you can slide through within the time frame, get down on a spectacular Gyro that definitely lives up to the hype.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great coffee and atmosphere  [END]
[BEGIN] Wanted something close to my hotel. Their pasta dishes sounded good, so I figure I would give them a try. I thought the service was excellent. Huge portions too.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great place for a meal that will leave you feeling satisfied. Vietnamese and Thai food are both very flavorful and that's definitely what you get here. Good prices and no wait on a holiday evening. Easy to miss from the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was staying at the Avalon, awesome hotel, Outstanding customer service! I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Salmon. The sauce was too die for. The English muffin was a little too tough for my butter knife. I would definitely have breakfast here again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great prices and really good food. The wait can be long for brunch time on weekends but so delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great menu... Lots of choices! Too bad they took some favorites off the menu. Still...good staff, tons of different beers and 4 (soon to be 5) locations.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was packed but we somehow scored a table and our food came out quickly. The people here hustle, fantastic service.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food (we got soup and sandwiches) was good, but I have had better vegan nut-based cheeses before. Service was very friendly and the environment was nice as well. I'd love to come back when in the area again and try some of their other options.  [END]
[BEGIN] 4 stars for the freshest sashimi, average sushi and awesome oysters with great service and good value for money. I ordered a sushi boat with oysters. Loved every bite.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very nice modern hotel. I stayed there for business and it was great. The decor is modern and tasteful. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The restaurants and bars are good too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good liquor store...great wine and beer selection, Knowledgeable staff. They have great on-line specials. I recommend signing up to get their specials. What more can I say?  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like german sausages and cream puffs, this is your place! They also have other good options like the reuben, deserts and oh yes, large draft biers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool place, cozy feel to it. Good service and great food. Perfect for brunch!  [END]
[BEGIN] The atmosphere and decor is mostly what makes this place shine. Their skillets are pretty darn good too but different every time and u are almost always guaranteed a line up. The coffee and service is fabulous.  [END]
[BEGIN] We are grateful that the staff could accommodate our softball team. The pizza was really good also. Really fresh dough!  [END]
[BEGIN] Best lobster tail I've ever had. When they overcooked the steak, they worked tirelessly to fix it and were extremely hands-on in an effort to make me happy. Made me like the experience even more.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the noodle, broth, lard & spicy options. Broth though was a little too salty and not as flavorful as other places. Wish they had corn as an add on or garlic. Bowls were small. Gyoza was basic but good. 3.5 stars. Nice staff. Clean room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just like others have said, its definintely in a random place. Don't let that discourage you, the food and service are excellent. We love it.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here since I was visiting. Tried the Philly Cheesesteak. It was awesome. Very close to the real deal from Philly. I would go again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the Half Fast! Great subs, huge selection, and decent value for price. The atmosphere inside is a bit dark, but hey, I'm sure that works well for those days when you just need a sandwich and a beer (or two).  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food! Had the Steele slider and Nashville chicken sandwiches. Great options for beer as well!  [END]
[BEGIN] it is a nice place for a cheap buffet， and they have various kinds of food and fruits. Could be a little bit noisy but who cares ：）  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, creative cuisine!! Portions are small, but good flavor. Atmosphere is great. Downsides were: expensive, food comes out not very hot, and coconut mousse cake needed more flavor.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is amazing!!! Sherri the bartender was so friendly and shook our hands at introduction. She made us feel important and like she cared! The atmosphere is fun and the beers are good! We will be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] The menu is full of great home style fair like chicken and waffles or huevos rancheros! K  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place. Very close to where I live, coffee drinks are good, muffins taste great especially the pumpkin. Customer Service is top notch, the girls working there are friendly and on top of it.  [END]
[BEGIN] this place pretty much ruled. i love the charmingly scattered design and cozy, if a little cramped, feel. our server was great, always refilling our coffee, the biscuit was mindblowing, and mindblowingly huge, and the shrimp and grits were perfect. the best meal of my trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good experience both times I've visited. First time got the brunch burger and I'm totally a fan and then the PB&J burger which was surprisingly good. I would definitely go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Caesar Burrito (romaine lettuce, herb croutons, feta cheese, caesar dressing) is the BEST I've ever had. I had it about two years ago and still on the hunt for a decent replacement in New York City.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good food at an average price. Excellent service with very friendly employees!!! Very quick to serve food. Only gripe is I got the chicken that had a few chewy pieces ( fat not trimmed off). Crab Rangoon was fresh and excellent!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has amazing food. I have only ordered delivery, but the food is just so great. Definitely one of the best pizza places in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really great food at good pricing. Pretty quick too. The service is a little laissez faire, but whatever...  [END]
[BEGIN] I was a walk-in for a regular mani-pedi and was trying them because they're super close to my new home. Friendly, clean place, and can't beat the prices! Anna did my nails and did a great job. I'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went here with my persian friend so I had a little advantage. We went and had the lunch buffet and I really enjoyed it! They seriously have the best hummus ever! Stuffed grape leaves were good too! Wud def. Come back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place to get some drinks listen to music and enjoy hookah. The prices are decent, not too expensive and the service there was great. From the hostess to the waitress they made sure you were well taken care of. Definetly will visit again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is one of our go to places for breakfast in Portland. The omelettes are terrific. The wait staff are great as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great taste little messy overloaded yet delicious Be great to provide buffalo sauce on the side  [END]
[BEGIN] Good creative food in a fun atmosphere. Service is very friendly and attentive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. The calamari was def. one of the best. The Chargrilled Swordfish with a side of broccoli and rice pilaf was also good. I would stay away from the steak though, it was bland. But overall, tasty seafood and wonderful service!  [END]
[BEGIN] Every once in a while I pick a random spot with my buddies just to break with routine hangouts. This was one of those random adventures. It paid off handsomely. This is a truly cool bar. Nice ambience. Reasonable drink prices. Friendly bar tenders.  [END]
[BEGIN] Potato wrapped snapper had great texture and flavor Truffle Mac and cheese couldn't go wrong Expensive but delicious  [END]
[BEGIN] A bit on the pricy side for what I usually spend. But everything was great. Nice atmosphere, good service and the food was delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was here over the weekend.....margaritas are top notch....the food was above average...would definitely go back, service was good, waiter was attentive and informative.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place!! No matter what lady I get she always does a perfect job. The service has always been quick and neat, and a mani/pedi is only $30.  [END]
[BEGIN] A different menu than we are use to but delicious and beautifully presented. Loved the oatmeal raisin cookie as an appetizer other than bread.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place. Consistently great Thai food served by nice people. What more can you ask for ? :)  [END]
[BEGIN] This business is relocating to a larger space next month. Family run. Good food. Reasonable prices. Smoked chicken is delicious. The biggest knock is the tiny space - but that will be fixed upon relocation. Check them out after they move!  [END]
[BEGIN] Super happy hour food. Steak tacos are huge, and delicious. I love the chipotle salt they rim their margaritas with. Late night happy hour every night is awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here for first time Friday night. Ladies were really friendly. Food was good and got a fair amount for what we paid. will return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tasty food, very helpful recommendations and friendly service. Good portion sizes, reasonable prices, clean establishment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pad Thai, quick delivery. The vegetable pad Thai has a lot in it- green beans, baby corn, broccoli, carrots and zucchini. The Bangkok bags are great too- Thai take on crab Rangoon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely love this place and the gluten free waffles. I had the dutch Apple waffle with cinnamon and agave nectar and it was so delicious Everyone who works here is super friendly. Their drinks are also just as fabulous. The only downside to this place is the lack of seating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was visiting from Los Angeles my experience was great! Good food, great customer service and the Key lime pie was to die for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had Beef noodle soup and deep fried pork rice. Both were good. The parking area in the plaza can get hectic. Go early at dinner time.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best vegetable phos we've tasted hands down. The broth is a beautiful symphony of finely orchestrated spices and pairs well with the hand pulled chewy noodles. I would stir clear of the dan dan noodles ().  [END]
[BEGIN] Waitress Gillian was great! Awesome potato heads, awesome happy hour prices! Very cute place!  [END]
[BEGIN] Glad to have a banh mi shop close to home. So far I've had the lemongrass chicken which was good, the meatball (not great) and BBQ Pork which was quite good. Nice baguette, good veggies. Good green tea bubble tea, although a little on the watery side (consistency not flavor).  [END]
[BEGIN] Best buffet is south Austin. Good selection of Chinese as well as Korean food. Many more light dishes than traditional Chinese buffets.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chips, guac, salsa and queso were meh. Southern tacos were good. Our server, Naia was amazing and all the staff was wonderful. We even got a free dessert! I probably won't be back, but I had a fun night with the love of my life.  [END]
[BEGIN] We enjoyed our stay here. Room came with a sink, small fridge and microwave. Bed was very soft to the point you nearly sunk into it. We suggested that room was probably due for a new matress. Otherwise clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly. I'd recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I spent a great afternoon at B&G's and tried a wide number of items on the menu. My favorite oysters were the Bristol Bay but I also tried the Island Creek and Conway Royale.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am a big fan of this place. I've been going to Cappy's for almost 10 years now. There menu is cheap, they are open late, the have great food and great workers. You definitely have to try their Chicken Cutlet with the works. One of my favorites!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hi guys, Here at BKP writing from the lobby and all I can say is these guys understand portion size. I ordered 2 slices of pepperoni & mushroom pizza and got enough to feed 500. Reasonable prices and carry Aquafina bottled water.  [END]
[BEGIN] The two locations serve only four different sandwiches. Menus change daily. It's basic and casual, turning out high quality meat sandwiches.The porchetta sandwich is a must. Opening a store in Seattle soon, which makes me happy. The meat hook toilet paper holders in the bathroom is a nice touch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really cozy place and the person working was so nice. Not sure if he was the owner or not but either way he was nice!  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm a big fan of the mussels appetizer, & the Scallop Risotto. Others at my table loved the beet salad & meatloaf. Such a great neighborhood restaurant!  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a great experience. They didn't have the car I ordered but for a minimum price I was upgraded to a bigger car. It worked out great. We will surely use Ace rental in the future.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is fantastic. Great outdoor seating, excellent drinks and what I would say is the best Pain Killer in town! The food is yummy... Try the dirty fries... How can something sooo bad be sooo good!  [END]
[BEGIN] I was craving dumpling and I thought the were pretty scrumptious the dough was pretty thin and they didn't stick together too much, but I had the pork leek dumplings and I was super satisfied!  [END]
[BEGIN] yummy mezcal drink was made to my specs, since they didn't have it on the menu. was very tasty - nice bartender =)  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing experience!! Only complaint is it wasn't long enough ... took family from out of town and they couldn't stop talking about how great it was :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Beer was ok. Only tried the couch and Lou a cult both were decent. The steak nacho were really good though small. Good enough for an appetizer though for 2  [END]
[BEGIN] Too much to choose from!! Breakfast is really good here!! Stairs have to go through the back if disable!! Then u encounter stairs in this place!! But food yes if u just want to get stuffed!!  [END]
[BEGIN] A fun, donation-based tour ($2 suggested) that takes about an hour. Informative on beer processing and tasting. You get to try 3 generous samples. We had the lager, Oktoberfest, and double black (only available in the brewery).  [END]
[BEGIN] Homemade pasta, great arrabiatta sauce. The tiramisu was fantastic. Nice ambiance, and the staff was wonderful. Would go back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome food! Not very authentic, but still extremely delicious. Go for the lamb tibs and make sure to use injera as your utensil.  [END]
[BEGIN] Onion rings are not greasy, crisp, but not sure if they are homemade. Either way they were tasty. The polish looks great! Tomato, onion, peppers, cucumber, relish, on poppy seed roll. Pickle on side. It tasted even better than it looked! The sausage isn't overcooked, not too shabby.  [END]
[BEGIN] The place is very popular and has a great deal of traffic. I didn't have any problems since there's plenty of people helping out, including directing traffic. Fire pit was raging and had a merry gathering. Plenty of trees. Lovely place.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have good food and nice service. They provide unique food. However the amount of food is not awesome. You might end up eating 2 dishes for each person. Parking is a little bit of problem as only street parking is available. So try avoid Saturday night.  [END]
[BEGIN] The raw octopus is much better than I thought, and the salmon belly is a great meal for people to eat at night and not gain weight  [END]
[BEGIN] Free wireless, tasty drinks and desserts, cute barista w/Mark Ryden tat, patrons who bend over directly in front of you to inspect the pastry case thus giving you an onslaught of rear views. What's not to like?  [END]
[BEGIN] Very tasty crust. Thin, chewy, warm and perfect. Looking forward to going back for another round.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went to Sushi Factory on Christmas for their sushi buffet. The restaurant is clean and sitting is comfortable. The sushi was good and the price was right for $22 per person. I think it's worth a try.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's free. It's relatively clean. It appeared that the kids that were there were basically trying to find a place to smoke... and they need to work on their 'sneakiness' skills. Dog friendly. Volleyball court, basketball court, field, grills... all in all a decent park.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great shop with wide selection of higher end brands. Ann Marie did a fantastic job for both my makeup trial and wedding day. I didn't feel obligated to buy everything she used, but certainly splurged on the lip liner and lip color. Prices are typical for the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Update - I was informed after this post that there were some major staffing changes after my first visit, so it was probably an anomaly. Looking forward to my next visit to see if third time's the charm!  [END]
[BEGIN] Frito Pie with beans / brisket was great - big chunks of tender beef. Enjoyed the variety of BBQ sauces and fixings they offer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hot pot. This place is bigger than it used to be and the menu offering changed and it is not quite as good and more of set menu. At least you don't have to wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing service. She really took care of how I wanted to shape my eyebrows and it was over by the time i could register the pain! Lol I would definitely recommend this place for a painless eyebrow threading experience !  [END]

[BEGIN] The happy hour is great, they also have appetizers included. Even when the restaurant is really busy, the costumer service is outstanding. I would definitely recommend this place. ( just for the happy hour)  [END]
[BEGIN] Weekend brunch is awesome, best in Boston. $25 per person is high but kids are free and the seating is relaxing and quite. Nice to enjoy an extra coffee with a second helping of eggs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Completely satisfied with the service. Called and got pricing estimate over the phone and service within the days. I was informed via text each step of the way, and billing was painless. I will be a return customer.  [END]
[BEGIN] An early Tuesday dinner was a joy. Food and service were standout. The view can't be beat. This is worth the drive and will stay on our list of restaurants to revisit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quite a decent place to stay. Staff was friendly and breakfast was not bad. I read about the negative reviews on cleanliness, but my room was quite alright. The only concern is that it's a huge place with confusing hallways, also the parking places need maintenance.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has been my go-to for years. Affordable, filling, decent quality, best bang for your buck. Service is subpar but you get what you pay for. Best quality/price/portion ratio when it comes to sushi in Vancouver. You can easily get super full off $15.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very unique place to eat. You can bring your dog, they have a amazing patio to sit on. Really nice cocktails and a decent amount of ever changing specials including soups. Service has been excellent every time I have been here. Bacon infused bloody marries are a must!  [END]
[BEGIN] great food very affordable been going for years Monday night special is steak night (love the pepper steak ) Tuesday night special is Burger night ( love the bacon cheese burger yummiest ) Wednesday night special is Slovakia night Thursday night special is Salmon Lee :-)  [END]
[BEGIN] We've rented a car from this location twice now. Both times they've picked us up, the employees have been friendly and professional, and we've gotten in and out quickly. We will definitely continue using this branch.  [END]
[BEGIN] I My wife and I checked this place out over the weekend. Nice and roomy inside and pretty new. I had the Italian sub and she had Classic Reuben and they both were very good as were the fry's. Cold beer and good service. we will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bibb salad is considered one of the best things I've ever eaten. Pizza is not far off. Sangria was delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service. Clear communication and follow through. Hallelujah. My little car is running great. I just moved my business from another Toyota dealer/service provider (12 years) to Broadway - it's closer and much better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent place to eat dinner. When I come to Columbus, I have to have bd's! The food is create your own bowl with meat, veggies, and spices. It's usually busy but little wait time. The only draw back of this place... It's noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] We ordered 1) Shanghinese noodle 2) Pork dumplings 3) Vegetarian dumplings 4) Mushroom and bamboo 5) Tofu and vegetables Delicious and great value!  [END]
[BEGIN] Best frozen yogurt In town always has great flavors , great prices and amazing service , come out to Hilliard to check out Yo Lish  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a New England Deli. So ah everything a deli has to offer. Food is great. Roast Beef as good as or even better then kelly's.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is located on the board walk. Our fist evening had no reservation but got a seat at the bar. The service & food was awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Korean food is always a bit expensive so that was to be expected. The tofu and beef soup was delicious, especially with an egg in it. My friend is a vegetarian and ordered the bibimbap combo and was delighted. Definitely recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] Generic Chinese food; 4/5 for what it is supposed to be. Big portions, cheap prices, free delivery to the hotel. It delivered pretty fast too. If you want typical American Chinese food fast and cheap, this is you place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Typical Cuban place with some good Cuban dishes and good services  [END]
[BEGIN] Quite expensive, but get the lobster roll. Service was ok. Make reservation if you don't want the long wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its all good!!! Plenty to chose from and lots of goodies.. Worth a visit for sure.. The veal parm sub is killer  [END]
[BEGIN] Great selection, great customer service (for the most part.) I would have given 5 stars but I asked a question of an associate named "James" and I was given a dirty look and short answers, like I was troubling him. Everyone else was super friendly and considerate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fried pickles are magnificent! They are spears and enough for three people. Waiting on my chicken but I'm feeling pretty positive....  [END]
[BEGIN] I live down the street from this place and go to it regularly. It's my go to in Waltham for pizza. Chicken bacon ranch is my favorite. Everything I've tried has been good. Pickup is usually only 15 minutes  [END]
[BEGIN] The selection is varied and well thought out. From Belgians to Imperial Porters, the selection is always fantastic. The staff is helpful and friendly. Keg pickups are handled efficiently as well. I primarily pick up and take beers out, not drink at the pub they have next door.  [END]
[BEGIN] Met friends for dinner. PROs Really delicious noodles. yummy sushi watching the noodles being made good prices CONs pretty loud  [END]
[BEGIN] The bread is where it's at. I've only had breakfast here and it is good. Every time i go to Bexley i have breakfast here. That said i think their eggs tasted a little too powdery. Did i mention the bread was amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I this place! The New Make whiskey is my fave but do yourself a favor and order the flight and try them all. You won't be disappointed! The music on the patio outside provided the perfect setting to end a long hard week. I will definitely be returning soon!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good straightforward breakfast. Fantastic coffee. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Some outdoor seating. I had two eggs with potatoes an toast ($4.95). My wife had the fried egg sandwich ($3.25). Both of us were happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] My son said to make sure we ordered the bacon cheeseburger pizza and that's what we had. It was terrific! The deep dish crust was cooked to perfection! Had a "Nitwit" beer that complimented the pizza perfectly. BJs is a welcome addition to the Austin restaurant scene.  [END]
[BEGIN] Outstanding selection of meats and salad bar. While not cheap, but it is worth the special Times. Next time I will skip the salad and get my fill on meat.  [END]
[BEGIN] all the essentials. you can probably find more options and lower prices elsewhere. convenience is convenience. quick no hassle higher end convenience.  [END]
[BEGIN] The margaritas were good, the food was good, the music wasn't to loud. However, since it is a Holiday weekend the server was over worked! Highly recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm never quite sure how this place is still open. I have never been in when the restaurant was even 1/3 full. But the food is good, and it is always quiet in there. Try the buffalo burger!  [END]
[BEGIN] A wonderful experience in service and food. We had a great waitress Erika who was wonderful. First time here. Used our groupon coupon and had the fried calamari which was delicious. Had the lobster pie with crabmeat stuffing. Very good. My husband had the sea scallops. Will definitely go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a great place for Sunday brunch. No wait, outside seating was beautiful, the chicken and waffle Benedict was the tables favorite meal. I had the pesto and sundried tomato omelette which really hit the spot for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Caldo de res, (a hearty beef veg soup) and homemade tortillas. Then a Tejano trio set up. Lunch and live music FTW.  [END]
[BEGIN] Monday nights are $5 open gym nights from 9-11pm. GreatOpen floor with a spring floor any regular cheerleading floor. The gym is mostly open floor with little utilities. No bars, foam pit, not very many mats, and only one tumble track. Great gym and good crowd on Mondays.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place. Quiet and just as advertised. Got lucky that it was free co-work day, but even had I paid the $15 for a day-pass, I would have been very pleased. Staff was friendly and the location quite convenient in downtown Orlando. I'll be back for sure!  [END]
[BEGIN] Barcelos Surrey,B.C. Nando's should b shakin' in their boots... Awesome Peri-Peri sauce...simply the best version of this African /Portuguese style of fare. Such clean food too!GUILT FREE GOODNESS. You need to go... 'appy Noshin' Brianm Foodieatlarge.yelp.ca Fb Tumblr  [END]
[BEGIN] Good relaxing area, coffee isn't at the level of other places like Starbucks. Subway is just a regular subway it's a little small though. Parkin lot has a few potholes  [END]
[BEGIN] Great selection of frames, comparable pricing, and friendly helpful staff from the manager, Brian to his sales associates, Amy and Luis  [END]
[BEGIN] Tableside guacamole is amazing! Regular margaritas are alright but the patron margaritas are great!  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to get take out from here on some week nights. Really good chicken parm and fried cod. Huge & Hearty portions and very generous portions. Great burgers too.  [END]
[BEGIN] "This is the brand new Walmart in the new Goldenrod area, super clean, friendly and has everything you need and look for when you visit a Walmart, but with out the ghetto nes of many of the Walmart I've visited in the past. So definitely recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The atmosphere is great and I enjoy coming every Sunday with the group I swim for. Things that could be improved: it is a little pricy almost 7$ for a coffee and bagel sandwich, and the wait times for food get a little long if they are busy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was here with my partner for a Sunday lunch. We aren't vegan but decided to pop in due to great reviews on yelp. We had a delicious meal, great value for money, and enjoyed superb service with a smile. Will definitely come back if we're in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sleepy, quiet, cheap. The collection doesn't move so fast. But whatever -- I've totally found things. I mean, where else are you finding Mavis Gallant and Eric Hobsbawm for a couple bucks a piece? Plus it's a neighborhood shop. And the money goes to Bryn Mawr's scholarship fund.  [END]
[BEGIN] Shrimp and grits was really good. Not too heavy! The portions were generous. We also got the burger and it was tasty-not the best burger ever but decent. $3 shock top beer during happy hour was a plus. The staff were friendly and the chef checked in on us.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place, always a treat when I go, and always a great experience when I leave. Awesome food, open till 2am (which is awesome when being in the service industry), big portions. I highly recommend this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have now been here several times for both the Tapas and dinners and the place just keeps rocking our taste buds. Be there before 6 for the Tapas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great vibe for Saturday or Sunday brunch. If you love the young black (mid 20's 30's) hip hop and mimosas type vibe you'll love it. Their mimosas are mostly champagne, which is a plus! & their food is pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big dinner portions and reasonable prices. Love their rice and a huge fan of their pita bread!  [END]
[BEGIN] Discover this place by getting lost in the area. Now I come back intentionally. It's a great find, the food is amazing. Love it!!! Highly recommended to anyone that love food like I do  [END]
[BEGIN] BEST antique place ever to happen in central Florida! 2 levels of great finds! I enjoyed it and recommended friends to go there. The staff I will say are not too friendly, I think it's family owned?  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful reasonably priced breakfast. Superb crepes and Mediterranean signature dish Shakshuka. Staff was friendly. A great choice for my vacationing family.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the best breakfast taco I've ever had in my life but it definitely did the job. We had a big order and they got everything just right which was good! The prices are also very reasonable and there was plenty of parking!  [END]
[BEGIN] I mean, its Domino's. theyre in East Boston, I'm in the Throp, delivery is about 10 mins, what else is there? Consistent service and food, nuff said.  [END]
[BEGIN] He servers ask when they meet you how much time you have. Be careful with your newer because they apparently take as much of it as possible. Food was great (had the OFS Dirty South) and folks were friendly, it just took a lot longer than I like.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pure chocolate plus pure honey - makes for some smooth chocolates. They also offer a selection of 'hot chocolate' like drinks. I tried one called the 'inner child' - which was excellent. This place is a block down from 'flip happy' crepes'.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food and cool dining area. I was wondering why no wrap pics but they are pretty messy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Powder extension with gel, colour is good, like it Hope they can clean my dead skin and massage next time Not sure what exactly is included in the service This cost me 60 dollar after tax and tip not cheap!  [END]
[BEGIN] The place is small but the food was very good. The servings are a nice size. However, the service is slow. There's a large lot not too far from the place with free parking. I went there with my girlfriends but would go back with my family.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very tasty, the staff has always done a nice job. My only complaint is that it gets really loud.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only critique I have about this place is their overpriced desserts. Other than that, their coffee is delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service can be hit or miss, but Cioppino is very yummy. I get it every time I visit!  [END]
[BEGIN] Btw, while I very much enjoyed the mac and cheese we were served last time, there was a smoked cheddar mac and cheese with gold fish crackers on the top and rotini noodles that was my absolute most favorite mac and cheese in Portland. Please bring it back!!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a favorite of my kids. Love the remodeled look. Simple, chain resturant food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great local Mexican place. I always get the enchiladas verses. I can't stand the mariachi band which shows up some Friday nights but I haven't seen them in a while so maybe they no longer play there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just what the doctor ordered after long day! The staff is always courteous, and they pay attention to detail. I almost fell asleep during my manicure in the massage chair. Ultimate serenity!  [END]
[BEGIN] I always buy my jeans from jasmine sola!! great selection! Check out their website and print off the 10% off coupon and bring it into one of their stores- when your paying $200 for a pair of jeans-$20 off helps ease the pain!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] A beautiful garden With space for reflection And time for introspection Paths among flowers galore And waterfalls of different sizes For wonderful enjoyment by Human and dogs  [END]
[BEGIN] Just as cool as you've heard, believe the hype! Do yourself a favor and order the Debbie Harry!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stuffed mushrooms were perfect. I got the "Godfather" veal plate(veal 3 ways) that is not on the menu, it was good. The atmosphere was like you stepped back into 1973. It was cool and the staff were very friendly. The area of town in strip club central, just an fyi...  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like fresh , delicious Mexican food...you will love this place! I have had food inside the tiny dining area and have also ordered takeout and delivery. The portions are generous, great value!  [END]
[BEGIN] Curteous employees who went beyond their obligations to help out a non-local customers. Thank you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Marlow's is a very solid small chain. Their places are always nice and their menu has something for everyone. The staff at this location was very good. My only complaint is that they need to expand their tap beer offering.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lunch Buffet is amazing! Always a fan of the chicken dishes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great breakfast, wonderful fresh squeezed orange juice, friendly staff, inexpensive. Glad we happened on this cafe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great neighborhood pizza joint, a throw-back to the old days of pizza. Their non-pizza items were also very good. Not a fancy place and definitely not modern but very good. Earns its spot on the top 10 pizza list in the US every year.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing mexican food!! Great staff and great atmosphere!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the salads! They do a pretty good Caesar Wrap as well. Service is friendly and the Sandy Springs location is clean and well organized.  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably my fave in the 'Couve for this comfort food. I never expect much for service when going for Vietnamese food, but eagerly await the day. Anyhow, Pho Green Papaya = great pho.  [END]
[BEGIN] Value for the price. Not Morton's but better than Ruth's Chris. Service is decent. Not Bones or Chops but better than STK. Need a steak downtown dressed casual - it's the place to go.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good prices and large portions make this my go to sushi place as I'm a fairly big eater. Can't go wrong with a teriyaki and roll combo for $8.95. There is better sushi around but for value for money I havn't found a place that beats this.  [END]
[BEGIN] My favourite ice cream shop in Vancouver. Nice selection of flavours; some rotate, while others seem to be mainstays. A bit out of the way and expensive, but the quality makes it worth it. The aesthetic is hip minimalism.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good variety of noodle and pasta dishes with different sauces and protein options. The service was fast and friendly and the meals were delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious. The butter ramen is so yummy and the happy hour Menu makes everything affordable enough taste it all. Love this place  [END]
[BEGIN] What's not to like about shopping at IKEA? It's a large store with a large selection of home decor, with price ranges to fit every budget.  [END]
[BEGIN] 2nd time here, Van did such a Wonderful Job. I called today and asked for her. She was in and so far an Awesome legs and feet massage. The chairs also are wonderul 3 settings for automatic massage.  [END]
[BEGIN] hip vibe comfy seats strong espresso/ macchiatos I'm a fan  [END]
[BEGIN] Fresh tasting food, well made drinks and a huge selection of beers, Bodega is a great find with a comfortable atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love to drink and hang at this place. My Band also plays there quite a bit, and it is a great place to play. On weekends the place is always jammed, but there is still room to move around. Great staff, great bartenders, and great drinks!  [END]
[BEGIN] Finally a real good Mexican food place in Orlando. I highly recommend.It's open late. the service was good. the price is decent. and the food was amazing. the place could use a cosmetic touch up, but other than that... excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] pretty good/cheap subs. we still call it bhob even though its now technically bhorb. chicken fingah dinnah! wicked bum-tuck ked!  [END]
[BEGIN] A consistently tasty meal. The crab puffs(rangoons) are the best in town, seriously the best.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food good...upper east side drink delicious nice atmosphere. ..uuumm but keep the music going during the band taking a break...  [END]
[BEGIN] My favorite place to get my comfort food, congee. It always hits the spot. The honeymoon fried rice is second on my list.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had the tofu scramble with potatoes, tofu scramble with tempeh bacon, tofu scramble with vegan chorizo and the birdie sanders. They were scrumptious! Definitely recommend this place. Staff was very pleasant and food was delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] As BBQ joints go this is pretty good. Stopped in for a quick lunch and the joint was packed at noon. Got in and thru the line in good time. Food was good as always. Sure I will go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good cuban spot. Only my 2nd time having Cuban cuisine and I was very pleased. Food was good and staff was fun and friendly. I would def recommend this place for a first timer.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have very good toppings for your pizza, the pizza is cheap and flavorful and they make it very quickly. If you just have craving for pizza and do not want to eat a big one with so much cheese MOD pizza is the place to go.  [END]
[BEGIN] NY style pizza served fresh and hot! Ordered carry-out over the weekend and I think we found our new local pizza spot! Pie was hot and fresh and made just as ordered. Service was friendly and quick!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this Place,From the Music to the food,to the Satff,i'm Speechless. I'm here every Week End.GUYS GO TRY IT and you tell me :)  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the few places I will eat Italian food outside of the North End in Boston. Always filling, never disappoints! My advice: do Family Style. They'll just keep refilling your plates with food. It's so worth it!  [END]
[BEGIN] good sushi and the fried rice is really amazing but its a little pricey  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, but lately the wait is upwards of 30 minutes to get the food :( breakfast time turned into lunchtime waiting. Unfortunately if we want this in the future we will order ahead or choose somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love there chicken momo's and choila. Mouth watering, I always order this. Nepalifood#  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent pork egg rolls! Great friendly service. They are very busy but they always get you in and out. My only complaint is they sometimes run out of chicken on busy days and the chicken can be kind of fatty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Initially had a bad experience at this location but since they've been open, their customer service has gotten much better. Great for gluten free pizza and their Caesar salad is amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] had a great burger with yam chips...it was delicious...will be going back for sure...decor is average but the environment seems to work  [END]
[BEGIN] Take a close look at the West Tower of the bridge sometime, and look closely, and you might see the very faded - if it isn't already gone - Union Pacific Railroad emblem. Thank you random knowledge of school field trips past.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this place, laid back atmosphere, awesome backyard, interesting indoor and outdoor spaces, decent drinks.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been trying to find a cheap place that does a great job of cleaning the interior of my car... this place is definitely it! I was shocked on how clean my car was on the inside! I highly recommend this place for anyone in South Austin!  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here twice now, once for brunch and once for happy hour. Both were great experiences... The pretzel bites are amazing especially if you mix the dipping sauces as suggested by our HH server, Danielle  [END]
[BEGIN] First time I went I got the bandito (black bean patty) and it was okay, tried it again and got the Magic Shroom Burger with chile con queso fries and my experience was transformed talk about a magically delicious meal!  [END]
[BEGIN] First trip to Chuy's. The happy hour in the bar area is one of the best I have seen if you like awesome chips, beans, meat, cheese and salsa. The service was by far excellent. Get there early they pack them in...  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was good and I liked that the ambience was quiet and peaceful even though right outside was loud and busy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing coffee! I was only there for about 5 minutes, but the baristas were so nice and made my drink exactly how I wanted it. If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely go again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great neighborhood bar that is perfect for a game of darts or a few pints., It is usually filled with some local residents, or a nice mix of college kids and young professionals.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place and quiet. Friendly staff. Took me And my wife as walk ins. We will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] We haven't had the steak or anything the blue ribbon good grill is known for but they made a very good kids cheeseburger in my French onion soup was delicious. We will come back another time try the steak and have a martini. They are known for $7.49 martinis!  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid bar. Ridiculously friendly bartenders who know a surprising amount about their beer selection. Really fantastic pizza. Not the atmosphere I typically choose for a bar, but fun for a large group, with foosball and pool and some decent tunes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got charged an extra $1 for chili flakes and got what seemed to be one shake of the peppers. They also forgot my soda. Overall really great pizza and the owner has a heart of gold. Customer service goes a long way! You don't get outreach like his ANYWHERE anymore.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sometimes the wait can be long depending on when you go but always worth it! They are great about working with your price point and getting you a great bra. Staff is super sweet and friendly!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good compared to all the other Latin restaurants in the city...I went there yesterday and was very satisfied  [END]
[BEGIN] A neighborhood gem. Great bakery, desserts and a deli counter full of prepared dishes. They have a good cheese selection also! Look closely, that dessert you are having at your favorite restaurant may be from Alon's.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Barking crab was a change to the chain restaurants. I had the fried shrimp. It was fresh and juicy. I recommend giving the Barking crab your business. Great atmosphere and the vibe will help you to relax. If your a seafood eater, you will not be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fish tacos were awesome! (Sorry no pic as we ate them right away) Shrimp Tacos were also good, but could have used a few more shrimp.  [END]
[BEGIN] Across from Poor Calvin's, this spot gets a surprising number of canine visitors given the assumptions about the neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] They were helpful and fast fixing a problem with my un-trendy mountain bike. No attitude.  [END]
[BEGIN] Memorable Tabasco and honey fried chicken. Friendly service, and good desserts. Over average for bar food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was AWESOME (had the french toast). Staff was very friendly. Service could be a little faster. Look forward to going back here for dinner sometime! :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service. Classico pizza was very good. Loved the cheese polenta balls. Our server was very friendly and helpful. Great restaurant for my first time visiting Austin.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great coffee and a decent selection of bakery items. They've always been quick to make my drink. Staff isn't overly friendly and I don't think anyone has ever said hello, but I'm only there for a max 5 minutes so it doesn't matter too much.  [END]
[BEGIN] Joe Pizza is quick and delicious. Slices are huge, beware :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good pizza, great choice of games and prizes. Could have been a little cleaner though !  [END]
[BEGIN] vegan breakfast burrito A plus fruit/yo/gran. parfait est parfait good coffee- all that matters friendly staff best during non peak hours yummy smoothies portions sized just right sometimes if they give away free stuff when they oops or make too much  [END]
[BEGIN] YUM MOCHI! So many flavors - so delicious. I've had all of their flavors and am never disappointed. Would recommend for boba as well. More of a take-out place since the inside is small. It's a great place to stop when you're walking around the Harvard Square area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent meal Cool space and our waiter was really helpful. Scallops and pork tenderloin were great. Great selection of brews. My favourite was actually the Clementine dessert a very tasty orange palette pleaser!  [END]
[BEGIN] as others have said...a little pricey but everything is in perfect condition and the shopowner fixes/sows anything that needs it before it is on the floor. great jewelry...lots of crystal and bead necklaces...can't wait to go back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Checked out the treasures of the Forbidden City. Thanks! Saved me a trip to China. Lol  [END]

[BEGIN] Mmmmm. This place is good and fast. They have anything you could want that is of Asian decent cuisine. I enjoy the fast service and cheap prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like nothing I've ever had before. It was a great on the go lunch decision. It was fresh, hot and flavorful beyond words.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good carwash, they hand dry with towels. Helpful and friendly staff. Make sure you fold in mirrors if possible because brushes can be rough ! Unlimited carwashes for $29/month is a good deal! (Rough of one basic wash is $15)  [END]
[BEGIN] Spectacular ambiance, one of the best services I have encountered. Won't say food was the best Italian I have had but at par with the best of best. Portions are less hence you can happily consume a 4 course meal which makes this place pretty expensive. Nice for dates.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tough to rate. I know that they can't control how much space they have so I'm basing my rating on if they did have a lot of space. Nice casual bar. Very cozy and small. Real neighborhood feel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our first trip to Portland, so we were told that this place was a must try and it did not disappoint. This place is not your typical donut shop and is worth a visit. Our favorite was the orange olive oil and the Meyers lemon.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Burren - fun Irish Bar with good live music. If you choose to eat there, the food is actually above decent with some fun Irish specialties. Never had a bad time here.  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoy their food! They are also one of the only Mexican restaurants that sells aguas mexicanas which is wonderful  [END]
[BEGIN] Updated review- I think this place is under new management. I had a good salad there last week and just now am eating the bibimbap- it's super yummy!! Definitely going to start coming here more often now.  [END]
[BEGIN] Damn good food, and they're quick so you can actually eat there on your hour-long lunch break! Great for groups, too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this Bar! It's basically what you would dream of doing with your own house if you could. Ha Ha. Very low key, relaxed with a very cool unpretentious crowd. Ping Pong table outside is a winner!  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid quality food, not fantastic but provided the alternatives in this area it is a great option. Pretty pricey though. Super nice friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] I gave 4 stars because of the charge for parking, as Marriot Elite members shouldn't have to pay for parking. The plus to the hotel is that everyone gets a complimentary breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped there after a long day walking around vancouver and Capilano park. The place is nice with a great friendly vibe. I got a steak sandwitch (very good) and a beer. The price was also very reasonable. Overall good experience. Definetely recommended  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cool decor, awesome chips and salsa, killer asada skirt steak tacos. I sat at the bar and the service was great. The mixed drinks looked good so I'll have to try one next time because I'll definitely be back. Shop local!  [END]
[BEGIN] A hidden gem that I happened to stroll by with gorgeous views. Great drink options of wine, tea and smoothies too!  [END]
[BEGIN] I hate the 'red carpet line out the door' thing - but everything else about Hopboddy is excellent. Their burger selection is excellent - I especially love their Ahi tuna burger. It comes with wasabi honey which is just the best, sprouts, tasty tuna. Can't beat that.  [END]
[BEGIN] We love walking down after dinner in the summer for SG's great gelato, but its best kept secret is their donuts. Truly the best in town. Light, not to greasy, not to sweet and great flavors. The ginger is my favorite!  [END]
[BEGIN] This station has the best mix of songs, mostly, with the occassional looser tune negative vibe. I'm a fan with my finger on the change-channel button.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality mochi ice cream. More flavors, please! Street Fighter II arcade cabinet in the corner. Thoroughly entertaining throwback, but fifty cents a go? Standing fan in the back. It's going to get hot this summer! I will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Colorful little booths, ok house margaretas($8) great chile rellenos ($9) and floutas($10). Good salsa. Good service. Definitely worth a trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recently stayed here and I thought it was great. Great customer service. Clean room and fabulous view. I would definitely stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, service, beer selection, and view. The oysters were amazing, although the clam chowder was just ok. The main negative was the music, sounded like a popular pop radio station. I would definitely come back though if I'm ever in Salem again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Also sells awesome and sizable breakfast burritos (no potato though) -- get the salsa verde on the side!  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious pizza! Loved the chicken parm slider appetizer and bread pudding dessert. Ambiance is nice, though tables are quite tight when the restaurant is full... it's a bit like dining with your neighbors.  [END]
[BEGIN] Snow crab legs and the salmon were delicious. Love that they start you off with complimentary hush puppies. Always happy to stop in here for a meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] The environment was so friendly, you can chat with strangers in the same booth. I ordered hazelnut coffee, it was so goooood！!  [END]
[BEGIN] I went here after an EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) event - pretty interesting to have a speakeasy-like setup underneath a hostel. I ordered from an African American bartender who made me a "Baptist" - good drink, good fun, recommend it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Predictably great food! It can be very busy/loud on weekends and it takes awhile to get the checks with groups.  [END]
[BEGIN] Short, but nice course in Newton. Decent value, especially for residents. Accuracy is important and rewarded. I would suggest taking a cart the first time around - some of hte holes are hilly!  [END]
[BEGIN] I love This place. Good sushi, good entrees, creative drinks. Parking is rough, but that's downtown Delaware in general. My only real complaint is service, especially when ordering cocktails can be very slow. Seriously order two drinks...  [END]
[BEGIN] A solid restaurant! Selected the Pork Phad Thai had several layers of flavors. Also selected the chicken skewers... Peanut sauce tasted homemade and was fantastic!  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here to see Lachlan Peterson in June (2016). Great space! Hope to go back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute little market. Loved that it was easy to park close by and it was not super crowded. I will defintely be going again  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been stopping in regularly for a couple years. I like their pizza, subs, and salads. The staff are very friendly. And orders are ready pretty quick.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for group dining. Great local sourcing, fantastic wine list.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hangover food. Cheap tacos. One taco can serve as a meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been for their spa pedicure a few times now and am impressed. The sterile look of the sign out front does not match the spacious and modern, comfortable look inside. The technicians and staff are friendly and the price is right. Will give the manicure a try next time!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's hard to find really authentic German food, unless you go here. Get ready for brats and beer cuz this place gives an all access eating pass to German cuisine without the 6 hour flight across the Atlantic.  [END]
[BEGIN] The donuts here are very good. This is a must go when in portland. I would recommend the blueberry and glazed.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really liked Papa Razzi. I'm not big on the chain restaurants, but I enjoyed this place. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. I got the cavatappi affumicati (pasta with eggplant, cheese, and tomatoes) and it was yummeriffic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good burger, always attentive service (we've only eaten on the full service side). Wouldn't even think of going here on a weekend....it's good, but not 3-hour wait good. The onion rings are awesome, the "adult milkshake" is very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little market. Sat outside with a bottle of wine. Great view of the lake across the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious. Absolutely great. Wait was only about 10-15 min around 11:30 am on a Saturday. The price was a bit steep but quality and taste was on point. Potato and beef hash were cooked to perfection.  [END]
[BEGIN] Drunken noodle was bomb, steamed veggies and shrimp also were good. Only thing missing was more sauce! Ask for some on the side :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Ive been going here for almost 8 years now. Get your hair cut by Mike if he is there. Apparently he now typically only works mournings.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great space, great cafe and teas. I will be back. D.patnod. Acup H. Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] They just remodeled the whole place and it looks so much better! Staff is usually really nice always very helpful. Clean and very well stocked. Gas service is also great here. Fast and easy. They have tons of lanes and service people!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service , nice location and nice staff, first time, I went, MUSIC was SO LOUD, so I stopped going ... yesterday I decides to give it second chance , music was not so loud , so I was able to have meeting and do my work. Hope they conyinue  [END]
[BEGIN] They gave one of my coworkers a bunch of free egg rolls because they said they were training new people. They were delicious! One batch was spicy, the other was normal. They had plenty of meat. The only caveat: the spicy is SPICY.  [END]
[BEGIN] My girlfriend and I had our first official date here. We have been meaning to go back but it looks like we missed our chance. I am sad to see that this place is no longer open, we both really liked the meal we had there.  [END]
[BEGIN] A very nice find on a rainy night -- despite its location in a shopping center this spot felt very tranquil, sushi was very good, fresh, some inventive rolls. Attentive service.  [END]
[BEGIN] All 3 dishes we had were delicious, very hearty and savory. I will be back. Making it a point to try the beef momos! Also the hand pulled noodle soup is great here!  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been to this clubs many times over the years and have always found that the dancers there are among the best looking in the metro area. The environs are mildly divey but not bad. I only wish I lived closer.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was fresh and tasty. They have options for the kids. We had a party of eight and were seated promptly at our reservation time. The service was fantastic and the price was incredibly reasonable. This is definitely a gem of a place to eat inside of the parks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Come here if you want some round melon balls and soft ice. Sweet with milk on top. Seasonal fruits for the mood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing dine in! Great butter chicken lots of big pieces of chicken and heavy on the cream. Great shahi paneer and fish pakoras. Nice naan. When you order take out they provide you with a small order of salad which is a nice accompaniment. Beautiful upscale atmosphere  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the kind of burger that you will always feel guilty for eating, but just can't resist every time. I have been to this location many times and I will go again and again in the future. Oh, and if you get fries, expect a truckload!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is so cheap it boggles the mind. You can get trendy going-out clothes for next to nothing. Obviously not the best quality stuff, but with these prices that doesn't matter.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food but give you too much food. If you like a lot of food this is the place for you. They give you double the food you should be eating. Must admit the yogurt and fruit is my favorite.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good grub, good drinks, friendly peeps and kewl atmosphere  [END]
[BEGIN] Great spot & food, but we went on their second Sunday brunch/DJ offering and they were a bit understaffed, but I know they are working out the kinks. I'd love to see their full menu offered on Sunday's once noon hits:)  [END]
[BEGIN] Beer and burger special for $5.95. Best lunch special in boston!  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm a fan! A lot of choices but I went for the signature spicy tuna burrito. Huge roll made me so full. Except for the tuna, the roll was packed with fresh goodies, picked ginger, seaweed, lettuce ect. Will definitely be back  [END]
[BEGIN] The beet salad and calamari appetizer was delicious. The service was excellent very attentive. Would highly recommend this restaurant!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was great this time. Sometimes it is hit or miss. The music is much too loud and not fitting to the setting.  [END]
[BEGIN] I liked the fact that they accepted my last minute appointment, I happened to be in the area and needed a pedi ASAP. The service was excellent, my feet look amazing :) On this occasion I chose the service which included a massage and it felt great!  [END]
[BEGIN] I can't wait to try the breads from this bakery....I bought the Pineapple Bun and the Red Bean Mochi Bun. They were about $1.35/one. No seating area and difficult to find parking.  [END]
[BEGIN] Spinach artichoke dip was honestly the best I've ever had. And Eric N was my bartender, he was super attentive and personable! Great experience!  [END]
[BEGIN] One of my absolute favorite restaurants! HUGE plates for a good price. Always enough to take some home. The only thing I'm not a big fan of here is there Pho. Kind of bland. Other than that, love.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lunch! Large portions!!! Tastes wonderful! Compound butter addictive! Turned me around on Brussel sprouts! Would come back if i lived in Austin!  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid Buffalo Burger. Grass fed and tasty burger for a decent price. I toured the kitchen and all the ingrediants are fresh. Love it for lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Try this place the first time. Pretty good. Had coffee and Hungarian Goulash soup and ApplePie French toast. Price is good. Taste is good too. Place looks clean. Will be back to try other food on the menu  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome food. Whenever we go it is not busy at all, and the service is good. I love the pad Thai, the pineapple rice, and the red coconut curry- all must-try's!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] We've been twice to Furniture World and it's always a breeze. They work with you on price, offer a wide selection and don't consistently hound you while you're trying out 42 different couches. It's affordable and easy and delivery was a piece of cake.  [END]
[BEGIN] I liked it. Good service. Reasonable food. Good value. I little something different.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are a Curious George, the curious little monkey, fan then you must stop here. There is a small store in New Orleans but this one is HUGE. It's right there by the metro line so you can't miss it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cru has a really great burger! Really great, with hashbrowns to boot. I would have never found it, but It im glad a buddy turned me on to it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute atmosphere- beautiful porch. Portions were huge. Staff was friendly. Would return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wait wasn't too bad to be seated on a Friday morning. Service is a little slow, maybe understaffed. Our server was very pleasant and apologetic about the wait. The cauliflower and kale hash was amazing, as was the Korean style pork. Good portion sizes too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Need to make reservations because this place is very very small and busy. Food is good and the prices are reasonable. Friendly staff. Gave it a four star because it is very small and tight.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered chicken fettuccine and garlic bread, with a slice of cheesecake. I really enjoyed my meal and I am excited to try more items from them. They were very friendly as well!  [END]
[BEGIN] Art is a very pleasent man, but he quotes a little high.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic tacos, not fancy but delicious and very reasonably priced. Routine take-out spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does Safeway medicate their employees? Everyone here is outrageously helpful and pleasant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved this place! The waffles were delicious, the food was filling and reasonably priced, and the service was fantastic! Bree was wonderful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality food made fast. Great prices and easy to navigate menu. Prices and menu descriptions are printed clearly. Hot food is hot and cold is cold. Everything is well seasoned and prepared with a wonderful smile.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is delish, an gluten-free friendly. Try the desert pizza :) Be sure to check in on foursquare to unlock discounts!  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm a newer customer at this establishment and I must say I'm glad I found this place. I tend to stop in after I pick up my baby from school. Very friendly staff. Great pizza especially the bbq chicken flat bread. I would definitely recommend this place!  [END]
[BEGIN] So apparently it's korean owned which makes me sad.. But of course they need Japanese staff to fool us, so not sure where the cooks are from.. The food is good, and place looks nice, affordable. But Shiro is still better, maybe because it's 100% Japanese?  [END]
[BEGIN] The coop scramble is great. Breakfast served until 2pm! Perfect for my drinking habits.  [END]
[BEGIN] An Entire Poutine menu! Then add Pork Belly! I'm in heaven! This place is great, with a lot of personality! Lots of dipping sauces (saus, get it?) to try! Be aware of specialty items on the side menu!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] We found this place to be pretty sweet. The restaurant is crap, but everyone was friendly, the rooms are awesome, and the price is right!  [END]
[BEGIN] Their handmade chocolate is a killer. My mouth melted as I put the chocolate in my mouth. Yes, literally melted. Service is friendly and attentive. Good ambience. Coffee is comparable to JJ Beans, hmmmm~ I will sure visit as often.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thursday night was very low key (11-12am). Bar tender was great and the game room in back was awesome! Free darts & shuffle board. $1 video games and skee ball. Didn't try the Food but it looked like fried goodness.  [END]
[BEGIN] I liked the beer and the appetizers we had were tasty, especially the biscuits. GNOM! They have a really nice selection of cocktails and beers and our waiter was awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Breakfast is horrible. It is extremely generic resulting in why the hotel gives you free breakfast. Other than that, the hotel is luxurious and you are guaranteed to have a great time.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you love funky digs, good beer and soul music then come find me at the Elephant room. We'll be friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty standard Chinese fare. Bonus points for a very friendly staff. Support local family business!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun festive environment. Guacamole is excellent and food is very good. Great after work crowd. It can be very loud!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is amazing. I had rice over beef. A little hot/humid inside. It's like going into a house in a humid, foreign (Arabic) country. Free Wifi. Definitely a place to go with friends or to study on a cooler day.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is such a gem in Lansdowne Mall. Dumplings, noodle soup bowls, green onion pancakes, and beef rolls. So good. You can even see them making the dumplings fresh right infront of you. If more food court restaurants were like this, fast food wouldn't have such a bad rep.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very good alternative to your typical Safeway or King Soopers. Really good deal on the weekly produce sales. Excellent customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place isnt fancy or anything but the food is spot on, nice and friendly waitstaff and the food is awesome, get the beef enchiladas they rock and the queso is always awesome. I highly recommend it  [END]
[BEGIN] I didn't know that my Mercedes C300 could be serviced here!! Saved me a ton of money, and my car looks awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best Vietnamese food place in Downtown Atlanta.Definitely recommend to visit.Only reason I an rating 4 is due to long time you have stand in queue to place order something they should learn from chick-fil or chipotle how to manage rush hours  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good food. Dont feel its authentic but the quality of the food makes up for it. Great service...not too expensive and they serve beer too! Nice outside eating section as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recently moved to Austin and was looking for a good vermicelli bowl ... Found it at 888.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the beef and octopus tofu soup yesterday. It was a bit saltier than I expected, but it was extremely delicious! Will go back again and drink a lot of water!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for breakfast! I ordered the biscuits, gravy and two egg special with coffee. It was $8 and was delicious. It is a clean and spacious place to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cool place. Reminded me of several spots in the Bay Area (Poggio's in Sausalito comes to mind, but with a Southern twist). The spicy rigatoni was fantastic - never had fried oysters before but they were a great addition.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here after work on a Friday, and it's a relaxing spot. Nice and quiet, simple spot. I had a beer and enjoyed sitting on a couch watching people walk by to decompress from the week. Wasn't too crowded either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel with above average customer service and experience. Lots of extras. Any issues resolved quickly and generously so.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great Goodwill to shop at! It is always clean and well organized. The staff is nice and always helpful. Another plus is that they are open on Sundays while most other thrift stores or not.  [END]
[BEGIN] Happy hour is the best, EVERYDAY (yes, even weekends!) from 3-6pm. They have a delightful and refreshing menu that changes seasonally, as all their food is sourced locally. The gluten free options are plentiful and DELICIOUS. I love the salad that has a wasabi dressing and hazelnuts. Come hungry!  [END]
[BEGIN] Three words: Beef. Lovable. Beef. Best burgers, servers and onion rings ever.. Hands down! Flipping out for Flip! Need more parking at Highlands!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the best food you can get in the food court of concourse E. considerably healthier than the other options. a bit pricy but the portions are HUGE. Pretty rich flavors for airport food  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a good place for dim sum but make sure to make reservations. The quality and service are what you pay for in your final bill. My favorite dish has to be the chicken shredded chicken that has slices of jelly fish.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prices are decent and they have a good variety of dishes. I've been here several times... food and service has always been good.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like seafood you should not pass on checking this place out. They are known for good seafood in the Boston area and they are sprouting up in the northern east coast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stop by for an authentic taste of Shanghai hidden in the outskirts of Chinatown. Try their steamed dumplings, gigantic Lion Head meatballs, braised meats, cold kao fu, and string beans. You can always ask the owner for his specials and suggestions.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not your date night destination but a quick taco in a pinch is great. The selection is fresh and the staff are super friendly. They do have specials that look interesting and the prices are very reasonable. Cant be beat to cure a taco craving!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent burgers. I didn't think it was especially expensive, but I also went for work and wasn't paying much attention to the price. The decor is energetic and eclectic. Great service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had great service on a damaged irrigation system. Lots of leaks were fixed, and system adjusted. Extremely fair price, and Logan provided great service! Will call them again for future work. Only nit was that they are extremely busy, so there is a wait for an appointment date.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, quick service. Located in a quiet/pretty shopping center. Ordered a half size of the apple fritters - which were more breading than apple, but still good - and the Greek omelet. Was pleased with both.  [END]
[BEGIN] The ambience is good. Went here for a birthday. The food is good however, with the pig in the name, you would think they'd be more pig oriented food but that's not the case.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is always good. Prices are a little high. You definitely have to order a few items to feel satisfied.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love fried chicken so I was happy to find they do it just right here.This restaurant focuses on one thing and they do it well!! Chicken breasts are tender, juicy and flavorful without being greasy. Recommended for fellow fried chicken lovers  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought my cat a cute Patriots bandana that he wears tied around his neck at this store. I also bought some small cat toys. We almost died laughing at the crazy dog clothes! It was a little pricey, but very original. I just wish they had more cat stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] I came here to pick up some gluten free sausages for dinner = awesome. I love the lamb one which i mix with my mac and cheese.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is my favorite place to get this style of food. Vegetarian and vegan friendly. Over the eight years of enjoying this place, the prices have sky rocketed, which is a shame. It's quickly becoming unaffordable, unless for special occasions.  [END]
[BEGIN] In my experience, its not necessarily the best you will ever find, but consistent and has become a comfortable place to go and hang out ... especially when they got rid of the indoor smoking. Chicken Fajitas for one can feed two :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Claim Jumper just calls to me every once in a while...pretty good selection of food and portions are always plentiful. The atmosphere is nice and they have a decent bar and happy hour to partake in.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is very yummy here...I especially love the fried plantains! It's good to get in early for dinner, before the crazy dance scene starts up. When I have been there for dancing, it's fun, but just a bit too crowded. Be sure to sip a Caipirinha or Mojito.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a quiet place for delicious ramen. It is self-service style and my favorite is #1 Signature Ramen.  [END]
[BEGIN] These are definitely some of the best tacos in Austin. This place is hipster heaven. Don't show up without your beard and Ray Bans. Try the puffy tacos!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the best Hudson Grille of the several in the Atlanta area that I have been to, thanks to the top-notch wait staff at the bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. Great wine. Very friendly and attentive service. Came down because of proximity to Botanical Gardens, but would totally come back!  [END]
[BEGIN] We love this place! It's quickly become a favorite date night spot. Hubby and I love their happy hour nacho bar and margaritas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really interesting things being done with flavor and texture here. Great, concentrated menu with care in each dish. No frills atmosphere, but it is technically in a mall, so be ready to wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried it again - all the ice cream flavors and cone options were available and the service was GREAT!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not the most posh nail salon. Additionally, I feel like the process of soaking and shaping my nails was a little rushed however, here I am a full 7 days later with perfect gel polish nails! Additionally, the lady doing my nails was so sweet!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good sushi. Edema me was excellent, very fresh. Nice atmosphere. Prices are reasonable. I'd go back for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was my first time here. Food was great but both our meat dishes were way oversalted. I'm still rating high as the rest of our food was great and service was fantastic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is amazing. I just thought for a while had been in Indian Chinese Restaurant. Hats off to the Chef  [END]
[BEGIN] The lady here was so friendly. One of the best soy mochas I've had recently. Conveniently located across the strfrom a great dispensary.  [END]
[BEGIN] I work in Reading and order out for lunch or dinner sometimes. I love their chicken kabob and greek salads. They have great chicken stir fry, awesome grilled chicken pita, pizza is delish !!!!!! I would definitely recommend them !!!!! Fast delivery too !!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Buon servizio che sa ben consigliare tra le varie birre proposte a menu. Peccato non abbia posti all'esterno.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the food. Very friendly was worth the drive of 30 mins. The chicken pasteles was amazing.!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great independent kids resale shop with lots of mama buys too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for a late dinner and got: - beet salad: way fancier than i thought it would be. Really delicious app. - pizza: average, nothing especial, my cheese kept falling off the dough. - crabmeat ravioli: also very delicious. Overall, solid restaurant with good food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mangieris is consistently good pizza. Plentiful selection of fresh ingredients. The pizza feels a little healthier than most, perhaps it's that whole wheat crust!  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful experience. It's a relief to find a place that maintains such a high level out near Concord. I've been there three times so far and have never been disappointed. The service has always been great and the food it fresh, tasty, and imaginative.  [END]
[BEGIN] Totally divey yet I loved it. Great strong reasonably priced drinks and a very polite/attentive waitress to boot. I'm a fan!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is really good! I have been here multiple times for brunch. Their eggs benedict is a little weird, scrambled with spinach instead of poached. But still really tasty! Service is always really friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lunch special. Not very crowded, but as far as Hakka food goes in the boston area, this is one of the better options we've tried so far.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good coffee and scones when there are few decent choice in the area. The staff are friendly and quick to serve.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here a few days ago for lunch. Cute little stop, but no A/C so don't go on a super hot day. Huge piece of fish on the fish sandwich with lots of fries, I couldn't finish it all. Great place in the middle of a beach day.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am in love with ModMarket and really happy since they started serving breakfast. Eggplant sandwich is my favorite for lunch and for breakfast the waffle is yummy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its small in a good way--unlike the Mega stores--(shaws, s and s, etc.) friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff. way better shopping experience that the big boxes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Read my previous, more extensive review below. That review focused on the Thai dishes. This time I went back and tried the sushi offerings. Everything I had was delicious, even the salad. The happy hour prices were great. For $3, you get a substantial set of rolls!  [END]
[BEGIN] Free wi-fi with no password, solid tea options, live music, friendly staff, ample sitting space, though most tables are too small for two laptops and you can't use a large one if you're not a group of 4. Can't ask for too much else, can I?  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good. It being my first time here I didn't know what to expect. I can say I am folly satisfied and stuffed. I will make this a regular lunch spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] THE JAZZ spot in Austin, nothing else. Enjoy your music.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the special deals they have each week! You can try different flavours for a great deal!  [END]
[BEGIN] A touch more expensive than the other frozen yogurt shops I have been to but a good variety of flavors,decent toppings, clean shop and prompt service. I dig this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like Thai, but live far north. Thai Cuisine is the best option for good Thai food, good service, and a nice atmosphere. The family that owns this restaurant is great, too. As long as they keep doing what they're doing, I'm a fan.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of my new favorites in Midtown. The Arroz caldoso is amazing! It is served in share size portion but I never have any trouble finishing it solo. Also great atmosphere and the service is top notch. I would highly recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here several times and its always good. Great beer selection. The 7 layer dip & the Mediterranean plate are delish. It is very casual and all seating is outside. The view of the lake is nice as well. It offers all that its name states, Relax.  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried chocolate manjari cake and almond croissant. It was uber delicious! They also have good looking paninis if you are looking for something savoury!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent! Antipasto had much more variety in meat and cheese than most places. Steak tips panino was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice atmosphere and good coffee. I love their wild berry cake.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for lunch, the food is consistently great, I haven't gotten anything I didn't like yet. The service is quick and the staff is attentive, great place for lunch for a very reasonable price!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place gets paaaaaccckkkeed super fast. We were there like 10 minutes before it opened and there was already a line for people wanting to get in. Super cute cafe, we sat inside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid place if you a conference near the Boston WTC. Clean lodging, good restaurant, and close to public transit and close to airport.  [END]
[BEGIN] Finally, a "real" restaurant at ATL. Server was enthusiastic and attentive and I opted for the Kobe burger which didn't disappoint. Who knows, serving great food in airports may just catch on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a sandwich at the bar sitting area at lunch. Not busy here and service was fine. Not sketchy inside right now.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got the General Gau's Chicken, and spring rolls. I can't complain. They were exactly what I wanted, and tasted delicious. Big servings. Rice does not come with the chicken, though... sort of a let down, but I should have known. Fast delivery. Nice driver.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the beef stew with the French bread and I don't know maybe I just really like bread but the French bread was awesome. Also they have so many more choices on the menu then pho which was refreshing to see. This place is huge.  [END]
[BEGIN] Holy Mother!! If you think the trailer experience is great...the restaurant creations will blow your mind. Fun atmosphere, great drinks and ...just ok staff. Can't wait to go back and stuff my face again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seriously good chicken shawarma! Not the best looking restaurant; take out is much better. Sadly the Falafels aren't great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hot chicken is very spicy. Almost too much. And I like spicy food. Chicken sandwich was wonderful. Quality breading. Fries were delicious. Pickled cucumbers were very tasty. Mac salad solid. Great open seating area with several other food places to choose from and beer options.  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoy going here for some standard Chinese fare, good service and takeout. Good neighborhood joint.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have lived in Miami and Tampa and enjoyed Cuban food everywhere. When I moved to Atlanta, imagine my surprise to find Papi's. I enjoy Papi's Ropa Vieja more than any dish anywhere. Papi's is the bomb  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has countless kinds of subs, all kinds imaginable since its located in Boulder; from veggies to tempeh, from seafood to all kinds of meats and cheeses!  [END]
[BEGIN] great beer selection, music was really loud but the sandwiches were awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] The DC store is better but Atlanta has great customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice neighborhood dessert lunch place. Staff are great and helpful. Offer frozen pies too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Have been several times. Food was great each time. We enjoyed our food best on the deck but the menu on the indoor dining is much better.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best sushi places I've been to! Portions are good, prices are reasonable, friendly staff..even got a free bottle of wine for the holidays!  [END]
[BEGIN] One of my favorite greasy food spots! I wouldn't get too adventurous with the menu though - stick to the pizza and the calzones!  [END]
[BEGIN] Visited is hotel about 4 times this year .. Big and beautiful a lot going all the time.. Rooms are beautiful, room prices are not to bad The staff is not very helpful and that's why 4 stars instead of 5  [END]
[BEGIN] I can't believe that I haven't been to this Jamba more often as I fly through ATL quite a bit. It's a great place to get a mango a go-go in between flights and the Jamba helps you to refresh and rejuvenate before your next flight.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was tasty food. Creative. Whoever I will not recommend coming to get drunk than eating there meal. Not nearly enough carbs to absorb the booze... Oi! We came for a Holiday party. It was a nice venue. I do recommend this. Great Martini and Wine selection.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lol so the service today was slightly all over the place and we got like 3 waiters, who were all very kind! Anyway the food was good, especially the refried beans wow! First time having migas and was super happy with that. Overall a solid 4 stars  [END]
[BEGIN] The brown sugar gelato was quite tasty not my favorite place but still up there on my list  [END]
[BEGIN] They have great and fresh sushi and a wonderful space to dine in. The customer service is top-notch and they are very welcoming. Great environment Would definitely recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] We ordered the pizza and it was very good. It was a little difficult to get to, but not impossible. The pizza sauce did not have enough tomato flavor for my husband, but I really like it. There was a lot of delicious, gooey cheese.  [END]
[BEGIN] Traveled 90 minutes just to try this out Wonderfully pleased. Will be back for sure. Loved the BBQ beans and bread pudding  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoy coming here to eat a little, drink a little and work on my computer. I've been there enough that the staff knows me by name. It is truly nice to go where everybody knows your name! It's a great place to chill without having a lot of distractions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fresh, very fresh, ingredients. Good price, good food, huge servings. They close at 10 which is sometimes too early for us. Menu is limited to Mexican only. The interior is 'cold' in design so I've only done take out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great espresso and service! More variety of food compatible with coffee drinks and more room would have made me give 5 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have tried many hot chocolates, but this place by far has the best. It's not too sweet, but just right. They also have very good blueberry muffins.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good! The delivery was on time and prices were reasonable. I got the spinach and cheese momos which were FANTASTIC. I also got the tofu curry which was just okay (a bit bland). Get the momos, you won't be sorry.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little slow, but it is a Friday night. Food was good (carnitas burger and yam fries).  [END]
[BEGIN] PHIL!!!!! He is the man and his customer service is by far the best I've ever seen! Keep him! I give 4 stars because my order got all mixed up 2 times and only revived a credit and had to drive all the way back there and wait ..  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a great place to eat nice portions, great for lunch and dinner. The staff is nice and friendly. It has a nice and warm feeling. So if you're in mood for good food, I recommend you check it out.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a bar that offers it all as far as entertainment. You can sit down and listen to a live band or dance to the latest hip-hop without ever leaving. The dollar drafts aren't too bad either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Go to this place. I guarantee you'll like it! Have the ribs - better than a BBQ joint!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a fun place, they have a stage in the back room where they have events and the cubby claws are awesome parmesan garlic is my best favorite  [END]
[BEGIN] This review is long overdue. There is a bit of a wait for breakfast, so go early. The food is great, the outdoor seating is nice and they are pet friendly! The service is great and the portions are big.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bookhouse does a good job. When it comes to Atlanta pubs. My recommendations will always be Steinbecks, The Porter, and now Bookhouse.  [END]
[BEGIN] Place gets busy so it's a dog eat dog when it comes to ordering. Then again what else would you expect from a busy place. Meaning popular for it's Devine pizza and craft beer selection.  [END]
[BEGIN] fast, good. Robert memorizes your name quickly and is friendly. The rest of staff are not really friendly but get the job done.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love that this place delivers! The Tom Kha is some of the best I've ever had. I had been avoiding the pad thai becuase I found it a little bland but I decided to order it again and it was much improved! Delicious curry and very friendly service!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great selection of beers, including Texas beers. The bartenders could be more engaging they kinda just stare at the wall waiting for orders and have no interest in talking or being social, something important to a top notch bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for a quick dessert. I ordered the pandan waffles which was made fresh. It had good flavor and texture, I would definitely get it again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went during a busy weekday lunch. Line moved fast, pulled chicken was good, could have used a tad more seasoning. Next time will get the half chicken. Vinegar slaw was good, as was the house salad. Place was clean, well kept, and staff was friendly. I'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the vegan burger and was amazed at how delicious it was. It tastes like a real burger!! I loved the tater tots too. Onion rings were good but a little too thin.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was dry and overpriced I didn't really enjoy eating here and I don't plan to come back again in the future ...  [END]
[BEGIN] We just had a wonderful dinner next door, but ice cream for dessert. This place is fabulous. Cartelized apple, toasted marshmallow, blood orange. Very original flavored. We will be back. Yum!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, cozy atmosphere. Awesome customer service, and tasty food. I tried the catfish tenders and the chicken with red velvet waffles. Delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] love their hookahs, the ambiance, the hummus sandwich, and the apple juice! Service is kind of slow but it's a nice little find so far!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food but expensive. It's a great place to go just to try something different but expect to drop a pretty penny.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to have a drink and end your day. It's a nice place two windows. I am a fan of their happy hour because you can try quite a few of their popular appetizers for very reasonable. You can't beat the size of the apps either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the place to go if you're looking for vegetables or something healthy, but the fried chicken is hot, spicy, and delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun, relaxed atmosphere paired with delicious food and good beer! Cozy so it's not so loud you can't talk, outdoor seating and within walking distance to downtown. Thanks for a great night!  [END]
[BEGIN] These guys were really friendly. They gave a cookie to my crying daughter ...which probably just rewarded her for whining...but you get the idea.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. Great prices. This place has become a regular for me and my family. They have several large screen tv's on the wall and a fireplace in the winter. Pizza is great, meatballs are great and I also like the chicken parm. My wife loves the lobster ravioli.  [END]
[BEGIN] They are a little bit expensive but they had what I was looking for when nobody else did. They also have a lot of US made stuff which is always a plus in my book.  [END]
[BEGIN] Get the curry bowl,its the best food on the menu and its more than enough,you will be stuffed  [END]
[BEGIN] Dinner and drinks were good. We sat out on the patio. Nice atmosphere. Friendly servers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great spot, great selection and nice helpful staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] I liked the sausages, the beer, and the vibe! Must try the humongous choux.  [END]
[BEGIN] On a girls weekend in Atlanta. Fabulous margaritas, nice and strong! We had steak fajitas and vegetable tacos. Both were delicious. Perhaps the ambience could have been better but after first cocktail we didn't care. Would recommend for the drinks alone.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best Pho in Vancouver. So so good. And if you like spring rolls, have them here, I can never not order them. Loses a star for ambiance. It could be a bit brighter and nicer inside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for dogs to swim. Many spots off the trail to jump in. The only downside is the parking situation. Small lot and you may need to wait in line for a spot to park. Otherwise, great experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty cool interior much better than competitors on route 1! Deff underrated. The menu is a bit basic but then again i went as soon as it opened but yet it was still satisfying the drinks are very good  [END]
[BEGIN] fresh, delicious, cheap and friendly! can't beat it! my first visit to an Austin food truck. fun!  [END]
[BEGIN] My boyfriend and I came here after spending time at Bracket Town during the NCAA Final Four Weekend here in Atlanta. It was very quiet and he atmosphere was nice and relaxing. The food came out hot. The services was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've traveled all over US and UK, this is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to. The Tikka Masala and Saag Paneer are some of the best anywhere. Thank god they are local. Try it and you'll fall in love.  [END]
[BEGIN] The meatball sub sure hit the spot! Their menu is very "straight to the point". What you see is what you get - scrumptious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great quality coffee. Pastries are good but they don't wow me. Food is also good but I don't like the seasonings they put in their eggs - they try too hard to fancy eggs up in my opinion.  [END]
[BEGIN] All I can say is wow!!. The appetizers were excellent, and probably the best bread we've had. The main courses were very good and we had an overall enjoyable time. We will come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Titaya's has the best shrimp spring rolls and peanut sauce! That's the extent of my Titaya's experience so I shall save, or would "savor" be more appropriate, the last star for a more in-depth analysis...  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice atmosphere, good food, great wine selection and overall good service. I would definitely recommend the fiddleheads and the paella. The place is loud but the vibe is very nice and relax. Really enjoyed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Noor serves up great food in small and basic quarters. Great for takeout. Food is served moderately quickly. The wrap was a little too tomato heavy, but I really recommend the Hummus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place!!! Boar, bison, elk burgers!!! OK, the service is a bit slow but the place is clean, and they still have the excellent fries with free cheese sauce.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid sandwiches, especially for airport food. The prices are surprisingly reasonable as well, with most sandwiches being about $8 and a 20 oz. soda for $2. Staff is a little absent, but I'm not really complaining.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for lunch. Food was excellent. Wait staff a little slow but we weren't in a hurry so overall a good experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Miss the wood and the old layout and look. Going to "all metal" makes the place much less cozy, and harder to find things because there are no sections, just one continuous metal wall. Even the lighting seems less friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] The cannelloni here is the best in the North End in my opinion. The other dishes are very good as well. If you go here sit up stairs for your meal and then go downstaris for a few drinks.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've use this place several times since discovering it and found the staff to be very efficient and courteous. I also like the fact that they will match the VBCE rates.!  [END]
[BEGIN] Turkey Gruyere good Nice girl with tattoos served me Like Spring in Summer  [END]
[BEGIN] For a theme park this was an excellent choice for high quality food and service. Our server knew the menu inside and out and explained everything. Nicely decorated and the cuisine matched the setting for the most part. Would dine here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really enjoyed my meat lovers skillet. Decent service have felt forgotten a few times I've been but it happens. Only gripe is my soda isn't refillable after 1 refill. Well priced though  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent ramen here. Soup is flavor packed. Noodle texture good. Pork tender and just right. Only very slight letdown was that their eggs could be marinated longer, but all in all, the go to place for us in the Portland area. I recommend the miso version.  [END]
[BEGIN] pretty good place. we come here whenever we make it to atlanta and want a high class burger  [END]
[BEGIN] Great izakaya to go to after work! The soba noodles omelet there is a must order. Sushi is great too. Sake bomb will make it better on weekends.  [END]
[BEGIN] I came to try this place out and I'm a fan! Linda, our server was outsanding! My brother and I were surprised to see that the food looked just like the pictures on the menu and was really good too. Definitely coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is where I always do my laundry... The owners are friendly, there are always washers available and I can stuff all my clothes (for a month) into one of their mega-washers to get over with painlessly...  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent, basic pub food with excellent service. Can get crowded at the bar at times but the staff and patrons are friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a wonderful treat. Mark and Kim have opened a great tasting room in downtown Vancouver. There wines are fun and so are they. You need to check Burnt Bridge Cellars out.  [END]
[BEGIN] First thing I like about Thierry is their working hours! It's very hard in Vancouver to find a nice place for coffee and tea after 7PM. Pastries are good quality, and I love their rich hot-chacholate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recommend and will use again. The men were fast and professional. The bonus is that they were careful moving our glass and breakables. Reasonable price.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm a huge fan. It is close to the house and I love being able to get healthy options and not break the bank. I make sure to get my local, raw honey for my allergies, and tons of other things.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beef Negimaki, Grilled shrimp, Boston unCommon roll, Bluefin toro, green tea margarita.... Alll very good. As everyone else mentioned.... its pretty inside. Wait staff were a bit clumsy and confused. They didn't have lobster for their lobster rolls. On a Tuesday. That was a bummer.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has always great service and delicious food. Decent prices. The service is really quick, not like in others places. Nothing else compares!  [END]
[BEGIN] Only good Chinese place been able to find so far in the area. I love the egg foo yung!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was great. Stopped in here with my sister and brother in law for lunch, and we weren't disappointed. Wine selection was great- and so was everything from the appetizers to the entrees! I will definitely visit here again- a total gem!  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the great strip clubs with woman with Big Booty....You will have to find them..its big and dark enough...I LIKE IT..OTHER PEOPLE maybe wont....this was in 2013..  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good place for a quick, cheap, and decent lunch. The fish tacos are good and the nachos are a big portion size. The fresh salsa is really good, and there's an avocado based salsa that's delicious! I've always found the staff to be friendly and courteous.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's the new food trend in Vancouver. Must try!!! Hotdog is made by Kurabuto pork but they have other options like vegan. The hotdogs are juicy, toppings are great. Get the combo with fries. Oh, be careful of the birds- they like the hotdogs as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] First experience at a hostel. For the price you can't beat the accommodations and location. Much cleaner than I had thought. Staff was great as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time at Gail Ann's today, had the best cream-filled doughnut yet. Cakey, with very light filling. Steady stream of people coming in for the half-hour I was sitting there. Just ate the jelly-filled that I got to-go, and it too was perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] This might be one of the best deals in Boston. Fixed prices on the salad bar make for an all out, how much can you fit in your container escapade. I love salad bars, so though this place is great in my book.  [END]
[BEGIN] The really good: Shrimp Po Boy The average: Gumbo The weak: Service (just on this visit)  [END]
[BEGIN] juicy meat cooked in front of you great falafel. nice setting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good burritos but dont know why the outside of the burritos are always cold to the touch, i guess thats how people have gotten to know them and like it that way but i find it odd  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't think I give this place enough credit. Excellent pizza by the slice, fast service, friendly people. Plus, the slices are a great deal. When you're looking for a casual bite, go here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Much better donuts that Voodoo. These are so fresh and fruit forward they pop in your mouth. Simply outstanding  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid Thai food. I like the curries and the cashew fried rice. It's always busy during dinner, but it's very quick service. I do think some of the dishes run a tad more expensive than other Thai places, but it's well worth it because of the consistency.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for a haircut short waiting time always a good cut. Even when I travel Great Clips will be the place for a cut.  [END]
[BEGIN] You have to be in the mood to stand in line but that's just an opportunity to build some serious hunger that will not be disappointed by the flavours & decent portions. Everything on the menu is great. If ur really hungry end with a waffle; yummo  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes please! The only problem is which cupcake to choose which means I often end up eating two cupcakes. The lemon is always a good bet. Perhaps a little over-priced and too bad they're not open more often.  [END]
[BEGIN] Better than Wal-Mart! Decent store, good staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, but a little pricey. They should offer free plain rice with entree, rather than forcing someone to buy something from "rice & noodles" section.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful flavors and presentation. Very comfortable and great service. And, loving the flights.  [END]
[BEGIN] Place is legit. With over 300 hundred reviews I don't think I can say anything useful other than give my nod. We went on a Friday night with over 10 people and the staff was very nice and accommodating. Food was on point.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place for brreakfast. They play great reggae music. It is a chill yet packed environment. I only gave it 4 stars because I always have to wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went in today and had an amazing breakfast burrito it was something like I would make for myself very good size and awesome taste. I also had the new york cheese cake and its like no other I recommend trying this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good and many choices for the adults and kids. Walking everyday thru the Disney parks leaves you hungry and this is a good value!  [END]
[BEGIN] Best wings in the city, sit in the bar; great TV placement. Good place to see Falcons game.  [END]
[BEGIN] Open!!!! Yay!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice astmosphere, very good Turkish waiter. Only had an entree dinner of chicken kabobs and dinner mate had the Salmon. Both dishes were very good and reasonable pricing for a downtown restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] GREAT menu for a large food selection. We had pollo chipotle and tacos el pastor and they were both delicious! As everyone has already mentioned, if you are a fan of margs, you MUST get the avocado margarita. It's creamy & you will love it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow, there are some very long reviews of this place, so I'll keep it simple. Great food, friendly upbeat atmosphere, reasonably priced - I'll be back for sure!  [END]
[BEGIN] Every time I come here it's so good. I love their burgers. The service is good. No complaints. I love their sweet potato fries with camp fire sauce. I always crave this place. The fries are bottomless! Today till whenever there are bottomless rootbeer floats as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service... smiles right back at that teenage boy server who asked me every five minutes if I needed anything else ;) Delicious food. Would go back any time I'm in Union Sq. again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap eats and friendly staff! This place isn't fancy, the decor is very tacky and None of the dishes match. HOWEVER ... Cheap good eats with friendly people is truly the root of a greasy spoon. $3.99 breakfast. Many things to choose from. Eggs to Chinese food. Try it out.  [END]
[BEGIN] We've gotten takeout from Carmela's multiple times and it's been good each time. They had quite a bit of business this Friday evening and appear to be handling it. We appreciate their location and good food.  [END]
[BEGIN] If I'm going to be naughty and have a burger, this is the place I go. I like to add mushrooms. The dining space doesn't have a lot of personality, but I usually use the drive through anyway.  [END]
[BEGIN] best pineapple fried rice and thai ice tea!!  [END]
[BEGIN] it's so hard to find a casual and laid back cafe in portland that has vegan options. this place is perfect. the only thing i wish is that they would have plain cream cheese instead of the flavored they offer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty decent. I was surprised. Kid out front working under the tent was super helpful! Get that dude some water!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great brick oven pizza. This is a small 10 table restaurant with great salads and lots of choices on pizza toppings. The wine is resonable and the atmosphere is cozy. Take note, they are not open on Sundays.  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried the ginger ice cream and thought it was delicious. The flavor was not overpowering, just slightly spicy. The ice cream is rich and creamy and had tiny flecks of chocolate. yummy!  [END]
[BEGIN] One dude who makes great sandwiches. Really simple ingredients, combined in interesting ways to make some of the best sandwiches in the city. Relatively new place but became very popular very quickly. Rightfully so.  [END]
[BEGIN] Always friendly staff. Clean seating areas. Beautiful sunshine. What else could you ask for at an airport  [END]
[BEGIN] Affordable, tons of toppings, even have recipes posted up on the best fro yo flavors/toppings. Nice little joint.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stopped here for a quick meal during a conference. Delicious food, quick service. Their chili salmon salad makes a great healthy lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best coffee shops to work from! Close to tufts and has a good atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] So yum, I had the Brioche French toast and a hot chocolate. Both delicious and the marionberry jam was so good too.  [END]
[BEGIN] These are the same folks as the South Boston Animal Hospital, meaning a second facility may be open if the first is closed. It's really convenient from the T at the Orient Heights stop. The staff is incredibly good with my Pug, especially Allan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to order ahead and get something to go. The small interior isn't conducive to eating there. The outstanding Mediterranean Salad, and decent quality slices keep me coming back for to-go orders.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love Ipnosi for trendy dresses and cute tops. Fun selection and fantastic prices. I wouldn't say it tends to be the best quality clothes, but perfect for trendy items. Fun selection of jewelry and accessories too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. We had the brisket and it was excellent. The BB King all star band made it a fantastic experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quick service & fun flavors. Great to grab a treat if you are in the area, but parking is hell.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is really cute! It's a nice bakery with some seating available. I loved the interior with white walls and white tiles. I came here to try butter tarts since they are a Canadian favorite! They were delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't get some of the reviews. Love this place...come here twice a year from New York. Great Clam Chowder, cod with fries, seafood caesar salad. Granville beers on tap for $6. Small family business. Take Bus 50 to Granville Island. A fan  [END]
[BEGIN] This bar exemplifys Portland. Quriky, odd, pinballmachines. Its in an ardoable old storybook house c1930. dimly lit and with friendly bartenders, its a dive bar with an slightly jaunty tip to its hat. Lots ofof "regualrs" and a good selection of local and national beers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved their slushy drinks! Happy hour food portions were awesome! Environment was chill.  [END]
[BEGIN] 5 stars for the donuts. The buttermilk old fashioned may be my favorite donut on earth. Knock them a star for the high prices, but do appreciate their focus on local, fresh ingredients.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good food from a unique (for Columbus) menu. I think sweetbreads were on the menu. Beer is just ok. The imperial stout was good but three other variants were mediocre.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was pretty delicious! Service was a bit slow, especially since we were the only ones in the restaurant,but the food was on point!  [END]
[BEGIN] Super cute spot with really yummy food. Easy to get a table mid week. Cute ambiance great for a date or family outing. Vaulted ceilings and a vintage touch. I recommend getting a mimosa and any one of their fabulous crepes. Parking is really the only issue.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn't want to spend a lot for new year eve party, every where charge an arm and a leg just for entry. Luckily, we found this place. We got the most for our bucks. It's clean, good music and the best staff. I definitely return here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent morning stop for breakfast sandwiches and coffee right across the street from the North Church in Little Italy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Damn good fish-n-chips shop. Also had hella good chowder and the server (I think she was the manager/owner) was VERY friendly. Would recommend this place to anybody. Nice, casual, fast service. If it's chilly outside and your stomach is empty, go here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Always decently crowded, but the food comes out pretty quick. My favorites are the ravioli, roasted chicken, and the veal sandwich.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good burgers. Really good service. A little pricey for what you get.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't ask for extra spicy! I can handle the heat however extra spicy was top-of-mouth scalding spice. Stick to their "mild, medium, hot" and you should be okay. Have had lots of things from here, great taste and family run. Would recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great ambiance and for the first time being here the food really hit the spot. Nice place, but there can be a wait, of course that's a good thing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious food and reasonably priced considering how pricey it is to dine in Vancouver. Gets crowded at lunch but really good food and lots of veg options for those of us who don't eat meat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took my bf on a date and we had an amazing time :) the environment was perfect! Burgers were amazing, fries delicious. Soco sweet tea I believe, is a must have summer drink!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good sushi with a fun experience. The food was good, the service was good and there were a lot of options to pick. The conveyor belt of sushi was a nice touch but the sushi wasn't anything special. Just a good generic sushi place.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have what I need (braiding hair) - even though they don't have much. They also have a wonderful selection of cost effective nail polish by the front. They don't take cards for purchases under $5.  [END]
[BEGIN] A regular stop to satisfy my sweet tooth. I love the flavors and wide selections of toppings.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a great menu, lots to choose from. Food was excellent. Highly recommend. Small dining area, but quaint, fast service.  [END]
[BEGIN] We hit up House of Dosas on the way home from work after seeing it packed every Monday ($5.99 special). Never had one before but it was awesome, fun to eat and left you at just the right amount of "full". Will definitely go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun. Fun. Fun. Order the magarita of your choice or your corona with lime and enjoy. Another place great to start a night, but you may find yourself not bothering to head elsewhere. Maybe they put something in the magaritas? Oh yeah, tequila.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great, fast, friendly service and an awesome burger. Just took off one star because of the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Owners responded to my review and apologized. I advised them to try harder to keep from running out of things. Their response is a good sign.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beef pad see yew and Crispy pad thai (when it's not overly sweet) are my favorite!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great views of Austin but not much of a hike, basically just walking up a few flights of stairs.  [END]
[BEGIN] King of Austin dive bars. Speaking as a musician, the venue's vibe is top notch. Rough that you've gotta bring your own crowd (it certainly isn't a late-night hotspot), but you also get to bring your own liquor. I dig it.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best Starbucks I've been too. Only downfall would be high customer volume.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for German food. It's a must go to place every time I'm in Columbus. The sausage goes great with beer!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice place with good value. Menu offers good choices, attentive wait service and decent ambiance. I save my five stars for the truly extraordinary, but this place provides an excellent family atmosphere with reasonable prices and a well presented meal. We enjoyed ourselves.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's all about the Avocado Margarita here. Sounds like an odd combo, but the creaminess adds so much and puts this off the charts. The food was fine, but the real star is the drink!  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and daughters love this place as much as I do. Boneless wings are our favorite, but so is the honey BBQ chicken salad. It is very noisy so you can't have team meetings here. It is a favorite place to go and watch your favorite games.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good ramen. Solid inhouse noodles and great and flavorful broth. The add ones are great. I normally don't eat ramens or Pho until winter but this is the exception.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything was cooked to hell and back but the place was so much fun I didn't care. This may become a yearly destination in conjunction with attending the Florida Tow Show.  [END]
[BEGIN] Breakfast is there forte. Get the pancakes. They taste like cake. They have a bear to take pictures with. Good clean family fun.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a cool club. My friend knew security and we were able to skip the long line outside. The sections inside are nice. The dance floor was packed, the music was good, and the people were nice. We stayed until they closed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still one of best places to eat for lunch. Food is great, service is decent and the price is reasonable. Pad Won Sen is good to try.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very Good donuts, not the best, but very good! The best part is their $10 bucket of the day old ones.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their pizza is sooooooooooo good and in my opinion their cannolis are better than Mike's Pastry. So if you don't want to wait hours in line for Mike's cannolis, please do not hesitate to stop by this little gem, it is well worth it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Best happy hour in town. Best gluten free crust wood fired pizzas I've ever had. Located in north boulder.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very friendly and efficient service with very tasty food and a bonus there is a lady who will make cute balloon animals for the little ones here (tip her kindly). We really enjoyed it and we came back more than once. Best Denny's ever!  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious! The Quinoa salad was good, would have been a bit better with a bit more pine nuts. And the linguine and swordfish were outstanding!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not too many Chinese food restaurants near my house. This one is the better of the two. I always get the chicken and broccoli. It's been a hit 2/3 times. Flavorful. Yum  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff. Opens late and I think they have the best froyo compared to Qoola & Menchies. I got the chai latte without the almond slices and it tastes really good. Not much chai flavour though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Would be 5 stars if they had free wifi. Great coffee, great tea, great food, great atmosphere and service. They're a little expensive, but definitely deliver on what you pay for.  [END]
[BEGIN] The people were very nice and helpful. The service was good. I recommend them for the price. It was clean and the staff made you feel welcome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Who doesn't like a big beer selection. Over priced? Maybe Over Kill? Yes Over It? Nahhh.. It is what it is, lots of beer and decent pub food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good lunch spot. Have good salads such as grilled chicken, steak tips, etc. The new pizza is MUCH better than the old greek pan pizza. Crispy thin crust.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best place to hear EDM/House Music in Austin. One of the best club speaker systems I have ever heard in my life. Inside is actually smaller then you would think but its done well. If you're into House Music, then it's a must.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place did a great job cutting my little dog came out just the way I wanted. Will be back when I'm around in town with the little one thanks Charles and the Blonde hair female groomer sorry didn't get her name  [END]
[BEGIN] The world would be a better place with more Live Oak Markets. Killer craft beer and local snack selection. I got a turkey reuben and a grilled cheese. I'll be back for some scratch breakfast tacos.  [END]
[BEGIN] Eating healthy I had the turkey burger it was great. No fries and water w lemon. #JackLimeTeam had a great time. #Anchorman2  [END]
[BEGIN] great authentic chinese food! lomein was bomb!! def will try this place again next time i'm in town  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food and atmosphere. My mother and I enjoyed our food and drinks and highly recommend it. A lot of food so if you are thinking of sharing do so!  [END]
[BEGIN] Brown rice only, which is not as bad as it sounds. It's soft and tasty and you can't tell the difference. Prices are not great anymore. But their quality is good. So it's still a decent value. Do not go in a big group, max seating is like 18 people.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizzas not too shabby, plus you can get any 2 slices (they're huge) + a drink for $6.75... Enough to split with a person. Cheap but good... And pizza by the slice is usually that price for 1.. Waaabaaam  [END]
[BEGIN] They really give you your money's worth for the drinks. The plates are very small portions,even for a fancy place. Ambiance was nice, my husband loved the salmon.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ate lunch here today with the family. Really cool location with a great atmosphere. Lots of tv's and the dining tables were also converted into foosball tables. Service was very attentive and pleasant. Food was solid!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very professional staff. Everyone was customer oriented and their waxing practices were very clean, hygienic. Miriam was a real pro. She made me feel comfortable and she did a good job.  [END]
[BEGIN] It tends to have lineups around 5:45 through 7:15. Still worth the wait, and they do serve Strongbow cider which is also awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service, intimate setting, good food, and large portions. Though there are other places that are closer, this one is definitely worth the trip. Nothing too fancy, but sometimes less is more. C is for (fortune) cookie and this one is for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very surprised, the food was excellent and the staff very polite. Be sure to come again with friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] What's not to love about this little shop? It's incredibly convenient, the owner is one of the friendliest people you'll ever meet, and you cannot beat the lunch special. Charming, tasty, convenient, affordable-- dig it.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I had the business lunch special which was 6.49 with a drink. This included three different meats, rice, salad, pita and a drink. Great food, generous portions, good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Being a fan of Dinh Ho BBQ off of Lamar, this place was the same...great! You can find the same food at both places.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time back since the days of Paul's. Beautiful view. Completely updated. Clean. Alene and other staff provided great service. Food quality and portions good value. Brought back many memories from the days of Paul's. Thank you. Wife and I will be back soon. Frank & Estelle  [END]
[BEGIN] went here with no reservations on a tuesday and had to wait 45 minutes but was worth it. food is fresh and good and nice presentation. good service. may be a little overpriced for the portion sizes but other then that a good restaurant  [END]
[BEGIN] Best coffee I've had. Good down home breakfast. Early Sunday morning no crowd. Diner type seating with 8 tables. Waiter service is pleasant and quick. A neighborhood stable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty decent seafood compared to a couple in the neighborhood. I expected the soba noodle to be the cold ones but it came as hot soup soba. It wasn't bad just not what I expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good breakfast food. More on the expensive side. Not too bad of a wait for a Saturday morning brunch either. And the portions are huge!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service, great fried oysters and aguachile was great but not super spicy. I would go back it's heaven for seafood lovers. We didn't realize that they had specials and that you can build your own seafood tower which looked amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] They do a decent job with my shirts. I've had shoes re-soled here and they came back brand new. I've also had alterations done, which were done perfectly. The drive thru is a nice touch as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Get in, get out, get good coffee. I recommend the Toddy SS or the Flash brew. Really simple coffee bar with everything you could want and open good hours  [END]
[BEGIN] Good twist on tacos, good seating and fast service. A little proud of their food in terms of price but you're paying the Domain premium, so caveat emptor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for a conference. The staff were friendly and helpful. Specifically, I would like to commend the housekeeping staff. They were able to accomodate our request and made sure our rooms were fresh and clean during our entire stay!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered from here on justeat.ca. The BBQ pork salad rolls were SO yum!!! Next time I'm craving vietnamese I'm definitely going to go there and can't wait to try their other foods!  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a great experience here! Everything taste great! Our waiter was fun and knowledgeable. I had the spicy miso ramen my friends had the level 3 spicy ramen. Beware! It's hot. I would come back  [END]
[BEGIN] We looked at a lot of interesting furniture and lamps, one ceiling lamp was made of gold wire and flat shells...made in the Philippines and done very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the Mad Italian. They cheesesteaks are very good and the atmosphere is very comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time trying hot pot, great ingredients and choices.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very delicious but they didnt have any vegetarian options. I wish I knew that before I took my vegetarian mother with me. Otherwise, very delicious food but the ambiance is definitely lacking, more of a hole in the wall type of place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Live in N Austin and have had some real good meals (mostly lunches) there. Staff is a friendly as most places. I bumped it up one star mainly 'cause of the bands that play there. Some real good quality music most every weekend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Such good thai food. There was a $20 minimum for delivery, so I was able to sample quite a few things. Veggie spring rolls, green curry, and sticky rice were amazing. The only drawback was that they forgot my coke, but otherwise, the food was amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to go to Ruby's every week when I lived around the corner. They really do a nice job on manicures and pedicures. I've found that their manicures last longer than most. They are very friendly and have pretty good prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the best dive bar in NE Portland. The build your own burger menu is expansive, but not expensive. The food is surprisingly super good. I would have given it 5 stars except you have to order and pre-pay at the bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] All southern food is NOT SOUL FOOD but this is the SPOT! Absolutely delish! This is my 2nd visit and it was consist! Get there early or be prepared to wait! The food brings the masses from all ethnicities, socioeconomic and professional backgrounds! AMEN to SOUL FOOD!  [END]
[BEGIN] When in Austin I try to hit this place as much as poss. I love Pho, and everywhere I go I see what's up. And while it's not as good as Pho Ca Dao back home, it's up there. The egg rolls are boink and the pho is bing-bong, Hellllllllo!  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap soups & noodles & always a good choice. I love this place. Not a fancy night out, but always good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best black 'n bleu cheese burger I ever did have! Cozy too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place! Best Chinese we have food in Columbus and they deliver, huge bonus. Their servings are good sized as well, they are just a bit expensive hence the 4 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good stuff. Love the atmosphere. I think waiting in line is part of the fun, kind of. Food is great. Highly recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] BEST. FRENCH. TOAST. EVER! A friend recommended it to me when I visited from Cali last week and I loved every bite of it...  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great choice if you feel like something a bit more upscale, and if you go for happy hour ($2 off drinks and $4 off appetizers) it won't be as painful to your wallet. Loved the Rotisserie Chicken Flatbread and the white and fuchsia swirled Huckleberry Margarita.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent Neapolitan pizzas, nice wine selection and cozy brick-and-beam interior. A Davis Square gem.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great fresh squeezed orange juice and eggs Benedict. This is one of those restaurants that is best to go to on a weekday though because it usually has a long wait. Nice hometown feel that is cozy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent Mexican! The guacamole is very good as well as the Chili Releno and Steak Burrito. The Tres Leche Cake is the best anywhere, big enough to share.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing flavors, easy location (walking or driving), and coffee to die for too (if that's your thing).  [END]
[BEGIN] The cannoli is delicious! The coconut macaroon is delicious! The mini cheesecake wasn't special but I will definitely be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good flavors on the soups and rice plate, and I'm VERY impressed at the fact they use short grained quality rice. This is one of the few times I saw a fast-paced Asian restaurant use the more expensive rice, it makes the experience so much more better!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic pizza. The service was wonderful Deven did a great job. Unfortunately he was the only waiter so the pizza did arrive a little cool to my taste so hence the 4 not 5 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good prices for quality produce and for finding items to make your Mexican recipes.  [END]
[BEGIN] No more hanger steak but still the best tapas in town (outside of their sister location in Buckhead). I recently enjoyed their new mushroom, buttom mushrooms with almost a bitter sauce...not my fav. The salmon & spinach was perfectly cooked! Desserts & atmosphere...a gem in perimeter mall area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped by for lunch and had their cranberry & apple salad. Yummy!!! I like that they grill their chickens without extra oil - I hate when it is greasy. I am definitely going back for more!  [END]
[BEGIN] Parish is a good place with a nice selection of creative (and very large sandwiches) as well as a good craft beer selection. I had "The Benny" which I thought was excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely a tasty surprise!!! But would definitely recommend if you happen to be in Vancouver BC and want something different.! Get ready to wait at least 30 minutes though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome view...it was on my BF list to do and I have to say I'm glad we made it. Enjoyed our time on it!!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's good food, nice people, just priced too high for my personal liking. Small fancy portions if that's your thing  [END]
[BEGIN] Good sandwhiches and a first glass beer and wine selection. Really if you are a beer geek and want a great selection of beers from around the world, you have to check this place out...  [END]
[BEGIN] For lobby and bar only- lovely Midcentury decor, great service and drinks at the bar. Lose the pumped in Drakkar Noir fragrance and I'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] This location brings back memories! Love the ice cream here - the dipped or sprinkle cones are so yummy :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Lose the hipsters and this place would be 5 stars. Lose the beautiful waitresses and maybe 3 stars. Ah, I guess you can't have one without the other! Happy hour menu is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super cheap sushi and food! Service is also very good, my green tea was always kept full! We could not believe how reasonable and cheap the prices were! Such a bargain! We went here twice in our week vacation!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great fresh tasting sushi. We tried a variety of appetizers, rolls and sashimi and enjoyed everything. The king salmon sashimi was a little on the expensive side but worth it. The sushi rolls we well prepared, fresh and delicious. Our server was wonderful, attentive and friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very very good! 20% off for sitting at the bar and service was great. Heavenly hash, migas, omlettee and gumbo was all super yummy. Def go here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Consistently the best wings in town. Drinks may be a little expensive so ask for the specials. Lots of TVs so you won't miss the game.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the margaritas on their drink menu was divine! Also had the Primetime and the Nutella and chocolate pretzel shake, Amazing! Now waiting in line for 2 hours? Not so great..  [END]
[BEGIN] Best pizza around. Woman who takes orders could be less argumentative and more pleasant. I have held off on writing this, but her attitude is a turn off. Going to look for a place where business is welcomed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great southern food ! Casual and easy going. Note there is no table service you order at the counter and then carry your food to the table. The carrot cake is amazing ! Best I've ever had  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was amazing. Loved the desserts. This place has a good ambience but can get a little noisy coz of big groups.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, fun ambiance, great service. Maybe a better brunch selection would be good...but otherwise it's great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pizza and awesome beer selection!! Servers were super friendly and helpful as well. We had the Gouda chicken pizza (which was suggestion by the bartender) and it was excellent. Not to mention they had Columbus Brewing CO's Bohdi on tap! I will definitely stop in again!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] ****WARNING**** Yelp lists this as a "restaurant" that's "open til 11:30". Nope. Went there at 10:15 and food operations were closed. Yelp, how about some nuance instead of sending me to the wrong place? 4 stars as it seemed fine and it's not their fault that Yelp wasted my time.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've gone here a few times. Good local sports bar with a fun crowd. The food can be a little pricey but it's usually good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love burgers but man its freezing in here. Turn on the heat. Can't beat veras cheap lol  [END]
[BEGIN] Well, I went in and was disappointed with the dried out nachos. A very gay friendly sports bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is my favourite breakfast restaurant, I usually get great service with the exception of one waitress who got my order wrong a few times, but otherwise they are great and the food is so yummy! I prefer this location over all the others.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is amazing! The perfect amount of veggies and meat. The bread is toasted on the inside but still soft on the outside. I'd definitely come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've ordered from this place a couple of times from Ubereats. Thus, I can't comment on the atmosphere of the restaurant. I've had the barbecue salmon with grits and the Mexican street corn. I would recommend them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to eat German food and drink German beer, and it won't make a hole in your wallet. The only thing negative is the neighborhood. If your dinning here at night, please be aware of your surroundings.  [END]
[BEGIN] This has a really cute interior design. The restaurant is a bit smaller than expected, but still spacious. The food was good! I didn't think it would be totally Americanized, but still good. I would come back here again!  [END]
[BEGIN] UPDATE: Cat offered a complimentary massage because of the previous mix up. I go there for Sydney. She's very knowledgeable and gives a great massage. I'm an athlete, and so I get the deep tissue and myofascial release massage (the painful kind) which Sydney excels at.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great date place. Plenty of trendy bars in the area to get your date hammered after dinner. But seriously, the food is good. Big wine list and an interested cocktail selection.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food and great service. They keep the coffee coming. Only complaint was toast was hard.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality service with a smile but far from a bargain. I highly recommend this place for its stellar service!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ruth's Chris can be hit or miss - this one was pretty good. We eat at the bar and usually split a meal. The service was good as was all the food. I would recommend this location. As good as it is I think they are a little over priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't get what everyone's complaining about. I've been here a thousand times, and yeah, I've gotten 2 or 3 things I didn't like, but: 1. The salsa isn't watery at all. 2. The chilaquiles aren't bland or messed up. 3. The chips are always salted, and never stale.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good parontay, great Chana Puri, wicked aalo tikki, the laasi is also delicious great place for vegetarian food  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice small nail shop. They do a pretty good job. All the employees seemed friendly & communicated nicely. Closest one to the house. I'll go back hopefully.  [END]
[BEGIN] Visited for brunch and it was very good. Best bloody mary I've had in Atlanta. The jazz band at brunch was awesome. I liked the decor and service was friendly. I would definitely go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really charming interior, but can get pretty noisy when it fills up.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ate outside, which was a lovely break from the noise inside. Had the gnocchi. Well prepared and not too heavy. Have been eating here for years, never disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] $5 movie Tuesdays, need I say more? The theatre is never crowded when I go, the quality of the screening doesn't falter and the bathrooms are (mostly) super clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good and tastey ! I'm not huge on the chicken 65, but the curries and dosas were a hit. And the sauces ! Chicken Britain was also good but not the top on my list of what we ordered. Eggplant and cauliflower dosas for the win  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the use of ingredients and combination of flavors Outdoor seating in nice EDM music was loud but I am a fan so it didn't bother me The smoke from the smoker was wonderful to me :) Will be back  [END]
[BEGIN] This is one of the best sex shops in Portland. Although they have a limited selection of toys, they have a large selection of specialty clothing and lingerie. I'd say Spartacus ranks right up there with SheBop, and I'd recommend it before sending someone to Fantasy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Eating an El Cubano sandwich from Live Oak Market with a Dogfish Head Immort Ale. A highly recommended combo for flavor insanity.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the Firecracker Shrimp appetizer as my meal. Really tasty! Good service. Party of six (4 adults 2 kids). Sat right away and Accommodated us by changing the TV to the game of our choice. Prices were in line with the caliber of food. Tavern Burger was a hit too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our family loves these two dentists! So, so many "extras" for our convenience and for them to show their appreciation; our family highly recommends Dr. Mo and Dr. Rima Saleh!  [END]
[BEGIN] I want to go back for the buffet!!! I like trying different foods, and this trip was no exception. I had the butter tea (definitely an acquired taste) and many other of their specialties. They are very friendly, and have books that you can browse about Tibet. Do it. YUM!  [END]
[BEGIN] Been to a couple shows here...always a hoot! Be sure to bring cash for beer...adds to the amusement factor :P Visit Count: 2  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy going and friendly staff but professional and prompt. Had good experiences with both purchases and a bike repair.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small but interesting restaurant with loads of character. The owner is social and has many interesting stories about his heritage if you are interested. Authentic Japanese and Jamaican food on one plate. Unexpected but welcoming.  [END]
[BEGIN] We went for Sunday lunch and we ordered three dishes each. We were quickly served and the tapas exceeded our expectations. The calamari fritas was especially well prepared. The cheese empenadas were light and delicious. Definitely coming back.( used groupon ).  [END]
[BEGIN] Busy location, but staff and baristas at this location always keeps line moving unlike the Assembly Row location. Place can be dirtier at times from the said busyness, but again, I've rarely had a bad experience here. I can't say enough about the efficiency of this location.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had higher expectations. On the other hand it helps to have a drink or two and run wild. It's a good idea for a larger group and make sure you eat before you get there.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was served super quickly. A great place to get in and out for lunch. Had the orange chicken (I don't know why more chinese restaurants don't serve it) and it was pretty good. Overall, I was satisfied and would return again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The prices aren't the same online as in the store. Their lemon pepper wings are too sour, I had to use like 4 dips for a 10 piece. Relax on the seasoning my guy. They have the best fries in Orlando, they're curly fries are a tad bit too oily.  [END]
[BEGIN] Coming soon to Davis square, seems to be a new location of the downtown Shino express. Yippee!  [END]
[BEGIN] They have snorkel fins whereas Dick's across the street does not. Excellent selection of snorkel gear and water shoes. I used the Yelp checkin discount for $10 off.  [END]
[BEGIN] I often pass this store coming from the street car going to the movies. I found a great little necklace there that I wear often. Lots of other nice, used things, and fun to browse.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good burger, good bar games, and good TV signal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good sea food. They have amazing melt-in-mouth scallion pancakes. We loved their spicy dishes. I wish the staff was more friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] We actually want to give a 31/2 stars but since it's unavailable, we picked 4 stars instead. Our food was delicious but service could be better. The host at the front door was a bit rude. Servers are nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went in to grab a cup of coffee. Ordered a medium latte made by Gaby. She was so sweet, great customer service to match the great cup of coffee. Will definitely be heading back to try other menu items.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not sure if any other reviewers have mentioned twitter. It is true that Dressew has no website, but they have someone amazing answering twitter questions - seemingly around the clock. @DressewSupply - seems to be working for them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here last night for a causal date night night. It wasn't too busy considering it was rainy and a Sunday night. Drinks are strong, service was pretty good, and food wasn't too bad. Their fried cheesecake is a must try. It's sooooo good!  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I stopped for lunch while out shopping. This our fist time at this location. It's much bigger than the location on Miami circle. We tried the chicken, salmon & spinach, Brussels sprout. Everything was really good. We've never had a bad meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had dinner here at loving hut last month. They served us soup to start with(its free) and then we ordered spring rolls, sweet& sour nuggets, black bean sauce curry.Everything is just yummiest ever and its all vegan and fresh. Good service and good food.  [END]
[BEGIN] No doubt about it...it's good eating! Favorite item is that delicious cornbread that's almost dessert. Go check 'em out and order the chicken and shrimp combo with the salad and cornbread. Enjoy!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is AWESOME. The food is good, the music is good, and the wait staffs are very friendly. Depends on which night you go, they have live music. It is loud enough to listen and not too loud that would interference with your conversation. Love this place!  [END]
[BEGIN] beautiful girls not alot if fake plastic big tits like Miami it was nice to see REAL GIRLS. had a blast the drinks are weak bt the staff friendly and it was nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's true what other viewer say about wearing PJ. The place is decent and there was definitely a line on Sunday at around 11am. 1 egg, ham, home fries and toast $5. They also have oreo pancake. Coffee is decent. Omelet is huge. ~$8-10 Overall, good food and good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm not a fan of fusion food. But Minero's southern style mexican food is pretty good stuff. I enjoyed the hoppin' john burrito.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would give it four stars. The food is amazing however a bit expensive. Craft cocktails and a great atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] This store has a large selection of quality dog and cat foods. Many brands are available that are hard to find at other area stores. If your pet requires a speciality diet there are many options available including dry, wet and raw. The owner is knowledgeable about her product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price for a nice sushi, sashimi, and kitchen menu. We had salad, shrimp tempura, several rolls, sushi and sashimi plus dessert. The total for 2 was $45. Not bad at all for the selections offered. Food was nicely presented and service was prompt and efficient.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good beer, good food, good service, cool atmosphere. They didn't mind making room for a single and a kindle.  [END]
[BEGIN] 2nd time here in 3 months (i think). Their menu changes occasionally. I had the fish this time and it was great but wasn't enough to satisfy me. I meant it was small. Would've liked it better if it was bigger.  [END]
[BEGIN] I take the family here whenever they are in town for a good breakfast. The pork chops and hashbrowns are exceptional and the coffee always hits the spot. One of the best breakfast spots in Midtown Atlanta.  [END]
[BEGIN] The salad bar and fruit are great!! So fresh and delicious! Only bad thing is I think I got some bad candy from them :p  [END]
[BEGIN] Try the Korean lunchbox great way to experience a wide variety of different Korean dishes By far the beef was the best but the spicy pork was also very good  [END]
[BEGIN] Right off of exit 41 on Route 128 this sandwich joint sports several tables and all around good food. Their staff is very friendly and the portions generous. If going with a friend split an order of french fries as they usually run on the large side.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow! What a selection! I took a tile that was 15 years old and they matched it!! I'll be back to do my backsplash. Nice and helpful folks!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Save room for Tres Leches. Alot of room. So good... Good food, thought the guac was ok, not best in town. The Elvis fried chicken is killer. Crispy, spicy, add some boom boom sauce. Done. They can turn tables fast, because the wait was the only thing preventing 5 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] delicious, I love, the ham and cheese, but I always get a sweet and one savory, the banana Nutella is amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] This restaurant is in a great little spot and they have excellent food! I got the shrimp teriyaki for lunch and it was heavenly! The teriyaki had the perfect spice to it and the prices were spot on as well. I can't wait I go back with my husband!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love how they renovated the place! The service was very friendly and attentive, the quality and portions of the food were great, and the flan was *amazing*. We'll definitely be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Always good service and flavor. The owners are constantly supervising every little detail.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, good service! Nice little place. Friendly and clean. Consistent ly good... Try the Spicy Tuna Roll... Yum!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food and even some options for vegetarians-- like the portabello arepas which are listed as appetizers but are big enough for an entrée. Service can be a bit hit and miss and they don't take reservations so not good for big groups.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fried chicken is spot on! It's so juicy and tender with crispy flavorful skin/batter. The sides are okay, not the greatest. We also shared the buttermilk pie which was quite tasty. I would go back time and again for chicken breasts!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Greek style pizza. No problems. Nice staff. The salads are also good. If you want a thin crust, this place isn't for you. If you like a more hearty pizza then this is what you are looking for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice guys, good service, very transparent and fair dealings. I've bought 2 cars from them and it's been a positive experience. The place has a nice family feel to it. Very satisfied.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stopped in here for a quick lunch. We went right as they opened and it was not busy at all. The pizza was good and satisfying. If you would like to hit a spot that is quick and filling, this spot is great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, clean, cheap and quick lunch, and decorated nice. Nice crispy chips and tasty salsa, reminiscent of Chili's. I chose the shrimp nachos for a weekday lunch. The half portion was very filling.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used Sunrail for jury duty in Orange County. This station is only one block from the courthouse. So much better than driving in Orlando rush hour traffic. I highly recommend this as an alternative to driving to jury duty if you live anywhere near a Sunrail station.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still a good burger, but the experience has started to slide. Lot's of signs with rules, limitations, etc. No more smiling server greeting you in line to get a drink order.  [END]
[BEGIN] I come here often since it's close to my campus. I love the eel rice combo very much! Dining environment is also good!  [END]
[BEGIN] I can't see my food in the dark.. but like the way the reflective light curls around Kate's face. The calamari app is a meal and thusly caused the global shortage of squid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Above average food and good prices. I also had a peach Mojito, which was pretty good. The staff is friendly and check in often. I'll be back to try what looked like fried icecream :D  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderfully tasty steaks and impeccable service. Au gratin potatoes weren't the best but the Lobster Mac n Cheese was phenomenal!  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband took me there to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. And, I LOVED it. We had the ahi tuna tartare, bacon wrapped jalapeño, crab cakes, fried calamari and paella as an entree. Everything was delicious. Highly recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] I am a fan of the Döner Fries. The fries were fried fresh and topped with thinly sliced beef. The perfect size to eat with fries. Then the whole thing is topped with a cream & brown sauce. Tasted pretty good. Overall: might return if in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good pho, and great location! Parking could be a pain but that's downtown Austin for ya... I used to go there for lunch all the time...  [END]
[BEGIN] I had their latte. It was a flat white, so you know the baristas definitely know what they are doing, they are well trained. The smoothest, creamiest, latte...ever! I'd come all the way back for this. Not a lot of seating space however.  [END]
[BEGIN] The counter girl is always helpful. They have a decent selection of blunt wraps, but not the best.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dania....is to furniture what Toyota is to automobiles A little bit of something for everyone: Stylish but not too trendy Quality but not too expensive Nice but not top of the line Safe and comfortable but not too boring not that I drive a Toyota or anything....  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the salmon entree & the blue cheese potato chips were excellent. Nice atmosphere & friendly service. I will return again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great menu, good atmosphere, lines are wayyyy too long for a burger though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank goodness for this place. There's just enough variety for each grilled cheese option that you'll be happy with no matter what what your order is. Sola AM is a great breakfast one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to grab a quick meal. The food is pretty good, service has always been great, prices are very reasonable. I usually get the salmon bento box... Very tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great drinks and service, food has strong flavor profiles. The Cuban Benedict with mustard hollandaise was perfect. I wish they had Diet Coke or fresh grapefruit juice but my mimosa was tasty. We came with a party of 10 and the service was exceptional.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good italian food. I got the short rib pasta and it was fantastic!  [END]
[BEGIN] Always good dining experience and fresh sushi. Recently had lunch there, great sushi, and speedy service during the lunch rush. Overall we've ordered sashimi, tuna kabachi, godzilla roll, katana roll, dynamite hamachi roll, and fried ice cream.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Silk Weaving Studio has a beautiful selection of silk products, from finished pieces to yarn. I choose two 100% silk skeins while I was there and am very excited to start knitting them. My only complaint was that it was a little pricey.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little bit of a wait, but the food was well worth it! I had the pork with red beans, yellow rice, and plantains. It was amazing! My boyfriend had the same but with yuca, the sauce on the yuca was soooo good! We were too full for dessert.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is great! I wasn't sure what to expect as it's a replacement of Bar-BQ-Bar but it's still the same great place with an awesome staff, cheap drinks and good vibe! Love it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Irresistible almond croissant and delicious cafe au lait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty darn good deal for inside Disney. $10 for a meat lovers pizza and caesar salad. Not a lot of meat on the pizza but it was decent. The 4 stars is based on location comparison and price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried the red velvet chicken and waffles and strawberry stuffed French toast. Both were great and delicious. The waffle didn't taste like red velvet but, the chicken was seasoned to perfection!! I think I may have to tell my mom I found someone that makes chicken better than her!  [END]
[BEGIN] They make a pretty decent New York style pizza here. Get the Classic Pizza with the one sauce I think it's the best.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been there twice now. Great food and service in the bar area. You can watch sports in there also.  [END]
[BEGIN] The yogurt wars continue. After trying samples, settled on the taro, cheesecake, and blueberry. Yummy stuff that will run you around five bucks. Do enjoy.  [END]
[BEGIN] great kept-cold cupcakes. love the lemon blueberry, any chocolate variety , + red velvet. random mixed cereal rice krispie treats are fun, ex. the ones plus fruity pebbles.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great, reliable spot in a convenient location. Reasonable prices and consistent service. The menu is big enough to find something whatever mood you're in and small enough to not seem intimidating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great ramen and great price! I got a level 3 spice which was way too hot! I love spicy food so be careful. But I couldn't stop eating it, it was too delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great little place with authentic Turkish food. Having grown up in Europe this place is very reminiscent of quaint restaurants in cute little towns. Love it here  [END]
[BEGIN] Went back for lunch. Yep, it's definitely our new lunchspot. The shio ramen with pressed sushi (mackarel) was SO FREAKIN GOOD! Oh mah gah. I love. I love. Never going back for dinner (too many people go). Only lunch. It's more than enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] My favorite fried chicken spot in Austin. Crispy, flavorful and moist chicken I've tried just about all the sides, all good! I recommend to friends and family whenever they come to town. Worth the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice Korean food that you would expect only from an unknown aisle in Seoul. Great experience and very friendly staff. Will definitely go back for more authentic korean food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizza was really really good!!!! Clam chowder was good as well. The service though was amazing!!!!!! That alone makes me want to head back. I had the fish and it was ok.. I would definitely return and order something else from their menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's my first time come here and I absolutely love here! I ordered the Magic Mushroom, the sauce, cheese is so great. Not a favor of meat.  [END]
[BEGIN] When I first moved to North Austin, I didn't know where to get my hole-in-the-wall Mexican breakfasts that I so desperately need on the weekends. Truth be told, I do miss Habenero, but I really like Los Jaliscienses for its convenient location, value, immediate seating, and gut-splitting breakfast plates.  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought the pho here was pretty decent. I enjoyed their flavorful broth however, I thought the noodles were a bit overcooked. I regret not trying the fried rice since that was recommended by a couple of people who have been here.  [END]
[BEGIN] My favorite Ethiopian restaurant in Atlanta. They have the best customer service and the food is not only delicious but affordable also  [END]
[BEGIN] After a loooong wait, perfectly prepared fried chicken with tasty greens, best in class mac n cheese, delish corn muffins and above average additional sides. Lemonade not from scratch and service a little hot and cold. Would definitely return, but probably for pickup.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been visiting Rimsky-Korsakoffee for 22 years. It hasn't changed much. The service can be iffy but the atmosphere is vey "Portland" and the coffee and desserts are tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good breakfast for a reasonable price...clean and great service...both Columbus and Phoenix locations have treated me well!  [END]
[BEGIN] $2.50 pints of great Oregon beers! My server helped me choose one I liked with descriptions and free samples. The gnocchi was tasty, but a little too oily. Sat with my laptop and a book for an hour and a half without being bothered. Will definitely return!  [END]
[BEGIN] As a barbecue aficionado it makes me happy to have a top 3 BBQ joint right around the corner from work. Service can be hit or miss, but the food is always killer. Brisket is my fave, ribs are always awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a grisselly piece of meat and our waiter Rick took care of it, brought a perfect filet and treated me to a birthday desert. If you've never been go. This place is great get the filet and the sweet potatoes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing time with the kids. I also jumped and felt like I lost a pound or two.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm a picky eater and this was my first time trying Tibetan food, but I loved it and have come back a few times since. I tried momo, spicy chicken masala, spicy beed shapta, and shamday.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good ramen! Would give 5 stars if not for the cash only and the usual wait required to get a seat. However I've seen people order it out so I might have to try it!  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was great. We had the chorizo omelette with guacamole and salsa, the peach waffle and a cinnamon roll. Service was a little slow, but they were packed when we went. The staff were all very friendly and nice. Great place for breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food here was quite good. Got sushi to start - fresh and delicious. Pad Thai was great, as was the Kim Chi fried rice. We'll go back!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was great! Fresh fast and really tasty. They take pride in their service and food! Amazing customer service tell them Pink sent you!!#  [END]
[BEGIN] Historic, fun pub with good, hearty food as well as light salads, and good beer. Live music occasionally. A fun place to hang out and enjoy the scenery. Definitely a great place to take visiting friends or relatives.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had lunch with family last weekend We order 4 different dishes including appetizers. Everything was delicious, portion of the food is so big. Good for sharing. Service was really good. Cute decor ..  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice new restaurant, you can still smell the newness of the paint! Very fresh bowl that leaves you wanting more!  [END]
[BEGIN] Despite being in a food court, the authentic Chinese food is made in front of you and always tastes fresh. My only complaint is that it does take quite some for some of the food to come.  [END]
[BEGIN] A decent family style chinese restaurant with good sized portions. Nice modern interior and good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is decent. nice menu. Good atmosphere. Attractive waitresses. Probably could use better booths to eat in. You kind of sit right next to everyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Reasonable prices and great selection. Staff are always helpful and courteous. However, always busy and parking is a pain. The cheaper prices you pay here make up for the markets deficiencies.  [END]
[BEGIN] OYSTERS........ DROOOOOOL.... DELICIOUS. A FAN OF BL restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] Eeh...Just didn't enjoy so in order to not say anything Bad I'll just not elaborate further.  [END]
[BEGIN] The dim sum brunch was tasty. I want to try their dinner menu. It's a bit of a random part of Washington Street, but worth the hike.  [END]
[BEGIN] Visited on a Saturday noon. Wanted to eat some hot idlis but learnt there is only buffet on Weekend Lunches. So tried that. Its a little higher priced compared to other Indian resturants, but food was good. Like the chole chaat the best. Will visit again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place with very reasonable prices whether you drop off your laundry or do it yourself it is. It is never busy and they are open from 8 am till 9 or 10pm everyday. Very friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a delicious happy hour burger and pint for a good deal. Though I don't think yelp had their hours accurate. Tasty pub fare and good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great place for Indian food in JP. I personally like Ghazal Indian Cuisine a bit better. But these guys come in a close second in food. The environment is clean, staff is professional and kid friendly. Overall an very good experience. I have been here 3 times.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their breakfast tacos are a hidden gem for those of us who work nearby. Much less greasy than the others in the immediate area, and great bargain. Their underground dining area reminds me of Old Austin, may it live forever.  [END]
[BEGIN] Veg Dumplings where very yummy and fresh Chick satay was cooked Perfect Duck curry was very flavorful Beef macadamia with ginger was good But better mixed with curry sauce from duck  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent food. Very tiny restaurant. Kind of takes a long time for food to come out, but I think it's because there are only ever two people working. Maybe a husband and wife duo? Still worth a try.  [END]
[BEGIN] Being from NY, this really is NY style pizza! Hard to find anywhere else in the country, but these guys do an amazing job and it's served with a smile... service was great. Wine options were limited but surprisingly good. Atmosphere is noisy and family friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very tasty. Love the scallion pancakes, they are light and crispy. The prices are very reasonable and they have a great variety of dishes that are fresh. The restaurant is neat and clean. You can sit in and eat, and the food comes out quickly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic food and great service. There is a huge variety, including several different kinds of sushi. It's all noticeably fresh. Dishes range from chicken to seafood; there's something for everyone, including those picky eaters who don't like much in the way of Asian food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Regular pizza shop in a strip mall. Regular menu, descent ingredients and professional staff. Good option for a local bite to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] El Porto is my friends' go-to restaurant in Sommerville, and I'm so glad that it is. Chile Adoboda - yes. Adoboda TACOS - where have you been all of my life?!?!?!?!? The ceviche appetizer was on point, the chips were abundant, and the service was warm and welcoming.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for a small brunch. Biscuits and gravy are killer. Grits are good too and the beignets are yummy sweet. I liked the Longmont Lucille's better, but this was still really good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kept it simple- Full rack of baby back with sweet potato fries. ($20.99) Good as a carnivore could want. A sure good eat'n bet. Split this meal with dbl fries (+$2) and w/ no add'l plate charge. Will be back for the build a burger next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Tex Mex...better than El Vaquero's. A little spicy but still good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I found this today at lunch. Very nice for lunch had salad very fresh. Had meatball sandwich(panni). Servers all seem to natives from Italy. Pace was good. Nice neighborhood restaurant. I would like to try other dishes before total review  [END]
[BEGIN] The jackson street is usually what I get and it is usually a lot to eat. I have had the fries once and they aren't bad. Best greek food in the area, much better than Greek Express.  [END]
[BEGIN] Always have a good time here, even though the employees aren't always the friendliest. The laser tag room is as close to paintball as laser tag can be  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Stuff Chicken Broc Alfredo is the best  [END]
[BEGIN] Chocolate bomb is just that-the bomb! Very creamy and smooth and the warm hot fudge only made it that much better! Very cool vibe with 80s music playing outside  [END]
[BEGIN] Good stuff. Their philly isn't so much life changing as some would have you believe as it just done perfectly. Been here a bunch and everything is good. Wings pasta lasagna philly and even their fries. Definitely worth your time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oh we really enjoyed breakfast at Sanborn's. We came here during the week so it was nice and quiet. Our waiter was very attentive and personable. It's a family run place. Father in law was in the back cooking. German style pancakes are so good!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Monkey Brains, Hawaiian Poke and rolls are all solid. I love the interesting sake menu and the great beer selection from Roscoe's. The space is clean and simply decorated, and the service is always fast and friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] My second time visiting this wine shop and again, was impressed. LOVE their charcuterie!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place. Hamhe Dot's burger is AWESOME. Loved every bite of it Dark inside has a feel of club, bar and cafe.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best fried shrimp,I had in a long time. The taste reminded me of Lundy's of Brooklyn .fast, polite quick service.  [END]
[BEGIN] clean and good selections.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good service and very convenient. They do a good job, are always on time and I've never had a problem with them.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here, food was good. Clam chowder was excellent & the value is good. Atmosphere is very fun. Server did not tell me daily specials as the other table over server did.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super friendly staff, and willing to help! I bank with an associated credit union, and I have never had any issues!  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a mani/pedi. Sonny did my manicure and he is great! Another woman did my pedicure but she seemed to be in a hurry. Overall, I was satisfied with my experience!  [END]
[BEGIN] Yum. Llano burger. Truffle fries. We have waited over an hour and for that reason we do not go there as often as I would like and why not five stars, but otherwise the burgers are great as is the service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there for Chinese New Year's dinner. It was my third time there.. I think it's becoming our default restaurant choice for Cantonese food in Vancouver, since it's close. I like the dessert and also food!  [END]
[BEGIN] Beef brisquet, 1/4 lean, 1/4 moist, 1/4 bbq turkey, Mac n cheese, peach cobbler, famous bbq sauce.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to get in and get coffee, I don't eat bagels any longer, but I still like the smell as I get coffee.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mango slush with the cubes on top is so bomb. It's a must get if you come across one of these cafes. It's a chain. I want to try the bubble waffles next time I visit Canada.  [END]
[BEGIN] These guys took on a MAJOR painting project for us. We are very particular, and want things done in a professional manner from start to finish. We made the right choice choosing DGP. And well use them again in the future. Thanks guys!  [END]
[BEGIN] It was nice to find a dim sum restaurant that opens at 8 am. Parking is plentiful in the public parking lot. Float validates an hour and half if you dine there. They had a good selection of food. The food came out hot. Portions were good sized.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went today - was freezing so sadly couldn't stay long. Lots of vendors selling treats... I'll do another visit some time and dress more warmly!  [END]
[BEGIN] Always like to stop for good food, lots of choices, & great service. Fun sports bar with all the extras  [END]
[BEGIN] the necessary pit stop before throwing an mit dorm party. get an adequately aged senior to escort a horde of lowerclassmen in, and the libby's staff won't bat an eyelash. as long as one person has an id to show, they're cool with anything. pretty standard liquor selection...  [END]
[BEGIN] One would be amazed to see a place run on fries, waffles and some sandwiches. This place does exactly that! Perfectly fried & seasoned fries, airy sweet waffles and both accompanied by yummy dipping sauces. Jalapeno-habanero, vampire slayer, salty caramel, their home made ketchup and mayo. Must must try!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have only been here for happy hour. Half price apps in the bar area! Samosas, mussels (yum), calamari, crab cakes and lots of other yumminess. They have a ginger infused vodka drink that I must try one of these days.  [END]
[BEGIN] I dragged a large group in for a meeting and we were able to scoot some tables together near the fire, drink some amazing beer and receive great service...followed by great music.  [END]
[BEGIN] great place for a drink. stop on buy. the tender is nice. A lot of heavy drinking though later in the night. not much else to add to the other reviews. bit cramped. small area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chiliean sea bass was excellent... Rest of meal was very good! Wait staff well trained and attentive! Nice time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place. Never have I enjoyed just noodles this much. Also, they have happy hour 4-7 and then a reverse happy hour starting at 8:30, and it has $4 sushi, so if you come for dinner you can get pretty good cheap sushi as an appetizer.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've enjoyed the food here the few times I dined here. The selection in the lunch buffet wasn't extensive and the price was a tad more than I typically like to pay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. Beautiful atmosphere. Some staff need to work on customer service. Doesn't hurt to smile sometimes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for burgers, wings and has an extensive beer selection. Mike is an awesome manager very welcoming and friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] We love the pizza and get the same thing every time a large cheese and a large 360 supreme. The staff is courteous and friendly. Highly recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really enjoyed their lunch buffet. Good variety of vegetarian and meat dishes, as well as variety among salads, soups, hot dishes, and light fruit desserts. I would agree with past reviewers that Tibetan food has flavors/dishes similar to Indian and Chinese (understandably) but still it's definitely distinct.  [END]
[BEGIN] one of the staples in boulder. fabulous space downtown on walnut st. you need reservations! sometimes you get lucky with a seat at the bar, but don't count on it. brunch, lunch, and dinner are all great. reminds me of balthazar in nyc.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little shop, super fun to browse. Anytime I need a gift for a girlfriend, guaranteed I'll find something perfect here. Fun jewelry and cute knick knacks. And it's perfect when I need a cute new purse for myself, too. :-) Their prices are surprisingly affordable.  [END]
[BEGIN] You really can't find better grits in Boston. The service is always great and the bloody marys are delicious. The best part of going to Johnny D's is the specials menu. Each time I go I order something different because the specials are always too delicious to turn down.  [END]
[BEGIN] love this place! really good pizza and probably one of the best meatball subs you can get. i'm picky when it comes to meatball subs and this place has one of the best.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped here for brunch 2 weeks ago. The huevos rancheros were some of the best I ever had!! Unusual and very tasty. We sat at the bar, as there were no tables, and the bartender was friendly and efficient.  [END]
[BEGIN] Even though the place is small and cramped the food was good. I ordered the Homemade corn beef hash with 2 eggs and fries and it was delicious. I would definitely go there again since it was so cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food. I got Chimichangas. They were really good. They do trivia too (on Thursdays I think).  [END]
[BEGIN] Missing male intact dockson dapple since 12-22-17 from Holland to. 2547217597 His name is Wally believe stolen!  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes, I'm a fan. They always do good. Keep in mind that SB has a hidden menu. Ask the people and see what else they have.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool spot! Great food, drinks, and service. Would be nice if they didn't charge to park in their parking lot, however there is free parking on nearby streets.  [END]
[BEGIN] Such a cute little place to go for a chill night. Decor is so modern, and the open windows really sets the mood. I haven't had the food here yet, I've only had their drinks and i think their drinks are great and reasonably priced!  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutly love this place. I took my wife and kids( 18, 16 & 12). Everyone loved the food and the music was awesome. I will be a regular once I move to Orlando in June.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was very pleased with this meal. The atmosphere was good, and the waitress was very nice. As for the meal, I thoroughly enjoyed the fajitas. It was a great experience, one in which I wish to have again the next time I am in Orlando.  [END]
[BEGIN] Michael reached out to me to follow-up on this and while my feelings about the food didn't change, but opinion on the service and the ownership is more positive. Will try them out again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really well priced, good service and good sushi! Can't say anything bad. Perfect for a quick lunch drop-in.  [END]
[BEGIN] My favorite dive bar. Amelia and Sherrie are great bartenders! Good drinks and decent food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent brunch menu and beer selection. My wife also loved the Bloody Mary she got. The biscuits and gravy are phenomenal and so is the pulled pork- better than any BBQ joint in Boston. Haven't been there for dinner but will absolutely try to go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best prices on quality chicken, cheeses, and most fresh produce in town. Small but great bakery goods section. The small store gets busy in late afternoons and there can be long lines with not enough staff; the only reason for a 4 not 5 star rating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their menu is pretty big and has a variety of options. Any fast food greasy option you can think of, they have. Their slices are pretty big and their service is real quick. Great late night option if you're in the downtown area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good atmosphere and good tea/coffee. I never tried their food but the menu looks good. I would love to go back for more. It's a bit slow service so this is not for a busy grab and go cafe.  [END]
[BEGIN] very clean looking place got take out though so didn't sit in. The Chicken in Garlic Sauce is OUTSTANDING!!!! has a little heat to it but the sauce is phenominal will go back for sure prices are comparable to other chinese takeout  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the fried chicken you deserve. Spicy and tasty. Flavorful. The sides leave a little to be desired, but the chicken is king.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is decent, and the location is perfect! It's right on Lake Eola, so it's great for a quick bite and drinks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Review based on service/drinks only. The staff was quick and friendly, pretty good beer and spirit selection. We got a house whiskey and club soda and an Allagash White beer. All in all good, was able to watch the game and see my gate while my flight was delayed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good food and love the ambiance. The customer service was great. I'd definetly go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ethiopian food experience was different. The staff and service was really good. We ordered lamb, chicken, fish. And all of their flavors were spicy and savory.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent brunch - try the poached eggs or sausage and spinach omelet Outside is great but the music was terrible - no one liked it and they weren't willing to change  [END]
[BEGIN] *Update* I was contacted by the owner (Paul R.) who was great. He not only apologized for the mistake, but he also appreciated the honesty in my post and took care of me to correct the issue.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice, sort of a hidden gem amongst salons in Portland. It's not swank like its "sister" salon, Dosha. However, the service is excellent and the staff is always very friendly, professional and I feel GREAT when I walk out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ali will take good care of you all for a very reasonable price. Been there twice and had a great experience each time. I've called for an appointment and they've accommodated same day each time. They also do drop in's. Definitely highly recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] Happy Hour was great and Jeremy was awesome. The food was delicious! Bosphorus is a little pricey, but amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Holy Wow Cow! This place is AWESOME!!! Great atmosphere and location. The beer is fantastic, the food is tasty, the staff is super friendly and the set up is adorable. I'm waking up with last nights leftovers but I'm already plotting my return!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Boyne is the perfect spot for a beer and a great meal. The chili is amazing! Great atmosphere..great staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Laurie did my hair, I am new to area and took a chance on this place. Very satisfied will definitely go back  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, consistent food and great service. Get reservations, no matter the time of day or day of week, this place is ALWAYS packed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The BBQ pork and BBQ chicken was delicioso. The coleslaw and BBQ beans were better than my husband's beans. The waitress was friendly and perfect with everything we ordered. We will return next year.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got the Pad Se Ew with chicken. The texture of chicken sometimes weirdos me out, but this chicken passed my test. The flavor was great. The wait staff was attentive. My boyfriend got something with white rice, veggies, and beef.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful and relaxing environment to match a beautiful and relaxing massage. This was my first time, and most definitely will not be my last. The massage therapist was knowledgeable and provided an excellent massage that was personal to my bodies needs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place. It is very specific in its support of fly fishing and shooting, but if you are looking for high quality and hard to find excellence for your outdoor hobbies this is a great place to do it!  [END]
[BEGIN] A friend recommended this as an anniversary spot, and I wasn't disappointed. As an app, the crepes were fantastic, and the entrees were pretty solid. The happy hour and brunch menus looked great, so we'll be back...  [END]
[BEGIN] Great stay. Very clean and friendly staff. Love the tv in the bathroom mirror. The rooms are spacious, the only negative is that their hallways are not decorated. Makes it feel not fancy as the rest of the place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love all of their cocktails, and I've never had anything that wasn't delicious. I don't like the menus to fill in, but honestly, the waiters always take our order, so it's never been much of an issue. The guacamole is really yummy.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great find on Yelp when we visited Austin last weekend! Came minutes before opening & people were pouring in when the doors opened. Great food & great service from everyone. Loved the fun atmosphere!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got off the plane and came to the pizza place with the highest reviews! Fun little joint with good pie. Not to greasy but just greasy enough. Excellent selection of toppings. The garlic knots were free with yelp checkin!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I highly recommend El Patron. The food was excellent the service was just as good and I couldn't have been happier. I wish I lived closer that way I could go back but until then 4 stars it is!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. I had dumplings with pork and beef noodle soup. And the beef was just perfect, but broth could use little bit more spice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food and service were excellent. For ten dollars a glass of house wine, the pour should have been a little more generous  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hot Gobbler. That's what I had on recommendation from staff. It was good, a decent size, and yes, it was spicy. Honestly, I stopped in because it is very close to class for me but I will definitely stop in again.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's your standard REI. Conveniently located off highway and near other stores. Clean, organized, well stocked.  [END]
[BEGIN] Paid $32 for a complete wash, and was happy with the results. I typically go to a MooMoo or some other automatic wash, but this is MUCH better because the "finishers" (guys who wipe down the car) get all the spots the machines missed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great seafood and a great location. Outdoor dining overlooking the harbor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good and consistent. I have been a few times and it's always been tasty. The service is usually a little slow but never rude. Good place for a casual dinner and a beer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent selection of interesting, tasty beers. The tasting room is pretty small, so don't bring a group here - best to go with 2-3 others. I haven't tried the food yet, but it looks great. Give the IPA a try!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, good prices. It's around $10 for HUGE burritos. It can get busy but waitstaff handles it graciously and does their best to expedite wait times. Staff is friendly and service is pretty quick. They also deliver which is a huge plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food but really crowded. Dimly lit which is good for dates, but not foe the rest of us. Very friendly staff. Fills up fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] These guys are always friendly and helpful. They are quick and I have never had a problem with my car. The area is a bit sketch, which is why I gave it a 4.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food and fast service. The charm of this place is that it's a hole in the wall and churns out terrific, flavorful dishes. My go-to dishes are the vegetable tofu pad thai and pad see ew.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I have been back a couple of times and just sat at the bar for drinks and dessert. JP is a great bartender and is great to chat with.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here many times. Other than the terrible line situation where you stand in the middle of the restaurant, the place is amazing. Some of the best food in the industry. I give it a 4 for the bad line setup. But the food is easily a 5.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, spicy chicken. Spicy beans. Good fried green tomatoes. Don't eat them right away, hottt. Good service, your Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken Tea cup stays filled. The only drawback(besides parking, take public transp) were the tiny tables. Hard to keep everything on the table.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been to a couple of Home Depots and such. Lowe's by far has the friendliest and most helpful employees. Yay! This is where I buy all my house handy-woman stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] My go-to place for brunch when entertaining moms and dads! Fresh food, solid flavors, and a tasty Bloody Mary.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great everyday bar. A little bit of everyone shows up here, and the menu is pretty standard, everything I've eaten is great! They also sell my favorite burger here, mmm. Definitely gets crowded on weekends, but what decent bar on boylston doesn't? No complaints.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seen some bad reviews on this joint but it was cool to me, had the fish tacos they were damn good. The margaritas was strong which was a good thang service good I will be back when spring hit.  [END]
[BEGIN] The atmosphere is casual upscale elegance. The food is fantastic!!! Large portions and great wait staff and solo artist  [END]
[BEGIN] Imbeccable service from Marcus. Citrus salad and burgers great. Deviled eggs need some work, but then again I'm comparing to my mom's.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice authentic Mexican food. Doubled checked my food before leaving to make sure I had everything there. Good portion of carnitas and good amount of cheese on the quesadilla. Would recommend for Mexican food. It was ready promptly and would order again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Asian dishes are good but the sushi is what makes Blue Ginger one of our weekly stops. Without doubt one of the best places for very fresh sushi in all Columbus!  [END]
[BEGIN] We were in Atlanta for a week and looking for a nice place to listen to music, eat, and have a drink. We had great wings, friendly Service and the music was hip hop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had some amazing lobster here while attending the National Assn. of Realtor convention. A bit pricey but certainly delicious with great service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small place with decent food. All fresh. We stayed near it so we went. It was adequate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious fresh sushi at a reasonable price. Waiters were courteous and attentive. Great place for a quick meal or nice date.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great small place, don't come with large crowd, it seats 20!!!! The selection of 5 oysters and a great small wine list say "come on back for more"  [END]
[BEGIN] The Sablefish was delicious! Thanks to Hiro for the custom surprise order! Everything was perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of our favorite burger joints. Giving it a four instead of a five because it can get pretty noisy. Always good service and love that they have a gluten free bun.  [END]
[BEGIN] had a very good meal while traveling though the airport. I would say give it a try.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been a favorite spot for years! Plates are smaller under new ownership, but just as good! The orange chicken as well as chicken katsu are phenomenal!  [END]
[BEGIN] One of my faves in So. Austin! Great house margaritas no mixes all fresh! Food is always great. They serve fried plantains to die for! You won't be disappointed  [END]
[BEGIN] Really great local moving company. Just moved us from Boston to Cambridge in about 3 hours. The crew was incredibly friendly, took good care of all of our belongings, and they came in at the low end of the quoted price.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food and service was great! I had the filet and it was cooked perfectly! I also had the lobster bisque and it lacked flavor which is the only reason I am giving this place four stars. It's a little pricey but is great for a nice date night  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the strawberry mint hookah. The tea they serve is great as well. Parking? That can be a problem. The building is old too. Lots of bums outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] overall a good experience. there were only two of us waiting but it took awhile for my scan.i appreciated the large waiting room. facility felt a bit old since it was in a shopping center it also felt odd.....  [END]
[BEGIN] We went for a farewell treat for a collegue. The ambience was nice. The food is good. Liked the starters.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything our table ordered looked fresh, well-prepared, and tasty. I heard no complaints. We all left pleased. I had the haddock and it was wonderful!  [END]
[BEGIN] 朋友生日时去吃的，提前订了位置和烤鸭。 餐馆依水，景致不错。 在我看来只要不是特别惊艳或难吃，手法又相似，烤鸭和全聚德就没什么差别。 凉皮很好吃哦，虾，蟹也都不错，鸡的味道一般，还吃过什么忘记了。 总体菜色味道都还挺好的。  [END]
[BEGIN] I have had what they call Road Kill and this time had Cat Fish it was very good. Be careful when you bite into Cat Fish its scolding hot let it cool off first Service so far has been great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meat samosas were a bit dry. Malai kofta was delicious as was the lamb tikka masala. Gulab jamun was also delightful but wish it came more than two an order!  [END]
[BEGIN] good place if you want to eat a samwitch outdoors in Union Square, especially if you value an establishment that uses local / sustainable ingredients.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a great pub! The service here is amazing and food portion is pretty big and filling. The server that was helping us gave me a great drink recommendation. The seafood noodles were delicious but was too much for my tiny stomach to handle.  [END]
[BEGIN] We love our apartment! The maintenance staff has been quick to respond and the office staff is super helpful and friendly. It's beautiful, green, and quiet!  [END]
[BEGIN] The neighborhood coffee shop in one of my favorite neighborhoods in Portland. Love the theme. Love the coffee. I had one of the finest lattes I've ever had yesterday, prompting this review. The niece and nephew love the hot cocoa. The crowd is very interesting. A unique Portland experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very tasty and a lot for your money! Line was long but ice cream did not disappoint!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just American Chinese but fresh, delicious American Chinese. The combos are a pretty good deal. Sometimes Beef and Broccoli can be too stringy but this was spot on. The cook may not be the most personable guy but I keep coming back for the food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Always love za zang mien. But I find their 'Sweet and sour port' much more delicious! Love it. Will certainly go again!  [END]
[BEGIN] A terrific breakfast - enormous servings with farm-fresh ingredients. The French toast with lingonberry syrup was wonderful. Excellent coffee, beautifully poached eggs. Only downside - would not heat the syrup for pancakes. Still, would happily go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great menu and location in the heart of downtown Decatur. Have a sangria and enjoy the on street seating. We had the tostones, empanadas, and ceviche. My wife is Colombian and she approves Calle Latina:)  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want to be close to the airport for an early flight, this hotel is very close to the airport and has a free shuttle to and from. There's a small but decent restaurant inside, in case it's winter and you don't want to leave to get food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super cute place, indoor or outdoor seating with cozy feel. Cute was really good with lots of options. Nice mix of comfort food and health food options.  [END]
[BEGIN] The burgers were great but the sides were nothing special. The service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere is just like any other sports bar anywhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stocked up on essential British Christmas items. Expensive but that's to be expected as they are all imports. A freezer at the back even has black/white pudding, haggis, meat pies and sausage rolls!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I always have so much fun dancing too the cover bands! Plus the line to get in late on a weekend night is not too long and its 5 bucks to get in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is pretty good. The place is small and they need to be more organized. Parking is also limited.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the Crispy Duck with Sweet Chili Basil and sticky rice. Loved it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean! The food was delicious and the service was good as well. Lots of options to choose from. Works defienetly recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] They have great selections of cakes, buns and soft bread here. red beans and taro are my favor. I strongly recommended their taro cake. is light and fluffy with yummy taro. It's good if you don't want anything too sweet that American bakeries are know for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, original choices. Good taste and plenty in size. A bit on the pricier side though. Long wait times for brunch is a downside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great college bar, but just that... If that is what you are looking for, then this is definitely the place... If not, go someplace else  [END]
[BEGIN] Ohhh... who doesn't like sausage! Great food and the puff pastries are to die for. Been going to this place since HS and that was a while ago.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun little brewery to visit, though the tasting room gets crowded. Excellent selections on tap and, if you take the tour, you can try beer fresh out of the fermenter.  [END]
[BEGIN] Right in Faneuil Hall Marketplace. Had a great sale section (yes, I only check out the sale section at a store!) It's a great place to grab some casual clothes! Sales reps were friendly and helpful!! Good job guys!! I got my retail therapy!!! http://www.ae.com/web/index.jsp  [END]
[BEGIN] Shanghai dumplings were delicious! Another stand out was the smoked tea duck served with steamed buns. Good food It was busy and we waited close to an hour, but the food was worth the wait. Service was also good. Will recommend and return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Third time here and every time is been really good. Prices are fair, and portions are ok. The guy up front is nice. .handy place to eat if you can get out of your room and make the walk up there. .nice change from the hospital food. ..  [END]
[BEGIN] Vegan donuts rock! Even better is 24-hour donut access. Lines can be long, so be prepared to wait. Also, they tend to sell out rather quickly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely place for tapas. Button mushrooms with goat cheese is awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been here now a few times and everything is always outstanding. The meat selection is excellent and always very flavorful. If you are into Brazilian and don't want to pay a fortune this is the place for you  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was excellent. I went with 8 people last night whose tastes ranged from cautious to adventurous, and whose familiarity with Korean food ranged from none at all to having eaten in Seoul. Everybody loved the food. The price was excellent, too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fresh & Fast!! The place is very nice. But I'd recommend them having real beef, turkey and chicken not ham.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a lovely place. Large patio so you can bring your best friend. Service was excellent and food was amazing. A little pricey!  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there for happy hour. Super cheap top-notch food and beers. Our waitress was exceptional.  [END]
[BEGIN] Neat, tidy, good atmosphere overall compare to other T&T's. Friendly staff and good service. Product selection is decent but prices are average.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good selection overall. I do wish they had more stamps. Also, some of their prices seem kind of high.  [END]
[BEGIN] I usually come here for coffee and sometimes a sandwich when hungry. Heard there soup is pretty good. Food is fresh of course because it isn't like frozen food like most places you eat or some canned crap. Pricing is good too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yum! We went for a light dinner. We split the margherita pizza, olive appetizer and the lamb appetizer. It was good for the price. We got soda...no alcohol. Total was about $30. We will definitely go again!  [END]
[BEGIN] So so yummy! They have a good lunch combo and I definitely recommend the spicy eggplant.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is VALUE. Portions are big and tasty. It's not gourmet. It's not surprising. It's affordable and dependable. You want this in your life.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chocolate Lover's Paradise If you love chocolate, don't miss Ghirardelli in Disney Springs. Great sundaes and salted caramel hot chocolate! Go to the chocolate shop for a free caramel Ghirardelli square.  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoyed this spot, would like to come back and try something else from the menu. It was nice being able to sit outside on picnic tables and people watch. Fresh fruit and flavors!  [END]
[BEGIN] I really like the space, and the tapas is good and surprisingly reasonable for the city. My only complaint is that the drinks are too small. Otherwise, a good option for Tapas in Boston.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the better Walmart's! I always go in the after hours, the well known shopping cliental is better to deal with then!  [END]
[BEGIN] Chickenwings zowel met als zonder bot. Flink aantal verschillende smaken maar ik vond ze erg aan de zoute kant. Ook de patat,hoewel lekker, erg aan de zoute kant. We hadden als dipsaus honing mosterd en die was erg lekker. Frisdrank kon je onbeperkt bijvullen. Personeel was erg vriendelijk en behulpzaam  [END]
[BEGIN] Customized noodles broth and spice levels? Sign me up. Regular here be sure to grab a stamp card free gyoza and ramen after certain number of re-visits.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was visiting Boston so I was only able to eat here once and had the Shrimp Platter. Very good! You can really taste a difference in their batter and it's truly delicious. The atmosphere is lively and the service is also good.  [END]
[BEGIN] The seating is ample, the service was speedy. I had tea and a hot water bag. It is not rocket science. I also used their wifi for about an hour to work on some projects.  [END]
[BEGIN] I previously had not recieved good service from this store until I worked with Gavin today. He was extremely helpful and saved me lots of money. I would recommend him to any customer that enters this store  [END]
[BEGIN] Well, it's a bit on the pricey side, but the quality keeps making me come back and bring out-of-town guests here. Their tuna empanadas are great. Their lemon meringue pie - it's perfection! This is why they often run out of it by late evening =(  [END]
[BEGIN] Never mind the 'location' concerns expressed by the suburban hoi polloi. This place serves good food with friendly service. Don't miss the red beans and rice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just discovered this place. SO DELICIOUS. I tried the Miga's taco last visit and was instantly hooked. All the sauces are amazing especially the habanero green. Going for dinner tonight. 4 stars because I wish they sold alcohol!  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was a bit awkward but the food was amazing! If I want thai this is the the only place I'll be going back to  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent in the pub category, meaning cheap with big portions. Some interesting menu items. Semi-rowdy sports bar kind of atmosphere though. But hey, maybe you like that... "bro".  [END]
[BEGIN] Third time here, ordered take out. Pad See Ew was amazing! They put it in an aluminum tray and plastic lid with cardboard bottom, so it stayed warm for the journey home. Fast, easy, decent price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Such a treasure! Nicely priced and good vegan choices. All 4 of us enjoyed our meals (even though the portions are a bit small)  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the better burgers in Portland, and a great happy hour. I haven't had anything less than good here and I've explored the happy hour menu fairly extensively. Great place to meet up with friends over drinks before gaming (as one does).  [END]
[BEGIN] It's an American diner experience. Ended up here for a brunch date and tables were packed so we got seated at the bar. The food is prepared at close quarters and that's an experience in itself. Great options on the menu, decent coffee. Will come back if in the neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good and fresh. service is good too even its busy sometimes! Finally have a hotpot in Malden!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, not great. A little over-priced, $3.50 for a scoupe of cookie dough. I got the M&M. Would have like a non-vegan chocolate option!  [END]
[BEGIN] Saw this place on Esquire's best. Really nice and classy. Nice historical treat. Food and drinks are not bad at all. I'd come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great local ice cream place. Within walking distance of my apartment. Excellent banana splits and raspberry lime rickey's. As a former scooper of ice cream, it's a nice homely place to grab a scoop and either sit and chat or walk around. Very popular in the summertime.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious crab! Sometimes a long wait since the place is popular.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the few cool restaurants/bars in Boston. Great place. Food is delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Next time getting a sandwich here. The salads are very good. The dessert looked delious the choc chip croissant. The avacado salad was good but the dressing too strong. Loved choc chip cheese croisant  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty delicious subs. The Roasted Eggplant was good but I wish I had known the eggplant was breaded (and possibly fried?).  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious & filling! I got the burrito bowl with chicken. The hot salsa is quite spicy, and the avocado salsa is delicious!!! I'd definitely come here again - quick and friendly service, too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Must stop for Vancouver. Go here for hotdogs. Recommend getting: Kurobuta pork. Misomayo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Started with a blood orange martini,then the meatball pizza and a canolli for dessert,everything was amazing!! The atmosphere is really nice too,definitely the best spot in Davis!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great quick food with a couple of vegan options (and many vegetarian options). My only suggestion is adding a few more vegan items to the menu!  [END]
[BEGIN] I LOVE this place. Adorable inside, great social environment to mill around and meet people, and AWESOME food. I had the tri-tip sandwich, and also the Au Jus sandwich...both highly recommended. Also: make sure to check out Do-Over in the summers. SUCH an awesome outdoor dance party!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great breakfast spot! Kind of small and you'll have to wait but the food is great. Cinnamon French toast is wonderful! Wife says the hash is to die for. And the estimated wait was right on the money. Cash only, so be aware.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool sammies, decent beer taps. Would return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love me some Ramen. Located in the grocery store but a decent setup. If it is the only ramen in town then I am thankful for ramen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best way to get to Boston, gives me more beer money. I take a taxi home after hours. They could clean it up a bit, but it is the closest MBTA to Tufts (for now).  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a great time - loved the erhu playing, and authentic China style food. Great location - international drive! Spent $90 on 3 appetizers, small portions - 3 meals reasonably sized - dinner for 2.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hummus was a little bland so that was disappointing but the falafel was very tasty, as well as the egg plant sandwich. And the baklava was delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Sopa de Pollo is excellent as is the Tostaguac and fajitas. Good place for lunch on nice days with a patio. Inside is dark. Service is sometimes slow, so be active in managing your requests.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kujo was great for our walk in tats. We hardly had a wait and he was entertaining and very effective and efficient. We would definitely recommend him to other people in the area looking for a tattoo. Shop minimum is $60 just so you know in advance.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the friendlier and less crowded Kinko's in the chain. I'm always able to find a helping hand here when struggling with the copier and printers. The system is efficient and effective.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was great! There usually is a wait, but I do have to recommend their coffee drinks to-go and waffles with raspberry/carmel sauce. (not too sweet for breakfast, get two because they are small but delish'!) You can thank me later!  [END]
[BEGIN] Can't beat the empanadas here! We ordered a few at the bar for lunch and had quick, prompt service. The East Austin location has a great atmosphere and is super laid back. The domain location is a little stuffier, but we always eat outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid but a little inconsistent. Little things, sometimes trash left behind, sometimes under the sofa sometimes not? Overall, WE STILL HAVE AN F-ING MAID SERVICE so I'm actually embarrassed to have a single complaint!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Most definitely not the friendliest staff but if you want a gift shop that offers up trendy CU or Colorado gear, this is the place. There are a ton of shirts to pick from and other fun trinkets.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is a little slow but food was good. My main complaint is the crackers were super stale. All of them.  [END]
[BEGIN] 4stars for the food, 2for the place itself. Tables need to be cleand, they have unsweet teas, yes more then one, but nothing ro sweeten it wirh. So....  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the coffee here and the overall vibe. Great space and nice to have the outdoor seating on the terraced patio. The service is super slow though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good appetizer sampler, nice beer list, really nice dining room views. Good for a low key weeknight out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good spot for old fashion meat and 3 near downtown. Yum on open face roast beef and mash potato. Bummer they were out of fried okra.  [END]
[BEGIN] Crazy Roll & Monkey Brain = Great I shall return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great NY Style Pizza, thin crust and true sauce! Tuesday Deals!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good chicken, but comparable to many other chicken places. I tried a two piece dark, the Mac and cheese, and beans. Just wish the small side was so small, it would've been suitable for a small child....or at least adjust the price  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice little place. I've been there a few times. Staff is attentive, food is good. I do recommend this restaurant  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here had a blast Service was quick our waiter was good The fried green tomatoes were excellent!!!! Prices are ok , the ladies restroom was CLEAN..  [END]
[BEGIN] This Salon is gorgeous, and I find the pricing to be very affordable! I like how there is spa services on site. Go see Lily! Best hair stylist :D  [END]
[BEGIN] This noodle house is a great spot to grab a quick something to keep body and soul together. The setting makes it ideal for a date, lunch or casual dinner. If working your way through all the local eateries, this one should be on the list.  [END]
[BEGIN] The soft shell crab Taiwanese buns are delicious, though a little pricy. Could be an occasional indulgence.  [END]
[BEGIN] Casual pub with lots of TVs, open space, and tables. Two bars to belly up to. Recommended for both groups and solo drinkers. We ordered the sausage platter, BLTA, and the chicken tortilla soup and all were seasoned well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for happy hour Cheap and good! They staff was great keeping our tabs organised with our party of 9 bouncing around the bar. We had drinks and appetizers and everything came out quickly. Would return to try out the food on the menu  [END]
[BEGIN] Kids say it was delicious. They have all the american cuban staples made with a care/effort. I am adding this to my list of regular eats. Thanks for the great food. Marina loved the plantains.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been ordering food (pickup &delivery) since Lucky Yeehaw opened and this is now the only place in the area we order/eat oriental food! Pleasant Customer service, quick service, and their egg drop soup is super delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had some $4 happy hour specials. The mini shepherds pies were yummy. The wings are so so good. The mini pretzels with cheese was really fresh and delicious. The chicken fingers with spicy bbq sauce were NASTY! Cute place. Nice experience. Good prices. Good beer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great addition to the gunbarrel area. Finally something besides Bk and sandwiches. I like the steak tacos but my co-worker prefers chicken. I recommend this restaurant and hope it sticks around.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Burren is the mullet of bars. Business in the front. Party in the back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hands down the best Indian in Austin. Go during their lunch hours for the buffet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to grab a California style burrito- reminds me of hitting the taco truck! I would give it 5starsbut they are sometimes out of carnitas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Let me same you some time. Go for the corn fritter and rock shrimp. The rest you can get at captain D's - are those still open- or long john silvers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped by here for lunch and wasn't disappointed. I love Pho noodles. Added shrimp and loved it! Will Definitely be back here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] We arrived around 8 pm on a Friday and sat in the bar area. We had a total of 4 dishes, which were all very good but the service was terrible. I wouldn't sit at the counter by the window as we were completely ignored.  [END]
[BEGIN] This has been my Sunday brunch place since moving here. The food is good-that side of oatmeal is fantastic. The music is great and the place is packed with Davis/Tufts/community vibe. I love doing the crossword here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gooooooood! I have never been wrong going there. Get the original/danbo soup. Ohh classis tonkotsu, that is goood!!! Miso was so so... nothing to complain coz i like their noodle, but soup is somewhat less flavor  [END]
[BEGIN] Have dinner where Paul Revere once ate. This is nice place and convenient to the Freedom Trail in Charlestown.  [END]
[BEGIN] Make sure to seat yourself if no one notices you've been standing at the hostess table for 10 minutes. Other than that, great food and amazing sangria. No really, the sangria is the bomb dot com.  [END]
[BEGIN] Go EARLY! These homemade donuts are really good! We arrived around 10a and most of the inventory was gone. Not your traditional donut shop. The donuts stayed fresh the entire weekend that I visited. My favourite was the twist, cream cheese filled, eclair...what the heck, they were ALL delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food even if you are not a vegetarian. You must try the desserts they are scrumptious.  [END]
[BEGIN] First visit in a while. Food was what it used to be and the service was great. I hope this is a sign that things have taken a turn for the best again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had lunch here and was extremely happy with what we had Malai chicken, cauliflower side, samosa and mango lassi. Very tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Sephora is much, much smaller than the Prudential location. However, it was not nearly and busy and the salespeople where much calmer and more relaxed. I enjoyed browsing around this one. Your typical Sephora supplies all this one has fewer perfumes and creams than others I've visited.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is overall delicious. I love the spicy conch appetizer and Kung pao chicken. However like another review said, they do not do teamwork. My water was empty for a while and other servers just walked on by and I know they saw it..  [END]
[BEGIN] The salted caramel milkshake was amazing.....with bits of salt adding texture and as the perfect flavor enhancer to caramel. Savory and sweet. Worth every penny of that $5.40.  [END]
[BEGIN] Always consistent food and service. The Tonkatsu Ramen's broth is rich and full of umami. Always hits the spot! The noodles are perfectly cooked every time.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stopped in for lunch while walking the Freedom Trail. We had burgers and they were the outstanding!! They have a good variety on the menu and great historical atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff and predictable, consistent food......nothing spectacular but decent enough. More like 3.5 stars for food and and extra .5 stars for the staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best Chinese buffet in the Portland area. The egg fu Yung is excellent, so is the general tao's Always go when its busy... They make new food constantly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here three times now. Always good food, friendly staff and friendly conversations with other customers. Today I had the special - pork belly hash - mmm good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location, AMAZING bed! Hallway is somewhat warm and smells...  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food. Understanding wait staff, they paid attention well. Good franchise. The tri tip was well seasoned and had great portions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wait sucks but is totally worth it!! I take everyone who visits Austin to hop doddy's and they all fall in love! Great atmosphere. Amazing food!  [END]
[BEGIN] We found this place comfortable good service and the pizza and the calzone was very good.Fresh not dry like some places full of flavor. We had seen the reviews and went anyway The server was prompt food was served hot and timely. Fast service Good Food,Fun Atmosphere  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hot food and coffee. The serving are large and reasonably priced. Menu is varied and interesting. There's always a line to get in, but it's worth the wait!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place to me is very good! the price is a little pricey but it is worth it to me!! I had the chicken Alfredo, it was okay but the pizza is where its at! yum yum yum... so if you like pizza you should try this place!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Line took forever, but it was worth it. The sides felt super home made, the ribs!!!!? Melted: in. Your. Mouth. And the sausage was fiiiiire !! Loved it great bbq experience in Austin  [END]
[BEGIN] The Kobe in Florida is better than other Kobes that we have been to. Price is reasonable for the amount of food u get. Good variety. Will definitely come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food and service. Just a bit pricey... Alot $12 plates or above. I was also very disappointed that there's no kids menu. But good Mexican food.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a great experience. I came for an early dinner by myself. The food was delicious and staff was friendly. I had the beet and goat cheese salad and steak frites, accompanied by their Rose sangria. What a gorgeous way to spend a spring evening!  [END]
[BEGIN] Granted, I'm a Texan and went to Boston vulnerable to tourist traps. But I don't care, I loved this place. Great atmosphere, good food, good service, good music and a great view of the water. I'll go again, without hesitation if I'm in Beantown.  [END]
[BEGIN] The dishes were executed flawlessly and they were presented beautifully. Minus a star for the seemingly rushed service. Our server breezed through the description of the dishes. All in all, it was a great dining experience. (Had the 14 course meal with pairing.)  [END]
[BEGIN] During our visit to the Capilano Bridge, we purchased our coffee here. Both the girls helping me with the coffee were super nice and helpful. Although there was a line, they didn't rush us to get our coffees. The coffee was mediocre but they explained it's locally grown.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the staff, very helpful aaaaaaaaannnnnddd friendly. Food was amazing, godfather sandwich with Mustafa sauce on the side  [END]
[BEGIN] Good stuff, unique & tasty. One of our guys brings them into work frequently, they don't sit around long thats for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] FYI: I revisited Joe's a couple of days ago and to my surprise they changed their prices, boooooo. I paid $7.25 for a large steak and cheese. Still worth it though.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great place for happy hour and for brunch. Little pricey for a long happy hour, but the half price apps make it a better deal. Awesome bar staff. Brunch is amazing. Buffet, some favs from the menu and some special items just for brunch. Bloody Mary bar...yum  [END]
[BEGIN] Came to celebrate Alina. Again :). The waitress is awesome. Super fast and friendly :) Great for groups and just a chill place over all. Yummy food too:) Dessert is GOOD  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the decor and the dark lighting. That, to me, is what makes this place so great. The food is decent-- try the paella and skirtsteak salad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Smoked Turkey was surprisingly different and delicious. I sometimes get a specific craving just for that  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast service and a very large variety of rolls to choose from. I wish they had more soup options thought. Overall a great chain.  [END]
[BEGIN] Salmon to die for. Best honey mustard salad dressing in town. The specials are always excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place... delicious tapas and very nice wine list... I didnt try any of the specialty cocktails but I'll in my next visit!  [END]
[BEGIN] the meat quality definitely cannot be compared with that in Zen Shabu. However, the price is unbeatable! It is pretty good for a get-together. you can take your time, sometimes the whole afternoon, chatting and eating the buffet! definitely worth giving it a try  [END]
[BEGIN] I get brazilians here, from Brenna. I find it relatively painless. It's so easy to schedule, and their rates are reasonable. I'm not planning to go anywhere else!  [END]
[BEGIN] Its pretty good especially uf your there on a date and there at the right time to catch the sunset  [END]
[BEGIN] My boyfriend and I love getting brunch here. We're regulars for the Sunday brunch now and love the staff. They're super friendly and good at remembering faces which always feels nice. The food is also pretty good and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the cocktails.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic!! Service was great. Portions were huge. A great neighborhood place. You will definitely leave full. The shredded chicken and beef were extremely fresh, tender and tasty. Prices are very reasonable.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great place to go to with friends and have a good time.. Excellent bar service with a variety of cocktails, good food, and fun atmosphere ..  [END]
[BEGIN] Was here for the Pop Culture Expo last Sat. & liked that it was (IMO) the perfect size venue for the show.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny place but don't be intimidated. The service is friendly and fast (at least it was at 2:00 on a Thursday in mid-November). Walk up to the counter and order a delicious wrap or kabob or grab something cold from the case. Falafel wrap is fantastic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great cloths and excellent very helpful staff. I went in looking for a great gift idea for my wife and the helpful staff immediately gave me all kinds of great options. Thanks lucy folks, I will definitely be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the downward dog smoothie. I also love peanut butta tho. But minus one star for $15 for two small smothies. :/  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best fish congee and wonton noodle I have tried! The wonton is basically full of shrimp. It's $6.50 a bowl Canadian. Great price for quality congee and noodle, I would recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Starbucks impressed me with the Drive Thru service, spacious interior and the staff's effcient service. The music was jazzy and really nice too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Agree with the others here that De Bens is a great classic barber shop. Whenever I go in (appointment or not), I haven't had to wait or anything. TJ does a really good job cutting my hair.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a fun little spot for lunch. Great deals on their food and the service was fun.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best queso, no question. This location's cashiers are hit or miss for being really nice or really jerky. Am I bothering you so much to place a two item order??  [END]
[BEGIN] For was actually quite tasty! Really enjoyed my tofu and veggie burrito bowl. Pleasantly surprised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super cute hipster coffee/tea shop we stopped in for a bit before meeting a friend for dinner. No complaints.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good prices, good atmosphere, good location. I loved the popcorn! We all felt like the prices were pretty darn good. And it wasn't over crowded at all, which was why I had avoided it initially, I was certain it had to be crowded. Plenty of room. Go check it out!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stick to the Asian dishes with the spicy symbols and add the tofu. Italian pastas ok but not as tasty. Overall, great bang for ur buck...  [END]
[BEGIN] Such a cozy, warm spot with a great menu of offerings. Shared a pizza, salad, and app with the hubs and it was all great, including excellent service by maitre d.  [END]
[BEGIN] We frequent The Restaurant - and receive our food exactly as ordered. We frequently recommend this venue. Adding the bar has messed with the acoustics. Our only suggestion would be to look into a sound system to lower the noise level.  [END]
[BEGIN] some comments on this are outrageous, who actually listens to a therapist yawning?? Get a life, and who cares who runs the place, it is a polite and professional environment, I went in for a massage and the therapist was very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our waitress was super sweet and our food was outstanding, like someone's Grandma was in the back cooking!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place! Eyebrow threading is amazing! My eyebrows look awesome! Very professional and always on time. Appointments are convenient and the staff is very friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent food. I have eaten here several times and the food is always great. I usually order General Tso's chicken but I have tried other menu items as well and they are all delicious. My family and I frequent this location. I recommend for simple yet tasty Chinese.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is always great here. The service from both the manager as well as the staff is super. Only draw back of this restaurant is it's super loud. If you can, snag a patio table!  [END]
[BEGIN] I second the previous review! Anu is so easygoing & pleasant. The threading process may sting, but it's super quick & doesn't cause the redness & sensitivity to your skin that waxing does. I'll definitely be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Adventureland is fun. Aladdin and the Pirates of the Caribbean along with Jungle Cruise are the best things here. But they are also things to learn around here.  [END]
[BEGIN] I find Haru to be reliable and solid every time I go. Yes, it's not Oishi, but I don't want to pay $30 for a roll every time I want some reusable Sushi in a good atmosphere. Also: the Boston Uncommon roll. I heart you forever. And ever. Love, me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oh yummy yummy! I always get good food here and the people who work there are just lovely!  [END]
[BEGIN] The noodles are tremendously tasty and have a insane amount of garlic. They don't dish the most for the price, but the quality and flavor was outstanding.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious, and the staff was super helpful in having me order for a large group and pulling everything together for me and walking it out. Definitely going back next time i'm in Austin.  [END]
[BEGIN] We tried many dishes and all were perfectly cooked and full of their own unique flavors. The desserts are all one-note for my taste. The wines are very good here for being a brewery. Pork belly app, duck entree were my faves. Service and atmosphere are casual yet elegant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely atmosphere. Service was super - the host could have smiled a bit more. The blackboard was fun to practice our pronunciation. The food we had was superb.  [END]
[BEGIN] A very good gym with lots of equipment. As to be expected, it can get crowded after work, but not so much that you have to wait long for a machine. Except for a few missing towel hooks in the mens shower area, a well-maintained facility.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a delicious and quick taco place. The mole is delicious! The staff are friendly. I ate 4 tacos but could have easily ate more. I will be back  [END]
[BEGIN] Always a good selection of home goods here with rockin' prices. Good service, lots of space, and reasonably tidy, this is a convenient place to shop for seasonal items and small gifts  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good sandwiches I got the chili dog. Gets pretty messy. Had a bite of my friends sandwich "da dip" warning don't get to excited about the horse radish.  [END]
[BEGIN] Some of the best kid food in town. Great fries. Always a solid meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recently went here with an old friend to cetch up. Our waitress was awesome and came to check on us regularly even though we told her we will be here awhile cause were long lost friends. Food was spectacular.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great gyros, friendly family-owned place with outdoor seating. Try the "Greek donuts!"  [END]
[BEGIN] Plump asian chick with nice melons. What can be better? At least my eyes were satisfied.  [END]
[BEGIN] Phó is something I purchase regularly from this place, and after trying a few places around town, this place has the best I've tasted in Vancouver. Friendly and fast service to help with my lunch break stop and go!  [END]
[BEGIN] A little pricey, but the food is seriously amazing. I don't know what made them decide to make sushi burgers or burger sushi, but it is delicious. The atmosphere of the area is fun, with creative and comical sushi and burger related art and decor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our favorite place in Austin... And it must be other folks' favorite as well, there is often a line waiting to get in and sample their eclectic and trendy treats. They make fabulous drinks and the food never disappoints.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here...time for a cocktail on the patio with tunes by DJ Loweki! I will have to go back and eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was good. But if you are looking for traditional tacos this place is a bit more modern.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have been here a couple of times, for dinner and a large get together! Customer service is great and the food is very good. It is not traditional pub food or atmosphere, it is a little more upscale.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place offered a nice value plus the food was tasty. Got a pork dish which could have used a little sauce but still very good. Enjoyed sampling the Empanadas, didn't have one I didn't like.  [END]
[BEGIN] Consistently above average. I dine here regularly. The wait staff is attentive and courteous. The food is fresh and prepared properly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been to a good amount of pizza places in the Columbus area, and so far this is the best pizza I've had. It's always hot, cheesy and delicious. Service could be better, but I think the pizza is worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a rainy evening, and the patio was still so comfy, with blankets and heaters blasting away. I went with some girlfriends, and the happy hour menu was reasonably priced and delicious (we got mussels, ceviche, lobster poutine, salmon carpaccio, and grilled jumbo oysters). Good drink specials too.  [END]
[BEGIN] When here for my birthday! If you like seafood then this the place! I had oyster shooter for appetizer an amazing seafood soup and house salad plus key lime pie for dessert. Staff was very friendly and accommodating even got me a birthday candle in my pie. Definitely coming back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Relaxed atmosphere, always good food. Workers look happy and actually talk with people. There's a short young man who is very outgoing and treats us well whenever we go. Short haired blonde girl is new I think but very sweet. Floors are sort of TOO slippery to walk properly sometimes  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrific place for drinks, oysters, and/or dinner.  [END]
[BEGIN] 這是一間現已為數不多仍然是推車仔賣奌心的茶樓，真系好鬼懐舊，我朋友叫左虾餃，燒賣同埋魚蓉腸粉，我就叫左牛肉球同埋潮州粉果，熱辣辣糸架車仔度攞出嚟，真糸好过㽼！其中有个高高瘦瘦靚靚嘅經理好鬼热情，服务又体贴。值得一去！  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service, great food, the restaurant was clean as could be. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the restaurants fault but the corporation itself, the prices are a bit high but pizza has become a delicacy anymore so it's to be expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best brunches in ATL. The food and entertainment is great. I've been a few times for both brunch and dinner and I will continue to come back! Planning a birthday party here soon!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service and the food was out quickly and... it was delicious! Definitely worth a stop if your in the neighborhood. Also, they have cool specials for blazer games.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious take out! Highly recommend the wings (all are good), lovers honeymoon, & the banana dessert. 4 stars bc it's a little pricey.  [END]
[BEGIN] I Loved The Meat.... Looking forward to going back and trying the Gyro Pizza. Missing 1 star cause it um.... Needed to be bigger :)  [END]
[BEGIN] only reason I'm not giving this lovely establishment a 5 star is because of the shrimp I had to peel my self and I'm a huge fan of shrimp. But this place is awesome!! lovely ambiance, lovely price, large portions! this is a gem! really hope this place stays true  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Ramen!!! The bowls are huge! Long wait though  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool spot with good food and good customer service. The wife and I were able split a California Roll, Thai Spring Rolls, and Beef Pad Se Ew, she said it was a little salty but overall still enjoyed the flavor of the dishes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent enough. Liked the firm bed. Stayed on the 2nd floor. Quiet stay, small pool and hot tub. Better than other options around the airport  [END]
[BEGIN] Last night we went in for late night drinks & snacks. To my surprise, it was really delicious. I highly recommend the appetizer that's basically a fried Ruben sandwich. WOW! I can't remember the name of it but it's absolute perfection!  [END]
[BEGIN] First lobster roll I ever had and it was delicious. Connecticut Style was great. I will definitely return!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Taste the Italian roots of Todd English, who also owns Olives, with his signature thin crusted pizza topped with figs and proscuitto. It's the perfect balance of sweetness and saltiness.  [END]
[BEGIN] We happened upon this for brunch and it was really nice. Food was executed well. Staff was great. I have this on my list of places to try for dinner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good burritos and tostadas I really wish they had a location closer in so I could visit more. But this place is definately worth the trip into outer east portland.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here more than a dozen of times, very friendly bartender, food was good and drinks are good. Prices are right, not too far from my house. I love it, will return again soon!  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried it because it was close to the hotel. Pretty solid cheese over the toppings style pizza. Take out and delivery only.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome deal 20$ for just ten... I love Mexican food, and this is a nice little location in Union Square for those looking for authentic mexican. The salsa is to die..  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been missing Pietro's Pizza since moving out of Southern Oregon. Great Pizza, lots of games for the kids.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice little place. I truly enjoyed the food. But it was busy for only one server. The Cuban bread it's really good  [END]
[BEGIN] This complex has the fastest work order turnout and I greatly appreciate that. Previous apartment complexes would take up to 2 weeks to get anything fixed. And John always does an awesome job.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow! When our family walked in, we were greeted so warmly and walked through the menu and ordering process like it was the best decision we've ever made. The gentleman that helped us could be an inspirational speaker and seems 100% genuine. Thank you for running a great, family-friendly company!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent food and service had a great time. We had a group of nine and we sat down right away. The lobsters were awesome. More food than you can imagine, we would recommend this to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Just near the sea side. Their fire grilled lobster with two sides are really good. Don't need to order the clam chowder. Because it's pretty similar with others. The oyster is fresh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just happened into this place and loved it! The Thai curry soup was delicious and the tomato and cucumber salad was refreshing! I would definitely recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this place! Beer is good! Outside seating is awesome! The servers and bar tenders are so nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great brunch spot! A unique mix of moroccan and traditional eggs and waffles. Be aware its ALWAYS busy!  [END]
[BEGIN] We love this place even though we can't afford it. The help is great and the stuff really lasts. We wish that we could shop here more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small, new Indian spot in Coolidge Corner. Perfect place for takeout: tasty food, good prices, parking availability, quick service. Great for a mid-week quick fix. If you ask for it "extra spicy," they won't disappoint.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is well kept and clean. Trucks are too. Good people. Friendly place. Dogs are welcome. Don't go during Halloween due to the haunted house next door you won't find parking.  [END]
[BEGIN] Exelent flavors & friendly helpful people. More busy on Sunday morning than when we went on Saturday. Do not hurry at this place you need time for fresh food.Will go back & Will recommended to others. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Must get the Bento Box! A perfect variety of 6 different little entrees. The drinks are good. They're shrimp appetizer was just okay. Was expecting better. But still overall a wonderful place. I go at least 2 times a month and will continue.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lobster rolls are generously sized and the buns are buttered and toasted nicely. It's a great choice for takeout, and the women behind the counter were super friendly. The kids said that their French fries were better than most and they were happy with their chicken tenders too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nearly as good as Kelly's and half the price! You don't get that buttered, delicious bun, but the beef is good and the BBQ is spectacular.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality of the food was outstanding, but portions are incredibly small. This may work for you but need to duly note.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was deceivingly great! From the exterior it looks unremarkable but in the backyard of it there's a large amount of space pretty good music and the bar service is quick and efficient. I was also pleased with the liquor selection.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered antique old fashioned. It was a smooth cocktail made of rotten house rye. Nice ambience, great place to have a drink with your friend or meet interesting people  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pizza for a good price. Service was a little lacking but nothing horrendous. The sausage and garlic was amazing, I'd recommend that if you go. Voted best of Boston by Boston magazine  [END]
[BEGIN] Brush up on your spanish and hit this East Austin gem. Excellent breakfast tacos. I haven't eaten lunch there yet but I'm looking forward to trying it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Place was great fun. Bar was lovely and packed- the service was 5 star. Staff very nice and knowledgable about all the dishes. Food was tasty and fun to share with my group. It's definitely the new hot spot in Boston !  [END]
[BEGIN] Surprised at the lower reviews. This place has a decent variety of slices and great portion sizes. Boston is pretty much junk for pizza but this spot is def worth a shot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the energy and Friday night fun here! The menu is only "okay" for vegan/vegetarians, but they made a terrific hummus and veggie wrap tonight. I'll order that again!  [END]
[BEGIN] I actually really like Tim's coffee. It's really good and cheap for no frills for $2. This location is busy but not as busy as the other ones. Customer service has always been good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rachel is always lovely. Happy hour is fun and bustling filled with some of my all time favorites. Ham and cheese crepes, chicken liver pate, the baby burger and oysters! Love the Bras. My favorite upscale comfort food spot in Boulder.  [END]
[BEGIN] Get the steak tacos!! My barbacoa one was pretty much all fat/fatty pieces and no real meat but I'll forgive them beause that steak taco was amazing! Wanted to try chicken but they were out... I'll definitely come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sapporo used to be 5 star on my book, but recent trip made me think they have lost some touch. They are still good, but something is missing. In bean town this is a gem and I still go back there, especially in cold winter days.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only buy our vehicles here because of the no-hassle pricing. Still takes too long to complete a transaction though  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pizza, very speedy and good for gluten free! All my friends liked the gluten free crust better than regular. Their Montreal pizza is to die for! We order pizza from this location all the time.  [END]
[BEGIN] deputy mary was awesome and a great team building exercise. She was very helpful in guiding us but not giving the answer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Thai curry, especially red with duck and yellow with pork. Tempura was cooked perfectly. The spider roll was delicious and desserts (coconut custard and sticky rice with mango) were amazing. Service was less than superb, but got the job done. Over all a great place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pancakes! Random spot but old school dinner food is fantastic! Staff is friendly and the food is yummy!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's okay. Just like every other Panera I've graced the drive through of. But sometimes consistency is good when you just want an unsweetened pink fruity tea.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband loves the chicken sandwich. I recently had the mac n cheese which had a thin cheese sauce. Disappointed in the taste and plate appeal. Service has always been good and nice employees.  [END]
[BEGIN] UFood is really good!! We grabbed dinner here prior to going to the movies. The UnFries are great... and I love the bison burger. For 2 of us to have dinner complete with sides and a beverage, it was $14.95 -- yes, less than $15 -- WOW!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a business meeting here, and it was a great location. We met late afternoon, and the sound level was great for conversation. Staff was extremely helpful and attentive. We sat for over 1.5 hours and never felt neglected or harassed. Had 2 appetizers and both were delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] It a cute place in seaport looking over the water. I came here for a bday with a party of 8. Pros: Great with groups, good atmosphere, lots of seafood selection Cons: Portions run small  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes Lawd. Come through with the banging soul food! We ordered mac n cheese, collard greens and fried chicken. Everything tasted great. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's a bit tight and crowded. Other than that, I loved it  [END]
[BEGIN] Veg spring rolls are great. Stuffed eggplant also really good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great southern food with "home cooked " this is a large dining room. The staff is friendly and courteous. The food is very good southern food. Good sized portions and very tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] We needed a virtual reality head set and some hard boiled eggs on our way to Melbourne Beach. Lucky for us we found both here! Restrooms were very clean! Coffee was not great... and their cup lids made sipping difficult.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great staff great drinks and food say hello to Conan the Irish bartender.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for a 30th birthday celebration! Maykold was a wonderful waiter with a strong knowledge of the menu and suggestions. One entree came out a tad off but the manager went beyond with personal attention and extras ;) as the head chef addressed the issue  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to hang out, they have a small amount of outside seating when the weather is nice. The sandwiches that I have had have been great. The smoothies are very good. Free wireless internet. Only problem is that it is sometimes very crowded.  [END]
[BEGIN] Large selection of plants, flowers, pottery, etc. I can't comment on the price as I don't visit nursery's very often. Friendly staff that helped this novice pick out some flowers for my son's school project.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious tacos! Wonderful hand made drinks and great atmosphere but the tacos are small  [END]
[BEGIN] Such a romantic spot to enjoy a wonderful meal. Absolutely would recommend going to grotto. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. I am 100% adding Grotto to my list of favorite resturants in Boston.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm not a huge burger fan, but I did have the turkey burger which was pretty good (and their fries are yummy too). But what's really amazing is their nutella chocolate pretzel shake. Has basically ruined all other milkshakes for me, forever.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here this week, I got a shack family got cones and cups. I would get a cone next time as its cheaper. Also the shack is mostly milk and if you are going to pay that high a price might as well get moré then a bunch not milk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service. Dined at 3:30pm, so not very busy. The "burnin love" burger was very good. Bottomless salad or fries is nice. Cod was good. I will return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is good, food was delicious. I was leery after reading some of the reviews and it turned out great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoyed my visit. The facility is quite impressive and the exhibits are well done. The history is a bit sanitized, as it barely mentions any of his failures or personal flaws. Nonetheless, it's his museum and it's likely the way he'd want to be remembered. It's worth a visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely one of my favorites! I usually order tex mex. However, today I wanted to try something different so I went with fiesta wrap. It was pretty good. Wish it's not too pricey though  [END]
[BEGIN] Great theater but they really need to invest some money in making more bathrooms for women. The line lasts all of intermission and it's just crazy. Adding another women's room would really go the extra mile.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the food filet. The only thing is they don't tell you they weight their steaks so you have to tell them not to. It just takes longer to cook because it's so thick. Manager there in Plaistow was very helpful so now I know what to ask for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Neal was professional, timely, and very solution-oriented. I hope to never be locked out of my car again, but if it happens, I'm calling Neal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered delivery to the Hampton Inn hotel on the north side of Boulder. Pizza was delivered quickly and was cooked well. Plenty of toppings and tasted good. Pizza was above average, would order from here again next time I am in town.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good stuff. Had cold udon for the first time and it was awesome! Very small place, I been at UT for two years and I never saw this place on the drag. It is a must check out!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly and happy to help me since I'm not the tech head.  [END]
[BEGIN] I purchased 11 items for about $10.50! What a steal! There are 5 for 5 racks near the back (lots of variety and whole grain options), and if you spend 10 bucks you get one loaf free!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent atmosphere (with livemusic) and super friendly staff. Very clean food - no complaints related to quality at all. Oysters were decent, as well as the crab bowl and lobster. Only complaint is the price points - $63 for a 2 lb lobster plate??  [END]
[BEGIN] So very busy but for good reason. Buffett is the best deal of you want to sample it all. Good sausages, especially the hot, and the cream puffs will keep you coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] try their cupcakes YUM YUM and the service on the phone was great - all in all, very good exprience  [END]
[BEGIN] Fanoos popped my persian cherry! First time I ate persian food was there and it was magnifique! The pita bread is made fresh, to order. Hummus is zesty and the buffet is the best time to eat there!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has such an awesome setting. Food was absolutely delicious. Warm feta was unique and delicious. I'd definitely get it again. Salt cod fritters are a must! The slabtown area is fixing up to be one of portland's best, and this restaurant is absolutely part of that!  [END]
[BEGIN] The sides are weird, but that is the only bad thing I can say about this delicious little gem! Buffalo chicken and s'mores were crazy good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Now, the chicken kabob is good, but the kubideh? That's something to KILL for. The portion sizes are rather moderate, but the food is delicious. The salad is good, so is the rice. Have not tried the pita. I would definitely recommend this place and will likely go again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place to eat from a wide variety of options and enjoy the theme park scenery. Staff was awesome - Ledin really cared we had a good experience! Good choice in Islands of Adventure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, and really nice folks! I work in the area, and Sancho's in a favorite. The tacos are great, and the burritos are huge and delicious! I'm a regular!  [END]
[BEGIN] Evan is fantastic! I go back to him month after month, he is exceptional. Be sure to book him out, his calendar fills up fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Roosters Is a great place to hang out, watch a game, and eat some food. No matter where you sit, you will have a view of a tv. There is a nice selection of beer and the wings are pretty good. I like that the tables are big and comfortable!  [END]
[BEGIN] Was just here yesterday and they now accept Restaurant.Com certificates for Dim Sum Buffet!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the Yuppie burger and the frappes are great! Good for a quick bite before catching a movie.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far have only tried the crispy Brussels Sprouts... And they were delicious! Get them, you will not regret it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place. It is carnivore heaven! I have been to this location three times and loved it every time. The one in downtown Chicago is great too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kind of pricey for the amount you get, but the quality is there. It's not often that I am served chicken that's still really juicy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Checked out the gym while visiting Portland. Compared to the LA Fitness gyms in Southern California, this one is a little more dated, but much less crowded. All the dumbbells were racked in their correct places! Lots of parking.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food but could work on their service. Good customer service is not customary in the BVL area and this is no exception.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Orlando Eye is pretty cool, I went on it with my wife and kids. Overall, it was fun seeing the sights when you get all the way to the top, but if you're not a fan of heights, I would not recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was in Clackamas and another stop yesterday after a movie with my Grandchildren to grab a pizza!'' Quick, fast and gone!" Their pizza's are pretty average as far as pizza's go? But tasty and long on convenience !'' 4 stars****! ''Thank you''  [END]
[BEGIN] Oops. We forgot saloons on Monday night in downtown means lots of adult bevs being consumed and not really a place to taste fun foods or beers. But it is Portland. The nacho app 3 star the NW Red ale by bout 5 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Shaking crab food are spicy to eat. Service is fast and friendly bring my friends here next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] I liked it and the presentation was cool too. But honestly I had tastier rolls. I ordered 5 rolls and A few of them all tasted alike. Server was lovely. Prices are very affordable for lunch as well. Good spot  [END]
[BEGIN] Super friendly bartender! pork belly over waffles a must and the best sweet potato "fries"! We were there on a Sunday before the ACL music festival, watched some football, great local beers!  [END]
[BEGIN] I just had the Pollo Encebollado for the first time. It was great, the chicken was seasoned just right. It was not over powering, nor lacking in flavor. Rice and sweet plantains where also very delicious. very good experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] So glad to see others describe this place as "charming" because that's exactly what it is! I would have loved to spend more time here exploring their selection of books on Salem. Good balance of books, new and used AND quirky knick knacks. Loved it!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're in Cambridge, you need to visit the COOP. It has a great selection of books and Harvard branded stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful view, dog friendly, not difficult to climb/hike and there's stair access for those who can't walk on such unsteady, rocky terrain. It's free, there's free parking and it's a good place for a date or family outing :).  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food and even better sitting outside on the pation on a nice day and people watching. Great place to hang out and the sangria was a suprise on a hot day! Good time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did you know the place is haunted? It's supposed to be a male individual that had worked there decades ago. He's sometimes seen in the kitchen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here the other night with wifey and cousin. Had very fresh Poke dish. Very tasty and fresh. The picked cucumbers and rice were really good too. My mind went straight to Maui when I tried it. Very good!  [END]
[BEGIN] The burgers here are excellent. Same with the appetizers. The reason I gave four stars and not five is because the initial wait to get seated was a little long because this place gets packed on Friday nights. Other than that great customer service and food. Definitely coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good sammiches and good customer service. I love that they have Maine root soda too! I suggest the curry chicken salad sandwich mmm...just a bit pricey for sandwiches.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is so funny such a small park has so many reviews. I sometimes go to this park to have my drink or sweety which I buy from Davie street while watching playing dogs.  [END]
[BEGIN] My fave sports bar to hit while in Boston. Huge draft selection and geat food, which is so uncommon among sports bars. I travel extensively and they have some of the best sports bar food I've had anywhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome buffet food. Good variety and genuine Indian cuisine taste. Interiors are good and comfortable. A must go place for enjoying authentic Indian food. People are friendly as well. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] cute cute stuff, as if you haven't already heard this. I saw some awesome earrings, necklaces, and bags. So even if you're looking for accessories to go with an outfit you already have..check it out. The clothes were reasonably priced too. And different which I loved.  [END]
[BEGIN] Finally checked out the new Yeti store. Cool spot. All your Yeti essentials. The outdoor bar looks nice for a warm day (which is almost every day here). Beer and wine in cans, cold brew coffee, olé ! They have WiFi and are dog friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Every cupcake we've ever had from here has been great. It's probably not the best cupcake I've ever had, but it's still good. Where else are you going to get a cupcake after 5pm?  [END]
[BEGIN] Interesting plates that combine for a awesome dining experience. Not traditional dinner or lunch but plenty of food to fill you with. Choose one extra plate and you won't be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome food good service, we went a little early to beat the crowd and it was a good thing we did. It became crowded and service started to suffer. We ordered additional food and it took a while to get it. A bit pricey but I would recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Go for the Brussels sprouts. We ordered a bunch of dishes, but those Brussels sprouts really stood out. You won't be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome patio seating and the food was delicious. Had the DBar sandwich and onion rings. Excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent French food, amazing coffee, and heavenly desserts. Food so good, you may faint. I would give it 5 stars but the lighting is a bit too dim inside. Oh, and the service is top-notch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it and not just because its in the hood. Busy for a reason, but the line-up always moves fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was very tasty. We got a veggie platter that was nicely seasoned and had lots of flavors. We had a very nice beef dish also. You eat with your fingers and the bread which was fun. We left feeling stuffed but felt that we ate healthy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was really good, nice sport bar with a great beer selection  [END]
[BEGIN] It's not a five star hotel but it is decent since most of the time is spent at the park. The rooms could really be updated (the carpet). The workers are nice and ordering food is a breeze. I would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious food. The location is pretty hard to get to though because parking in that area is a nightmare. Also, they blare the music so it's impossible for me to eat inside and I always have to get my food to go.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Customer Service! The hotel is in a good location and offers great amenities. I enjoy staying here for business and pleasure. My room was very clean and the staff was helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a fun place to just chill on a Saturday night! The atmosphere was nice and the drinks were pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well, for just making pitas, this place does a great job. Im giving it high marks relative to understanding this is not a fancy restaurant. But they make good pitas. And the service has been excellent in the 2 locations ive been to.  [END]
[BEGIN] ordered delivery, fast delivery, decent pie a tad pricy but i will order again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great local vibe.. Quite Decent brew. No bullshit attitude Felt like I was living on the edge as covert Wolverine fan in my UCD attire. Getting great service by Lisbeth Salander. Thought about getting a shirt but it was just too mean  [END]
[BEGIN] The burgers at Hopdoddy are worth suffering through the confusing system, long wait, high prices and difficult parking. The big ass local beers help, too. That is all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute atmosphere and staff is very friendly. The biscuits are huge and awesome and the Cajun breakfast was delish! The fresh squeezed orange juice in the mimosa was pretty good too!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the curry goat and chicken spinach, on tomato rice. They gave me a healthy portion of each. The meats were tender and the sauces were mild to medium in spice level. It also comes with half a piece of naan bread.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the 3 tuna roll lunch, was fresh and tasty. Came with either soup or salad. I had salad, was loaded with ginger dressing and very cold, yuOnly $10, what a deal!  [END]
[BEGIN] Its a nice room. Very hard to find the ironing board. Tip: check the secret door in the bathroom. I love the location. Makes me feel like I'm surrounded by smart people. Probably cause I am. Kendall is next door. Go check it out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tirando o nosso querido e velho Aki, Sushi Katana apresenta uma variedade e deliciosa da culinária japonesa. Tirando a demora no atendimento estão de parabéns.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was really good-friendly servers, etc. The food was really good. My wife liked it, so that's all that matters!  [END]
[BEGIN] Underrated Mexican fare. Feels more like a family home that opened up a restaurant, but don't let the little loud music fool you, the cook knows how to make a decent fish taco and the home made salsa is excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got the roast duck, roast pig, beef chow funn, and soft shell crab. All came out super fast and tasted great, especially the seasoning on the soft shell crab.. Service was excellent as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good meal and good service. We have the soup dumplings. They are okay. Enjoyed the spicy pig ears. Order the beef stew noodles and enjoyed the noodles. The beef was good. The broth was a little thin on flavor. Would like more depth in the soup. Overall a decent meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the atmosphere and the food is decent. The staff are okay in friendliness and quality of service. I like all the natural light. I want this to be a great spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best places for lunch in the back Bay Area of Boston. They have a great selection of sandwiches and I have had at least 8 of them and never have been disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good food and service. Great bar and vibrant scene. Quite expensive though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still good. But they really should buy a second till/interac machine for checking more than one person out at a time. The line can get clogged and the sandwiches colder and soggier by the time you pay. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent food we tried one of each empanadas. Roast pork and lomo Saltado were cooked well and had lots of flavor. They were out of tres leche cake but were offered guava and cheese nuggets, which were tasty. Definitely coming back next time in Orlando.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the concept. And the food was good. I got the Zuni and my mom got the special. Big portions - we could've shared. It was quaint and worth a stop if you're hungry. Staff was also friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was quick and friendly. Lobster bisque was excellent. Next time I plan to get a full meal. This place was open later than other restaurants in the terminal  [END]
[BEGIN] Outstanding quick service.... Good fresh food Great Bartenders Nice ambiance too  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was great. Catfish had a lot of flavor & shrimp was good as well. Hush puppies sucked but rest was good. The interior of the place could use some fixing up. Great takeout spot though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Intimate. Lots of props! Good visiting teacher. I would have liked to meet the owner. Would visit again. I'm from out-of-town.  [END]
[BEGIN] Brand new location. Very small with limited seating. I was lucky to score something. I just had the basic cheesecake. It was my well deserved cheat day. Good customer service and fair prices matching the other locations.  [END]
[BEGIN] Surprisingly good deals and finds. We found some out of production Samsonite luggage at an incredible price (I don't think the owner realized how much these are going for on eBay).  [END]
[BEGIN] Great local bar with a good menu. The chicken wings here are very good. Big and meaty and are comparable to Roosters wings. The fries taste fresh cut. O'Nellys has great live entertainment and have plenty of T.V.'s to watch your favorite team.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service, always excellent food, and a surprisingly good beer selection. Love the special bowl/burrito variety and quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] If your going for a high end sushi but don't want to spend too much money, this is the place. Aburi sushi was the highlight and a must try!  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious original gyro. Service is fast and pleasant. I'd come back. YUM. This is for the food truck!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent subs at a reasonable price. A huge variety too for those picky eaters that can't decide on what to settle for. Come with an empty stomach and enjoy a great turkey and ranch or one of their other 100 subs!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Diet "Surf!" flavor (mint-colored labeling, Hibiscus Mint flavor) is really good! Tastes much better than some of the past flavors. It's refreshing and gives me non-jittery energy when I really need to focus and get stuff done at work.  [END]
[BEGIN] 2 beers, 2 shots, a Voss water, vodka martini, and amarrouto sour cost us $44 at late night happy hour. A very chill atmosphere with a touch of some western class made for an enjoyable night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Jamaican Food Reminds Me Of Back Home! Its A Bit Of An American Taste But It Comes With The Territory Of Having A Jamaican Restaurant In America But Nonetheless Very Authentic! Service Could Be Better But I Don't Expect It To Get Better For Personal Reasons!  [END]
[BEGIN] Contemporary design. Bright. Clean. Enthusiastic. Comfy. Tasty. Choices... Like: Delicious food, service, free parkings Dislike: Prices, not accept credit cards  [END]
[BEGIN] The service is fair but I must say the cooks are what makes the place what it is. The food is GREAT... Omelettes are excellent as well as the pancakes. Expect a wait time....  [END]
[BEGIN] This fairly new restaurant in the Beachwald area. It is very clean and the service is good. The food is good. Many times they are busy and have trouble getting a table  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good coffe, so many options, friendly service, clean place, free wifi, clean restrooms, parking lot.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is HUGE, has tons of stuff, and is pretty well organized as far as Forever 21 stores go. I wasn't able to spend a proper amount of time last time I was here so I have grand plans to visit here again and do some damage :)  [END]
[BEGIN] This place can get very busy on the weekends. Great little restaurant. I like the 'healthy start' breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it, kinda wish them sell taiwanese food snack too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably the best pizza in Wellesley/Needham. I really like the "Farm Fresh" pizza--potatoes, cherry tomatoes, olives, arugula, etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just tired this place. It was very good. Ordered Larp Chicken, which was not on the menu and they made it for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it. Close, Affordable and the scenery is awesome. Sadly, no gripes about this one....well maybe my terrible golf game.  [END]
[BEGIN] Always good food always consistently fast friendly service... Probably best Chinese food in the Vancouver area... Great hot and sour soup which is my way of determining if a Asian restaurant is worth a second visit!  [END]
[BEGIN] Can be a little backed up at times, but this place is great. The Coppola add cheddar! So good! The almond pesto aioli is super good. The sourdough bread is a great pick too miam miam  [END]
[BEGIN] The oysters were good! We also tried the house ceviche, but I would pass on that and get more oysters if I went again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Buffalo chicken wrap and jambalaya are awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] Even though this place is a zoo to be in the make your own sticky rice roll is delish. You can choose from 5 different fillings and they prepare it in front of you. I always choose the purple rice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ate here last night and was pleasantly surprised! Food was delicious but could have used just a bit more meat in the sandwich! I got the torta de Milanesa! I will def be coming again! It was cooked fresh and quickly! Bread was perfect!  [END]
[BEGIN] Still think this is a great place for a cold beer! The food is good and the service is great! Pricing is very good too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for a post gym lunch and it was great. I had the spring rolls and the Bloody Mary. Both were on point and the staff was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried make-my-own bowl and their signature bowl. My bowl I made tasted so so lol. Their signature poke was tasty and save time to think of what combination I need to make my bowl tasty. The Wasabi Basil dressing was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for a Chinese buffet. Very clean and neat. Men's room spotless and well stocked. The buffet is hot and fresh. From the soups to the salads everything was very tasty and well presented.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was so happy to discover a yarn shop so close to my home! I love taking classes here and find the staff very helpful! There is a great selection of yarn too. They have everything that I need to complete my projects!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great burger but need to clean the place more often. Most tables left a mess and bathroom is just not clean. Every time I go feels like they just got slammed with a crowd. Also beware outside tables are loose. Still a good burger..  [END]
[BEGIN] 30% off everything on Mondays and Thursdays. Darts and pool. This is not a dive bar. It's a dive lounge, and I love it.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice hotel, but I expected more for the price. I stayed there about a year ago and barely remember the room. That must mean it was just typical. But very clean, which is always a plus!  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful property, we have stayed here many times considering it to be our home away from home. Really close to WDW. Great staff, beautiful amenities, villas are beautiful inside, spacious and fully stocked. My family loves this property!  [END]
[BEGIN] I live closeby, so the location is perfect for me. All of the breakfast tacos are pretty good, and I think their coffee is very solid as well. The underground area is pretty nice for eating or hanging out. Careful with the tacos though, they're very hot at first.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best juice place there is but prices itself out of being an everyday place. Unless they're being charged double what other smoothie joints are for their fruit or their labor is paid twice as much, be prepared to drop 12$ on a cup of juice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved our experience here! Quiet, wonderful/friendly staff, and excellent, fresh food.  [END]
[BEGIN] the Snug is good food, good beers, and great entertainment. The food is fresh and delecious. I've never had a problem there. The beer is ice cold. It can get loud but nothing outrageous overall it's a great place  [END]
[BEGIN] Looking for the latest pair of designer jeans? By George has a great selection of designer jeans and trendy button down shirts for a night on the town or for looking your best at work. Men's department is at the right hand side of the store.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a great evening with our server Caleb. Food was good and Caleb provided outstanding customer service. Would recommend the pretzel bites and ahi tuna flatbread. Dirty martinis with blue cheese olives are the best!  [END]
[BEGIN] This was an interesting find. The food was very good and the service was friendly. Small place but seemed to be a pretty popular place. I will stop here when I come to Austin again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff accommodated my request to check in early, which I appreciated, and they got me into a less expensive room, which I really appreciated. I still felt the price was high, but overall the hotel was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] All I have to say is maple bacon donut will change your world. On the weekends, the line can get extremely long and it's cash only.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been to Fuji numerous times over the years and it is great! Nice bar seen. fresh sushi and good service. Drinks are delish and my friends and I had a great time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent Burger, I had the Cowboy and good service. Good place to watch the game with friends, lots of big TV's.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quesion fundido: awesome. Rajas poblanas puffy taco: awesome. Pork chili verde: good enough. Bourbon burro cocktail: fantastic. I'll definitely be back to try more stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic food, large portions, attentive service, nice ambience. The korma is my favorite. I don't like spicy food, and they always prepare mine mild as requested. Tried the buffet once and didn't enjoy the selection.  [END]
[BEGIN] You can occasionally find some really cute and unique gifts here, but sometimes I feel like it is just really overpriced However, it is one of my important stops during the holidays because they do have a good selection of small, sampler goodies that can round out a weak gift.  [END]
[BEGIN] My mom and I stopped in for a quick drink while I was waiting for my flight back home. Our waitress was kind and attentive, and the drinks were tasty. I'd love to stop in for dinner next time I'm in town!  [END]
[BEGIN] I could not believe how very good the food was. We happened upon this place while traveling and suffering through traffic. When they told us it was cafeteria style we almost left, I'm glad we didn't. The food was awesome and the staff very pleasant.  [END]
[BEGIN] The chicken is great with a nice crispy crust and a great level of juiciness. The Cole Slaw is finely chopped with a nice sauce that's not too creamy.  [END]
[BEGIN] not going to win any style points but the food is cheap, plentiful and delicious. six bucks for a (seemingly) two pound plate of curry. The cashier asked if I wanted a sprinkling of cilantro...I almost cried. happy tears.  [END]
[BEGIN] Triple berry pie was delicious, the lox on a bagel was AMAZING. Wish there was more seating because it gets really crowded, but when you find a good seat the free wi-fi makes for a nice office away from the office.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered a half n half pizza for carry out. Half pepperoni and half peppers with tomatoes, it was made properly and on time. The crust lacked in flavor and thickness so I had to knock off a star. Cheap pizza, taste good but not great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been a customer here for a few years now. Yummy food, never stale, friendly service, and is delivery and take out. I suggest the garlic chicken rice and all the appetizers. If your not into spicy, dont get the tom yum, there is plenty of other deliciousness on the menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheesiest breakfast taco I've had in Austin. Nice job!  [END]
[BEGIN] A great atmosphere for studying. The space accommodates for collaboration or room to spread out and work. It is a very positive and productive space that provides amazing lattes to fuel the mind! I can't wait to come back and try more  [END]
[BEGIN] California Burrito in FL, as weird as it sounds taste great and I was in Cali a week ago so my palette hasnt been "cleansed" as yet. Not as big like in Cali but just as if not more flavorful.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of my favorite diners in Boulder, just gave it 4 stars being so far out of the way being out near Valmont & 119. Food is always very good, and service is fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Such a cute place with great flavors! I enjoyed their rum raisin one a lot- def recommend it!  [END]
[BEGIN] the chilaquiles here are pretty good the burrito is legit one of the best veggie options in all of atlanta and real talk: one time I was eating on their patio and owen wilson walked by  [END]
[BEGIN] Really nice place. Great atmosphere. Wish there were more parking spots. Some of the servers are clueless. But overall a really nice place :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Not fussy or pretentious. Well executed simple Greek/Canadian good. Chicken souvlaki was nicely cooked. Very moist. Restaurant doesn't look like much from outside, but it's a nice family feel on the inside. However, not as inexpensive as you'd think it would be.  [END]
[BEGIN] First of all food was very good , but like others posted service was poor. Got seated pretty quick then once we did we had to wait and watch others getting served before us that got seated after us. Teach your staff better or hire new ones  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere. They have a mariachi band come play for you. Just make sure you get the right order and if you don't read Spanish, make sure you know what some stuff is. I will definitely return though!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good food all around. The dishes taste fresh with unique favors. I feel like I am eating very healthy when I eat here. One of my favorite Chinese restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good thai food. Big portions for good prices. Ambience is very nice & decor is stylish! Great place for a date night or just a nice family dinner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decided to try here after seeing so many reviews. The food was good. We got the Co qui van (?) chicken dish and the bouillabaisse (mussels) and it was pretty tasty. Far as being a frequent diner... Hmm, not sure, will try more places in boulder....  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here because our usual vote place was closed, pleasantly surprised, good foot, good service, can't complain  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little shop on the mall. They have nearly anything culinary which is great. The coffee selection seems to have dwindled. Though definitely worth stopping in to check their unique selection of goods.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious. Everyone raves about the sauces, and those were up to par. It's difficult to find, but the staff is pleasant. I still prefer Gus's World Famous fried chicken, as this chicken wasn't as crispy. I'd compare the chicken to Chik-fil-a chicken strip texture, as opposed to KFC.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is my one of my all time go to Italian places in Atlanta. The menu lineup is wonderful and the service is pretty good, too. More than anything the ambience is what draws me into to, be honest. A solid choice for date and even business dinners.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'd never had cuban before but we got the slow roasted pork and it was fantastic. We capped it off with the tres leches cake and I must admit it was heavenly. I will go there again SEVERAL times!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is really good. Got Benzino's sauce on the crab and it was a great choice. A nice gesture are the gloves they give you. The only critique is the tea. They need a new recipe because it's not the typical "sweet tea"!  [END]
[BEGIN] You sit down, pick you selection... Order everything on the menu (more or less).. They bring it out and you ponder how you could ever finsh everything that was ordered... 2 hours later.... you wonder where did it all go...  [END]
[BEGIN] I know people complain about the smell in the elevators...but I've been taking them and I haven't had an issue. They have been clean and prompt...no bad smells setting off my morning sickness.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location but very busy. Excellent staff. The food was good and the baby enjoyed hers. That's about it.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's been awhile since I have dined at Gators. I must saay the new menu is awesome. Mercedes was our server and she is a great addition to the staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] In Atlanta and need celebrity brows and lashes check out Jazmine! Great experience especially the wine and champagne! Oh, and that's without an appointment. Thanks Jamie for my great brows!  [END]
[BEGIN] The sushi was fantastic. As were the appetizers. Out waitress was friendly and attentive and the kitchen staff was courteous and polite. I recommend checking out Happy Hour from 5-7 for some GREAT deals on rolls and drinks. I will be going back very soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had Time Square, and it was great!! Never had beaf tongue in sandwich, but I really like it! I accidentally found this place, kind a small and clean. I guess popular for locals.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would have given them 5 stars but they forgot my tea. The waitress said they were in the middle of service. She offered me my tea but it was too late. I was done eating. Food was good. I'll definitely comeback here.  [END]
[BEGIN] I can put these tacos down like tic-tacs... one of the greatest taco places you can go  [END]
[BEGIN] Great local place for seafood. Consistently busy but you can reserve a table in advance up to 30 min prior.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food and wine we're amazing! The restaurant is very cozy and warm. The service was mediocre. If Jennifer is your server try to get seated somewhere else. She was unfriendly and inattentive. I would give this place another shot in hopes of better service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap and very good sushi place. I have been buying Sushi there for 3 years now. I would highly recommend it. The only negative side is that it's very small and at the rush hour times eating in would be almost impossible as the place will be packed.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was really happy with this place! The service was perfectly friendly and fast, the food was fresh and tasty. I got a shredded beef burrito enchilada style (the #3). It was very filling! Their green sauce is possibly the best I've ever had and the salsa was also yummy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Boom... I love the Taetertot special. Rice with Tuna wrapped in egg for $1.25. Three bites of goodness and relatively cheap. That's how I like it. I'm a regular because of how easy it is to eat there when you don't have time! Thanks Sushi TOWN!  [END]
[BEGIN] The only reason it doesn't get the 5th star is bc it's pretty expensive, but other than than that...delicious  [END]
[BEGIN] What a fun store! The clothes were strange, but the knick knacks, dishes, and furniture were cool! I got a couple of great items and plan to frequent this shop when I hunt for treasure!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pro's: -Great route-setters -Laid back atmosphere -Student discounts -Decent protein bar selection -Nice little climbing shop in entrance -Staff are always helpful Con's: -Very busy on weeknights -Slow route-refresh, go more than twice a week and you will quickly get bored -Crowded bathrooms with poor privacy  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been coming to Lucille's since I was in college and it's never disappointed. The food is always super good and the beignets are pretty good too. It's probably some of the best Nola food that I've had outside of Nola.  [END]
[BEGIN] The breakfast buffet was delicious and fresh. Eggs and pancakes made to order, fresh fruit and juices, and a decent assortment of baked pastries and cereals. A little pricey even for Orlando, hence the 4 stars. Service was supreme!  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing beer and everyone that works here is so kind. Only down fall is that they don't have food but.... they allow you to bring your own or have it delivered. I love it!  [END]
[BEGIN] very delicious food, but soda and water taste very much like chlorin. they have nice background musik and the american waitress was very helpful and attendive  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic service, great food. I got the Kansas City Strip steak and it was very well prepared, melted in my mouth. Yum!  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the show..for a first-timer the Helium maze to get to the Main Room was daunting, intimidating, and totally unnecessary.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was great service could have been better and there was an issue with them not havering items on the menu  [END]
[BEGIN] Interesting menu - really good food - casual vibe - but *expensive*.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful service - very attentive. Food was good. Waiter let us add one crab cake to our order so kids could try crab. Kids loved it! Thank you!  [END]
[BEGIN] The queso flameado is very good! and so is the grilled pork chop  [END]
[BEGIN] My dog and I enjoyed our visit to this store. They have a lot of different gourmet treats for dogs. Friendly service was also a plus. Things are not cheap but I guess that comes with healthy pet treats.  [END]
[BEGIN] There a lot of great bites on the tasting menu here. This restaurant is more of a social experience, if you go with a group I'd suggest ordering every item on the menu to share.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had xiao long bao, fish and meat. All of them were really good. Also, my Chinese friends like this place very much.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great staff, wonderful service. The wine list is top notch, and the wine by the bottle prices are pretty good as well. The steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and the side dishes were done well too. I highly recommend the Boulder Cork  [END]
[BEGIN] Has just opened up recently downtown. Friendly staff quick service. Just only had a coffee and strudel today and it was as usual. The size of this location is smaller than other ones around it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was great! Attentive and very friendly! Food was delicious! We had the vegetarian nachos and split a Big Rig! More than enough for two! Great happy hour prices too! Will come back again and for the music next time!  [END]
[BEGIN] We get pizzas, subs and various entrees from here pretty regularly. The pizza is pretty darn good, much better than the big chains and their delivery service is excellent. The rest of their fare is decent if not great. I definitely recommend them, especially for their pizza.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delivered our king sized mattress & box spring from US Mattress. Scheduling was a breeze, they arrived on time, and they were friendly / careful. Would recommend them for a delivery.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place serves very good Cantonese food, especially the roasted duck and the house fried rice. We also tried the salt and pepper squid which is also very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] My preferred airport parking. Most drivers are helpful and congenial, though there is the occasional grump. I am constantly dismayed at the customers who insist on putting their own bags onboard seemingly to avoid tipping.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stuffed buffalo above the bar!! Not as in food but taxidermy. Points for that. Also, great margarita options. Always crowded but not skeezy. Young crowd in a good way. I'm a fan when there's room for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] This show is VERY CHEESY. I love it, others may not. There are a few very cool effects and a very high energy tour guide/ actor. Totally worth it for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] i have got take away from here many times. this is my closest indian joint. it's good, and consistent. haven't had a bad fish from this place. great pickles!!!! their naan is really awesome as well. i always get extra.  [END]
[BEGIN] What can I say about 360 Pizza? Junior and his crew make the best pizza I've ever eaten in Austin. On top of that, Junior is the nicest guy in the world. Highly recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is usually busy, but they manage the crowd well. People cannot get a table until they have actually ordered. The burgers are unique and delicious, I had one of their salmon burgers. The fry orders are huge, so I would recommend sharing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent diner, always friendly staff. Food isn't the greatest, but usually hits the spot when I crave diner food. Fresh OJ is excellent, portion puts me right to sleep. Kid friendly, although my baby daughter didn't enjoy the mascot bear walking around as much as I did :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location in Austin. Quiet, relaxed atmosphere. Very good coffee, cappuccino and espresso drinks. I recommend the iced Americano. Creating a proper espresso based drink takes time, and they do it right. So sit back, relax and enjoy... Cheers!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this tourist trap. Right on the water. Close to the Childrens Museum. Wish they still had the crab rocks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummiest ice cream I've found in Vancouver to date and I've been trying all the spots :) I really enjoyed the Whiskey Hazelnut. It was super creamy and had a lovely light whiskey flavour. It was full of crunchy fresh tasting hazelnuts.  [END]
[BEGIN] Posto does some of the best italian appetizers Ive had since living in NYC.. It also boasts one of the best bartenders I've met in Boston! Sit at the bar with Ian !!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Gotta love this place! Good ole neighborhood bar and the steak frites salad is to die for!! All the servers and bartenders and very pleasant and this place has awesome daily specials and even live music pretty often!  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly, local cafe with very good food! Very pleasant staff. Was able to get a 1/2 portion to avoid waste. If I lived near here I'd be a regular  [END]
[BEGIN] BTone offers a great workout that will leave you sore in places you never imagined! Instruction was clear and offered options for beginner, intermed & advanced, so no one is left behind. Look forward to my next visit to Boston for a mega workout!  [END]
[BEGIN] They make the most gorgeous custom shirts. Check it out. GREAT FOR: I think a custom shirt would be a nice graduation gift, any thoughts?  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was amazing except for the lamb shish kabob which was undercooked. Not big on the dancer that came out every 20 minutes but I know that's just part of the shtick. Other guests at my tabellen enjoyed it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dark, moody, and fun. Great date place, but also a good place to go with friends and gab for a few hours over drinks, while lounging against comfy pillows. The menu doesn't have a ton of options, but the middle-eastern style food that is served is yummy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location near my hotel! I could just walk around the corner. Great service! I sat at the bar and was acknowledged immediately The Blackened Chicken and Shrimp Salad was more than I could eat. Really fresh and flavorful!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] My friend and I stumbled upon this cute little salon after being turned away at another nail spa downtown. The staff were fast, polite and efficient. We had a nice spa pedicure and exfoliation and foot massage for a bargain! (Half price of downtown spa.) I'll be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a burger. We went on a Saturday morning. The staff was pretty quick and efficient. The burgers were melty goodness. The tator tots rocked! However, the onion rings were stringy red onions... not bad, but not what I expected. I would recommend if you are in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recently bought a cake for hubbys 40th bday. It's was just him and I so the small 4" cake chocolate cake was perfect. The staff kindly helped me with the order since it had a bit of detailing. The cake was SO TASTY... and not too sweet.. just perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place. I am a simple girl. I like that there are not a lot of selections...but the ones that they have are good. The owners are nice and personable. I look forward to returning!  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm addicted to this place! Love my usual, Wintermelon Green Milktea with Herbal Jelly and Boba! If you set up the app, it's just more convenient and they give you a $4 credit to start! I prefer their drinks over Cocos. If they start serving food, that would be awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious! Laid back atmosphere. Great place for a quick bite to eat or a drink before a movie  [END]
[BEGIN] 天津+日本的串燒小館子 評語：中式和日式料理都有水準，價錢也合適 「擼串燒酒場」是一家剛開業不久的新食肆，店舖地址前身是一間叫"Cucina Manila"的菲律賓快餐連鎖店。新店接手後從事全面大裝修，高身木條的靠背卡座既保留個人空間却沒有局促的感覺，天花垂著的和風吊燈十分精緻，加上座位放滿不同圖案的大型靠墊更增添不少舒適感，店家在室內設計上真的下了不少功夫，值得讚賞。 「擼串燒酒場」的地方不大，中心通道兩旁設有八個卡座，每套卡座可以容納6個人同時用餐。至於餐點方面款式不多但却包含中式和日式兩地料理，早餐時段供應中式的天津傳統小吃例如「煎餅果子」「豆腐腦」，午市供應日式套餐，而晚市直到零晨時段則變身成為日式居酒屋，提供串燒和關東煮。大家來到不妨同時享用這裡的特別中日兩地美食啊！ 天津煎餅果子 $4.95 ~ 口感有如雞蛋煎餅包裹著薄脆吃，外軟內脆，很有特色 (3.5/5分) 煎餅果子是中國北京和天津地區的著名早點小吃，材料由綠豆麵薄餅，雞蛋，還有餜子（油條）或者薄脆的"餜篦兒"組成，配以甜麵醬，蔥末，辣椒醬作為佐料，口感鹹香 豆腐腦 $4.50 (4.5/5分) 豆腐腦是天津的傳統風味小吃，近似上海館子吃的鹹豆漿，最大分別是天津豆腐腦會加入濃稠獻汁和不同材料 ，鮮香可口，豆腐非常嫩滑月 日式香煎雞扒飯午餐 $8.50 (配味增湯+日式海草沙拉+玉子燒) 4.5/5分  [END]
[BEGIN] Good and decent Chinese food. It is kind of pricey, but I'd highly recommend this restaurant in this area. I think this is one of the best Chinese restaurant in this area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very much liked the Nicoise salad. Well-prepared and quite delicious. Also enjoyed the cocktails I had - they have a nice selection of craft cocktails.  [END]
[BEGIN] really cool little authentic spanish tapas place with a ton of small plates on the menu. highly recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] I could eat the warm potato salad forever. The wait to get in and eat on-site is usually pretty crazy. If you get takeout, your order is ready inside of 15 minutes - and you can run over and eat at Schiller Park when it's nice outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] We went on the 2nd day so it was pretty packed. Great ramen, awesome location, and friendly but inexperienced staff. Love the variety and options. Def recommend for work sponsored lunches!  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't know how this place stays in business, as I'm usually the only one in there when I go. Regardless, I LOVE LOVE LOVE their chicken tom yum soup. OMG good! Makes me happy whenever I get it. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is great... What makes this PANERA stand out from the rest was the service I got. Kelly was awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good!!!! I came here with family and had a very good meal. The jerk chicken wrap is amazing!!!! When you come be mindful of their hours, especially on weekends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lots of menu items and reasonable. Bill is the owner and there full time- he will steer straight. Fridays are the pulled pork sandwich day. Not overly tangy but a hit indeed.  [END]
[BEGIN] good for after work drinks and a snack big space, always a crowd. bouncers don't give me attitude like at most of the other boylston places  [END]
[BEGIN] Was here last Saturday night. Good drinks. The music was incredibly loud, BUT it was good music. The female, brunette bartender is SMOKIN' HOT!. Also watched High Infidelity on the TV's. All we needed was closed captioning...GREAT TIME! and did I mention the bartender we had was smokin' HOT?  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nearly perfect pizza. We are always happy with our order and delivery is a snap. Closest NY/NJ pizza I have had yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gyro's are good.. could do with a little more lamb. Greek salad is phenom.... great feta cheese.  [END]
[BEGIN] I LOVE this coffee shop. The staff is so courteous and the food is amazing. I would suggest trying the basil lemonade and the salmon patties. I do wish it stayed open later. Also a couple of the servers aren't always on point. Outside of that fantastic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good wings and fast service! Only $1.50 delivery charge too! Good for take out or delivery, but sit down lacks some atmosphere. It looks vacant from the outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best chicken salad sandwiches ever! So fresh with nuts, grapes, and veggies. My son had their cajun say and he was raving about it. My daughter had their grilled cheese plate, that came with fresh fruit, gold fish and gummys.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there for the first time a few days ago. The owner (Andy, I think) was really nice and helped me pick a delicious wine. Nice to sit outside and watch the world go by on Fremont. Great place!  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried the chocolate ganache cake and lemon tart. The show stopper was the lemon tart. So lemony and so delicious with a slightly crunchy caramelized sugar on top! I'd go back again for lemon tart.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best part is ordering take out and waiting in the kitchen. I also love the sign that says something to the effect of "we won't take your order if you are on your cell phone."  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I came here due to groupon. We were so happy about the food and price that we bought more groupons. They have a regular soft paper with Chinese translation and you have to ask for it. It has a few more dishes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good fresh sandwiches and salads. That sourdough bread and those marinated carrots though...  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent blue cheese burger, solid wings. Wedge salad was good too. Service really shined. Very happy to have a great dinner option on West 2222.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went in for the first time in February for my free birthday burrito. It was clean and orderly. I was the only one in line so I'm not sure how swift they are when crowded. The employees were nice. I plan to go back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Possibly the best Mediterranean food I've come across in Atlanta. Loved their kabob platter and falafel. The Gyro is also very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kenneth N.'s recommendation of Thierry's macarons persuaded me to return. Smooth crust. Chewy cookie. Light creamy filling. Reasonable sweetness that does not overpower the flavour. Yum. I haven't had a disappointing flavour to date.  [END]
[BEGIN] ディビジョンのローカルなフローズンヨーグルト屋さん。自前のキャラも作って、お店も広くて清潔。店員さんのホスピタリティもよい。ソルティピスタチオを頼む。ピスタチオはローカルなもの使えないだろう‥し、ペーストの良し悪しがモロに出ちゃう。ここのはどうだったかというと、しょっぱ過ぎてわからなかった‥昔自分の最初のお店を作った時、ソルティキャラメル味を出したら、友達のアメリカ人から、スイーツに塩味なんてありえない！と言われたが、時代も変わった。人種や宗教、性的嗜好に関係なくという外の張り紙はパウエルブックセンターでも見たが素晴らしい！  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome vibe, and VERY good tempura. :) My companions also had very good things to say about the sake, though I myself had none.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was amazing ! But it's just as pricey as all the other restaurants in Disney would be. I recommend the duck but the Korean beef was a little salty. Good atmosphere and service, just wish the price could've been adjustable  [END]
[BEGIN] Staying here for a convention. Well appointed room for the price. Good beds & pillows. Safe is really small - won't hold a laptop.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like fried chicken. I like spicy. Basilisk has both in equal measures. Huge pieces of chicken on my sandwich and the basilisk sauce had a serious bite. The fries were good as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] The owner was very knowledgeable and she took an hour just to help me out selecting the right dance shoe. I wish they haven't moved that far because I live in Vancouver but if I ever need another pair of dance shoe I would definitely come here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good food. Excellent choice for lunch. Valet parking is only $2. Don't be cheap!  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome food...awesome service. .Jordan was great!!! Only problem was smokey from the grill when we for here... I would recommend this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I could eat that green salsa all day on anything!! Delicious food, excellent service , hot and crispy chips, everything was fresh and well-prepared. Even the rice and beans were specials. And what a cool building! Highly recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mate Chai, breakfast burrito. It's what you do when your girlfriend goes to work and you are relegated to be a part of the Boulder mid-morning-to-afternoon coffee shop occupiers. I can't think of a nicer place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had brunch there. It was good. An 8 out of 10. I would go again. I had the Florentine omelet... It was a little dry but tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] We like this place because they are pet friendly you get a warm fireplace the food is great servers are always good to the beer is the best  [END]
[BEGIN] Good deals on burgers on Tuesdays... only 5 bucks. Sat in the bar.. good wait staff, good food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good, uncomplicated, thin crust New York -style pizza. I've been back multiple times for their inexpensive and satisfying ready-to-eat slices. The chicken cutlet sandwich is good too, and I've heard the Thanksgiving sandwich is excellent. Service is fine, folks were friendly enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been eating here since I was in middle school. The cheeseburgers are delicious, roast beef better than Kelly's and friendly service. Always happy to eat here whenever I'm around.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love coming here for their tasty crawfish whenever I am in Orlando!  [END]
[BEGIN] The loaded nachos are unbelievable. Food is great here. It is a must do when in Dublin. Bar service is average at best. Do not expect fast drink service though. Overall a good spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took my TV in that was having issues keeping a picture and staying on. A few days later TV repaired. Nice staff and fair price. Will return for future electronic repairs.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is so cute! The prices aren't too bad and the service is friendly =) I'd definitely skip their Japanese style breakfast though. The salmon was overcooked and bland. The waffle breakfast was delicious though =d They include a chocolate whipped cream with it! Mmmmmm Free wifi too =)))  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun place to eat but it often gets busy and then it's not as fun. My favorite is the jammy Davis jr. Spicy sweet and yummy!! I get it ever time  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pizza!!! This was easily one of the best pizza I've had. Easy on the budget. Local place where everyone knew everyone. Only added to the experience  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the sangria! But, the quesadilla de nopales is the big winner! Sooo flavorful and way too much to eat. My husband and I always share. The Happy Hour is excellent!! Love all of the La Costita's !!  [END]
[BEGIN] A wide variety of flavorful pasta and sauces. I wouldn't recommend for the Ragu and white pasta fan. Very casual atmosphere. Comfortable setting and quiet patio.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Ramen place for the price and location. Ordered take away. Served fast. Order the original and was satisfied. Good sized serving.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good burgers, awesome fries! I also like Main Root soda selections.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best deals in Boston. Not quite as fancy as some places downtown, but the quality is good and there is a ton of variety, esp. for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quick, cheap, good quality eats. I got the pork kimchi and grilled shrimp tacos. Both had a ton of authentic Korean flavors with the spicy kick! Super cheap with my total being around $7.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our new favorit pizza place! The strumbolli is GREAT too! The service could be a little friendlier or maybe poliet is the word but the Owner is a Great guy. So far all the items we have ordered have been AWSOME!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good vibe. Lots of seating. Cleanish bathrooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Over all this place is good... my visit today was just ok.. the pork servings this round were very small... but still it was good...  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent as always, superb food with outstanding service. Very cozy room for 2-4. Not good for a large group, for that go to Gaslight.  [END]
[BEGIN] been twice to Austin, twice to Terry Black's. this place is amazing, great food and great brisket.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yup. Cafeteria food. Just like the school food in the good old days. Soft veggies. Fried chicken. Great deserts. Sweet tea. Get a tray and slide it down picking what you want. This is what a cafeteria should be.  [END]
[BEGIN] In the past I've been disappointed with the customer service. It was so bad i actually came back the next day to share my experience with the manager. The last two visits have been the complete opposite. The employee Zach was extremely professional. Keep up the good work.  [END]
[BEGIN] THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD. My mom had bland fish and chips and my dads fish was good. The dessert was pretty good even though my dad said it was microwaved. It was huge. I am begging to go back to have another delicious burger.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is very good and reasonably priced. I come several times a month, and I'm never disappointed. Anything with the shrimp is delicious. The drinks are average but the service is always great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fresh delicious food!!!!.. Fast Service Clean and attractive environment. I have been there more than once and went back again because I was pleased with the experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dining Services location, deliverable to dorms. Includes a small C-Store to get snack/grocery items as well as pizzas, subs, and wings. Breakfast and lunch available for pickup. Overall great quality for low price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ate here for lunch today. I got the classic gyro. The meat was excellent and generously portioned. The vegetables were fresh. The tzatziki sauce was a little different but still good. Overall I would definitely recommend trying it and will be going back for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Generous portions and prompt service. I'm not a big Thai food connoisseur, but I did find everything very tasty. The decor inside the restaurant could use some sprucing up, but, yet again, I didn't go there for the ambience, but for really good Thai food.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got breakfast and my hubby got sandwich. Both were good. we thought the portion was smaller than expected. but the quality was very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I haven't tried much of their menu but their salads kick ass! Every time I order a salad I order it with grilled chicken and God knows what they marinate it in because it sure tastes heavenly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to stop in Austin. Food was great and the beer was cold. It's a little pricy but definitely a good spot for a one time stop.  [END]
[BEGIN] I work nearby and come here for a sandwich every now and then. The sandwiches are fantastic. You get a big filling meat packed grilled sandwich for $8. It may take 10 - 15 minutes for a take out sandwich, but it's worth the wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good prices, meat slices ample in their pho. tasty. went there late at night around 10 pm. easy to get to. don't miss this pho next time you need a place to eat in Surrey. Ample walking space and the restaurant dont feel crowded.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is fantastic! I liked the shrimp and pot stickers. The cowboy burger was cooked perfect and their ketchup is awesome. Will definitely come again  [END]
[BEGIN] There's some good curry here. Just remember to order extra meat because they're extra chintzy when it comes to that.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is SO GOOD! I'm a vegetarian, and I always get the falafel plate. I ask for extra white sauce packets too because that stuff is amazing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel like they decreased the portion sizes which I don't like.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm definitely a fan of the Vancouver Aquarium ... loved the Beluga show the best ... the Beluga whale is super cute ... I'm pretty sure it waived at me as I was a front row seater :D  [END]
[BEGIN] Good sandwiches, simple menu, limited toppings, but fresh cut meat right in front of you is kinda cool. Employees can be hit n miss, I wish the one lady would stop signing though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved it! Located in a nice place in Dr Phillips. Ordered the philly stake croissant with eggs and it was delicious!  [END]
[BEGIN] Tasty breakfast, but expect a cold blast of air during the winter every time someone walks in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mas caro do que deveria ser, porém muito saboroso! O molho Bacon- Parm é uma delicia.  [END]
[BEGIN] If there is a new location or very similar food for the price, please post it here and Send me an Alert!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good on all counts. Great seating outdoors. Smart server. River view. Wonderful sunny, Sunday afternoon. Probably stayed longer at our table than we should have. Good, good food served in a timely way.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sat at bar. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Great bottled beer list, wine list, and spirit list. (Plymouth Gin!) Had the burger and fries. Super juicy and sloppy: just the way a burger should be! Will definately be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] yum, yum, yum. great, fast food. love this place. benedicts are spot on and everything else is delicious too.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is an institution in East Boston (and for the rest who know about it )and serves great italian food(pizza,lamb!) in a family/bar setting. The reviews speak for themselves....I have no words.....  [END]
[BEGIN] I got the veggie scramble and my boyfriend got the el Marcos, and we both got mimosas. All delicious. The atmosphere was my favorite part, super homey. My only complaint would be that it's not really one dollar sign, more like two, but still worth it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Simple cafe but food was good. Had the shakshuka. This cafe is perfect if you want to dine in or take out. Good service, simple.  [END]
[BEGIN] Portions outrageous. Usually can't finish. Food better the second night. Servers very helpful and friendly. Will go back again and again  [END]
[BEGIN] Was here for an event in one of the meeting rooms that are available for rent by day in the building. What a great spot! Open areas for working with breakfast and lunch available at the cafe and also at the restaurant inside. Coffee and breakfast sandwiches were great!  [END]
[BEGIN] We didn't eat any food but it's the most authentic Irish pub we've ever been too. Good atmosphere on a Saturday if you're looking to party, otherwise I'd pass. It gets pretty packed and loud. All-in-all it was a great place to stop and grab a beer  [END]
[BEGIN] An Italian experience! Pizzas ok Nutella pizza is amazing lol, located in Disney spring! Great customer service  [END]
[BEGIN] Great venue for various concerts and events in the Atlanta Area. Very safe. Parking is easy to access. Make sure you get there early because lines can be long! Overall I've had great experiences at the Tabernacle!  [END]
[BEGIN] A big fan of this place. I have yet to have a bad meal or experience here. I love the salsa. Really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Shout out to Dakota from our visit last week. He was great. Only downfall is the parking.  [END]
[BEGIN] AND they have vegan donut options! We love this place, if you are visiting...skip the VooDoo and have a Blue Star.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was good chicken. The bone in chicken was spicier than the chicken strips, however neither was too spicy. The sides were also very good. Only 4 stars due to the chicken strips being a little greasy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Consistently our go to Chinese place. Good food and always quick! Very nice people who work there.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this place. Their happy hour rocks. The tamales, picaditas and the drinks were all great as was the service. I will definitely be recommending this place!  [END]
[BEGIN] They were so freakin' nice and welcoming. They described every menu in detail. I loved the twist on tacos. I'd love to see more vegetable options soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for Valentine's Day with the kids. We are pretty picky with our Mexican, but we did not have any complaints. Everything was great, including service.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was great but the service wasn't the best. We waited there for 45 minutes before we got to even order. Otherwise, the food was amazing and their pancakes were spectacular! I would definitely recommend it, but makes sure you have time.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went for lunch so the burger wasn't on the menu. The whole time there I felt the place was trying to be a Holeman & Finch for the everyman, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. A diamond in the rough for sure in the cheesy, North Buckhead market.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great fine. Service was excellent. Very well priced menu with the usuall favorates. I always try a new thai place by ordering yellow curry chicken.....was not disapointed. Inside is very warm with tables and booths spread confortably. Think I'll be back to this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food. Better cocktails. Need a multi person men's room. Their old fashioned is great! Onion rings are grreat!  [END]
[BEGIN] I got the captain crunch donut. It was really good and fluffy. I wanted the Voodoo Doll donut but they were all out :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, good prices, wonderful atmosphere! I highly recommend this place. Compared to the restaurants around it, it's one of the best!  [END]
[BEGIN] I've only had the Philly Cheesesteaks on Wednesdays, and for the price they are damn good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I walked to this place on the weekend when it was not busy. This place looks great and the product were very familar with the product from Daiso in Richmond. Anyway, I brought a Smart Grip for my phone and it works great for taking phones with my phone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service, people, atmosphere, & bakery. Espresso was a bit burned. Honestly a neat place, I will definitely give it another shot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow, I was surprised at how great my natural foods burrito was. I couldn't believe it was $20 but that's the price of quality ingredients I guess.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great value at New China Express. The food is good however there is better Chinese food out there. The portion you get for $6-8 is great. The place is always clean and fast with good service. I highly recommend for lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummy crapes. Smoothies tastes better than the other that I have tried.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very yummy/ healthy food. Not too salty or greasy. The staffs are very nice as well! Will go back for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] This bar is a perfect example of what makes living in Austin so cool. It's funky, laid-back, has plenty of seating, eclectic crowds, and great music.  [END]
[BEGIN] fast, friendly, and safe way to get to and from Red Rocks - good customer service  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was fast, beer selection is good. Great place to watch sports. Very affordable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality = A Variety = A Healthy = A Choices seem really sold. No place to sit, ONLY To Go orders., hard to find; a little pricey, but i'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Go. The food is magically delicious and the service is wonderful. They have some of the best egg rolls I've ever had. My husband got the grilled pork chop which was divine, so divine we ordered another to take home. I'll definitely be returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good... love the orange chicken and fried rice. My 10 year old daughter loved the shrimp lo mein. I would definitely recommend.  [END]
