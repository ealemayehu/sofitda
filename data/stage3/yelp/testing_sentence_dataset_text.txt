23532 They don't have enough servers to cover quite a few open tables so they have guest wait and stand for other parties to finish their meals. What a waste. So non efficient. And why aren't there enough servers on duty anyway? 
23533 Delicious gyro meat; very juicy and flavorful. The service was excellent, and they even brought us free Greek beignets to sample! Yum! 
23534 Service wasn't great and the food wasn't all that great either. I had a fajita special and shrimp was hard and needed flavor. I've been to many seafood restaurants would not recommend this one. 
23535 Food is great back for my second time to try buffalo chicken sand which. Amazing food with hush puppies. The cinnamon roll is a must. 
23536 Nathaniel and James are paragons of customer service and have dramatically improved the quality of my life. Every time I'm in here I feel like I gain 15 IQ points with the superior quality of assistance I receive. I will continue to be a loyal customer. 
23537 Perfect place to catch a concert. Bands are always great, good priced beer and great open atmosphere. Its usually 15 to get in, but think of it as helping the band out. 
23538 Their taco and torta are great!! However the wait time is super long too especially during meal time. 
23539 I'm not sure why, but this location is strange. The decor is bizarre and the food is only okay. Nothing to brag about. I don't enjoy the drinks there either. Opportunity for improvement. It just opened a few months ago, so hopefully it gets better. 
23540 Probably the best Chinese food I've ever had. Love it. Setting is casual and you never wait for a table. I work nearby and order take out all the time too. And I like that you can get low-carb veggies instead of rice. 
23541 So happy to find Halal place in downtown! Affordable food and they have baklavas and konafa!!! 
23542 The waitress ended up being very nice but they didn't have a lot of menu items, probably almost half the menu. It was a Saturday, about 4pm. They were showing Nigerian soccer on the tv screens so that might be a plus. They do have beer and wine. 
23543 We had a great meal here on a rainy day. They were accommodating of a toddler and generally warm and welcoming. 
23544 Gotta love a Great Mexican that is also BYOB. Been here three times and never had bad food or service. 
23545 Fantastic quality & excellent service!! Only thing I struggled with was that my scallops had a few several gritty bites. But that might just be how scollops are. But I'd recommend this restaurant, for sure!! 
23546 Convenient location, friendly staff, fast service -- and no more expensive than you'd pay anywhere else. 
23547 Dr. Debaghi is one of the finest people and greatest docs around. The entire group at Austin Gastroenterology are truly first rate. Perry Minton 
23548 Great service! Great food. Everything came out in a timely manner. I will be coming back thank you khiet! 
23549 A little pricey for what you get. The crispy chicken tacos were exceptionally good, but could have fit in a lunchable. 
23550 Had the best time celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. Hung was our bartender and made sure to make our experience unforgettable! Happy hour specials can't be beat. 
23551 Nice Italian restaurant. We did takeout. Was told 20 min ended up being 10 min. Great service and friendly atmosphere. We will eat in next time. 
23552 This is the place to go for pie and rice crispy treats. Pie was amazingly good. Nice atmosphere and great service. Had the marionberry pie and my dad had a chocolate pie both were exceptionally good. 
23553 The Coffee Cream Truffle is one of the finest chocolates in the history of the world. 
23554 Quiet, good food, hot drinks, and great meeting location with friends or business. 
23555 Soooo good! Tried their blueberry, lemon poppyseed and matchstick espresso! All very good. Be prepared to wait in line but it's worth the wait! Will definitely be coming Back soon! 
23556 Lines are awful. Long line for tickets, way longer for popcorn. There's so many people in line at concessions that you can't even get to your theatre. I wanted popcorn, but not this bad. There's a whole second half of the concession stand that's closed. Why???? 
23557 I favored from here. Idk if maybe because I favored the food wasn't up to par but I def didn't think it was as good as the hype. I'm def giving it another try soon. Kinda feel like the price is a bit over priced as well. 
23558 Great staff, great food, great beer...a lot of love and care goes into this place. One of my favorite places to sit, have a pint...maybe get some work done on the ol' computer. 
23559 These guys are great. I own a property management company and they've helped me out a bunch. Reliable and easy to work with. 
23560 We went here after getting married and they were so accommodating! I almost always get the salmon BLT because it's THE BOMB. 
23561 Great atmosphere in the outdoor dining room. Great for a small dinner party. Great wine selections. As of recent the chef has lost his edge with only mediocre execution. 
23562 This place is adorable! We had our granddaughters 2nd birthday party there, they decorate, had balloons, party plates and cups. Besides the amazing play area there were plenty of seats for the adults too. What a great day! 
23563 Top notch Fried Chicken. Same quality as you'd find at the original Gus's in Memphis. I love this place, and I place it at the top of the Fried Chicken list. 
23564 LOVE this place and the fact that it's in my neighbourhood! Great food, excellent portions, friendly efficient service! The California Rolls, Teryaki chicken, salmon bento box, tempura, all very good, so much I'll be having leftovers tomorrow! Will be back again soon... 
23565 The food here is amazing! Come hungry and leave with a happy belly. 
23566 When I get to work and don't have time to pick up lunch I call JJ's. They are very fast. The only complaint I have is that sometimes I get an upset tummy after eating here. But I tend to get that with a lot of fast food places. 
23567 Love Belly! Excellent service, really interesting wines and great space. 
23568 Went to this bar after a derby game. Was really delicious. Had a few of their speciality cocktails and was very impressed. Everyone settled on the Moscow Mules as the crowd pleaser. The derby nachos were really tasty. 
23569 I absolutely love this place. Really good food and the price is very reasonable. Just wish there was more seating 
23570 Outdoor stage 5-stars Indoor stage 1-2 stars Also, someone shit on the toilet seat.... 
23571 As a veganish Portlander, this restaurant is a romantic date in dish. The little portions of pickled treats (kinchee, bean sprouts, and spinach) are like a valentine. Yay!!! 
23572 Paolo Castro is rally a nice guy, he is humors patient and always trying to solve the problem for me. Thanks a lot to him I got my C63S model! 
23573 Not much to say about this chain. All the food is the same. But I love this place! I always come here late at night and always leave full of regrets from all the fat is consumed. But I don't think I could ever stop going :D 
23574 Yeah we buss it down ..fish,jallop rice and plantains He ramp the chicken before I post ‚Äç 
23575 no detail went ignored in this fine dining experience. the restaurant and service is on point. definitely a place that will impress the foodie, the business client, or the lady on a date. bottom line... you're getting laid. well done, 3fiveVII. 
23576 Great experience. I'm from Chicago but reside in Nola. It wasn't Chicago style but it was better than anything in Nola. The girlfriend didn't care for the taste of the dough but I loved the crust. The white and spinach was my favorite! Service was great. Definitely no complaints. 
23577 Nice people and location but I did not like my haircut. I even went back to have it fixed and it got worse. My angles are uneven and my layers are choppy. :-( 
23578 Very clean store, friendly staff, I found the prices are cheaper than Dallas. I wish there was an HEB near me :( 
23579 I have to say, I've been coming here a lot lately. Vicky? Always gets my order right and the food has gotten much better and I love the salt and pepper egg plant. My only request is vent the boxes for anything fried, otherwise it's mush. 
23580 As a frenchman, I always look for places to compare to. I can honestly say Thierry is amazing. Great choice of pastries and deserts, great service, great location. 
23581 Without the opening is Pandora I would have never discover this gem within Animal Kingdom. The portions look small but after you enjoy them you realize that was just right. The restaurant is fancy, elegant with an actual server!! The food is excellent, so far the best octopus ever!!! 
23582 Went here for dinner last night. Was very pleasantly surprised. The food and drinks were absolutely delicious and the service was excellent. A great atmosphere overall. I will definitely go back soon. 
23583 Went again recently. So much better than when they first opened. The soup now has great flavor. Also love the complimentary pickled veggies bar. I think the specials make the prices more reasonable. 
23584 Best burguer in town. You can actually get out feeling good and not dragging back to work. Perfect sizing, cooked to order, real ingredients and plenty of options. My kick-off the weekend choice 
23585 Love some of the jewelry here. They carry lots of different styles! This little store is packed with lots of eye candy! Good candles too. Lots on sale right now... 
23586 try the fried green beans! the dipping sauce in excellent. super friendly service too ) 
23587 I've been here twice for gel pedicures now and I have to say I'm impressed! The ladies are always super friendly, and knowledgeable. I'd definitely come back here again! 
23588 Great food. Awesome service. My go to place for soondubu ji gae. 
23589 I had this to go. It was really good! Had the red curry. It was packed with flavor. I will definitely go back for more. 
23590 good food with okay value for lunch time! we had ordered 2 combos and some nigiris, the overall is decent. 
23591 Beware - I paid over $900 for the scope/camera and the jetting and the service fee and it did NOT include location. They wanted to charge an additional $150 for location even though they had the camera in the line. 
23592 Freaking amazing. Nuff said. No not even think about going here and not ordering the brussel sprouts 
23593 I had an open-faced gyro platter and soup with shredded chicken in it. They were both excellent. The staff are extremely friendly and the service is excellent. I will definitely be back. 
23594 I'm always taken care when I come here. This is a great Friday, after-work place to start. Had the fish n chips, mixed sushi, salmon flat bread, sake and beer. Nice decor-felt "fresh" just like the servers. Prices are a bit "spendy" but in line with the comeptition. 
23595 This is still my all-time favorite dental group! I just got back from my 6 month check-up and couldn't be more pleased. Nothing of concern this time. 
23596 Blegh. Stupidly-overpriced and annoying staff. Not worth the trek to Chinatown at all. 
23597 Came here for brunch. Everyone was amazing from the pork smoked ribs, brisket sos to the bottomless mimosas!!! Good vibes! 
23598 Our server Chris made sure we had a mimosa before it was gone:) he was the true definition of bottomless----in a great way! Awesome brunch, we'll be back in a flash!!! 
23599 The instructor Vitality has really bad attitude about rescheduling lessons with students. JUST a plain money making school, no quality. Has no patience for students, lacks common manners and should be fired. 
23600 This restaurant has an amazing view of the Columbia River with lots of outdoor seating. However, they lack in service (slow and rude at times). Could be a 5 star restaurant, but needs better management. Will return for the view, and make exceptions of the service via tip. 
23601 This was a pleasant surprise Staying at hotel across the street Gave it a try Heavenly food Fresh and well prepared 
23602 Best coffee in Portland. Think I'm joking? Check it out. It's SERIOUSLY good. I just got a mocha and it was the perfect combo of chocolate and coffee. It wasn't even sweet - it was just....perfection. I'm a fan of subtly flavored coffee these days and Barista delivered. 
23603 This is a comfortable, clean mid priced option near the university campus. I was here for a conference and would stay again! Room was spacious with a comfortable chair and lights for reading. Owner very responsive. Convenient parking and modest continental breakfast! 
23604 Excellent food! You must try the chicharron tacos they are amazing. I've been here several times and the service is great. They offer a delicious lunch buffet as well. 
23605 Very impressed with the food and the service. I got a delicious carnitas burrito with guacamole and all the fixings. It was a huge burrito that lasted me two meals. A little greasy but that's unavoidable with carnitas. 
23606 Simple, cheap, fast, and good. Awkward space, limited seating, no reservations. What's not to like? When I think of restaurants in Chinatown, places like this are the reason I go there. Chow foon, mooshi pork, and fried dumplings for $21! We left full. 
23607 The Turkish eggs for brunch were delicious. But my friend got the noodles and they were bland and needed a vegetable to cut the starch. Seems expensive for what you get, but I minded this less because my dish was yummy. 
23608 Cancellations and sub-par service make handy.com a huge waste of time based on the multiple times we've tried to use this service. Very stressful dealing with them and I would recommend you avoid it. 
23609 Really cool spot. Hops hang from the ceiling. They have a lot of outdoor seating if it's a nice day out. I had the Sweet Heat which I highly recommend. 
23610 loved this neighborhood gem. Service was friendly and professional from the hostess, bar tender and server. Knowledgeable too. Food flavorful. Atmosphere welcoming. Embrace this local treasure fellow Windermere/ Winter Garden residents. Wine selections a bonus to a great meal. 
23611 It's not bad, it's average food, a little greasy. I had the fall sangria... Not good at all. The onion rings are really good. The service is ok too, not great. Overall it's not a place I have to go back to, but definitely worth experiencing at least once. 
23612 Great food and good service. It's a pretty relaxed setting and very close to downtown in a quiet neighborhood. I was apprehensive going in because of the low Yelp rating but I'm glad I did. 
23613 Excellent food and service! We took my dad here on a Friday night and we had a great meal. The ambience is warm, friendly and pleasant. I recommend the cob salad with one of the beers on tap. 
23614 My friend took me here and their food is amazing! Very small place but don't overlook it! Sidechick sandwich was bomb. 
23615 The staff at Body Ache Escape is incredible. They genuinely care about their work and providing the best; most therapeutic care possible. Kyron has so much knowledge and understanding of the body and his massages are AMAZING! And acupuncture with Stacey has changed my life. She's the best! 
23616 Cute little shop with very nicely designed pastries that also taste good. It was pretty pricey but I felt like it was worth every dollar. 
23617 The Blueberry basil, Valrhona Chocolate Crunch are both awesome. But my overall favorite it the Passion fruit cocoa nib is top notch. Highly recommended. 
23618 Price is fair. The salad was good; kind of taste like Peruvian. The Sha Phaley, yes, is similar to Chinese meat pancake. I would recommend anyone to try this place. 
23619 I love Bdubs! Garlic spicy or hot is the best for me! Great place to watch football and eat some wings with a great bar to wash it all down! Burgers are just okay, but the wings are delish! 
23620 Sierra is AMAZING. everyone else is meh. Sierra totally made my day, tho. She's a smart cookie! She rocks. 
23621 Mekong River on 6th Street in Austin is CLOSED. I bought a Groupon on Saturday, went to the address listed, and the doors were locked, nothing inside and the phone number is out of service. 
23622 Chicken gyro, so good! If you aren't a fan of a lot of Dill seasoning, let them know because they put quite a bit on the potatoes and hummus. Definitely will be back. A lot of food!! 
23623 Great sushi! Went in last weekend, definitely the best I've had in the area. Nice bar and very polite staff. Don't remember the bartenders name but he was great, wasn't sure what to drink and he was very helpful with suggestions. 
23624 Best Wendy's in Columbus. Unbelievably fast. Line will be wrapped around the building during lunch and you'll be out of it in 5 mins. Fast and friendly! 
23625 I have to say I was a bit hesitant with the reviews but it was really tasty. We had the lamb burger, mushroom Swiss burger, and the breakfast burger all were good. The patio was really nice and we had wonderful service Sara was fantastic! We will be back. 
23626 I could forgive the deeply mediocre tomato on my sandwich, since Sorelle is a bakery first, and not a sandwich shop. But when the bread itself is the worst part, there's no going back. Too sweet, not fresh. Will not return for sandwiches/bread, might try a treat in the future. 
23627 Nice convention center with plenty of water fountains and bathrooms. Several conference room facilities everywhere of all sizes. 
23628 Such a disappointing experience - definition of bouncers on a power trip. Honestly I would never recommend this place to anyone 
23629 Best tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich I've had in a restaurant, period. 
23630 Here is a quiet little gem of a place. Try any of the "five-flavors" dishes: beef, chicken or fish. Easy on the palate and wallet. Laid back ambiance. Enjoy! 
23631 Good good but staff rude and felt imposed upon when answering questions. Treated my family with disrespect. This is not the same Blacks service you get in Lockhart perhaps because it's not the same owner. 
23632 Fantastic friendly baristas, my fave coffee. A group of us from work walk to get coffee here every day. If you haven't been here you are missing out. 
23633 Canton Junction commuter rail stop. Who knew??? Fantastic coffee in an unexpected location. Not open on the weekends (yet). Highly recommend checking it out on your way into the city, or if you are just in the Canton area. 
23634 Recently worked on a project with Shan from Club One Concierge. She was very professional, and extremely easy to work with. She goes above and beyond for her clients. I will recommend her company to people moving forward, as I know they will be taken care of! 
23635 My first Philly cheesesteak ever so I can't compare it to others but damn, it was beautiful. One of my new favorite foods. 
23636 It's called FD's Grill now, but same menu and delicious margaritas. Great food and great prices. Nothing mind blowing... Just good food and drink at reasonable prices. I'm a fan and so's the wifey. 
23637 This place is amazing !! A must have is the tuna nachos it's a very nice size and delicious ?? 
23638 If you are a doughnut lover like me, this is not the place for you. Without the icing or sweets, the dough itself is tastless and very heavy. Coffee isnt good too. I guess thats what you get when you go to a vegan place. 
23639 This was a great hotel for the money. Flight got cancelled in ATL and I booked Here for $76. Perfect place to sleep the night and head back to airport on free shuttle. 
23640 Food is getting really bad and the server...sucks, took 45 minutes just to get us the bill. 
23641 Whole Foods may be overpriced, but I still love its wide selection of deli. Tasty sandwiches, sushi rolls, salads, hot food, and the quality is constant. Good place to go when too lazy to cook. 
23642 Got three cupcakes, three huge chocolate croissants and a sweet roll with white chocolate mousse for $20. All were delicious and the atmosphere is great. Would have given it five stars but only had a few things. Looking forward to going back. 
23643 Very nice people running the place and I feel bad to give a bad review however the meat is always dry and they really need to season their food. Very bland and lacks flavor 
23644 They treat their members right! I got $200 hiking boots for $5 at their return sale, plus a couple of sweet pairs of sandals. Wonderful. 
23645 This place is very popular with locals. The food was delicious, fresh, and served exactly to order. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. The staff also seemed to work together seamlessly to make all the customers happy and full! 
23646 Very convenient to Disney world and other resorts and highly affordable when compared to what you'd pay for a room at Disney. Nice pool and even a mini pool on the back of each condo. 
23647 I would skip this Disney signature dining experience. The food is solid but unspectacular. For the price, I would go to Jiko, Monsieur Paul or Citricos instead. 
23648 Here for southpaw and the cold brew here is out of sight! Never knew in all these years! Thanks Alamo 
23649 I always enjoying getting bubble tea from here. Good variety of flavours. Just beware of the parking, they will tow you 24 hours a day. Saw an unfortunate car get towed. 
23650 Had a really good experience buying from them online. They have a great communication with their customers through email. I would use them again when buying flowers for Parkrose area. Highly recommend. 
23651 Great place. Wonderful place for breakfast or brunch. Gets busy fast. A must for foodie types. 
23652 Definitely lives up to its reputation! A nice open space with lots to look at and such delicious donuts! 
23653 Woot! This place made me finally sign up and write a review. Thanks Evitas for a slam dunk dinner. 
23654 Best Russian store. Kalbasa here is really good. They have a good coffee shop next door. Come do your shopping here! 
23655 If I remember correctly wings are great (considering they are baked) but not enough to keep me coming on a regular basis. 
23656 Amazing. Friendly, great owners. New Yorkers with class. Food was awesome. Got the NY Dog. 
23657 This place is fantastic and authentic. It's one of the only places I can get goat in the US and feel like it's well cooked and delicious. Service is good. 
23658 5 stars just for the metal!!! haha Pizza was hot, good price. The place oozed downtown fiber of Austin! KEEP AUSTIN WEIRD!! lol 
23659 Awesome place good service. Amazing fries and a surprisingly good beer selection. A little pricy but you get what you pay for. 
23660 Probably my favorite happy hour in Portland. The food is to die for, the cocktails are creative and the servers do an amazing job... Not to mention, they are SMOKIN hot. Yum. 
23661 Great food good atmosphere. Love the variety of different tacos and salsa 
23662 Loved our tour with Juan and Eric. They were both informational and entertaining 
23663 It is great to see students who are friendly, proud and enjoying what they at doing. 
23664 By far the best place I have eaten at Disney!! I had the Wagyu... AMAZING!! Made my mouth water. 
23665 Most delicious place on south congress! Classy, and great for an arrange of events. Birthday dinners, Brunch, and everything in between. I'm always happy to take the special and a glass of wine. The wine selection is superb. 
23666 Great atmosphere at Pointe Orlando plaza. I ordered the shrimp and crab nacho which were delicious. We also tried the asparagus fries with a fantastic aoli. The service was great and prices were reasonable. 
23667 Rude costumer service. I wish I could pump my own gas too, but unfortunately I can't. 
23668 Love this place for the smoke chicken with Costa Rican flavor. It's a gem in Lake Oswago. The price, service and portions are great. 
23669 Lingering shade has a beautiful building and a great location. However the vibe is more Avalon than Beltline. Drinks were priced decently but it's definitely missing the cool factor. 
23670 Mmmm, great breakfast tacos. I almost always get breakfast, but everyone I know loves their regular tacos also. This new location is pretty convenient, and has plenty of seating. 
23671 We are from California and we don't have candlepin bowling and wanted to check it out. Tons of fun! Owner was super helpful and was curious our thoughts of the game. Highly recommend stopping in 
23672 Great ramen!!! just like in Fukuoka, this is a most try. The place is small but the service is really friendly and fast. worth to try it.You can customize the thickness of the broth and noodle. 
23673 Such delicious pizza! I am not a huge fan of pepperoni pizza but I couldn't pull the slice out of my mouth... THAT good! Freshest ingredients, the pizza dough is just perfect... mmm definitely have developed a serious craving! This location is open on a Tuesday - bonus! 
23674 Mandatory stop in Atlanta. Can't get better puertorican/cuban food anywhere! I've been visiting this location for around 5 years and it never dissapoints. Service is quick, staff is friendly food is excellent, and the coffee is the best there is. Literally everything on the menu is excellent! 
23675 Good enough Tex-Mex food in Back Bay. Prices are reasonable, and food is yummy. Nice enought place to sit outside in the summer and relax with a beer while watching the people stroll by on Boylston Street. 
23676 Doc Green's is a pleasant joint to eat healthy and enjoy a great meal. The atmosphere is inviting and the salad options are tremendous to choose from. I favor the buffalo chicken, but any salad is great. 
23677 Crappy and slow as hell. What the heck. Greasy burger and the bread too. (Frisco) and fries. 10 minute wait at drive through. Terrible. Never again. I was the 2nd car in line....no excuses. Sorry, but true. 
23678 Best tacos in town. Authentic Mexican food. Definitely the best spot for "Tacos al Pastor." Greatly priced. 
23679 Booked the one bedroom suite for 2 nights during st. Patrick's day week. Better than expected. Our room was conveniently located near the mall and eateries. The Green line was around the corner which was great after walking all over the city. Definitely would book here again! 
23680 I'm not crazy about Thai food so I have always gotten chicken fried rice here. Pretty tasty although I recently found a small rock in mine. Very small but a rock nonetheless. Nice staff, and choice of spiciness - 1-4. Also not much chicken in the chicken fried rice. 
23681 1Nov15 around 11am for lunch. Three of us had bowls and one had a burrito. Everyone liked the bowls. Good but nothing to write home about. Burrito person thought it just ok. Seemed a bit overpriced. Good service. Nice ambience. 
23682 Surprisingly delicious! I saw the high number of stars but still expected this to be mediocre bar food. I was wrong!!! The Mexican bowl (can't remember the name) was delicious. Their cocktails are also amazing. Quite possibly the best old fashioned I've ever had. 
23683 Edit: since my last review, Oscar is no longer there, that's a shame.....he was awesome:( 
23684 If six stars were possible this restaurant deserves every one of them! We've eaten in many fine restaurants around the world and this one ranks among our top favorites. New residents of Orlando this was a wonderful find. Just wish they had veal on the menu. 
23685 Very dirty and old hotel.... everything was sticky and worn down.... and the breakfast was a joke... you can choose some bread or some Waffles .... the staff are friendly .... but overall definitely not a good experience... will not be back 
23686 Worst.pizza.ever. Think: soggy bread. Maybe their other dishes are better. I wanted to like this place so I hope I am right. 
23687 This was the most painless and comfortable Brazilian wax I've ever had! Lexi did a great job both to detail and in distracting me. I will definitely be back! 
23688 I've been to this venue twice. Once on a Tuesday. They had crab legs and great hookah. 2nd time I went I got a shrimp pasta and not so great hookah. But I enjoy this spot and the swings. The bartenders are tentative as well! 
23689 Great food and service. If you're new to Ethiopian food they have a straight forward and easy to understand menu. I got the meat lovers tibs with lamb, beef, and tilapia. Everything tasted great. 
23690 I had the best fries here, so crispy. That is important! I ordered a chili cheese burger and it had very delicious HOT peppers on it, which I had requested. Yum and double yum. I might come again tomorrow. 
23691 I came here while waiting for my car to be ready at Sullivan Tire down the street. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the extremely friendly waitstaff. I would definitely come here again! 
23692 Responsive, quick, reliable and friendly service. We have 'priced around' and consistently find Sho's to be very fairly priced. We're now comfortable calling them first to schedule any work we need done on our vehicles. Thumbs up for Sho's! 
23693 We went to a few different stores to try to find color matching ties to my bridesmaids dresses. We Finally ended up at this place and received soo much help. 
23694 Okay. They make doughnuts. Very good doughnuts. Unique flavors. A bit expensive for what you get, but a nice treat. 
23695 I love their open dining area and the breakfast/brunch here is pretty amazing. I'm always debating if it's worth the price, but the food is always tasty. You can also pick up the free WiFi from the Hive co-op space which is a nice added bonus. 
23696 Now a former Dunkin Donuts junkie after experiencing the great coffee, bagel sandwiches,and prices at Atomic Cafe. Also very friendly and welcoming staff and atmosphere. 
23697 Wow from the customer service; to the scrumptious Fried fish to the Mac and cheese sweet potatoes and corn dressing to the tea to the peach cobbler omg heavenly heavenly heavenly... true definition of Grandmas kitchen real real real soulfood awesome sauce to you guys 
23698 Dr. Pepito and her staff are incredibly kind, gentle and patient. They have great hours and are always courteous and accommodating; I recommend them to everyone and appreciate their professionalism and the relaxing atmosphere. 
23699 This is hands down the best Chinese food around. And it's not American Chinese food. Mala fish is awesome. And their sechuan menu is amazjng. Did I mention the hunan menu? What about the pineapples after dinner?! Complimentary pineapples slices!! And their lunch special?!?!?! Don't be crazy. Go to Zoe's. 
23700 The grand Floridian is awesome! From the minute we pulled up we were treated like royalty. The staff were so attentive and clearly loved their jobs, it was really good to see. We have enjoyed our stay very much- we just wish we could stay longer!! 
23701 Presentation wise, the food was outstanding. I am 97% sure that the crudo misto is what threw my digestive system out of whack for nearly three days though. Comedenti caveat! 
23702 Nina is absolutely amazing, she worked wonders on my hair. She gave me blonde highlights and trimmed up my hair, I don't trust many people with my hair but she is someone I'll always trust! Thank you Nina for doing amazing and I'll be back soon! 
23703 Man I love this place. The best Mediterranean food I have had in Texas so far. I just can't get enough of it. I always get chicken shawarma over rice and falafel. I can have this 3 times a day, 7 days a week. 
23704 Enjoyed our time here! Got the IPA and the tropical fruit sour...laid back vibe in industrial area, if I lived in boulder I'd be back here all the time! 
23705 Nice atmosphere and great selection of wines. Nice alfresco seating. Kitchen a bit slow, but food was good. Portions are tapas-sized, so best to order 3 items for 2 people. Great happy hour deals until 7. 
23706 A good spot to have cheap bottomless mimosa if you don't mind having cheap champagne & the long wait. 
23707 We had a great time during Bands Brew and BBq. The food was awesome and the shows were fantastic! !!!! Much better service than other theme parks in the area. 
23708 All the food I got was ok except the calamari, which was truly horrific. Soft, soggy, bland, fishy, pretty much everything that could go wrong with it did. 
23709 Not only is the staff polite and accomadating but both Dr. Jill Ellison and Dr. Don Ellison are the best in terms of professionalism and patience. I now drive 35 miles to reach their office but worth every minute for such service and experience. 
23710 First time here and loved it! Reminds me of little French cafes in Paris. The Steak Frites was so tasty and the Creme Brulee had that wonderful crunchy top. Will definitely return! 
23711 Wonderful donuts! The best was the maple bacon! We opted for trying this place over Voodoo doughnuts are were NOT disappointed. Staff was extremely helpful and patient during our selection. Coffee is great! Would definitely recommend! 
23712 South Congress Cafe has amazing salads! We got the Arugula & Apple salad with an incredible white cheddar vinaigrette dressing and the Warm Goat Cheese salad with field greens and maple balsamic vinaigrette. Holy Moses! This is my new favorite place for salads. 
23713 Very cool Irish pub. Just as an Irish pub should look and feel like. Loved it. 
23714 After moving to Somerville from CT this was the first spot I went to and the mashed potato bacon pizza was pretty good. Cool little place with great service. 
23715 First Interesting and equally wonderful quisine we've come across since leaving the SFBay area. Lamb chops rivaled Kokkari's. Loved this place. Wish they had a place in Bristol RI... 
23716 The food is way too rich to eat on a regular basis but by God is it an amazing splurge! 
23717 Very welcoming atmosphere. My server was kind enough to explain the syle of service and even asked me if I eat dairy. I loved getting to taste all the different dishes. In my opinion the food was good enough, didn't blow me away but overall I had a great experience. 
23718 this is one of the best places to go on a date! the menu items are creative and will satisfy your tastebuds! dimly lit settings in this very mod and chic atmosphere will make even the ugliest person in the room look beautiful to you! 
23719 got out off the heat this past weekend at Wilfs, enjoyed the music, great sangria, very tasty and beef filet very tender. Staff was fun with good service, attentive but not too much, and it was cool! meaning temperature, very relaxing, will visit again soon 
23720 It was just ok to me. I had the bacon cheeseburger with fries. It comes with 2 onion rings, the onion rings were not good. 
23721 Perfect pizza. I recommend olives, and use some seasoning too! They even do delivery! 
23722 One of my favorite places in atl!!! Best spicy kale salad... The pad thai is also tummy! Not to mention everyone in there is so friendly! 
23723 Very friendly and my friend Don says they have the best chicharones. I myself like there carne Asada. 
23724 Very Impressive and prompt service. Very professional, on time, and very clean. Highly recommended. They are a bit pricey but did not find them outragous given we are in Boston. 
23725 Love this place. The good wolf burrito so good. The atmosphere is not your average Mexican place have more a arty feel to it! 
23726 By far the best Thai food in town. There isn't a bad dish on the menu. Love the place, just hard to find a parking spot. It is good! 
23727 I sat here for hours while I was visiting Portland. Excellent people watching. Pretty good service and delish pie! Be sure to have cash, they charge for small amounts charged to your card. 
23728 Good pinball selection, great beer selection, smiling Service and a variety of pies to punch into your gut. Get your Pinball on with a brew or two and a slice o pie with a breadsticks, take some marionberry soda home. 
23729 Good food. They even have buffalo seasoned falafel & it was delicious. Grape leaves good. 
23730 One of the best salons in the locality. They understand what you mean when you say "I just need a trim"! 
23731 Service was spectacular. Food was really good. A little cramped. A little loud, but that's not abnormal in the north end. The pork chop was a little dry, Very good flavor though. Also had the vegetables, which were done perfectly. 
23732 I don't really know what Tibetan food would taste like. So, I am not here to judge it's good or bad. 
23733 Good art, friendly staff, clean/well-equipped bathrooms. Excellent Chinese House exhibit--a must see during your visit. 
23734 Had to take the plunge again. Every time we come we have to make sure we ride this ride. If you want to cool off in the middle of a hot day, highly recommend you take the plunge as well. 
23735 Great food and service. Tacos are super stuffed and flavorful. Like all torchys it does get pretty on lunch and dinner hours as expected. Their chips and queso is delicious. The Brushfire tacos and the chicken fajita tacos are my favorite. 
23736 Great service. It was recommended that I check online before opening a particular tool and low and behold it was unnecessary. I got to return an $8 item for a very workable $0.99 item. Yay honest salespeople. I'll be back!! 
23737 second time here [Northern Liberties Philadelphia] with my family, great food, great service, my girls happy, my bbq burger w/ root beer float, on point, we will be returning. 
23738 I'm a foodie and this place really exceeded all my expectations! House made sausage was delicious. Food was as good as any top restaurant in New York. Wine list was reasonable with many gems from small vineyards. I wish I could go again tomorrow! 
23739 We got a mint mocha here--yummy! The wood fire pizza was calling our name, but we kept telling ourselves, no it is not time for us to eat. They also have a cool little window where you can order without going inside. 
23740 Hands down this place has the best cheese steak and the best chicken whether it's boneless, fried, buffalo doesn't matter ! The chicken is awesome. 
23741 My friend told me they had an amazing Cuban sandwich, and he wasn't kidding! Complimented it with the Brussels sprouts and got the exacta! Highly recommend...and great tunes as well :) 
23742 Bought some clothing items here, was able to leverage the 15% student discount. Some folks at the cash register are very nice, some are not - just depends on who you get! Lots of souvenir options. 
23743 Horrible. Why do they spoil the name of South Indian restaurant. Dude I cook better than you guys and I am not an expert. 
23744 It smelled great when we walked in, the food arrived quickly (Mondays aren't too busy but there were plenty of patrons), and it was delicious--like, really delicious. Hearty portions and the right price...and I even had a non-gluten-free beer. I'll be back. 
23745 Food was great..omelette especially. Our waitress was very nice and polite. I would recommend for a local breakfast spot! 
23746 I love this place! Everything I've had so far is delicious, plentiful, filling and a great buy. I'm glad they are proving that healthy food can be rich and delicious. Their burgers are great and the nachos are amazing. 
23747 Very cool little ice cream shop! They have a friendly staff and the ice cream is delicious. Will definitely be coming back again. 
23748 Great flavour and fresh food. Soup was great. Both the fresh and fried spring rolls are amassing. Server was very attentive and friendly. Clean and comfortable environment. Will defiantly be back. 
23749 Good stuff!! They know how to make salsa and the drinks are nice with a good patio seating. 
23750 Great cupcakes perfect for a snack, dessert, or breakfast! It's small and can get crowded with very limited seating. 
23751 The puffs here are a bit dry but get the job done. It's nice that it's in the same room as bubble tea and that makes a solid combo 
23752 There is not enough space to fill with raves about this place. Best coconut cream pie EVER. Well, best any-kind-of-pie EVER! Red velvet cakes rocks too. 
23753 Ordered for delivery so not sure if it doesn't travel well but the Malai Kofta and Saag Paneer weren't amazing. The naan was more like a flat bread than usual naan. Have to yelp the good and the bad I guess... 
23754 Beautiful restaurant. Hostess didn't even greet us and wasn't pleasant. Pizza & food was good. Wait staff running around like crazy busy. Took forever to get check and never got a second drink. 
23755 Worst pedi my friend and I have ever had! Loose skin left around nail, polish did not cover entire nail, and it was smudged when she put on my sandals. Her fix was to paint over smudged polish. 
23756 Leslie was born to be a masseuse, I have had many massages over the years, and she provides a fantastic massage. 
23757 Pretty great. It's a bit spicer than I usually except from Thai food... But it's good.you won't regret grabbing a meal here. I'll be back! 
23758 Great service! excellent food! The cost of food is average. The ambience is warm, cozy & beautiful! 
23759 I usually go on Monday nights for the half off entrees, best deal ever! The mojito is pretty good too.......love the atmosphere and the people are very friendly 
23760 Really great service. Had to have my tire patched due to a nail. 30 minutes and I was in and out. Will definitely be coming back when replace my tires next year. 
23761 Excellent tour for beer lovers, they explain how beer is made, ingredients that goes in the beer. You can eat beer and drink beer on the tour, smell hop. On our tour we were offered three types of beer to taste. 
23762 Horrible. Food was tasteless and bland. The guacamole was a mix instead of fresh. Not to mention the restaurant was super dirty and No paper towels in the bathroom. Don't waste your time. 
23763 Pretty good Jamaican food. Jerk chicken is good, sauce is spicy but you can put it on the side. Brown stew chicken has a good flavor as well. Coco bread is hot and seemingly fresh. Great lunch spot to visit. 
23764 They're not as good as they're cracked up to be, in my opinion, but they're still very good, and substantially better than pretty much any other donut in town, as far as I'm aware. 
23765 Fantastic experience for my birthday party. Drinks were really great. Food was better than your average bowling place, but a few items we tried were just ok. Staff was friendly and attentive. Would definitely recommend. 
23766 We had a great visit here. There were 7 in our party, including 3 children. The pizza is really good, the location is great, I can't complain about the service, and it's good for both a family night or a night out with friends. 
23767 Great subs. Fresh turkey, ham, roast beef. Solid chicken cutlet too. I have eaten here a 100 times. 
23768 The food was definitely good, but the employees were a little confused, didn't seem to know what they were doing. 
23769 I have shopped @ Ace for years, largely in part to the convenience of its location. After tonight, NEVER MORE. I might be a woman but I know when a bottle of booze isn't right. I don't t appreciate being talked down to. 
23770 Horrible service. Please avoid going on any weekend nights and avoid this location. PF Changs has great food but just the overall experience here has left a bad taste.. 
23771 All employees that I interacted with were friendly and professional. I did not have a long wait time. Just love their front office look! 
23772 My family ordered from Stonington's today. The 6 cheese macaroni and cheese was delicious. I love the crunch on the macaroni and cheese. The salad was so good....lettuce, tomatoes, kernel corn and sesame seeds. The crab cake.....oh my goodness! What are you waiting for?......go get yours! :):):) 
23773 Farm to Fork goodness!!! Watching them prepare our meal was like watching someone cook in their kitchen. (Fun!) Food was amazing! Great flavors, fun drinks! 
23774 The owner did a great job on our Westie! He looks great! A very cute shop with affordable prices. Makes me happy to support a local business. 
23775 The doughnuts are awesome! Great vegan selection for my wife, the music, although, completely sucks and is WAAAYYY to loud to talk or even think. May take home, will never stay and eat again. 
23776 Small place. Music was WAY too loud. Waitress was very "loving" and good. Food was decent. Very much a hipster, bohemian place. Not a calming experience. 
23777 Nice people. Got my MA inspection, but they took cash only. They have a $25 minimum for gas. 
23778 I am a loyal customer of this bank and I always recommend this bank to others.great customer service and new technologies and features, they up to date. 
23779 I am here for a short term assignment. A nice spacious, comfortable apartment in a very central location. I am very happy here. Management and staff seem very nice. The one bad thing is the terrible comcast WiFi. It makes skyping home a difficult experience 
23780 Stopped here twice while on a bachelor party in Austin. Amazing BBQ (the brisket melts in your mouth). Great place to stop to get a real Texas BBQ experience 
23781 Went back for their weekend brunch and it was delicious. And, we were happy to see that the Bollywood videos are back. Great food and great service. 
23782 Cute cozy interior. Small menu, but great Benedict and skillets. Especially enjoyed the country Benedict served on a biscuit with pimento hollandaise and collards. 
23783 Beaches has been a family favorite for the past 10 years. You can always count on friendly service and a great atmosphere. Their food is some of the best. Vancouver is a better place because of beaches. So many memories are made here. 
23784 Love this place. Have been to the one Memphis and am glad they have opened one up right here in Austin! 
23785 It was my first visit and the cook recommended I try their Shrimp Poboy sandwich. I gotta say I kept looking at the sandwich I cause I could swear I was eating shrimp for real. It was sooo good I definitely be back. 
23786 They are very fast. The drivers didn't always understand me but they were quick to get there and simple to work with. Of the four cars I rode in they were all clean. 
23787 Soooo discouraged to go after reading these comments. This place need to make it a top priority for cleanliness. There's bad reviews for CoCo Keys Waterbury, CT and This one. 
23788 Chicken was awesome. Very juicy... Not a fan of the sides, but we would come back... 
23789 Don't waste time reading this review. Just go already. Why? Good service, great food, right price. I could eat here 888 times and not get sick of it. 
23790 best prime rib french dip anywhere anytime. Would go here just for that. It was that good 
23791 First time visiting the Voodoo Doughnut eatery, they have some pretty interesting donuts, we tried the captain crunch donut and the "Dirty old Bastard"..... I'm not a huge donut Fan but the "D.O.B" was pretty tasty! #FGMD. 
23792 We used Uber to go to this location before a concert. They were closed during peak dinner hours without notice and put a sign on the door. We ended up going next door to a hole in the wall pizza place. 
23793 Enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros and a Spanish Coffee 
23794 Nice cozy place with some cool skylights 
23795 Trendy for sure. Love the family style serving. The hostess ( not our server) was way too casual and way too talkative when she stopped by to check on us. Order was wrong more than once. Good variety. Good drinks. 
23796 If you are in Boulder and you love sandwiches go here. There is usually a long wait but worth it. 
23797 BEST BREAKFAST IN THE ATL!!! Their Eggs Benedict was INSANELY good, the service was good, the coffee was good, and the environment was chill! It's not a place I would have expected to be so top notch, but it blew me away! 
23798 Arby's may have the meats, but they sure don't put any on a sandwich. Besides that it was pretty cold and they potato cake was actually old tasting. Don't think I'll be back to this one 
23799 The food was good, but I was really disappointed with the service, the waitress was rude and because we tipped her based on the service received, she ripped the check in front of my friends face. I am never coming back to this place!!!! 
23800 No Killer whales...Sydney aquarium is way better. If they charged half the admission price, I would have been less disappointed.... 
23801 SOOOOOOOO gooooooood ! Quick service and authentic Thai food. The Tom Yum is to die for and the Siam Spicy lunch special is my fav ! 
23802 Stopped in for a quick breakfast. The gentleman working was very nice and the food was good but I wish the eggs would have been more scrambled and there was a little more fruit. 
23803 Their food is really good! Nice and affordable pizza! Breadsticks were to die for! I loved their pizza box decorations! I would definitely come again. Not my one of my favorites which is the only reason it didn't get higher. 
23804 Super easy and painless experience. I love the Groovy chain here in Austin. They have some of the lowest labor rates in town. They also are no B.S. It's really cool that there's the little cafe next door as well so you can hang out while getting your oil changed. 
23805 Quick easy and very clean for a Panda Express. She washed her hands before serving my food. Haven't seen that in a while. 
23806 Great vibe at this place. Exactly the type of coffee shop you're always looking for. It has a diverse menu and the food looks tasty. The staff here is very friendly and efficient. There is pride in their work! 
23807 Love this place! Long wait but it's so worth it. The burgers are juicy and the fries are phenomenal. My favorite is the goodnight burger and man is it delicious! I highly recommend and will be coming back soon. 
23808 Whites bakery is one of the best around. I love everything I try from there and I get all my special cakes from them. Everyone is always blown away by how delicious they are. YUM! 
23809 Just as great as the other two Keke's except there was not waiting time! If you go to the Keke's by Millenia and Dr. Phillips you'll have a wait time of at least 30 minutes. Go to this one instead! Same food quicker service. 
23810 Save your money and time. Late, unprofessional, phone number does not work half the time, and they will reschedule at their convenience. Do not pay the deposit!!! 
23811 Fantastic southern food from fried chicken to meatloaf. You can't go wrong with any of the sides, however, I have a special affinity for the cornbread and the mac 'n cheese. 
23812 Not the cleanest joint around, but if you can get past that, it is a GRRRREAT place for breakfast in P-town. Plus they give you coffee while you wait for a table. Sweet Potato French Toast is YUMMY! 
23813 super delicious Brazilian Bakery! Everything made fresh every morning! Best coffee ever! Everyone very friendly and welcoming 
23814 I was kinda blown away by how great this place was. They quoted me a great price for replacing a window on my Mazda 3, they were able to fix it the same day in under 2 hours, and the repair was flawless. I definitely recommend Low Price Auto Glass! 
23815 Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and very well kept. Not to mention FUNNEL CAKES! Could use a slightly bigger craft beer selection but this place is a great place to stop by early on Saturday, people watch and kick back. 
23816 Warm atmosphere, agreeable servers, quality stimulants make it an excellent study spot. Busiest after lunch. 
23817 Great staff. Great service. You feel very welcomed and comfortable in the tranquil environment. Dr. Don and Dr. Jill are top notch. 
23818 This is my fav pizza place. I always eat here after I smoke or when I'm hungover and it is heaven on earth sister. A little pricey but I guess it's fine because I recently got a merit increase I love it tho 
23819 Great greek salad and awesome pita. If only they would combine the two and do a greek salad wrap. 
23820 Best experience ever! The black seafood paella is out of this world! Hands down the best in town ! We will be back for sure! 
23821 Lamest selection of any liquor store I've ever been in. Also, the staff seems to have quite the attitude. 
23822 I love Yan's. Nothing fancy, but their dishes are consistently yummy, they're super friendly and they delivery to Lynn. This is my go-to local Chinese fix. 
23823 Love the food.. specially chicken shish and chiken tandoori kebab. - HP 
23824 Hands down best brunch. Locally grown food, great service, nice selection! Rosebud will make your belly happy! 
23825 Customer service has absolutely plummeted since the old manager left. Literally took them an hour and a half to go through my stuff on a WEDNESDAY when it wasn't even that busy. No manners, slow as hell, and they don't give you decent money for your stuff. Not going back. 
23826 Alex the bar tender was great!! The crab cakes where great. We just stoped in for a appetizer and glass of wine. We'll be back. Great service good wine and good food. 
23827 Was definitely the best shrimp poboy I've had since I've been working in North Austin. Could have been a tad bit spicier but nothing a little hot sauce can't handle. 
23828 This place is too awesome! The baristas are really friendly to talk to and they really know their coffee. Their pastries are from Quack's over in Hyde Park, and they use Texas Coffee Traders beans! Awesome coffee in the middle of West Campus, who needs Starbucks? Must have coffee stop. 
23829 Today a gentlemen named Mitch helped me over the phone. He was efficient and kind! I have never had better service than I receive at this location in particular. Thank you for making life a little easier 
23830 No hot water. Diner seems permanently closed. Run down hotel. The safe is tiny, will not fit a 13" MacBook. 
23831 The worst! They frequently get orders wrong, you get less food than what you paid for. Of the food you get it is typically of low quality and quantity. Bukahra may have been around for 20 years, but my opinion is this establishment will be gone in the near future. 
23832 Amazing donuts! There are a lot of choices so I decided to get a few of them and each one was great! Quick and fast service. I would recommend this place to anyone in the Portland area. 
23833 Best cocktails. Didn't eat but the Irish coffees were the business. Love the decor and we were quickly greeted and served. 
23834 I don't go to Star Market very often, but when I do they generally have everything I need. I wish they had a bigger organic selection. Overall it's a pretty typical grocery store. For those who drive, the parking lot is a plus. 
23835 It's a great place. I hope that they can fix the app so I can book an haircut appointment directly like other studio posh in town. Other than that this is a great place. 
23836 Had the Migas and Bloody Marys. Awesome. This place was fantastic. Could use a bit more of a grittier feel decoration wise, but the food is what matters and it was awesome. The staff was really friendly, as well, quick to seat us and help out with suggestions. 
23837 Chocolate chip pancakes with buttermilk batter = fantastic 
23838 I only see Ally at this salon, and you should, too. She is a terrific colorist and so friendly. I'll be back for a cut soon! You should give her a try! 
23839 Excellent take out food, great menu choices, fast friendly service and the restaurant has a cool little bar. This is a hidden gem in Braintree! 
23840 Had the meatloaf and chicken enchiladas. Both delicious. Sides awesome too. Lots of food. Highly recommended. 
23841 Took my lovely fiancee' to BQE on theTuesday before New Year's eve; loved it! Nice crowd, very creative menu, good food, nice, cool ambiance. We will definitly return! 
23842 First time and the sandwiches were great. They had the Red Sox game on. The people and atmosphere were friendly. The only little knock is that the building is a little old but that's it. 
23843 Does anybody know why it shut down it was such a good location.? So sad ..whaT goes there next 
23844 I had the grilled fish tacos with shoestring fries and a beer. After tip it was about $21. Good service. Food was a large portion and it tasted great. I would recommend this place. 
23845 Omg hopdoddy has became my favorite burger place ever, the meat was tender and juicy and service was great. Now the wait sucks but its worth it. 
23846 Really solid PHO here, best I've had recently. Great for lunch, but large portions may slow your afternoon down. Service is fine, decor is bleh, but thankfully the food is what counts here. 
23847 Terrible, Terrible Service. Especially if you get delivery. Hope you aren't hungry, it's a crap shoot in if/when it will arrive. 
23848 commenting as the girlfriend of this user...this isthe best drunk food in austin so prob not when youre using yelp but please support thos business. i cannot make it worhout firecracker fries. i am a young professional the test of the time. trust me. 
23849 This is the worst HEB in Austin. Management is horrible, always out of stock, fish area smells rotten and no meat department. 
23850 Awesome food, drinks and service! Healthy options to all menu items and skinny cocktails as well! Prices are perfectly priced for every item! Best place to hang drink eat and chill 
23851 Cool looking place, good service, decent food, cool owner, great wine. Will go again, just not on a Sunday. 
23852 I heard from a reliable source at a local newspaper that they are closed now. Which is a bummer because I loved going in late at night and relaxing with some good nom nom's. There were always people in there so not exactly sure what happened? 
23853 Great selection of hand-picked wines, seriously addictive paninis & tasty cheese/charcuterie options (served complete with Little T's kick-ass salt loaf!!!), interesting themed tastings and rotating glass pours for a price that make my money-clip happy. The staff is friendly and insanely knowledgable. 
23854 got my first gel nails and a regular pedicure yesterday. Super work. Pleasant staff, hyperclean, good atmosphere. Not for those seeking absolute total spa indulgence luxury but for the rest of us mortal non-princess divas, really spot on! 
23855 came for a quick bite for raw oysters (HUGE. will definitely come back again for oysters, but it is expensive. $2.75 for one). the drafts are cheap for $6. I think the outdoor seating and location is fun! 
23856 Born and raised in Cuba, moved to Austin about a month ago from Chicago and decided to try this place out even though I prefer homemade cuban food. Well this definitely exeeded my expectations, loved everything i tried, food, drinks, appetizers. I definitely recommend it! 
23857 Nice place on Newbury St. The Mexican meatball sandwich was amazing and the onion rings are pretty good too. 
23858 Awesome spot for Dim Sum and Peking Duck. The duck was a little over priced for what it entails. And the Mandarin Pancakes aren't as the fluffy ones that you find in NYC. but it's good enough to satisfy a craving. 
23859 I've been here many times. I actually had my moving away party here and it was EPIC with friends and Black Henny..... Just know I had to leave my car and Uber back to get it.. Lol Funtimes at this place.. 
23860 Just tired Casa Maria for the first time. Reasonable prices, good food, and a nice attached bakery. Great place, check it out. 
23861 Walked in and wasn't greeted until I approached someone to talk to them. One of the workers was nice but the others were far too reserved. Brought in many name brand but only sold 3 sweatshirts for 20 bucks. Although I know that's just how platos works 
23862 Solid coffee, delicious bagels, good prices and fantastic service--this equation seems more and more rare in Portland. So go here and get the works! 
23863 I went in after parking downtown just because it was close, and I wasn't looking for anything specific. The yogurt BLEW ME AWAY, and my friend and I got another one. They have so many flavors, and each flavor is intense! I highly recommend it. 
23864 Get Emilio's Strictly for their cheese pizza - it's BOMB and very affordable! They're onion rings are suprisnfly amazing as well. 
23865 Samantha was our server and she was amazing! Attentive, funny, great with recommendations... We ordered the spicy garlic edamame and the sonic and unbelievable rolls.. She recommended the Mexican roll with jalape√±o and omg it was so good! The ambiance was great! Love love love!!!!! 
23866 Been here many times and this last was to celebrate our sons 25 birthday. Always first class and always exceeds the expectations. 
23867 If cheap beer is all you care about, this is the place for you. It is huge in among the hipster/mod/indie crowds and is always packed. The only times I've had fun here were when I brought interesting people. The bar itself is rather uninspiring. 
23868 The falafel was mushy, overall plain tasting, and really slow service. Wouldn't come back. 
23869 No doubt the best lunch in NW so far. The Gyro Plate is wonderful. Lots of unique and subtle flavors. I can't wait to try more items. Not sure what eating in would be like but this will be a go to spot for take out lunch. Well done!! 
23870 Good Luby's location. Easier if you don't go at high noon as the crowd to get food becomes the crowd to pay and leave. Comfort food and prices have gone up slightly. Friendly staff. 
23871 First time eating here. The wing sauce was good. But the wings were cold. The sandwiches were cold. The waitress seemed really busy as we had to chase her down for refills. First time wasn't a charm. 
23872 This was one of the more exciting presidential libraries I have visited. By day, it's a museum. But secretly at night, it's the busiest swingers club in Boston! 
23873 Delicious ramen! Went twice while I was in town! So cutely decorated. Servers are excellent and the japanese toilet is an experience! Please visit! 
23874 Great beer, great music, and typically packed for these reasons. It's a wonderful Irish pub with tons of flavor. 
23875 Santorini Cafe has the best lamb gyros I have ever had. The service is amazing too - will be a frequent patron!! Can't say enough good things! 
23876 Stopped here before our son's soccer game. Great food, drinks and service! Thank you, Amara! 
23877 I've had an amazing experience with all of the ladies at La Raine's! Michelle helped me select the perfect dress-one I hadn't even considered trying on! They have a great selection for all styles and will make your experience fun! Thanks, ladies! 
23878 Excellent burger, nice open space, friendly, not smothering waitstaff, fair prices, free parking, and I'm sold. 
23879 Really disappointed at this place. Food was good. Service was really poor. We were not greeted nor acknowledged as we left. Not worth coming back. 
23880 So good! My first Acai bowl and it was delicious. Is Acai healthy? Because it doesn't taste that way! Only 4 stars because it's a little expensive, but you do get fresh fruit which can be pricey. I'll definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood. 
23881 As a Texas transplant, I am delighted to find Minero. The cuisine is not Tex Mex, and that's perfectly fine because they Carnitas Platter was outstanding. 
23882 Always great food, friendly service and quality dining 
23883 Very consistent which is awesome and a fun, ever changing menu 
23884 Ok- So it's more than I'd like to pay for a breakfast meal (I'm ALL about deals tho) but the presentation is beautiful and the lavender mocha ROCKS MY WORLD!! For breaky, I reccommend the artery-clogging skillet. Smoked applewood cheddar + brisket (i think) = decadent flavorful goodness. 
23885 Updated Review: I was contacted by Management regarding a previous order I was unhappy with. He really went above and beyond to make the situation right. I tried one of top ten drinks they recommend It was really good! I'll be back! 
23886 Overall 4.5. It's almost perfect score! I had the Texas bread French toast w/ fresh blueberries and side of beacon. 
23887 I love this place and frequent all the time. I do full body and feet and both are wonderful! I usually walk in and they take me right away. Always very relaxing and polite. I highly recommend treat your feet at 5382 Buford Hwy! 
23888 Awesome pool and drinks deal. Non smoking atmosphere loved it. Great staff...!! Definitely will come back with more friends 
23889 Overpriced and aggressive staff. Downtown prices in North Vancouver. The staff are very rude and the doormen are very aggressive. Food leaves something to be desired. There are many better places in North Vancouver to visit such as Queens Cross a couple of blocks away. 
23890 Great food, fair prices and a friendly service staff. Service was prompt and professional. 
23891 I went to MDC for lunch, had the BBQ short rib dinner, kimchee, rice salad and bean sprouts was delish. I recommend this place highly ! authentic, fairly priced , lots of locals eating here. 
23892 Best ice cream place in Boston I liked the outdoor seating, though they need tables to make them perfect. I also liked the glass structure if the place. 
23893 Great views of the Austin skyline the east and Lake Austin and the Texas Hill Country to the west. Hiking trails are easy peasy...there are stairs to the top ;-) 
23894 Fun entertaining tour! Great way to learn about the history of Harvard with visiting friends and family. Have gone a couple times. Student tour guides are funny and energetic especially Jake and Ana! 
23895 Would recommend the butter chicken, chicken 65, Tikka masala, and mango lassi! Their dosas are very big and comes with a variety of different sauces and housemade pickled peppers. 
23896 Always professional yet fun, you need to visit Icebox! These folks will take care of you!! 
23897 Love this place. My kinda grub. No frills, great service (Hunter), nice music. The food is awesome. Pie rocks!!!! I ate at the one in Memphis, too, and highly recommend this franchise. Could eat here everyday. 
23898 By far, the best meal I've had in Austin this week. Honey glazed lamb chops, blue cheese mashed potatoes and spicy Thai green beans. And, the ambiance is really cool. 
23899 I'm a fan. Great burgers (i've tried 3) and great shakes. Brought 8 people with me each time. I will eat there again. Weird way of ordering though....you walk in and they give you a number before you order....nothing wrong with it, just weird 
23900 This is hands down my new favorite food cart in Portland (and there are a LOT of food carts to choose from!) Fast, friendly and delicious every time. I like the Caspian Kabob, half rice half salad, but I'm sure everything's good. Yum! 
23901 I like the selection at this Winners...it is a bit crammed in this store but worth it 
23902 The crew and owner here are awesome! From another business owner I can't thank them enough for keeping my bike running great so I can enjoy the trails when not working! I highly recommend TCW if you need a bike or repairs. 
23903 We had to wait for a table but it was worth it. The drink, buffet, and desserts were so good. Since it was so crowded, I think the AC was maxed out. It was hot in the restaurant. If I'm in Columbus again, I'd go when it was less crowded. 
23904 Sublime whimsical and delicious waffles with fried chicken and somehow it also had chocolate, what?! Some sort of berry mimosa topped off a great meal. Worth the wait for a memorable Sunday brunch! 
23905 We had such a wonderful time Anjel and Tiffany were incredible!! The whole thing was incredible but we will come back mainly because of Anjel!! What an incredible waitress!! 
23906 This particular golds is never too busy. Even between 4-8pm during the week you can usually find whatever machine or Dumbbells you need without a wait. Staff is friendly, and always welcomes you as you enter and says goodbye as you leave. 
23907 Solid! Had the Italian sausage with onion and peppers. Very good, but I thought the grilled onions looked old and I wish the bread was more like an Italian bread. Overall great! I will be back. 
23908 I was so incredibly impressed with this place. The food was amazing, the ambiance was lovely, and the staff was very nice. I'm surprised I had never visited before! I will definitely be back in the near future to taste another torta! 
23909 The people there were awesome, great ambiance. The burgers were a little over hyped, good but not great. The fries were excellent, and the milkshakes were amazing. I'll give it a back seat to the Twisted Root Burger Co. 
23910 What can I say that hasn't already been posted here? Their pizza is perfection. I recommend the garlic and sausage of coarse. Who needs to go to Italy when you have amazing pizza right here. Oh and Cash Only! 
23911 Great watch selection. Friendly, clear, and efficient over email. Watch arrived in perfect condition, 1 day ahead of schedule. 
23912 Attended Sunday brunch with a very large group. Food very good. Service outstanding. Nice water view. Will definitely be back. 
23913 Service is horrible and food is simple bar food. Nothing amazing but frequent this place because the kids like it and it's simple. If you have kids or don't care one way or the other about food quality just go and watch a game on one if the many TVs. 
23914 Indian food with a nice, fun atmosphere. It may not be completely authentic, but everything is tasty. The curry clams are amazing. 
23915 Busy location with awkward access and limited parking. Physical product is standard yet service piece is lacking. The romance of coffee has been abandoned reducing this to another fast food eatery. A visit by Howard Schultz could do wonders. 
23916 The food is great here, as is the service and the atmosphere. It is so nice that there are finally so many great places in Boston to go out. Things in the city have changed so much over the last 15 years. 
23917 Please see feedback direct through the ADVANTAGE survey. Oh wait they probably don't even bother checking. All the one stars commented are right so just tacking on and adding the one stars to the mix. Enjoy. 
23918 Sarah Carr Rules! She did an awesome wolf head on my calf and its perfect. Super clean and exquisitely stylized. Plus, she's the nicest person you'll ever meet(: RECOMMENDED 
23919 This place is really good. They have original rolls that surprisingly arent based off California rolls! The service is great, the restaurant is clean and the food is great. I wasn't a fan of their soy sauce though. Had a weird taste.. 
23920 I went to the breakfast buffet at the Mishawum Rd location. They charged me $10 for the buffet and another $10 for a cheap, do-it-yourself, no frills waffle. Total ripoff. Usually, the waffle is part of the buffet. Don't go. 
23921 My favorite place to cure a hangover. Greasy, cheap, delicious and serving breakfast all day. Limited as far as vegan options though. 
23922 Phenomenal service! I love this place and their staff is wonderful!!! The omelette station crew are super friendly! There is a lot of seating in this restaurant along with an outdoor patio section. 
23923 This is a great little hidden pizza shop! The pizza is on par with the best pizza shops in the south shore. I would highly recommend Denneno's! Plus inexpensive! 
23924 Wonderful, flavorful. I had tofu rice veggie here and it was one of the most amazing things Vietnamese food I've had. 
23925 Perfection! !! We both loved our meals, service and hospitality!!!! Don't allow yourself to miss out on a great meal at ms pat's!!!! Yum!!! 
23926 Found a hair in my icecream.. Also the lady was rude. Um they never seem to have cotton candy when I go :( 
23927 Let's put it this way, we had a group of 16 guys out to Austin for a bachelor party and one of the 16 guys made it to XTC all 3 nights we were in town--and this guy doesn't really care for strip clubs. 
23928 Small play area 
23929 Children run wild...needs better staff supervision. Older facility and it could use some new paint and upgrades. Kids still have fun though and that's the main point! 
23930 Absolutely love this place!! My go-to restaurant. Their chimichangas are amazing, also their burritos are pretty big and can also be served on greens so it's more like a salad, which is cool. Great service and always kept our waters topped off. Super busy on weekends but it's worth it! 
23931 Went here on my trip to Atlanta. The food is absolutely delicious as well as it makes a lovely date night spot. 
23932 Good, but better breakfast tacos out there. Friendly staff and cheap. I will go back and try lunch or go for breakfast migas but bk tacos- try somewhere else! 
23933 Chicken was raw. Brisket was dry and tough. Staff had no remedy. With so many food choices in richmond. Don't waste your time. 
23934 Good food and staff love the red curry! 
23935 When it comes to Thai food in Austin, this foodtruck has the most authentic one yet! Whenever I crave for thai cuisine, i crave specifically their food! 
23936 THEY DONT HAVE YUM YUM SAUCE! That's reason enough to not go. Food doesn't taste very good and they messed up our order. NEVER going back. 
23937 amazing burgers really pricey not worth it but defiantly a must try! big thanks to Yobored.com for always helping me find new places to eat! 
23938 I thought I would give this place a second chance.. I can't stand cold burgers and this is the second time to get a cold burger, eww.. The fries are great, but what the hell, how do you serve a cold burger ? Never again ! 
23939 The ambience is cute! Swings around the bar area for seating! They served a buffet breakfast but were pretty much out of everything when I arrived. Drinks were good. I enjoyed it! I would go back for drinks. Not to eat. 
23940 Great place to run or walk in any season. The only cons are the many off leash dogs that owners don't watch close enough and that the pond view are obscured by the fence. I run here just about every weekend and it never gets old! 
23941 Love this place. Specials and happy hour are always good, regular menu is phenomenal. I think they even added the jasmine cream to the regular menu? (Orrr was that Uchi proper?) The sea bream and various mackerel, brussel sprouts are always so delicous. I am due back soon! 
23942 Really trendy little place with Taiyaki and ice cream all made infront of you. Really enjoyable atmosphere and the food is fantastic 
23943 Everything I've tried is good, but the buffalo chicken calzone really stands out. Delivery is super quick, too! 
23944 good, but it was a bit cold. cold weather though, so sort of understsandable. 
23945 Called in and spoke to the Owner Cody and he wasn't too friendly and was borderline rude. Couldn't understand what I was trying to tell him and I constantly had to repeat myself. 
23946 I couldn't even order dinner for my kids based on the looks of the place, it was so run down, dirty, trashed, so disgusting, the carpets, walls, ceiling, soiled. I was there for a party and had to leave. I will never go back! 
23947 Best yogurt in town (and we've been to them all). Loved the tart, and the place was super clean. All the toppings were fresh, with a wide assortment to choose from. 
23948 Loved the salmon here! Honey glazed to perfection. Only complaint- My friend got a gluten free pasta but there was a gluten noodle in there! Not ok! (Everyone also liked their cocktails, food, and ambiance). 
23949 Extremely unorganized delivery process, took off 3 hours from work to wait for my scheduled delivery and they were 2 hours late... Almost no communication after my credit card was charged. Would not purchase anything from them again. 
23950 One of my fav chicken base ramen spots in Vancouver. Love the extra table top condiments you can add on your own. 
23951 Fantastic selection of German meats and home-made sausages. Nurnburger brats great for breakfast or dinner (usually made twice a week). Also, the restaurant is a hidden bonus, with great German food and always fresh beer on tap. 
23952 You don't go for the decor but the pulled noddles were amazing. I got the lamb curry with pulled noodles and it really hit the spot. 
23953 Great job! We bought a giant table from Costco and needed it picked and hauled to our condo. Rick and Jarrod were amazing - punctual, courteous, sooo helpful, took care of everything for us, as promised. 
23954 Great presentation. Pork was cold, rice was cold, Salad was not appealing while the beans and plantains were Hot. My lil man enjoyed his chicken fingers and french fries. Food overall was ok I guess, but I will not be back. 
23955 Simply amazing food. Loved it. Ok service. Great prices. The Berber and ribeye is just to die for. Clean place as well. 
23956 Red Room is a great venue. From attending shows as a club-goer, to playing shows there as a DJ, it's always great fun. Friendly, efficient staff, killer subs and always a great vibe. It's a strong player in the electronic community, and has been a Vancouver staple for years! 
23957 Chicken has a nice crispy crust. pot stickers are good. It is a nice compliment to the other carts in the pod but tends to be my 3rd choice when eating there. 
23958 I had a maple custard donut and oh my days was it amazing!!!!!! A must try if you are in the area. 
23959 I couldn't order a latte because the espresso machine isn't working today. Par for the course here. 
23960 first trip to vancouver, b.c., and we picked the lamplighter for it's vintage building...we began with a kronenburg german lager, and my partner had the guiness...we shared the cod tacos, greens, and portebello mushroom sandwich on whole wheat...great drink and food...the server was very friendly...fun place...thx 
23961 Best fried chicken I've ever eaten. Good service, great prices. The chicken had a little kick to it, but not as spicy as I expected. I found the heat to be just right. 
23962 Don't know what the 4.5 stars are about. Few flavors, runny yogurt. Pink berry 100x better, but nice people and decent toppings available. But even the tart was so-so. C'mon Portland. 
23963 Buttermilk old fashioned... I go out of my way to get this donut 
23964 Wow wow wow!!! Amazing delicious tasteful unique mouthwatering food!!! I ordered the doner aka gyro!!! It was amazing and the best tasting gyro I have ever eaten!! I would give this place a 10 stars if I could!! And customer service was an A+++ Highly recommend this place!!! 
23965 Awesome donuts, nice people. The loss of a star was only because they are so popular that you often have to wait in a line out the door. 
23966 BEST BURGERS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!!!! Get the Llano Poblano burger, you will not be dissapointed! Only downside is there is always a wait, but it is ALWAYS worth the wait! You have to try this place! 
23967 Love this location. It's right between my house and my parents, so I often go use the drive through, it's so easy. I've only been inside once, but it's lovely inside as well. 
23968 Expensive but one of the best hotels in Atlanta. Nice executive floor with good breakfast but it's a pity it's not left open later in the evening. Staff are friendly and attentive. Very odd that there are no movies in the rooms just TV. 
23969 Five stars for service! My friend and I took advantage of the lower-priced appetizers and our bartender/server was a wonderful young blonde lady at the bar closest to the door. The food was good but her service went above and beyond. Thank you to her! 
23970 It's my first experience here and It went well. I didn't like the kung pao noodles at all. However, the service was great and the server. I also got the chocolate cake which was warm and full of flavor. 
23971 Came here for happy hour for the first time and already I'm excited! The fanciness and laid back atmosphere is great! Definitely try the French 75 (signature drink)! 
23972 One of my favorite restaurants for seafood. I've been to this location a few times and the staff is always friendly and pleasant. I can't get enough of them. 
23973 Very good food. Food is a Latin fusion with all kinds of Latin fare. You have to order at the register and have a seat, food is brought over to you. We had a party of 12 and everyone loved their food. Will be back when I am in town. 
23974 This location has issues. Last 2 times I ordered I waited and hour and a half and got the wrong sandwich both times. Disappointing....won't waste another lunch break. 
23975 this place is definitely different the food is excellent service is excellent if you're looking for something different highly recommended I had the clucker, my wife had the chicken and dumplings both were awesome 
23976 I am a sushi fan. But Boston doesn't seem to have good sushi, surprisingly. I tried several, some of them even highly rated. But I found this one more decent. Try A La Carte. 
23977 This pizza from Austin is by far the best frozen pizza ever. Crust is superb. It passed My husband Billy Howard 's critical palate. I would totally serve that at a party! Can't wait to check out the other 4 flavors. 
23978 The New England clam chowder was incredible! But, it felt like 100 years until we finally sat down 
23979 Thank you Roberto you did a great job took care of me for the time I walked in the CarMax to the time I left 
23980 Nice cozy little movie theater close to home that we enjoy visiting once in a while but the seats aren't very comfy. 
23981 The pecabon is a little piece of heaven! They are so sickly sweet fantasticly melt in the mouth deliciousness you will ever eat! everything from minibons to cinnamon stix to take out boxes of 12-24 to mochalatte chill to chillattas, your waist line will never be the same again! 
23982 Extremely knowledgable, friendly staff. Great quality coffee with plenty of couches. If you go after 3PM, pastries are 1/2 off. 
23983 This place is so fun. I love The tiki/beach theme. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The food and drinks have great presentation and taste great. Their food isn't the healthiest but it tastes good. 
23984 Expensive for the food they serve. Wait tines are normally over 1 hour. Not good. They tell you it's 30 minutes wait but it's always close to an hour and they don't have facilities to sit down outside. 
23985 I really enjoy going to "RED ROBIN" they have great service, and are very warm and inviting. 
23986 Great place, try the blue ribbon chips and any burger on the menu, we tried several. The mac'n'cheese was great too. 
23987 Consistently one of my favorite places to go for work lunch. From the outside, it does not look like the gem it is. Back patio is FABULOUS and the food is always good no matter what I get. Prices are ok and service is good. 
23988 Good food with a nice view. 
23989 They serve Richardson's frozen yogurt! They're homemade ice cream is creamy and flavorful! They have interesting sundae combinations! They're pet-friendly! They have an ice cream challenge! Yay! 
23990 Delicious every time! I love their jalapeno chicken dish. Spicy! Not made for kids. :-) 
23991 Great place for summer lunch, the limo saltado is delicious. The outdoor seating area is comfortable. 
23992 The massive banquet-style dinner I enjoyed with my family Sunday evening suggests Bob Likes Thai is indeed a 5 star Yelp restaurant. 
23993 New dessert place in Metrotown!! Nice ambience and view. The interior is very modern and refreshing and the desserts are extra tasty. Your taste buds will be extremely satisfied. 
23994 Very good place to stop by really quick and grab some tacos, very very affordable for the price and very good auntentic enough flavors 
23995 True genuine chinese hotpot with lots of choices. Nice services too! The waitress gave us complimentary slurpies! 
23996 Always a great place to taste some tea with friends. The staff is very friendly and not pushy. 
23997 Awesome sauce on the first visit! I will be back. Its a very relaxed environment and you may dress casual. The smell and food gets two thumbs up from me. 
23998 I have tried both their regular menu and buffet. I personally believe the quality of the food in the buffet is inferior. Nonetheless, the buffet is worth every penny. The buffet has good selection of items. 
23999 The Avenue has $1 Bud and Miller drafts, and has .25 cent wings till 7 and all day on Sundays. Cheap beer and good eats. The service is good too. I could eat their wings all the time. The honey mustard and the bbq wings are really good. 
24000 Second time I've used Bitesquad for food delivery from your restaurant and second time I didn't red'v the items I ordered.... AND the food was cold. Will never use them, again!! 
24001 Any restaurant whose premium tequila list dwarfs the wine list and provides the option to eat a whole quail in one sitting is an Austin classic in my book! 
24002 Over priced, mediocre Indian food. Only things that are worth having here are chaat and some drinks. 
24003 The Wintermoon is addicting! I rarely drink coffee but if I'm craving an ice coffee, I will definitely chose Summermoon over Starbucks any day! 
24004 Greatest smallest coffee place in town. Best coffee with a variety of flavor (the owner travels often to South America to select coffee beans), they used an old fashion manual coffee press for espresso. They make Affogato (coffee on gelato), espresso and so on. Great ppl too ;) 
24005 I'm having lunch at this place more and more. Tried the "Hippie" Wrap....awesome flavors. Amazingly helpful staff as well. 
24006 Had momos (spinach and paneer), goatcurry, and samosas. Finished with mango kulfi. Everything was freshly made and delicious. Kulfi tasted homemade. Best Indian is Boston to date. 
24007 Our waitress Samantha was awesome. Great recommendation for the pork shoulder and our other dish (mussels) was also delicious. Cobbler was very good and banana pudding is also a great choice. Samantha was attentive, prompt, a great waitress to share stories with. Would definitely go back to see her again! 
24008 Amazing!! Friendly staff that goes above and beyond. Ordered pho to share with my three year old and they split it and put it in another small bowl with out me asking. 
24009 This place was recommended to us to Watch some football. Owner and bartenders were awesome!! Great place to watch football and hang in and outside 
24010 Great Donuts and bagels. Ice coffees are great!!! They do not take debit/credit cards!!! 
24011 Bugers are good, fun place to eat, you may even see a star or 2 
24012 Ok food. Ok service. Good atmosphere. Lots of space. People seem to be enjoying their time here. 
24013 If you make a reservation anywhere near Valentine's Day, they will call you the day before to tell you that they have raised their prices $50/head. Surprise! And good luck getting in anywhere else. 
24014 I love the convenience, the price and the speed for tire changes and new tires. The only negative, is that they do not do alignments on site. You have to drive to one of their other locations, or somewhere else. Definitely recommend them. 
24015 I love their pizza, but twice I tried to get lunch and was turned away this week. Apparently they aren't open on Mondays, ok fine, but I came back on Thursday to find they are having oven trouble and won't be open till 2pm. Baby doll why you so mean? 
24016 I've been going to here since I've move to Austin and this place is super rad! Quick service, nice people, new/used tires. 
24017 Best gourmet donuts in Portland. No long line just quality fresh donut. Try creme brulle 
24018 Excellent coffee shop. Biggest I have seen in the US. Tasty coffee, and pastries. Close to UT Austin, lots of space to work, read, use your laptop. 
24019 they have homemade lavender syrup that everyone MUST try before they die. seriously. the atmosphere is quite cozy with something for all ages. they have beer too! 
24020 I've tried it once, and we liked it! I found the honey chicken a bit too sweet--it needed a little acid or salt to cut the honey. The food overall was nice, so I would definitely come back and try something else. 
24021 Unassuming place from the outside. Very good customer service when I went. The wait was less than the order taker said it would be. Small inside with four tables and a seating area. Delicious Big Kale Wrap with tomatoes, cucumbers and sauce. 
24022 While away on business, I was able to join morning workout session. Great place! The coaches were helpful and knowledgeable. Very inviting atmosphere! If I were local this would be my box. 
24023 I love this place!!!!!!!!!! The food is always fresh and the staff is friendly. For the past three years I always had a fresh meal exactly the same. Consistency is very important. 
24024 Do they cook with any other ingredients than salt? My entire meal was too salty...from shrimp chips to tea smoked pork ribs to wok noodles...I know it's a cheap ingredient but please exercise some restraint. 
24025 If you like overly-crowded Boston bars where the customers and bartenders all have attitude problems, go here. It does look cool inside, and the place has some history, but like most good bars, all the idiots find it and take over. 
24026 Strongly recommend! It's a fast casual concept with a Pam Latin flair. Eating a nice meal in Orlando doesn't have to cost you an arm and a leg. The service is very warm, and the food is just right 
24027 Had a nice pour of anejo tequila here on Cinco de Mayo. Didn't eat anything, active crowd, noisy but fun. 
24028 5 stars for the super volcano roll. A decadent melange of flavour- if you love rich and spicy, and you think it's okay to completely bastardize sushi, this one is for you! 3 For everything else. I go for this roll and the huge portion gomae. 
24029 Had the veggie burger, tots and a 22oz Yuengling and it was less than $10. Food was good. Service was great would definitely come back. 
24030 Ehhhh...it's airport food. Breakfast tacos were pitiful and their sausage offering was pretty much a hot dog on a tortilla. Coffee wasn't very good either. But hey, if you're hungry and on the go, it'll do... 
24031 Bongo the manager and Precious were super nice! It's been my second time and will definitely be back! I had the Texas burger and fries and they were super tasty! The fries were crispy and the burger was moist! I had a wonderful time here:) 
24032 Nice outdoor bar food and beer prices a little high!Could use a more affordable happy hour just saying! 
24033 This is one of the best places to go if you're here in Atlanta. I love seeing the city at night and overlooking the skyline. Atlanta is such a beautiful city so make sure you visit the Sky view when you are in town. 
24034 We appreciate all of the vegetarian and gluten free options available. The food was on point, and staff was great. 
24035 Love this local restaurant! Great food and drinks amidst cool PNW vibes. My favorite is the etc... dog 
24036 I've been to this place many times before. The finished product is nice however, THEY ARE SO ROUGH on your nails! She filed my skin so hard I began to bleed. Although the shape of my acrylics looks great...I doubt I'll go again. Still in pain from that experience... 
24037 Waited in line for 10 minutes. The counter clerk took care of her friend who cut the line ( while smiling about the wrong doings) making the situation irritable and uncomfortable. I left hungry and upset. The food is ok and the service is mediocre at its best. 
24038 CB is all right with me. I'm not a breakfast person. So knowing that they serve catfish at that time means I always have something to enjoy. The servers are friendly and very accommodating. The store is fun to poke around in too. 
24039 I really like this place. I used to order delivery all the time and then they stopped delivery to my neighborhood. Food is fresh tasting and not as greasy as most Chinese. 
24040 Quick, honest, competent and reasonably priced - highly recommend them for Porsche service! 
24041 Service is quick and food is decent. They're better than most Chinese food restaurants in the area. 
24042 Clean rooms, friendly staff, and great amenities! This hotel is in the perfect location, too. It is walking distance to many restaurants and directly across from the Convention Center. We had a nice experience from start to finish. Aside from theme park resorts, we found our favorite Orlando hotel! 
24043 My family has taken their pets to Dr. Myers for years now. They shoot it to you straight and if you can't pay it all up front, they'll work with you if you ask nicely. 
24044 Just amazing food! It reminded us of the pizza we ate in Amalfi, Italy! We got the prosciutto pizza and mushroom risotto! Sooo yumm! I wish we could try more things here! Great service, the lady we had was so sweet and attentive! Great beer on draft! 
24045 Healthy selection of sandwiches, salads, soups, and smoothies. Glad to see that the Altamonte Mall kept customers that like to eat healthy in mind when the restaurant was added to the food court. 
24046 Excellent bouillabaisse , huge salads, light healthy fare in addition to their famous chicken and waffles. Wide choice of options. Friendly staff. 
24047 This is such an amazing complex. The thing that you don't realize until you move here is how exceptional the staff is. So helpful in every single way. Feels like a resort! 
24048 Brian messaged me through Yelp explaining the situation of his reason for closing. I still have yet to try the coffee here, but Brian seems like a stand up guy about his business! I would suggest checking his Website/Facebook for updated hours (not yelp's) 
24049 this place was okay..not a big fan of the theme of the bar really..they have live music which is why i went there..the bar does not accept credit cards so have to have cash..they have an ATM inside also..bartenders were good 
24050 Great happy hour, and great food too! Enough items to satisfy a vegan, a vegetarian and a meat eater. That doesn't happen too often. It does look like an okay place not a great place on the outside, but I'm so glad we went in. 
24051 I love Flavia's. The BEST salsas in Austin! Always homemade and fresh salsa. Just delicious. And best homemade corn tortillas. This little food truck is a gem. The woman cooking always take care of you like you're her own. My new favorite spot for homemade Mexican food. 
24052 Awesome. Cody is an incredible coach. He's got a great sense of how hard to push you, but is also very focused on safety and proper form. I'd recommend this gym to anyone of any age or fitness level.... it's fun, challenging and overall very impactful. 
24053 Knowledgeable staff vary helpful good pricing. I will definitely be back. They have lots of accessories and ammo. 
24054 A great place to shop, especially because Filene's Basement is located there. They have a really big shoe store called DSW, where there are several floors just dedicated to selling shoes! However, there's really no good restaurants in the heart of Downtown Crossing...luckily Chinatown is next door. 
24055 Crowded but worth the wait- or grab a seat at the bar. We both had omelets and coffee, though the waiter recommended the brisket (after we had ordered). Most people were drinking bloody mary's, and they looked amazing. 
24056 A wonderful microbrewery with amazing beers. The thing that keeps me coming g back is how hospitable the staff is and the amount of energy they expend to making you feel at home. 
24057 The burgers are delicious; however, I wish they hadn't gotten rid of their Korean Burger. That was the best burger on the menu in my opinion. Also, the Krispy Kreme milkshake is amazing! 
24058 Go here if you like beer. 1 hour tour.....Free tasting glass, Free beer tasting, a little knowledge....what's not to love! Suggested Donation Riding the "T" is really the best way to get in and out! 
24059 Food was good. The place is too dark for my liking. Cleanliness of the place can still be better if they do more cleaning. 
24060 Love it. It has this off the wall hip style that speaks to me great food, bit limited on menu selections but i will be back 
24061 We ordered for our employee Christmas party. Not only was the pizza delicious, they delivered to us outside their delivery area. Thank from one local business to another, job well done. 
24062 Trash burger?... I guess shopping hunger got the best of me, and stopping at this eatery didn't help much. Service good, clean estab, but my burger was below par. Onion rings, soggy in oil? I won't be in a rush to get back to this burger spot. 
24063 Small and nothing special, the Avenue tries to lure you in with $1 drafts, but unless you are content sipping on crappy beer all night, there any many better bar options within walking distance. 
24064 A great space and atmosphere but the service was slow (they may have been understaffed), the margs tasted gas station quality and the shishshito peppers were ineditably spicy. 
24065 Very cool Johnny Cash themed dive. Perfect for a chill, casual night out or if you have friend's in town that want to see something "Texasy." We bought a bottle of wine and sat out back enjoying the Johnny Cash memorabilia, artwork, and music. 
24066 i like these guys a lot. when my contacts tore (they are very thin), they lent me several trial pairs until my insurance renewed. they are also friendly, have a nice clean office, and generally run on time. docs are all friendly. i definitely recommend them! 
24067 LOVE bill's!! fun specialty pizza choices - the "Carnivore" is delicious and reasonably priced. quick with delivery and yummy salads too :) :) a must-try in the newton area! 
24068 Vale a pena experimentar todas as del√≠cias! Os bolos, docinhos e salgados s√£o maravilhosos! Tudo que experimentei estava gostoso! Recomendo! 
24069 Good food, nice choices, but over ratted. Feels more like paying the rent than the actual food. 
24070 Everything was good from the atmosphere, the service, and of course, the food! I loved the salmon pecan dish. The steak was amazing too. 
24071 I got in 30 minutes prior to closing on s Saturday! Very professional, didn't require a full expensive examination. Was in and out rather quickly. I'll be back. 
24072 Tasty food. Exceptional service. I usually get my food to go because the restaurant is small and is usually crowded. But in spite of that it's one of my favorite breakfast places. The food comes out fast and fresh. The employees are always super friendly and helpful. 
24073 Great place in Clermont for Italian food. Service is always delightful and the food is delicious. LOVE the pizza!!!! 
24074 One of the best places I've ever ate at. Downtown's out of my way, but I do my best to go every single time. 
24075 My wife and I have been coming here for several years--bought two bikes, and a bunch of gear. Advice and assistance is tremendous (I have been into bikes for many decades and do know my stuff). 
24076 omg.... This place was FUCKING AMAZING. I can't believe for their prices how good the food was. The reviews are definitely right, this place is soooo good. Definitely reccomend eating here!! Had the snow crab and it was so much fun breaking that shit open! 
24077 This Jack was out of all burgers and soda.... haha what? If you're gonna stay open 24 hours, have your stuff together. Absolutely ridiculous 
24078 This fine cuisine is the closest I can get to mom's cooking. Everything here is divine! The price is very affordable. I love everything about this place. #BAJANANTIGUANAMERICAN 
24079 Great place all round. Thanks for the wam welcome from Vera!! 
24080 I moved to maitland but I'll still drive across several towns to get a hair appointment with Ana. All the dressers at this spot are terrific too if I dont manage to get my appointment, be sure to reserve in advance! 
24081 Oh my goodness, the crepe was the size of my head and jam packed with what I wanted. The prices are great for what you are getting and their customer service skills are top notch. 
24082 This best our 1st rodeo here. We just remembered to check it! Great Smokey dive bar. Ask for Daniel in the evenings. He makes great drinks! 
24083 Gross gross Gross. I would avoid at all cost and go to Cafe Agora in Buckhead for some real Greek food. The food is too expensive to be nasty. I wouldn't eat at Mykonos for free. And did I mention the lamb tasted a week old. 
24084 Always have a great time at sushi Katana. Great service and delicious food. Everyone check this place out! 
24085 I see a lot of good reviews, but I couldn't bring myself to try the sushi. When I walked in the place, it smelled like old fish. Wasn't willing to find out how fresh things tasted. 
24086 Highly recommend this place to eat! Emily was amazing. She helped me order and what she suggested was delicious. She was also very attentive to our needs. Worth checking out if you are in the area. 
24087 We had the spicy chili won tons, sweet potato dumplings and the lobster dish. All were outstanding. Apparently, Chinese restaurants don't have to be stuffy, sad take-out spots - this place was packed, serves great drinks...I'll be back. 
24088 I have really enjoyed every meal and visit I've had here. The staff have outstanding personalities and their food is extremely tasty and high quality. 
24089 Fantastic spot. I ordered beef swarma (sp?) and instead of rice got all salad. Yum. Wife ordered combo rice. Fantastic choice too. 
24090 Got my shirts For church Tomah. Anyone wants to go to church with me 
24091 Not terrible, not great. There are, however, way too many other places in Austin to eat. I wouldn't return here in the future. 
24092 I'd agree with the hit or miss of which driver/vehicle condition of the driver/vehicle. The price is fair though and much better than a taxi. The wait at the airport is no longer than the wait for a prearranged taxi. 
24093 We went here last night based on mostly positive reviews. What a disappointment! Overpriced, crowded, poor service and tasteless food. Pass this one by! 
24094 The vegetarian dishes here are marvelous. Highly recommend paneer korma, bhindi masala, paneer makhni, and tofu bhurji! 
24095 This place is outstanding. A lot of food always. Big dishes, great taste. Even though it is a chain, it doesn't feel like it. I highly recommend this place. Make sure to have the mozzarella marinara for appetizer! 
24096 Their customer service sucks really bad! Worst restaurant ever! (Customer service/ manager) 
24097 Great atmosphere, people and food ^_^ Grilled cheese, tomato soup, 3 franks, and the Arcadia burger! Yummmmmmmy 
24098 Had a brazilian wax in the "Green Room Spa" at the back of the Red Room. Was a really great experience. Will definitely go back again! The staff was great. Was one of the best brazilian waxes I've ever had. 5 stars. -Melissa 
24099 I absolutely love this place. The food is always good. My favorite is the country crab cakes. Omg. It's perfect! 
24100 Favorite spot in town! I get the chicken chimichanga almost every single time, and it never disappoints me. The chips, salsa and queso, nachos, combination platters, Cuban dishes, margaritas, and much more are always great too. Highly recommend! 
24101 Roche Brish has a wonderful bakery! I also favor their cheese selection. Lines at the cashiers move fast. 
24102 Since Julie is no longer working at Awesome Blossom, I'll spare myself the hour-plus-long LYNX bus trip to get there. She was the only reason I made the trek out there anyway. 
24103 For the most part all Starbucks locations are pretty similar, but the staff at this location set it apart! They're very thoughtful and genuinely friendly. It can get quite busy, because it's so close to the skytrain. 
24104 MARY is phenomenal service and very happy! She's a great asset to Sweet Tomatoes and should be promoted! 
24105 Great experience! Friendly and informed staff. Dr. Langer is fantastic, best experience yet with an eye Doctor in my 10 years of needing one. I highly recommend going to see her. 
24106 Excellent quality food and lovely service at this fabulous gem in Austin Heights. Loved the laab, panang curry, nua yang and spicy noodles. Hope this place is around forever 
24107 Had a great experience here. The staff was very friendly and the pizza is awesome. Huge slices and tastes great. Will come back again. 
24108 Went for dinner with friends hoping for a good Thai food but to my disappointment the food served is not Not Authentic Thai Food. 
24109 I just don't give 5 stars because the kids pasta is getting smaller. Everything else is great. Good service , fast and tasty food! The price is also great! 
24110 So many gluten free options and cute outdoor seating. Yum! Grouper dish is delicious and the brown rice is surprisingly fluffy. Best Thai food I've had in ATL. 
24111 The food was completely cold and the fries were chewy. My breakfast burrito was inedible. I went after I was off work at 3AM. If it wasn't so late I would have drove back and asked them to remake it. We spent $12 on food we couldn't even eat. 
24112 Looked like a nice place. Unfortunately the hostess was extremely dismissive and rude to my mother and I when we went to try to get a table at around noon on 12/18. I'd hope they see this and have a conversation with their hostess about proper customer service. 
24113 Loved the restaurant! Drinks were excellent and also the appetizers. Atmosphere was great! 
24114 Brought my two young boys here on a Saturday night. Friendly, affordable, high quality food. We had two bowls of chicken teriyaki one with rice and one with noodles, and all 3 of us loved it. We will definitely be back. 
24115 Ooooohhh, A new and exciting eatery in JP's dynamic Hyde Square neighborhood. Service was great, and the whole place seemed warm and inviting. Lots of fresh tasting ingredients and seafood. Good selection of alcohol. Yum. Bon appetit! 
24116 Love this place! But, owners, you're understaffed. Too popular to only have two employees working on a Saturday morning! Oh and you could use a recycle or compost pin to throw things away in the store. 
24117 Delicious southern style healthy food. I eat here every time I am in Atlanta. Our server Kory was very friendly and attentive. The new banana bread waffle is amazing! Everything I have eaten there was always fresh and tasty. 
24118 If the server picks up a plate with one bite taken out of an over cooked burger and doesn't think anything is wrong, that's a problem. My husbands steak sandwich was over cooked as well. Slow service. Boo. 
24119 Iam delighted with the service at my UPS store The service people are polite patient and knowlwegable My store is on 8th ave between 52 and 53 NYC 190019 
24120 This is the nicest salon I have been too in a long time. Super friendly staff, clean location and most importantly thorough mani and pedi services. I would recommend coming here! 
24121 Great tour! Noah was our tour guide and he was very entertaining. My boys, ages 9 and 11, still talks about the tour. Highly recommended!!!! 
24122 I went there couple weeks ago, I order dish but they give wrong one, but you change for me 
24123 Food it is ok. 
24124 Amazing restaurant/lounge, I've always had fun and had a blast every time I came. Recommend the chicken & waffles with the peach cobbler dessert. The music is great and the staff are very friendly and cool. 
24125 Location is fine, but I found a lot of ice in my ice cream. Wife said she did too with a different flavor. Amy, please watch your quality control. 
24126 Every time I'm in ATX I always make a trip to Hopdoddy with my brother. all I gotta say is.. AHI TUNA!! that honey wasabi sauce in the burger is awesome. and their fries are glorious. really cool spot. always poppin.. always a long line. but worth it! 
24127 This is our go to spot in Boston. We love the brunch and dinner menus and find it to be very reasonably priced. The buffalo Brussel Sprouts are a must try! 
24128 For the price your paying, this place really gives a bang for your buck. Try the flank steak and the sausage. 
24129 Update: Fathers Day 2015; big crowds, but the same fast and friendly service. Same delicious food! Way to go FJ Johnny's! 
24130 Food is good if your in the mood for soup sandwich. They have odd hours and who knows if it will be open or not. 
24131 Amazing ramen house! Too bad all of Portland's douchy hipsters are spilling into Beaverton tainting it and taking over all of our hidden little gems!! 
24132 If you're a Meth head, you'll love this place. Bring in all those stolen CD/MP3 players and get some quick cash! They buy it all for $10 and sell it for $150! What a great business plan. Thanks Stuff!!! 
24133 The chimichurri was fabulous. The ambience and art were authentic. The papas cremosas and beef were top shelf. 
24134 HUNGER MANs entire family of caveman and cavewomen have been coming here for years. The sandwiches are warm fresh and fantastic! The entire menu rocks. The owners really care about you and their craft. Bingo- you have a recipe for a successful business! 
24135 I have never had so much fun in one evening! I loved the interactive pieces and the element of surprise at each turn. I highly recommend to anyone who likes to have fun! 
24136 Hands down my favorite place to hang out in Atlanta. The pizza and wings are great. They are usually slammed busy on the weekends. Ask for the server Jeremy, he is awesome. 
24137 Authentic northern delicacy. Great price also. I love their veggie dumplings, better than Shanghai river or every Din Tai Fung. Their Juicy pork dumplings are good but DTF is still better. They also have great selections beyond noodles and dumplings. 
24138 Good place to go and watch the Sox game or play pool. Sometimes it's really crowded. Can be 21+ on weekends, but not always, it just depends on the day. Located right by Fenway so don't even think about trying to drive in. 
24139 My favorite! Very affordable. Delicious food. Filling food. Smiley servers. Very Korean atmosphere. Food is delicious. 
24140 Get a donut. There is no bad choice except to walk by at 10 pm and not get a donut. Heavy lines on Sunday morning but well worth it 
24141 Shenannigans was recently remodeled inside. It is now upscale and modern with booths and high and low top tables. The food is fair to good. The waitstaff are friendly. The chicken, ziti and brocolli is particularly good. 
24142 Great food, great beer for Thursday night football. Huge tv for the game. I'll be back 
24143 3.5 star could have been higher except served dishes and hot tea in plastic bowls & cup which is a pet peeve of mine. I look for glass or stainless steel. Food was decent and better than most with the exception of over cooked green veggies. 
24144 The best kitchen/home/food/gifts store ever. This store is PACKED with merchandise. It is so fun to browse. I've never seen more cookbooks in one place. My favorite shopping destination in Boulder. 
24145 This is a nice place for preppy clothes. GREAT FOR: Big hats (yeah, ok, i have one), nice socks 
24146 Great pizza, good customer service. Parking was a little hectic to figure out. Overall good experience. 
24147 This place is very nice and relaxing, at the end of a long week this is the place to be, the staff os very friendly and the foot massages are always great, the price os reasonable. Great way to end the week! 
24148 The customer service is wonderful. This is my first time here. Came because it was close and needed a last minute fix. Tracy did AN AMAZING JOB! On both my nails and feet. I got a full set and pedicure. One of the best I've had in Oregon for both. 
24149 This review is going to be short because there's is not much to say about the Leaky Roof. The prices do not correlate with the quality of food or the amount. The prices are too high. The staff was welcoming and nice, the only reason I'm giving them two stars. 
24150 I used to love going to this place to get my sushi fix...until I got food poisoned and forever ruined sushi for me. 
24151 Great yoga studio! Customer service is great and classes are taught by professional/friendly staff. I look forward to Sunday Funday Spin and beginners yoga each week :-) 
24152 MaryKate. The hottest commodity on the market right now. Come check her out. And the Southwestern Salad is the bomb. 
24153 Hotel's decent, been at better Residence Inn, staff is friendly. 
24154 this place never fails to deliver fresh, hot food in a timely manner. It's my go-to deliver place. 
24155 Service is WAY better than in past. Beer selection remains great. Heather/Haley is so welcoming and friendly. Menu has changed, no more pork, but some good choices. I'm back here about every 10 days. 
24156 This is a wonderful store with beautiful furnishings for your home. The fabric choices are beautiful and the designers are professional, courteous, and create a great buying experience. One of our pieces was a few weeks late but I felt the final product was worth the wait. 
24157 Northeast health and fitness in Weymouth has great classes for barre and body blast. Super nice staff and very clean. You can use all three clubs with your membership, going to try Pilates in Quincy. 
24158 Portions and food was amazing but service was crap. Took forever to get a table and only saw the waitress once for our order and once to give the check.. but the food is pretty great for the price. 
24159 Just down the street from me. I love this place. All you can eat wings are great and they seem to be building up a steady costumer base. Salads aren't very good. Also, city streets, if you're listening: PUT CHEESE ON YOUR POTATO SKINS. 
24160 I love this place! The owners and worker of the store are so amazing and so nice! I left very happy and pleased ! They worked with me and helped find exactly what I needed! I couldn't be more pleased. 
24161 Fresh ingredients, crispy, light crust. Loved it. The flatbreads are good too. 
24162 Great food, but the service was really REALLY slow. There were not very many people in the restaurant, so I really found this disappointing. We had to essentially flag down the staff everytime we needed something. We often sat with empty glasses. 
24163 Go here! It was sooooooo good. A little expensive feeding 6 people ($120) but totally worth it. Will definitely be back on a date night. 
24164 Amazing food and incredibly kind people! the only problem is that I wish the cafe was slightly bigger 
24165 I go to this sushi spot once every 2 weeks. The price and quality are great and I can't find another sushi place in Orlando with this value. Even compared to the expensive places this place has comparable quality. 
24166 Hours claim to close at 12:30. Showed up at 11:36, and was denied service and told they close at 11:30, and the hours haven't been updated online. Guess we'll be supporting big business instead of investing in local. 
24167 The grandkids are little foodies. They had fun trying various international soda flavors. It's a pretty cool place! (Pun intended lol) Free, unlimited, ice cold refreshment! 
24168 Best manicure experience ever!! Stopped in without an appointment, was immediately led to a station, beautiful manicure, back and neck massage (which I've never had with a manicure), great friendly service...will definitely be back! 
24169 The food is decent, but way too overpriced. Ordering is an overwhelming experience and there's barely any room to sit down so take out is a must. I'd go here out of convenience more than anything. You can get better food for cheaper with a nicer atmosphere elsewhere. 
24170 Ayyy order the Black Cherry w/ soft serve vanilla-it's hella good! I ordered it togo & the worker made that $h!t pretty fast! I'm about to go back there tomorrow again ha ha. 
24171 I love this place! I have lost several inches all over since I started about a month ago. I've only been to Robert's class in the afternoon, but I hear the other instructors are awesome! Robert is very helpful and professional. The gym is clean with no weird gym smells. 
24172 I just recently brought a RAV4 from here. My experience was good. I did not feel pressured and I did not feel like the sales people were shady. The customer service was good also. I would recommend this dealer to others. Ask for Blaise DaCosta 
24173 Attached to Roscoes you have a hefty 30 taps to choose from to go with some top notch sushi. Get the blackjack roll and the monkey brain! 
24174 Well organized space with lots of cool furniture. I want it all! They also have shelves of knick knacks, electronics, a record section, and clothes. Check out the sale shelf for some really good deals. Even my boyfriend (who hates thrifting) likes to go here with me. 
24175 Do they have chain clubs? Because, felt could be one. Impersonal, yet attractive staff. decent appetizers. week drinks. high prices. the whole vibe of the place makes me want to be somewhere else. 
24176 Food is shitty as always and the dark uncle(who is waiter there), he got so shitty and disrespectful attitude. I can say, he must be loosing so many customers for sure if not by shitty food then with his behaviour. 
24177 Guay Tiew Tom-Yum Ta-Lay Translation: Lemongrass descends from heaven with happiness just for you. 
24178 The food came faster than we expected and was excellent. Great water view right outside the window. Turned out to be quite pricey (we didn't know they charge for the tea), but it was a worthy experience overall. 
24179 I was in Portland from Los Angeles for a week and came across this cafe via Yelp. The food and service was great! I highly recommend f&b! 
24180 Dinesty opened about a week ago, ambiance is simply beautiful inside. What's even better is their food was absolutely deeeelicious! Price are very reasonable. But the main reason is to come and eat this! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dinesty-on-robson-vancouver?select=qGyEqXD6uhsMyFHAtRMHqg#-4c8pxdpqEwAPnRxwwxCRQ You must come and eat here! 
24181 My favorite nail salon in Winter Park best nail technicians and always satisfied and happy! Great pedicures and acrylic specialists. 
24182 Hi I'm Minh Big slices and a lot of surprisingly good food! The garlic bread here is really good and they have great French fries. The Mediterranean kabobs and schwarmas are to die for. Portions are huge. Definitely a good stop for a quick bite. 
24183 Enjoyed dinner recently at Skip Jacks. Went without reservations and got a seat pretty quickly. My wife had sea bass, I had salmon. Both were really good. Well prepared; came to the table hot; and tasty. Service was good. We will return. 
24184 Omg this place is amazing! I am gluten free so it is tough to find great restaurants with many GF options. They had an entire GF menu, and most things were naturally gluten free anyhow. I definitely recommend the queso fundido! 
24185 Great refreshing meals! We had the gyro, greek salad, grape leaves, octopus, pita bread and some chicken and sauce. Hummus at table was very good. Have been here twice and really good. Entertainment was fun. 
24186 Please consider FIRST COME FIRST SERVE. my first time here I ordered food then a lady came in after me ordered and got her meal before mine. I'm still waiting on my spam musubi shouldn't take long 
24187 Absolutely loved this place. Went for dinner and everything was great. Service, food and ambiance was perfect! Big props to this place and highly recommended! 
24188 Had a couple of great cocktails here, the Mai tai for one. A classic deliciously prepared. Great service 
24189 Edit: so glad that they opened up again! This place is my favorite Indian restaurant in Portland. I hope they come back soon... 
24190 I really don't see how someone could give less than 5 stars. It's free and it's beautiful. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and I love that their bridal room was air conditioned since I got married in early August. 
24191 pizzas are pretty nice. greek salad is baby sized and way too expensive. 
24192 This place has great pizza and great Indian food. The shahee paneer and raita is amazing. The pizza is also very good. 
24193 Love coming to this spot for the outdoor patio, mezcal margaritas and authentic Mexican food. No Tex Mex here! Great service, friendly staff too. 
24194 This place is cute and quaint with absolutely amazing food! Large portions so plan accordingly. 
24195 Great tasting food. A little overpriced in my opinion and could have been faster. Eggs Benedict is big enough for two! 
24196 All the food on the small plates menu is wonderful and affordable. Fast service, great chef, good drinks. The enchiladas with mole sauce and the mushrooms in garlic butter sauce are heavenly. 
24197 I'm in love with this place. their drinks, their sandwiches, the treats, the staff, the interior and whole idea behind the place. props for carrying local Zhi Teas. heaven is their salted caramel macarons. 
24198 The Good - Mimosas The Bad - Stereotypical cougar den most nights of the week, especially Thursdays; not kid friendly in the least 
24199 The pho was so good it brought tears to my eyes. Jackfruit smoothie...heaven. And the owner is awesome. I'll be back, even though it's a pretty inconvenient drive for me...but yes, it's totally worth it. 
24200 Wow been here almost 3 hours and still no dinner!!! Stay away if you're hungry!! No explanation why the terrible service and lack of food. This is terrible. 
24201 I came to try the food but this place was not opened although it was within normal advertised hours of operation. No more Island Time for me. 
24202 Exceptional take on rustic French food. From a country that brought us high fashion, toxic cigarettes and snails on the plate. You won't find them mollusks on the menu: in their place, an out of this world kale salad and onion soup. Highly recommended. 
24203 wonderful deep massage. very inexpensive--tip them well for their hard work! 
24204 For not bowling, this place has good alternatives in the form of an arcade and pool tables. Otherwise, it's a lackluster hangout. 
24205 The venue hosted the Atlanta Home Show. It is nicely laid out and was clean; no real issues. What would take this up a star? How about some plugs for charging the hybrid while parked? 
24206 Marta sucks compared to just about every other citys transit. Make sure you leave very early if you need to be somewhere on time! Not very safe either. Does the job, but way to exspensive for this kind of service. 
24207 Pricing is really weird. At times you can find the best deals here, better than any other store but most items are almost double other stores items. 
24208 I would give 0 stars if I could. By far the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Absolutely no organization. Takes reservations for some parties not others. This place needs serious help. 
24209 Second time at this food truck and it's still as good!! I had the big kahuna burger with the sweet potato fries, OOOMMAAGGAAH! Deliciousness delivered from Hawaii to Austin. This is a must if you like pulled pork! 
24210 The chips and salsa are made to order, so takes a little time, but oh so good. Had the crab stuffed enchiladas, soo good! 
24211 This place was great! The food was cooked on the spot,and we barely had to wait. The environment itself was quaint and homey and the attendees were authentic Italians. We are for sure going back! 
24212 Love this little niche in a strip mall. Food is delicious, ambiance is lovely and service great. 
24213 1st time here and this place was great! Great service, ambiance and amenities. Michael was my masseuse and he was amazing! Very relaxing and soothing experience. 
24214 True Grounds effortlessly exudes a cool 'neighborhood cafe' vibe that is hard to resist. they pour amazing Brazilian coffee, tasty teas, and also serve yummy baked goods. i have never eaten here, but they have food if that's how you roll. 
24215 Its huge and fancy! Drinks are expensive. And there's a pool table. 
24216 Their food is great. The restaurant is great. However... When I call in to get delivery it would be nice if I got someone that could speak english. I spent 8 minutes on the phone to order saag paneer and chicken korma. Come on. 
24217 Short wait and great service! My Prime Time burger was delicious! Our Parmesan Truffle fries were nice, but they were also primarily little broken bits. Would have appreciated fries of grander size:) 
24218 This was my first visit and I got a gel manicure which I have never had before and a pedicure. Britanny did an amazing job and the salon is beautiful. I can't wait to go back soon 
24219 Veggie sausage and maple- delicious. 
24220 Seaworld is an amazing Park to visit, not just because of shamu but because of all the other sea animal shows and rides available. 
24221 Pretty wide selection of teas (~100) including nice custom chai blends, matcha, silver needle; well steeped too - I haven't had burnt tea here. Ambiance is nice too, especially when not busy; there's a nice enclosed garden in the back and good nooks around to sit and drink. 
24222 Decent prices, HUGE portions, friendly servers. Get the croissant French toast, NOT the pound cake French toast. Dana is a great server, very friendly and accommodating. I was being extra picky that day and she was so nice about it. Definitely coming back. 
24223 I have to say, Mike is one of a dying breed. An honest mechanic. I have brought both my car and my girlfriends car there and he has been nothing but a straight shooter and definitely does not gouge you on the prices. Thanks Mike for the great work!! 
24224 Ate here with a group on a Friday night. It was awhile ago, so I can't remember exactly what I had. But I remember that everyone enjoyed their meals, and the atmosphere was cozy without being cramped, and lively. 
24225 Whoa - tasty! Love it. Ordered the Basic Ramen in miso base, added spicy meat option with soft boiled egg, and Shazam - tasty! We'll be back. 
24226 Best Burrito Ever, in 10 words or less: 1. Burrito 2. Yes (to "Rice?") 3. Pinto 4. Barbacoa 5. Pico 6. Hot 7. Sour Cream 8. Cheese 9. Lettuce 
24227 Very tasty Been going back for much times now for the same bubble tea but not stopping there to tey new ones For this week , bubble waffles Yummy 
24228 Great food and great service! Jesus was our waiter he was awesome and friendly! Fun environment great sports bar! But one get one drinks all day everyday! Awesome ! 
24229 I heard Swank had new chef and a new menu. Went there the other night with a friend. He had the scallops and it was love. The presentation was different and so delicious. I had the mushroom strogginof so flavorful and cooked to perfection. Everything was so yummy. 
24230 I love vegan nom!! All of the menu items are so good and their salsas are incredible. I have noticed they have been getting a lot busier lately and sometimes it takes a little longer to wait for the food during busy times, but it's worth it! 
24231 Consistently excellent food at reasonable prices. Their happy hours are great. Amazing chicked salad and best specialty fries ever! 
24232 Visiting from florida , we had an amazing meal. Walleye was fantastic and the lemon cheesecake was unbelievable - I ordinarily don't like cheesecake! Matt Walton the Sous chef came out to help explain everything and was extremely friendly and helpful. Great service as well. This is a great place 
24233 Nice atmosphere in Brewery area.....good beer and deli food! Fast service. Frenchy sandwich - excellent! 
24234 If nothing else come just to hang out with Peter. Great bartenders are life! Bathrooms have communal sinks for washing which I like; keeps line shorter actually. Plenty of seating. Music was good for reminiscing!! 
24235 Came for a friend's birthday party. We ordered pizza, brought beer and music! This is a different but cool thing to do. Evan, the owner is super friendly. So much FUN! 
24236 All the north end Italian restaurants will seem overrated once you eat here! Absolutely the best pasta I've had outside of Italy. Cannolis were delish! MUST CHECK OUT. 
24237 HEB is a great grocery store to shop at. They are friendly and have a good selection of items. Their produce always looks fresh and we'll kept. 
24238 The sushi was tasty, fresh, and well presented. Our server (Mollie) was friendly, knowledgable, and very helpful. Overall, one of the best sushi experiences I've had- thanks again! 
24239 I'm a man of freight words. Damn good Pizza Crust Perfect mix between thin and semi thick 
24240 All vegetarian Mexican food! Variety of margs available (coconut, jalape√±o, hibiscus) and the large nachos is HUGE. recommend just a small for two to share. Friendly and funny staff with outdoor seating. 
24241 OMG the best breakfast in Vancouver. The only problem is the LONG LONG waiting. I wish they would at least get reservation. but other than that they have the best waffles and fricass√©e! 
24242 Cuts a good steak house to go. I had ribeye and it was really good. It was packed with people and I have to wait 45 minutes to get in. I recommend to make a reservation before your go there :))) all in all I love it 
24243 I've been coming to Barbers for almost a year (every once in a while) and today Gloria worked with me. she rocks. she's nice and gentle and on top of that she's fast. I had a cut with neck razor for 18$. she worth every penny. 
24244 Nice spot it was pretty packed Friday I heard sat is gay night.. and if u don't have a section there's no where to sit or really dance .... so get a section.. Crown apple & cranberry cost $12 
24245 I go to this place on a regular basis. Great classic breakfast and bennys as well :) u won't have to wait too long even when it's busy and Amanda (waitress) is awesome!! 
24246 Loved dr Lampert- I had a root canal with him and felt amazing after ! He was so precise and so efficient! His staff was amazing and he warms the lidocaine - yay!!! Could not be happier !! 
24247 Thanks for the food poisoning! I tried to be healthy by ordering a salad. That was the problem. Clearly, the salad was dirty. For $15 plus tax and tip, this was a costly mistake. 
24248 The food is delicious and healthy, but the portions are tiny. You pay $7 for a "large" and it feels like a kid's meal. If portion sizes were about double what they are, this would be the lunch spot of choice every day. 
24249 Un hermoso lugar,con buena ambientaci√≥n ( cambiar√≠a la puerta de entrada ya que o es acorde al resto del local ) Sabroso y bien presentados los platos y su atenci√≥n fue muy cordial 
24250 Best hand pulled noodles I've had thus far! Thick and chewy with a flavorful mild sauce. 
24251 This is a wonderful little jewelry store tucked in the suburbs. Phillip and Bill created custom wedding bands for us that were exactly what we had in mind. They have resized several rings for me and repaired some jewelry; they are always a pleasure to work with! 
24252 We waited 20 minutes for our order to be taken. The pulled pork was overcooked and vinegary. Would not go again. 
24253 Negatives: Bland food. Not worth the price or the hassle of having to order family style. Positives: Decorations / ambience is nice. Service was good. Food came out really fast. 
24254 The City Sports is right across from the Gap in Porter Exchange. Of course like all other City Sports they offer a wide variety of sports and active gear. Everyone at this City Sports is real cool. 
24255 Our go to restaurant! The chicken fried chicken is hands down the best in town. It's a great place to take friends, family, or just have a casual date night sitting at the bar. We frequent HP multiple times a month. 
24256 Nice movie theater. I love the no talking and cell phone policy. The food was really good and good portion for the price. The seats are comfortable I wish they reclined more. 
24257 Awesome store and the name "cracked me up"! It's like an adult juice store! Great staff and selection. The one rep was from Philly and we had a great conversation .. prices were on point and wine selections were the best. 
24258 These guys are the masters of the chicken sandwich. Had the chicken philly special today and it was so damn great I almost considered going back for another one. 
24259 I have been to this location twice and both times I was pleasantly surprised. The food is outstanding! We got the Poke Nachos for an appetizer which was amazing and the crunchy ahi salad was also delicious. And the service and drinks were awesome also! 
24260 Great sandwiches, soups and salads. Okay Pizzas. THey offer wine as well. Very clean prep area. And the inside decor is very cool (white) and sleek. Service is quick and great. 
24261 Excellent food, wait staff is friendly and efficient. Great place especially for b'fast! If Tom's is crowded I'll head for the Black Bear. Not inexpensive but a good value for the money. They have pies in large bowls for $6. 
24262 Everyone at TLC is very knowledgeable and professional. I felt very comfortable throughout the entire process. Being able to see with my own eyes after surgery was a surreal experience. 
24263 The new place rocks. Good looking people and NOT a sausage factory. Loaded with College girls. Perfect white, yuppy, college crowd a bar you would expect to find in Athens after a football game. 
24264 I was so impressed by our room when we checked in that I almost wanted to stay there rather than attend the event for which we were in Portland. Clean, comfortable, and very spacious. The staff was very friendly and courteous. Highly recommend it. 
24265 Pretty good CD store - I go here to find older CDs that I would never pay full price for. It is the kind of place that you go into just to browse, and sometimes are able to get lucky and find a gem. 
24266 Asian Fusion food served at a sit down restaurant with lots of Asian decor! The food was good and service was great! Danny did a great job in a busy dining area! 
24267 Food is great, but they do not know how to run a drive through. Waited 20 minutes for the person ahead of me to get their large order. They should had the person park till their food was ready. 
24268 I tried the BAM sandwich today. It was really delicious. Seating space is a bit limited but I like the big wooden tables. 
24269 My favorite breakfast place! Their food is really good and fresh. The service is always fast and courteous. Even when there is a wait it's not that long. Well worth the time and money.

24271 Really good value. Japanese breakfast just like in Japan. Cheerful but slow service if there's more than a couple tables. Both the espresso drinks and smoothies are very satisfying. 
24272 I got the Our burger it was good. My wife got the turkey burger and said it was fair. Service was good and nice atmosphere. 
24273 Always the best food and best service. No other indian restaurant on scott rd can compete with Tastys. 
24274 Fresh squeezed juice for the cocktails...amazing! The oysters Rockefeller were garbage. Great view of the river! 
24275 In a word... Outstanding! Lobster Bisque is incredible as were all of the entrees' my family and I tried upon our first visit. Turner's is without a doubt one of our favorites in Melrose. 
24276 My burger was beyond tasteless.. Fries were too.. I didnt even like the taste of my pickles. My friend took me there b/c they had a "great burger" and he knows I loooove a great burger. This place fell flat for me. 
24277 The whole bowl is pretty simple: beans, rice, guacamole, ect. But the Tali sauce really makes it great! And it's chickpea-based, as opposed to almond-based (the way yumm sauce is), so it's allergy friendly :) Cheap, delicious and healthy is my favorite combination! 
24278 A decent Japanese restaurant. Great atmosphere! A good place to hang out with friends and get drunk while eating delicious pork belly. 
24279 Really good fresh food. Margs were fresh/ food but on smaller side. Food was delicious. Good , easy food in our neighborhood. 
24280 Those momo things are good. The rest, eh. I had beef with green beans and the beef was incredibly dry. Not a fan of this place. 
24281 I love this place. The food is flavorful, authentic and so well priced. Enat has a very unassuming and casual atmosphere and my service was amazing. Can't wait to come back! (Keep in mind - they have Ethiopian beer upon request) 
24282 Easily the best City Pub in Van. $5 happy hour full pints and the most professional staff i have ever enjoyed being served by in my 30 years of drinking. Top Notch 
24283 Staff kinda suck and for the size the price is a bit high. Might try again in a couple weeks and see if my first impression is correct. I think the fact that they are usually empty and that I have never seen them busy only proves me correct. 
24284 I like Mondays, though it's never listed on the website, they have Fried Green Tomatoes! If you're wanting good ole comfort food, Matthew's is the place. 
24285 I love this place and it's my only go to! Clean, super friendly and always ready to help. Gel mani lasts so long and doesn't chip even after 3 weeks. Their massages are great too. 
24286 Amazing. This location is consistent with other locations. The service is quick, the menu is simple, and they consistently sell out of donuts. 
24287 Enjoyed the lemongrass chicken and vermicelli and spring rolls. So delicious! Will definitely order again! 
24288 Incredible food! Great atmosphere and staff! The oysters were fabulous! I will definitely go back! 
24289 The staff remembered us the next day, which was nice. They modified one of there vegetarian entrees for our vegan diet without issue and it was delicious. It was another enjoyable experience. 
24290 China Delight is so convenient to my studio. I've had some decent food, like the Broccoli Tofu...my favorite. But I've never seen so much celery b4 in the Kung pow Shrimp. Celery should not be in Chinese food....or carrots.....I hate that. Please update that recipe! Bamboo shoots, more water chestnuts...pleasssse? 
24291 I'm not as big of a fan as others might be; not like their donuts aren't tasty, but I do feel they're overrated. And quite pricey too. There are now locations in Tokyo and Los Angeles. 
24292 Coolest yogurt place ever. They have quotes about happiness all over their walls as well as notes and drawings from past customers. Very colorful and friendly atmosphere. The yogurt was delicious and they had tons of topping options. 
24293 Very good! The place was super clean, colorful and newer...compared to the neighborhood. I had fried dumplings and pho soup. They have a menu for popular Chinese and Thai dishes. They also have tvs and a small play area for kids. 
24294 Lately I have been coming here for Venus in Furs, a gothy music night which is quite good. The space is perfect for getting some excellent dancing in with a spacious floor and some great places throughout the club to sit down. I even find parking pretty easily! 
24295 These guys are absolutely awesome! Helped me huge with all my questions and was able to help me get my kegerator up and running. Very knowledgable, and willing to work with someone new to the hobby with all my silly questions. Gennaro was a HUGE help...thank you! 
24296 Light dog fighting, betting, cheep drinks and chicks who will put drinks on their tab. 
24297 After Elmer's lost our reservation (AGAIN!) Shari's saved the day! They were able to quickly accommodate our large, physically handicapped, high maintenance party at a moment's notice. Service was quick and friendly, and the staff even remembered us. 
24298 Best fried chicken in USA. Not quite as good as original in Memphis, but still Gus's and still the best chicken in ATX. 
24299 The service was 2nd to none, had a 30 wait tonight at 7pm but, the food was excellent Still can't say enough about the service 
24300 Allways consitent, always tasty, allways warm. We love this place. the service is very natural. 
24301 Great breakfast food! Great service. I have eaten here on two separate occasions while visiting from out of state. 
24302 Don't get chicken pad Thai. There is no chicken OR noodles. Just sprouts. Plus there is a $10 minimum for CC's.. Who does that? 
24303 All of the wraps are delicious especially the urban chicken! Love that they give you a side of chips and salsa too. 
24304 Hey, what can I say....we were hungry and craving for some breakfast food at midnight"-) We don't go to IHOP often...but when we do, it never fails. 
24305 Went here for a b day party! Cool seating and the best ranch I have ever had in my life. I literally would buy it in bulk. Like they should be selling it at Costco. 
24306 My friends had their wedding reception here over the weekend, and it was a blast. The space was cozy, intimate, and laidback -- so everyone felt comfortable and had a great time. Staff was super nice, too. 
24307 One of the few bars in town to serve Mickey's Big Mouth. Saw Helmet a few years back here and was an excellent show. Outside stage with full bar a plus. Unique mix of posers, underage wannabees, and punks makes this a good time for all @Red_7 
24308 Amazing dessert! Newly renovated, easy park, good food, surprised dessert, great service. Can fit big group of people. Wonderful play to hang out. 
24309 Great food and I will definitely be back soon. Can't go wrong with any choice on the menu. Loved it all. 
24310 Delicious. Creamy. Low cal ice cream made daily. Friendly staff and family owned business. 
24311 It was great working with Justin. He was always available when I had a question and took care of any issues that came up. I look forward to working with him again! Thank you 
24312 great as always Tried the butchershop pizza (all meat). great as usual. I cannot find flaw in this pizza place. 
24313 Solid local bar with friendly staff, good pub grub, and free trivia on Thursday nights!! Definitely a must go if you like German beer and food!! They have a back patio too which is cool. The trivia is really fun!! 
24314 Everything was good till I bit into a large piece of glass in my steak taco. 
24315 .manager didn't seem to care but gave the money back. 
24316 Great food and coffee. Good vegan options. Nice patio. I had an omelet with soyrizzo (I am vegetarian, not vegan) which was delicious and filling. My soy cappuccino was well-prepared 
24317 Great people, tasty lunch. A little spendy for lunch 8-9 dollars but very decent slow cooked meats. Didn't try the wings but will be back to try those and then the rating may change! I had Kalua pork. Really good, no sauce and Bol choy. Nice healthy paleo lunch. 
24318 I love fresh juice bars, and Kure is solid. This time I got the detox shot and the queen green smoothie, and definitely felt refreshed and recharged. Another satisfied visit. 
24319 Fantastic...flavours,smells, service. Leaving here wanting more--already thinking about when we can make it back. Bravo Bijou Cafe! 
24320 Worst salsa and guac I have ever tried. Salsa tastes like nothing but garlic and the guacamole is watery and overpowered with lime (like the packaged lime juice, not fresh) Don't be lazy like me and waste your money, make your own! 
24321 My aesthetician Guddi is so experienced and professional she makes it virtually a painless procedure. It's my new go to place for waxing. Something as intimate as a Brazilian wax she makes you feel at ease. 
24322 Food was amazing and for my day off as a bartender myself Sarah the bartender was nothing but perfect! She handled that full bar like a boss! She was so engaging and was so much fun, definitely coming back just to see Sarah! 
24323 Had a great aunt-n-nephew breakfast here on a weekday. Lovely to sit outside. They weren't sure about my coffee order (I asked for an espresso macchiato) but went out of their way to figure it out! And it was perfect. I had scrambled eggs with brie and avocado - tasty. 
24324 Horrible service, just horrible. Drinks don't get refilled, missing food, servers have attitude, I've never given a 1 star review but these people deserve it. 
24325 Nothing special, burger was meh, salad was bland. I'd pass on this and hit Five Guys instead. 
24326 Tastes really good, price is what you should expect. Line up is okay, opens late though, which is pretty annoying on a hot day. Why would you open up at 3? 
24327 Love the food, the ambience and the service. staff goes above and beyond to make you feel welcomed. food is phenomenal. Atlanta needs more places like this! Definitely coming back with more people! 
24328 Love Keke's. I've tried every breakfast place in Clermont and this is the best. Good friendly service with delicious food. On the weekends the wait can be quite long but it's worth it in the end. 
24329 Wonderful venue to meet new, social people. Very welcoming group and perfect way to unwind and have some fun, circa the third grade. Highly recommend. 
24330 Great place! A must visit, rich in history and gorgeous views. Take the tour or walk the grounds, either way its a walk back in time 
24331 Fast service! Fresh food, right on the lake. Beautiful to just unwind with a snack. Try the nachos and Zucchinis you can't go wrong. 
24332 Always more than pleased great prices, always fresh. A weekend usual at this point for me, they have the best Scala bread, cookies & Danish. Me and my girlfriend come here frequently and it's quite the treat for us. Always a favorite! 
24333 Awesome burgers & sushi. Great happy hour food & drink specials. Staff is very friendly and helpful with explaining the specials and making recommendations for first timers. Can't wait to come back again. Great experience. 
24334 Lee is amazing. He stayed late for me, through in a blowout and knew his way around highlights! Seriously, I have had my hair done by at least 30 people before and no one comes close to him! If you are a blonde like me, he is your saving grace! 
24335 I have had many bagels in my life but Katz has the best. These babies blow away those NY bagels. The pizza bagels are superb. Try a bagel dog. There are about a dozen varieties all good. great cream chesses also 
24336 Not very good. I am convinced that the chicken tandoor was reheated chicken from the lunch buffet. Avoid. 
24337 I love little coffee shops and despite this being a Starbucks it has a nice small city feel. Location location location. 
24338 Love the food but the woman behind the counter was either having a bad day or just knows based off there reputation that its ok to have and attitude .... Five for food 2/1/2for service 
24339 I ordered delivery and the food was excellent. The Crispy Duck, Pad Thai, and scallop pancakes were all amaaazzzing. Cannot wait to try more. 
24340 look this doctor very much went to his Dad before him 
24341 In Japan I used to hear a thick ton-kotsu ramen that was just heavenly. The chicken broth here, which they say it takes over ten hours to make, has the same dreamy quality. YUM! 
24342 The four start rating this place enjoys is well justified. The Pad Kee Mao and Tom Yum totally rocked. Don't hesitate to go all in at this place... you will not be disappointed. Now if we could just get one of these off South Lamar in South Austin! 
24343 Dinerbuffet is een tegenvaller, keuze is miniem. Ben al bij diverse sizzlers geweest vroeger maar deze is echt heel slecht 
24344 - Burger perfectly cooked - Chicken sandwich solid - Excellent sweet potato fries - Slow service - Dining room needs better heating 
24345 He was here promptly and was extremely friendly. Made sure to check my ID to my mail to verify I lived there. Would hignly recommend 
24346 We had a wonderful lunch for my daughter!s Birthday. The antipasti, main dishes and wonderful desserts were all lovely. Bravo to the chef. Bravissimo! 
24347 Awesome service and food...i think they have the bestest bread pudding and mac and cheese in Atlanta!!!! We had one server and she rocked it out it was a party of 25 she did not meas one order she got everything correct on the first try! Awesome experience!!! 
24348 Hands down the BEST BREAKFAST EVER! Hash browns had the perfect crispy outside, big, meaty pieces of smoky bacon and fluffy scrambled eggs. Loved it! Would most definitely list this as a winner! 
24349 My review is for the maintenance team, specifically Dorsey. He is always very responsive to repair any request with a smile on his face and a positive attitude. 
24350 Everything I have had here has been great!! The boneless wings are huge, the regular wings are huge, the appetizers are great as well. One star is lacking because for a bar, their draft beer selection is lacking. 
24351 Food was ok but wasnt memorable. It was nothing compared to Anthonys in terms of customer skills. The coffee was not very good either. It was barely warm and tasted more watery than anything 
24352 That is a nice theater and that houses a lot of musicals. I recently went there for my daughter summer internship program called Millennial High But the sound and the seats were all comfortable and the decors absolutely beautiful. 
24353 Had my wedding ceremony and reception here. Great service, food, and drinks. It made my wedding day such a fun and enjoyable experience. Galit was amazing to work with! 
24354 High quality meats provided by smiling employees paired with speedy service. What's not to love? Add to that a local 15lb Fresh Turkey, 2 New York Steaks, dog bones, and Pastrami, all for under $60 - WOW! I will definitely be back! 
24355 Nicely maintained, good for average to good golfers, and a delight to walk. Best bang for your buck south of CMH. 
24356 We had a rice cake soup and seafood tofu stew. Overall, food wasn't that bad but some Banchans are overly salty. 
24357 This place is freakin awesome...Yak burger so damn good...you gotta go and check this place out...you will not be disappointed, in case you are, leave me a note... 
24358 Well this is for sure a dive bar. The good news is that they have real cheap drink prices. 
24359 Had a Super Roast Beef sandwich for lunch and it was absolutely delicious Could be the best roast beef I ever had. Very tender, thinly sliced and very tasty. 
24360 This smoothie king is all about the deliciousness John was amazing and extremely helpful. I commend the owner on hiring such an amazing employee 
24361 Nacho Salad!!!!!!!!! AMEN!!! Beer!!!!! AMEN!!!!! Wait...hurry up and eat people!!!!! I'm starving!!! People with TATTOOS-HAHAHA! Mom I'm not the only crazy one around here. Outside seating-AMAZING Inside seating-Hi, I a wasp was invading my privacy!!! It was really fun though!! I wish they had one in San Francisco! 
24362 Excellent crisp crust. Had the kale pizza with sausage substituted by artichokes. Was very tasty. Flavors were subtle but great. Not drowning in cheese or tomato based sauce. Pleasant outdoor seating. 
24363 The pizza is very good. Crisp crust with a diced tomato sauce and just the right amount of cheese. This place is old school. Prices were very low in my opinion. Cash only. 
24364 For a dinner place I really like there food it's a cute neigbor hood joint. I recommend the farmers potatoes and the blueberry pancake. 
24365 We walked across the street from Ria's and enjoyed our brief visit, albeit with some signs for folks we couldn't care less about as northerners in our 20s. 
24366 Only tried the vanilla cream puff. The puff was dry and the cream had too much whipped cream in it. Pure custard is the way to go folks. 
24367 Great place for a haircut,mike and sol always remember you and always remember your haircut. All the barbers are top notch guys, been going there for years (used to be ye olde clip joint). 
24368 Naked women and byob. My kinda place. Sounds like a recipe for a good time, eh? 
24369 They did my wedding and I've been getting so many compliments! I'm Type A, with high expectations. I had a specific style and they nailed it! Within my budget too! Excellent design and customer service! You will be so happy you chose them! 
24370 Super nice and friendly and Grumps (persian cat) looks super adorable with his new furcut! 
24371 We went for a business dinner for a party of 6 last week. Take their recommendations! It's worth it. Order family style and enjoy! Amazing service made for a wonderful experience! Thank you Karen! 
24372 This place is probably the best tapas place in south austin. Try the beef heart - it's much better than I would have suspected. Squid ink paella not bad, but will likely try one of the other varieties when we go back. 
24373 Wonderful hazelnut latte. Crappy hazelnut latte. Depends on who makes it. There's no quality control at any of these places! 
24374 It's shocking how every time I come here there is someone new working, yet they're always equally as rude and disinterested. Also food is mediocre and way overpriced. Don't waste your time and go to cocobeet down the street 
24375 The sales associate didn't say a word to me when I walked in. She was totally non-responsive. Poor customer service. 
24376 Friendly helpful staff with amazing drinks. They have a large menu and are ready to help you decide what you would like. The store is clean and flows well. I'm in love 
24377 Have been to Thailand many times, and Little Duck is the real thing. Great service and Thai hospitality too. 
24378 I've been going to Bukhara for years and it's just getting worse to go to the restaurant. The service is incredibly poor. They've also changed several recipes and the food isn't as good as it used to be. I'm sad to say I'm done with Bukhara. 
24379 Had lunch there while visiting Boston from CT. We ordered a vegetable pizza which was delicious and too large for 2 of us to finish. Great outdoor seating. Highly recommend. 
24380 I love this homedepot,it has the best associates in this store then anywhere,willing to do anything for you.and always plenty of smiles.store 0262 at casselberry is the bomb. 
24381 came during happy hour, nothing but great things to say. the big ass burger is indeed big and yummy. the lamb was good too and i assume so is everything else. the service was prompt and the view is amazing overlooking the lake! 
24382 Great place for froyo downtown. It's close to a bunch of restaurants we go to, and we almost always go here for dessert. 
24383 They do it right!! Always courteous and efficient... I do my alterations here as well, never any issues 
24384 These girls were amazing! They did amazing on my nails they were soooo detailed it was amazing. My nails are 3 weeks old now and they still look amazing and my toe nails haven't chipped at all! I will deff come back! :) 
24385 Hands down best Indian in Boston....great service and amazing food. Our favorites include Malai shrimp, Chili Chicken, and Lamb Rogan Josh. DELISH!! 
24386 It took an hour to get food delivered but worth it. The orange chicken was really good. Orange rind, i wouldn't describe as candied but sweer really makes this dish stand out. 
24387 Keep walking! Came here for breakfast one morning. Everything was edible, at best. Also, there was a bum going table to table, and harassing people on the line waiting to order asking if anyone had some spare change. The staff didn't even try to get rid of her. Preposterous! 
24388 Cool atmosphere but they don't have enough seating for the crowd so it makes it uncomfortable. Sure there is a fire code violation or something. Music is great though. 
24389 I had a bridesmaid dress altered and when I came in to try it on, it was a perfect fit. The work was impeccable to a point where, despite a challenging material, I cannot tell where the alterations were made. Very pleased! 
24390 Trinity upstairs was a great stop on a lazy Sunday afternoon. We were early and the only customers but our server Paoula made us feel like royalty. Great prices and service. 
24391 Great melts and friendly staff. Tried the Slow Poke Rodriguez and Mac The Knife alibg with the tomato bisque soup everything was excellent. Not to mention the Stone Fruit lemonade the teens loved. Thank you Matt and Parker! 
24392 Great food! Some of the fried stuff is too greasy. Awesome menu, although a bit hectic. One of the few such restaurants in the area. Fish selection is strong 
24393 The food is quite good, and the drinks were tasty. Since it's tapas, the servings are quite small. So this won't be a cheap dinner. But it will be tasty. Can't wait for the weather to really warm up to enjoy how open-air this restaurant is. 
24394 Please note this location is currently shut down due to a fire. I'm hoping it will open soon because it's the closest one to me. 
24395 The food was amazing. I brought my sister and fianc'e here on a whim. The bar area is very relaxing and almost a sensual vibe. 
24396 Out of towner staying and the apartment down the street. This place has everything I need and the location is great. Great pastries. 
24397 The only yarn shop like this in the world that I know of. Great service, wide selection and they ship too! I always make a point of shopping there when I visit Portlalnd. I've also bought yarn from them online. LOVE this place!! 
24398 A small town feel in the middle of the trendy Short North. Great for a casual hang out. 
24399 Amazing tacos, definitely rival the authentic ones you get in Mexico. Great service, fast. Will be definitely going back. 
24400 Came back & helped fix stains & followed up hace descent prices 
24401 Love this place, great coffee and food made from scratch. Awesome customer service and nice people. Highly recommend. 
24402 had time to kill before my alamo movie but hiked it here rather than the much closer vox. so glad i did. superb brunch. everything exquisite... the bacon, the salad, the eggs, the bread, the wine. i will so be back here. 
24403 I've trained at The Portland Ballet since I was 11 years old, a total of 7 years. The remodeled space is beautiful with 3 studios and a large spacious lobby. The teachers are wonderful. Ultimately, my training at TPB helped me get a contract with a professional ballet company. 
24404 The food is incredible at this place. Probably one of my top brunch meals I have had. Though it took a while to get a table, it was worth the wait. The service is top notch as well. 
24405 I love Sea World. Primarily because I love the sea. The park lets you get up close and personal with their residents. Great aquariums, and of course the Shamu show. The sea lion show was also quite amusing with a grand finale of a walrus breakdancing. Hilarious. 
24406 you should have a bit of alcohol to eat here. It's just greasy good food to get you to bed full after a late night. 
24407 I love Cuban food and we don't get that much in Dallas. I saw this place was close to the hotel and decided to try it. I got the Cuban Sandwich (which may be my first ever). Extremely good. Very fast and very friendly. Will try it again. 
24408 The tacos are solid!!! I would say they were a tad dry but really awesome! We tried the chorizo, pastor, chicken, steak. My girls had a chicken quesadilla and they cleaned their plate! A shining star here is the Guacamole! 
24409 This place is great good food ,friendly thank you Paola for great Service her coworker Carmen the Manager 
24410 very good atmosphere.my wife and I se thank you 
24411 Delish!! We had the all you can eat and it did not disappoint! Service is a bit slow and very serious but the food made up for it. Would have liked to be told which roll was which. 
24412 Always, always come here once a week for 5 years. Ann our wonderful server knows us of course. Food is delicious and can ask to so some changes 
24413 Although it doesn't top specialty pizza places such as Fig's, Bertucci's is definitely one of the best pizza places to go to in Boston. All of their brick oven pizza tastes excetionally good. 
24414 Give this little unassuming place a try today. The menu's got a decent share of items, and I must say I've not had better migas anywhere else. Extremely nice staff to top it up. It might just be my new favorite breakfast place in Austin. 
24415 Our first experience was not what we expected, but i must say Michelle the GM of this bahama breeze really made sure we went back and have a better experience with them, we went back this weekend and had the service and the food was excellent. 
24416 Seems they have had a management change... Doing a lot better in regard to customer service. Food quality good too. 
24417 Why would you make the to go order so so so so spicy when I did not request this?!!! Are you trying to kill me? Wow, this is terrible. :( Its making me feel like I'm going to puke. This is insane. 
24418 I love this place. We've been coming to this place forever. Always great food and drinks. We made the mistake of going on Cinco De Mayo. The wait was 45 mins, but luckily we grab a table at the bar which are first come first serve. 
24419 Shaking beef is flavorful, tender and scrumptious. Eggplant is outstanding. Lemongrass chicken vermicelli just so-so. Portions could be larger given price. Good vibe--decor, location, seating arrangement, etc. good experience but not great value. 
24420 For a place that everyone hates to go to make it even remotely enjoyable to go there is something that should be recognized. I absolutely love the team here and always receive the best service from whomever I come in contact with .. Dentist appointments made enjoyable? Check 
24421 Food at Zaz is off the charts - chef is pretty much a genius. 
24422 Mostly overpriced junk here. I was looking for a screen door & was very disappointed with their stock. I'll go to the Rebuilding Center on N Mississippi instead because I heard it was much better. 
24423 Great local bar! The staff is all very nice, drinks are quite reasonable and the crowd is always a pleasure. Definitely my new regular drinking spot. 
24424 New Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood? We had to give it a shot. Unfortunately, the food is bad and the service is mediocre. All for twice the cost of most other Mexican restaurants in the area. I strongly recommend that you avoid wasting your time or money here. 
24425 Best eggs benedict I've ever had, and I've ordered eggs benedict at a lot of different breakfast spots. They do, however, charge 75 cents to split orders. I thought that was a bit ridiculous, but that's just me being nitpicky. 
24426 Will NEVER come back. Bought pizza n beverages. Then preceded to eat cake we brought in. Then we were told we could not have because we didn't have a paid party. Way to go skate zone to break a 7 year old heart. BOYCOTT! 
24427 Had a lamb skewer and a chicken skewer over salad. The meat was tender and the juicy marinade is a very tasty combo of spices. Definitely a great place to grab lunch. 
24428 This is a great lunch spot. We struggled to decide on what to eat as everything sounded so good. We finally made our decisions and didn't regret a single bite. The food was excellent as was the service. We will be back. 
24429 Phenomenal. I had the fish in coconut sauce with plantains. The sauce was absolutely perfect, creamy and flavorful. My brothers steak was tender and full of flavor. Our server was kind. I will be back next time I'm in Boston. 
24430 Excellent food !! The guacamole and salsa's are amazing. They have a huge menu to choose from as well. I could eat here everyday ! 
24431 Went with a large group! Our first time there. Got to try a little of everything, got a tour of the pit! This was amazing! 
24432 WHY is this place carpeted? It gives me the creeps. 
24433 Good place for Thai food, everything in here is so good. Definitely worth a try. The Panang Curry and the Red Curry are so good, not to mention the Roasted Duck as well. Five stars. 
24434 Highly overrated...I tried the blueberry, bourbon and basil and I couldn't taste any of those 3 ingredients. Very average donut place charging $3.25 per donut...I felt scammed. Disappointing. 
24435 Pineapple fried rice take out. It tastes so weird. Veggies,meat are not fresh at all. 
24436 Not going to lie, but the beef rib was probably the best rib I've ever had in my life. Yes, it was 1.5 lbs. Yes, it cost $27. Yes, it was worth it. 
24437 I think I'm here once a week, best ice cream around! I love their mint chip frozen yogurt and black raspberry chip frozen yogurt! The portion sizes are huge which is another reason why I love them. 
24438 This place is Always packed!!! No matter what time you, that just means the food is THAT GOOD where guest's continue to eat here. This is my 4/5th visit and the ambience is just what you need after a long day 
24439 This place has completely changed since my last review. The space is much larger, the service is fantastic, and the rolls are excellent. 
24440 Typical american breakfast -brunch place, with little bit upgraded menu and design inside cafe. If i knew it is going to be that typical, i'd not follow. I guess this is a really old place and a good reputation since it has so many reviews. 
24441 Hands down the best pizza in Hunters Creek. The lasagna, pinwheels, and house salad are also fantastic. Great people and great service too. 
24442 Very impressed with this little hole in the wall. Picked up a "supreme" pizza, and it was very good. Didn't dine in, but could have, because there was no one dining in; although the atmosphere was nice. Will definitely go back!~ 
24443 I have given this place 2 tries and it has been an awful experience, so bad that the pizza deliver guy told me that he will no longer deliver to me because he had difficulty delivering to my secured building, he was so rude and nasty. Awful!!!! 
24444 Biggest veggie tempura app I've ever seen and the Pad See Ew was incredible, Slighty charred noodles and so flavorful. 
24445 Great lunch menu selection! I had the strawberry fields salad with grilled chicken, and it was so fresh and delicious! The view is beautiful as well! 
24446 The people that work here are so nice. They really made it feel like home and were so accommodating. Plus their products are beautiful! 
24447 Dinner was amazing. Homemade pasta was delicious. Wait staff was very attentive 
24448 Highly recommend. 
24449 I have never been here but Imgur told me to come here. 5 stars for the internet. 
24450 03/20/2011 A CATERPILAR IN MY VEGETABLES !!! HORRIBLE. The manager only made a discount of $5. When I asked her if it was normal to pay for a plate with a big chenille in it, she only made our sodas for free! What a SHAME! 
24451 so yummy. great price. great service. something for everyone (my carnivore boyfriend and my vegetarian self) 
24452 Every thing was good but I especially liked the.lobster bisque it was magnificent another thing that I loved was the the Filet mignon that was wrapped in bacon 
24453 Can it get any better? Seriously. Out-of-this-world service with staff who generally seem happy and also enjoy their jobs. The tacos are even a step above the service. Well done Taco Kings of Cambie! 
24454 Best fried chicken wings in Portland, and the jojos...daaaaaamn! When I first got those wings I thought I'd need some dipping sauces but they are delectable on their own- juicy, flavorful and meaty. 
24455 They have a selection of Mango and Durian desserts/drink for those who are fan of Mango or Durian. The location is very easy to get to and walkable from Richmond Centre. I would like to come back and try the other items on the menu. 
24456 Fantastic Mexico City style cuisine. Trust me, I'm from Mexico City and this style is not easy to find, or imitate. 
24457 Great gluten free and vegan options (GF injera is amazing) and wonderful service! Only sorry it has taken us so long to dine here. We will be back! 
24458 Their pizza is pretty good but everything else is canned crap. The service was good but again it doesn't make up for the bad food. It's over priced for the quality, I'm amazed they stay in business. 
24459 Best sushi in Orlando. Love the service and it's a nice clean place. I would definitely recommend stopping here to eat. 
24460 Took my fianc√© with a group for her birthday. Food was delicious. Service was excellent. We had a large group and they split the checks. It's an authentic Greek restaurant and I highly recommend. I am picky and could find a lot of things to eat. 
24461 Love this theater. For awhile we didn't have a nice theater in Deltona and it was always worth the drive to come out here. The seating is good, the screens are nice, the concessions are up to snuff. You can't go wrong. 
24462 Enjoyed my meal. Tasted great. Portions more than plenty for even a heavy eater. I brought a good portion home. Definitely worth trying! 
24463 Incredible sushi/ habachi.. This is a go-to favorite for my wife and I. Try their Rolls-Royce and Bubba roll 
24464 Mel Bucher is the best bar tender on the planet. Best Mexican restaurant in town by far.... Absolutely love this place. 
24465 I don't know who's giving this place all these good stars but this place is very mediocre.. My food was cold, cabbage was something id never had the plate looked thrown together, and the "jerk" chicken was not even close.'more like smoke with a weird bbq sauce 
24466 Only problem is sometimes it's cheaper to book through the course itself... it's not always a deal unless it's the "hot deal" ! But it's easy and quick ... just call the course first because it's cheaper sometimes especially in Florida where the prices drop in the summer! 
24467 Not fine dining, but a solid choice from the pub/bar niche. Good happy hour specials (till 7) and friendly service. Lots of TVs in all sections, booths that fit 6, and close to the zoo. 
24468 Pretty consistent every time you go. The food is good but not amazing. I really enjoy their honey chicken- it's crispy and good flavor with a nice kick to it. Service is good, no complaints. Cute decor and ambiance. 
24469 No small patties in stock, so no dollar menu burgers, then they read our order back correctly but give us a bag of fries without the $3.50 burger that we paid for. 
24470 Small market. The fruit is always fresh and prices are reasonable compared to nearby supermarkets. The salad bar is awesome and you can order make to order sandwiches at the deli. Great place to stop on a lunch break. Some picnic tables outside. 
24471 The best dish I have had in a long time. If you go here do yourself a favor and order the grilled catfish. It was incredible! 
24472 Yummy local and convenient BBQ! No waiting in lines just enjoying good food. Chili with spicy waffle was awesome. People who run the truck are super nice. 
24473 It's all about the food, not the d√©cor, here. The food is worth twice the price they set for it IMO, and it came out a nanosecond after we ordered it. One of my favorite restaurants in Orlando. 
24474 Door guy is a SCROOGE!!!!!! They are all grinches with roaches crawling on them. Worst place EVER! Waiting in line for 2 hours is a no go. Drinks were not good enough to make up for my NUMB feet. Bye. 
24475 So we get there and they card my student who is in his late 30s. He shows his Argentinean ID, and we're told it must be his passport. Seriously who who requires passport? 
24476 The food is consistently good at this location! I will continue to here. When ordering thru Uber, be careful... I ordered 2 sandwiches and they did not send the flavor or amount of sauces I asked for. Everyone knows the sauces are just as important as the food!!! 
24477 Such a fun place to stop by after a nice run on the esplanade. There frittatas & breakfast burritos are amazing! The staff is always helpful as well. 
24478 My favorite spot on the Lake! Ask for Ari he's an awesome waiter and has been there for ever. Make sure to have a run runner before you leave! 
24479 Great service and very good breakfast food. Eggs with pot roast the best around. Great home fries. Waitress staff is very friendly. Never have to ask for a coffee refill. Cash only 
24480 $9 kids meal. I'm sure the food is good but there is absolutely NO value. Sat down and was too tired to try to go someplace else. 
24481 I have been using Flea Busters for several years and they always do a great job. My flea, roach and ant problems are taken care of. I highly recommend them. 
24482 Service is very good. We came near the kitchen closing time and the staff was not hesitant making the the dishes or offering the desert menu. Food was well prepared and delicious. Nice place to have dinners. 
24483 The best quesadillas around. We go every time were in Salem. Also the Direwolf drink is amazing. 
24484 I've been living at Cielo for about 6 months now, and couldn't be happier. The staff is amazing, the grounds are well kept, maintenance is responsive, and my neighbors have all been super friendly. Definitely my favorite apartment residence yet! 
24485 Been here for over 10 minutes and not one person working has even greeted us or even said "hello" or acknowledged us...as we were leaving someone finally called out to us. We decided to stay. The haircuts we got were good, especially for the price. 
24486 Great happy hour. This restaurant has lots of vegetarian options! 
24487 Delicious food! Big portions. This is a small place that fills up fast. Go earlier than you think to ensure you get a spot before the wait gets long! 
24488 Yummmmmmmm. The cinnamon rolls are amazing. Coffee is perfect. Will be back for more! 
24489 Excellent service excellent food we spent about 70$ on 2 meals 2 drinks and an appetizer but totally worth EVERY PENNY 
24490 Beer selection in itself warrants 5 stars. Service is amazing. We're so pleased to see restaurants like this in our area! 
24491 Awesome Food , Quick Service We had the howling wolf Burrito and the Fried Avacado Tacos !!! Delicious 
24492 Such crooks. Half the time stuff doesn't work. The one in Holbrook was a joke. You have to cancel your card to stop getting charged even though you cancel per their policy, you call them, you send it in writing etc. 
24493 There's nothing like this around- and an amazing location. I'm surprised there aren't more yelp reviews because Everyone goes here. Reasonably priced, friendly family run business with lots of inventory. SUP (easy to stand up), kayaks, fishing kayaks etc. Plus you can't beat paddling around Marblehead's million dollar views. 
24494 Can't say enough good things about Marukin! Sooo good, super high quality. The broth in the Tonkotsu is AWESOME! Prices are totally worth every penny! Gets SUPER busy though, so get there early! 
24495 Mango strawberry habanero infused tequila. Carne asada fork and knife burrito. Hot salsa that was so delicious, I asked for a to-go container. Awesome manager that put on the Patriots pre-season game for our table. Happy girl. 
24496 The dumplings and green onion pancakes were very fresh and delicious. I also recommend the steamed bun with condensed milk. 
24497 Great place for an intimate dinner with a few close friends or family or just you and the S.O. Chef's tasting menu is a must. Love the vibe of this place. Excellent service. 
24498 Love the park! Go early to get good spot. Bring your own floatation devices and some sort of sandal or flip flop, the rock can be annoying sometime. Best if go during summer. 
24499 Super, super nice people who work here. If I have the misfortune of being in the area I make a stop here and I am reminded that there are nice people in the world. 
24500 no smoking allowed here !!!! the bar is usually not very crowded, but it is fun, the folks are friendly, good bartenders , nice space -- there is also a very nice outside patio for the smokers - I wish smoking was not allowed in any bars/restaurants in atlanta -- 
24501 Agree with Jessica. I just called for an appointment, and the woman answering, Dawn, was totally rude. Too bad. I agree, you can only rely on the "average" review so far, but when you hear nightmare stories -- I'm not going to waste my time. 
24502 Yup. Great people. Great values. The management and staff here are amazing, simply amazing. Thank you all for your help and advice through the years. Regards, 
24503 Had sample cupcakes at the Art museum evening event and they weren't anything special and were a bit dry. Maybe when you get them from the truck they are better? 
24504 Fast turn around time but I have had to ask them reclean a few items. Open long hours which is fantastic. 
24505 Great live music, food and drinks. 
24506 Everyone enjoyed what they ordered. Great view and vibe on a Sunday afternoon and very nice staff. 
24507 Authentic Asian bakery making quite delicious cakes and pastries. Haven't gotten bread from here before though. 
24508 Awesome shop! I just got into town for a couple weeks for work and they set me up with everything I need to enjoy Austin by bike. Rented me a nice bike, helmet, lock, lights, the works. 
24509 Best breakfast I have had in Boston. Ask about the Brazilian hot sauce. Eggs benidic with capers was to die for. The staff is great and the line is out the door even tho it is like 10 degrees outside 
24510 Food was great, good cup of coffee. Staff was a little slow and too concerned with the buffet. Don't expect refills, but the food is pretty damn good. 
24511 I'm so stuffed I'm sick. Fried chicken, and collard greens were so good it's ridiculous. The corn bread stuffing wasn't as good but still tasty. Our server couldn't have been sweeter either. I'd come back happily!! 
24512 I get the best Veal Parm I've ever had in my life there. I will definitely be going here for years to come!!!! 
24513 This place has yummy food. The CBZ ALFREDO is the best!!! 
24514 It's a Starbucks, folks. They have coffee, wi-fi, and various other stuffs. You know...If you don't know Starbucks, you should probably get out of your cave a little more. ...I really don't feel like writing any more... 
24515 Never going back to this place. For about three years I have been going here and have enjoyed their desserts. Well no more I am done because they don't stand behind their desserts at all. 
24516 So many vibrant, in-your-face flavors! Good luck in future endeavors! Our reservation was a late one because they were so busy; our options were slim. Luckily, we still had our full. And their desserts-- more than outstanding! We ended up ordering another round 
24517 Great staff, average food. The prices are higher than cracker barrel. The food fills you up but doesn't leave you rushing to come back. 
24518 Delicious, fast, healthy, cheap, vegetarian food in downtown boston? I'm game! The bean bowl is delicious and very vegan friendly! I did a little review at http://dontwhitesugarcoatit.blogspot.com/2009/05/jack-and-giant-bean-bowl.html if you want more details! Definitely get the sauces on your bean bowl-both are scrumptious! 
24519 Cool romantic atmosphere. Great drinks especially obviously margaritas. Very good menu range. Did was delicious. Very good personable service. 
24520 Amazing! I got the seasonal toast and an almond milk chai. Would definitely recommend the chai. The music and atmosphere is very relaxing and inviting. 
24521 Food is not impressive. The only thing acceptable is the soup. Business attitude isn't very good, won't go again. 
24522 Just call and listen to their voicemail message. That's what you'll get for service. They're too good for you. Stuck up. I don't need some 18 y/o looking down her nose at me as I want to spend $700/month for your service. 
24523 No one does it better than these guys! I've been all around the city, trying nail place that happen to be convenient at "that moment" and then I'm reminded why I shouldn't go anyplace other than Gaelic! 
24524 Went last night for dinner, seekh kebab tasted baked , maybe I am wrong but portion was little for the price. Bihari kebab was chicken not bad but better tastes if it was beef. Nihari was ok but Nan were too thin and some parts not cooked properly. 
24525 There are only two things you need to know about the brandied pear w/ dark chocolate & candied ginger streusel pie: 1. It's too good to be true. 2. It's seasonal so hurry up and go get it before it's too late. You owe it to yourself. 
24526 GREAT place! State inspection: We were in and out in less than 10 minutes! Excellent place and excellent customer service! 
24527 Meatloaf was very good ....I had a very good meal here. Staff was very friendly as well. Place was quiet and was very relaxing. Prices are fair. Something for everyone on the menu and breakfast all day. I'll be back. 
24528 Hard to get service when it's way crowded, everything else is good though. Food is fantastic, decor is as well. Try the dim sum basket appetizer. There's an upstairs too. 
24529 They should call this the Yuk and Yukkier. Really hated the what ever kind if goop they served today what ever it was it wasn't Asian. Do yourself a favor and pack a sandwich. The shows are great but the food at the parks have a lot to be desired. 
24530 I've never tried the food here, but checked out the menu and saw that it's actually a tad different from its affiliated Red Lantern restaurant. The nightlife has potential but it's wasted on an abundance of bar space with less than ample space for patrons. 
24531 there was a large group before us so the wait was quite long. The food was delicious, I was so satisfied with my meal I will definitely be coming back! 
24532 Cute old timey place. Pretty good diner food. Visit for the decor and to take you back a few years. 
24533 Every time I visited Austin before eventually moving here 3 weeks ago, I had to stop at Torchy's. Best taco's I've ever had. Actually going there again right now, lol. 
24534 Amazing view!!!! Come here for the view for sure! The food is good and service excellent... Very formal,and good for special occasion. A bit of an older crowd, but overall excellent experience!!!! 
24535 Affordable, Efficient and Kind. Very pleased with the service we received. They cleared everything out of our 2 bedroom apartment in about 40 minutes. I will definitely be using them the next time I move. 
24536 Found this hidden Gem which has great reviews on Yelp. Great service, quality work, very nice accommodating tech... Will visit again when in Atlanta. 
24537 Very clean, nicely decorated. The pedicure chairs are new, they use a liner when doing pedis which is a plus. Hot stone massage with a basic pedicure. The woman I had did such a great job with my mani and my pedi. Will definitely be back! 
24538 The woman who took our order was so upbeat and nice. I ordered one of the specials that was a short stack of pancakes, bacon and and egg. I don't drink coffee so she substituted something else in its place. The food arrived quickly and was delicious. 
24539 Wow she was completely horrible despite not having to greet me she only serve her previous customer the flowers are pretty dead too not to mention her lunch was with the bouquet all together. It was a mess. 
24540 Great friendly service at the bar. Food was different but very tasty. This is so cheap compared to Bartlett's and the service is real. I really dont think you can wrong here. My new fav! 
24541 I usually have the catfish tacos or the grilled chicken salad, and it's always good. The people are always friendly & the food is fast. A reliable standby! 
24542 even tho i like coming here out of convinience, lately the place smells musty and the equipment seems to be breaking down.. it really needs a good revamp. 
24543 When they say underground, they mean it. Food is good. Good value. 
24544 Food was tasty. Ordered a drink and didn't get it until I ate all of my soup. Not staffed very well for lunch crowd. Music way too loud in the dining room. Difficult to communicate with your table mates! Prob a better place for dinner. 
24545 If you ever come to Atlanta, this is the hotel you should stay! The room is luxury and clean. We also dine at the hotel restaurant, the food was delicious too. The best of all- it's only $195 a night. What a deal! 
24546 The food is good and the atmosphere is fantastic but the service leaves alot of room cor improvement. If eating here, do not be in a hurry. We waited over 30 minutes for an appetizer, but it was good. We'll eat here again but when we have plenty of time....... 
24547 Thumbs up for the crispiest fries ever! Oh and the burger is pretty good too. Hand packed and topped with the standard tomato, ice berg, and pickles. There were two slivers of red onion that were kind of pointless. It's a definite treat to come here for a decent burger. 
24548 Nice statue of Lincoln in the park block, Read the plaques around it, interesting information like he turned down being Governor of Oregon, It turned out OK, he became the President and we still have this statue of him looking deep in thought (it was donated though). 
24549 Love the coop! We come here about 3 times a month. The chicken and waffles are the best I've ever had! The bread pudding with the icing on top is a must!!!! 
24550 Really tasty and not expensive. They seem to do everything very well - sushi, noodles, rice dishes, skewers, salads, tempura and at reasonable prices especially happy hour. Expect a wait during busy hours. 
24551 there are not enough words to give this place another review. Their cheeseburgers are not premade patties, delicious. Turkey subs are fresh turkeys she bakes daily. 
24552 The chairs by the windows are the world's most comfortable chairs. Perfect neighborhood coffee shop. The patio area is very cozy in nice weather. The baked goods are great, and the staff is prompt and their product is always right on. 
24553 All I can say is AMAZING! The store manager helped me with all the possibilities in her store and offered to ship the items she could special order for me. This is awesome since I live in Elgin! LOVE this place! Thanks Triva! 
24554 Evan is absolutely amazing. A talented guy-- best massage I've had. I see him monthly. A combination of swedish and deep tissue techniques. Always asks for feedback on the pressure. I couldn't ask for anything more. Not a fancy salon but clean, quiet and very relaxing. 
24555 Have been here many times and everytime it's never a disappointment except when they change menu but then I'll find something new and love it all over again. 
24556 Living in Florida and choose Affairs to Remember from their Yelp ratings to send flowers to a friend in Melrose. Amazingly easy online ordering with a good selection. DELIVERED SUPER FAST within 1 hour of ordering. Would highly recommend Affairs to Remember. 
24557 Standard breakfast place, wasn't too impressed with the food or the cafeteria like loud atmosphere. 
24558 This place has the best food and the nicest employees. They are inexplicably cheerful 
24559 I stopped by in the early afternoon last weekend with my husband and had a very pleasant experience. The food was very great and fast. It looks like a nice place to come back with our son as well with a nice outside seating area. 
24560 Stayed here multiple times for baseball. Clean, friendly and across street with multiple options to eat. 
24561 The best cafe ever 
24562 fresh food and super clean place 
24563 fresh fruit smoothies and fresh baked pastries everyday with a fantastic coffee 
24564 Lots of choices for a good price. It was super busy, but the service was great and buffet style means no wait! Sushi was pretty good for a place that is all you can eat. Loved the salmon, teriyaki chicken, been sprouts, peach cobbler, and the assortment of Sushi rolls 
24565 Had an amazing experience here. The food, the culture and the service are all worth the wait if you don't make a reservation. The restaurant manager made sure my party was enjoying everything and checked up on us. Barca Wine Bar is a must go to! 
24566 Great atmosphere and very very tasty pho! Would definitely recommend this place. The waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. 
24567 I love this place and it's my only go to! Clean, super friendly and always ready to help. Gel mani lasts so long and doesn't chip even after 3 weeks. Their massages are great too. 
24568 good food, good location, nice feel and environment but man the food takes a loooooooooong time to appear :) 
24569 Really friendly staff. Very helpful and courteous. The pharmacy fills my prescription within minutes and is my go to place when I'm in a hurry. 
24570 Excellent water service. Delicious sushi. Amazing service. Excellent language skills. They even charged our phone. 
24571 I love the MacTarnahan's Black Watch Cream Porter. Great cocoa/coffee flavor. When i can find it available again, lemme at it! 
24572 I would love to first say -- THE RICE WAS LIKE MY ABUELA'S RICE. You can always tell a legit cook in the kitchen by the rice. It was perfect. I could literally eat a bowl of it alone. The tacos were also excellent. I had mole on corn. :) 
24573 Stop it! Best fried chicken in town. Wait, in all the surrounding towns as well. If you are hankering for some good ole fried chicken this is you place. Tell your friends and grab 5 bucks to get a 7. You will not be disappointed!!! 
24574 Step up from a crack motel. Briana and staff are stupid and rude! Hotel is old and dated. Never again will I stay here! 
24575 Made and appointment and waited for 40 minutes. She probably took a walk in that was getting color done = more money. Not good business practice and not professional at all. I left and will not be coming back. 
24576 Probably average bike shop competence but it just crushes my soul every time I have to go in there and speak to an employee. These people are reluctantly helpful. They are basically banking on their monopoly of location in the Alberta area here. 
24577 Very enjoyable specialty rolls. We like the Rainbow Bridge roll the best. Red Dragon was also good. Side salad was below average however. Very friendly service but a bit harried. 
24578 Soooo good!!! You actually wont believe its vegan. A must-try! 
24579 Breakfast was delicious. The wicked French toast was out of this world. The baby Benny was to die for, the sauce was the best I've ever had. Home fries, amazing. My husband and I loved it. Service is great!!! Can't beat this place, does not disappoint. 
24580 I'm not really one to leave reviews on yelp, but this place is terrible. They were out of all salad items, food was cold, lamb was super fatty. If you're looking for solid Greek food, I'd look elsewhere. 
24581 Mark was very nice! Food was delicious & service was fast. They pay attention to detail! Highly recommend. The shaggy dog & cucumber wrap are amazing 
24582 Amazing! Tracy and team were wonderful! Excellent mani and pedi and Mika gave me the most wonderful massage. I am walking away pampered and relaxed. I will be back! 
24583 Everything was great. Food was tasty and our server tiffany was pleasant and knowledgeable. Will be back next time I come for a vacation. 
24584 excellent food, My left over packaging leaked all over my bag (wouldn't have if plastic container was tight and in plastic bag). so....eat all your food cause if you take it home, subject to leak in your designer bag. 
24585 worst service ever! they keep rushing & ignoring us. we decided to leave the table to get the check at the front desk. we waited for about 10 minutes to pay so we can leave 
24586 I had the fried green tomato Benedict, a great spin on one of my favorites. Flavors include a crunchy fried green tomato with roasted red pepper, bacon and a creamy hollandaise Over two perfectly poached eggs. Cheesy grits are great too! Yum! 
24587 This mall has drastically improved from the old NorthCross! It has many shops, restaurants, and ice skating rink, and things to do.. Not to mention, it has the best salon inside it!! Check out Ozen Salon and Spa if your in NorthCross Mall, they will take walk ins! 
24588 This is the best JP licks yet! from there all glass setting to the beautiful location it's the best JP licks you could go to very friendly people and a very nice outdoor patio to enjoy your ice cream or shakes 
24589 My favorite is the cookies and cake batter shake 
24590 One of the best brunches I have had in the Boston area. Amazing staff and amazing views of Boston harbor. I ended up getting the Manimosa and it was wonderful. 
24591 Best place in Portland for indoor plant selections! They are always welcoming and helpful. 
24592 Celebrated two Birthdays over a superb lunch of vegetarian Ph√≤ and Ph√≤ Oregon didn't disappoint! Great service, extensive menu, super fresh ingredients! It was a epicurean experience. The Ph√≤ was as beautiful as it was delicious! #1 in Portland. Grateful! 
24593 The pizza usually is good. The flavor is great. Unfortunately I just ordered delivery and my pizza arrive with half of the toppings and cheese half on the pizza and box. I don't think I will order from them for awhile. Maybe a different location will have better quality. 
24594 Good food, fast service in the dine in theater. Bistro Mac and Cheese was very good. 
24595 I'd have to say I've become a bit of a regular here. I'm a fan of the yellow chicken curry. The service is always good and I've never had any bad experiences here. 
24596 Food was pretty good. Fries are top notch. Service was sloooooow. Like, ten minutes just to hand my check back to the server slow. 
24597 Late night lounge spots with hip hop, impressive eats and creative drinks are tough to come by in Portland. We were impressed by this place and will be back! 
24598 We came to PDX Sliders when friends were visiting. An alternative to Taco Tuesday! We were happy with the brew selections and it did not disappoint! 
24599 This place must update their hours on google because they rejected us at 10 pm when it said they were open til 2am !?!?!?! 
24600 Really awesome burgers, friendly staff, homeade condiments, thats all I need for a good lunch! 
24601 $35 for The Works Expedient friendly service and aim to please attitude Scrubbing the bug suicides off my windshield Hand interior/exterior detailing in a clean well run facility Unlimited washes for $29/month Bringing my baby back to its gorgeous shiny shiny Simply priceless 
24602 Phenomenal food, fantastic service. Orange Chicken and Crispy Beef to die for... Eat here. 
24603 This place has a world-class selection of mid-century modern and Hollywood regency style furnishings. The patio furniture selection alone is worth a trip. I love this place. 
24604 30 minutes to get thru line and order 2 subs. Girl never cleaned knife or prep area between customers. You guys were off your game tonight. 
24605 coming from los angeles and eating at all the spots (sushi sushi, zo etc. )... i eat sushi at this spot & it is good 
24606 Amazing, unique, house made dishes and drinks. The flavors here are extraordinarily balanced and experimental. The drinks are delicious and different. What can I say, this place is special and great. 
24607 FREE BEER. Our tour guide Jack was a lot of fun!! Really enjoyed his jokes & the free beer at the end of the tour!! We had Boston Lager, Summer Ale & Stout. Yum!! Did I mention free beer????? Yea. 
24608 This place is really cool. Attention to detail in the food and the feel of the place is great. BUT the prices are brutal. 3.50 for an Espresso? and it was crazy bitter... 
24609 Best children's book store I've been to in Portland. I'm so glad I stopped in today! It's much larger inside than it looks from the outside. I didn't have much time to explore, but look forward to visiting again. 
24610 Love the beer selection. I can find anything I've ever wanted in this place. I drive from Cambridge to get my stash. Keep up the good work. 
24611 This a nice neighbourhood pub. The Pub style food is pretty typical. Atmosphere is casual with lots of local patrons. Nice place to just hang and chill 
24612 Always delicious, always super homely and hospitable, always absurdly cheap. Come for the dirt cheap waffle sandwiches, stay for the friendly staff and customers (with whom you'll likely share counter space). 
24613 Amazing service!!!! Great food. Our first visit and this a place to come back if you want to eat authentic Turkish food!!!! 
24614 Food okay but the wait here is ridiculous. There are very few customers here and my Caesar salad are still not ready after 15 minutes. Just a bunch of high school kids ready to get off work. Beware. 
24615 2nd time going there and obviously not the las time. I love it. Lots of choices food is fresh and delicious. The staff is very friendly. 
24616 Good food for the price! Full flavors without dousing everything in sugar. Portion sizes are large. 
24617 Been to the trident couple of time food has always been very good my husband loves the oysters I love the meat and cheese board Bar staff always been very good Good wine selection and beer great cocktails 
24618 AMAZING FOOD, REALLY GOOD DRINKS!!bwill be returning in the near future! Salsa sampler was amazing 
24619 Thanks to Andrew I have a fabulous tattoo on my back. I love it :)! Definitely one of a kind! This was my first tattoo and I'm so glad I got it here. Long live Andrew and Pumpkin tattoo!!! 
24620 Great service and foo. Try the fresh sushi and fall in love. The basil Thai xtra thai ho!!!!!!!!!!!! Great fresh food that won't weigh you down 
24621 Great full bar with beer on tap! Food was yummy!! We came during happy hour and got a great deal! A lot of other bars nearby and food trailers nearby too! 
24622 Best Torta ever! You can tell its made with lots of love. I didn't care for Tortas before I tried one here but now I am hooked. 
24623 Luke does a great job, the shop is cool, clean and not pretentious. A little hard to find under the Capitol Highway bridge if you don;t know Multnomah village. 
24624 Oh Lazarus came forth.......love the dish, thank you for bringing it back to life! We will return...oh and the dessert...gotta have it...Patio dinning was a great suggestion 
24625 They did the flowers for my wedding and were fantastic! Great taste. 18 year veteran in the Boston florist industry. Very reasonable pricing and gorgeous flowers. FYI their store closes at 7pm. They just don't accept any online orders past 6pm. 
24626 Food was super bland. Got the red curry, it was sadly not good. Don't know much about their service as we got it delivered, which is why I'm giving it a 3 star. 
24627 You will feel comfortable during your visit. The staff and the place are absolutely great. Dot worry about the 99$ charge if you're late, they just want to make sure that you're coming to be ready for you. 
24628 Kristie AKA bird was an awesome server! She did a wonderful job! She was very attentive and informative about the menu. Will definitely be back! 
24629 Market of Choice has a very nice bakery & reasonable prices!!! 
24630 Nice, friendly people. I've had the tamales and tacos. Good flavor. Just got take out. The marinaded chicken and beef for grilling is reasonably priced. * I'm revising this since they have changed the layout. The meat market is still nice. 
24631 Want an amazingly huge bowl if Ramen? This is the place to go. Located in Porter Exchange, they're right among 6 other restaurants but the only to offer Ramen and Ramen alone. A cheap price for a good and large portion of Ramen. 
24632 Breathtaking property. Amazing rooms that are stylish and high tech. Service is incredible. Food is the best. If you are anywhere near this property you need to consider this awesome resort! 
24633 Upset with the restaurant that their sign waver they have out on the highway will press the crosswalk button to stop traffic for a longer time on busy Highway 27. Not cool at all. 
24634 I had been going to April and loved hoq well she took care of my hair 
24635 I've really missed her 
24636 I haven't had any luck with my hair 
24637 Last saw April July 29, 2016 
24638 April reach out to me. Dap 
24639 Friendly service and reasonable price with good selection of dishes. I usually order the rolls and noodles at this place. My favorite is the Taiwanese beef noodle which enough flavor but not too salty. 
24640 Everything a diner should be! Quick, greasy, and delicious! I highly recommend it! 
24641 Awesome BBQ brisket and Pork ribs!.potato salad was delicious and $3 bottle beer was a bonus. Need to work on their packaging and deal meals..a little too pricey for a mixed plate 
24642 Was pleasantly surprised. Just as good as other Brazilian steakhouses that are more than twice the price. 
24643 This is a great southern American restaurant, representation from every country and the best qualities from each country. Excellent service from Leo, Betty and Genesis, they're a beautiful group of people 
24644 Came here for an iced coffee, and I was given a tasty beverage. SUCCESS 
24645 Since this review customer service did reach out with an apology and refunded my money. Perhaps their fresh pasta would have been more tasteful had I used their sauce to enhance the flavor instead of my own. Something to consider when buying their homemade pasta. 
24646 Great food, awesome service, the lighting is majestic and the espresso martini is divine! We'll be back! 
24647 I had Peking duck with rice and it was good. My BF had chicken chow mein, he said it was ok. I liked the place, the waitress and the food. It was close to our resort. Would come back. 
24648 Amazing Breakfast (or Lunch) tacos -- my favorite is the migas (sans ham) with extra hot sauce on a corn tortilla. Its $1.75 and blow any other migas taco you've had out of the water... 
24649 The hostess was very nice and the food came out fast. The price was affordable. The environment was friendly. The place was quaint. 
24650 Hands down the best food truck burger I've ever had, and I've had 'em all. Juicy, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, insane flavors and really cool staff. Can't recommend this enough. 
24651 Amazing food. The place was clean and the food was served quickly. We had Lule kebab and chicken shawerma wraps with garlic sauce. The portions were just right and the taste was great. 
24652 Just visited this location for a late night bite to eat. Good service but the beer I ordered was warm. Also I had the fish tacos and they were small and not much fish. Nice ambience for a local place. Overall 3 stars.. 
24653 First time. So good. Lemongrass beef rice box is gluten free and will have me driving across town for more. 
24654 First time trying this type of food so I erred on 4. Lamb is really good. Recommend sticking with Berber source on whatever you choose. 
24655 Love the short rib risotto. The crab cake was delicious and the server was attentive. We sat outdoor and the wine tasting part was a plus. They had fruity wines. 
24656 It is the most intimate and authentic Italian restaurant in the north end. We have never had a bad meal 
24657 I miss my Fave Sushi place on the North Shore.As soon as i get out of the hospital i will go there and enjoy the delicious food and great people working there...get my Gomae ready....YUMMY 
24658 Not as good as tacos Guachos or Cuco's a few blocks south. This food tastes generic, straight out of a can. 
24659 These guys kill it every time. I've brought 2 different cars to them in the past and they always end up coming back looking brand new. 
24660 Excellent food, great staff, decent decor, and reasonable price. If you need Chinese food and you live west of the Charles river you need to give this place a try. 
24661 It was okay. It was ordinary for me. :) There were not much people considering it was a Friday night. There was a live band though and they were good. I might go there again when I feel like partying but it won't be the first on my list. 
24662 House to House has been incredibly responsive to our requests and feedback. Our yard looks great every time they come out. Price is competitive and it's easy to pay their invoices. What more can you ask for in a lawn service? 
24663 Cool dive bar with decent real food. Not as great as some of the other reviews made it out to be, but worth checking out. I saw some great drinks being made and lots of food. My burger and salad were just ok. 
24664 Best McDonald's drive-through service they're open 24 hours they usually always get your order correct. Cheap prices extensive menu, employees are nice what more can I say 
24665 Ordered Namsod to go. Got home, smelled foul... pretty bad. Took a small bite.. It smelled fishy.. Threw out. 
24666 Pretty good ramen, great service. It's a good place to stop in if you're craving ramen and don't want to drive to some of the other more well known spots in Austin 
24667 I ordered for delivery. Food came in an hour. Chicken sandwich missing ingredients. Cold. Fries soggy and inedible Hummus is good-but how do you screw up hummus Asked for a refund. Takes "at least five days". I wouldn't ever order or enter this place. 
24668 Great and authentic. I was new to hotpot (wanted to try it for a long time) and the taste was great. Quality and selection is good and the service staff helped us with some suggestions (we where the only not-asian in the joint). I will definitely come back for more. 
24669 Penang has really good Mango Chicken but not as good has the one I had at Berkley. Service sucked as always but heck what do you expect from an Asian restaurant? 
24670 My go-to breakfast spot in Atlanta. Came with my family, and can't wait to come back many times. Food was perfect, staff was friendly, and coffee and orange juice were delicious. 
24671 Plenty of delicious options and huge huge portions! Almost too big as I brought half my food home. The ambiance and decor are really cute and it's super authentic with Vietnamese owners and staff. We've been here many times and never disappointed. 
24672 Loewy Law Firm is a dedicated, professional and experienced team that offers top-notch service. They are caring, knowledgable and above all, trustworthy. I would trust and recommend anyone to Loewy Law Firm. 
24673 The place is great. The donuts are wonderful treats and they make a find cortadito. It's a perfect place to stop morning or after dinner. 
24674 Tommy was faster to respond to my tree trimming inquiry. He came out and have me an estimate within minutes of my call, and the trees were trimmed within 24 hours. I highly recommend Tommy! 
24675 Everything is fantastic. The broccoli appetizer is a must and so is the salad with sesame brittle! Can't wait to return. (Also, this restaurant has gluten free options available.) 
24676 I had an issue with a reservation on Wednesday, but since then the GM called to have us try it again. Tuscan Kitchen went out of their way to make sure our experience tonight was top notch, definitely changed my opinion. 
24677 Excellent, authentic Vietnamese pho and dishes! Great service. If you want to have Vietnamese good food, this is the one! 
24678 This place is great! The food and service is phenomenal! The grilled cheese was the best I've had and the empanadas were tasty and fresh! 
24679 Love this place for great food and service. A must for locals. The pretzels are the best. Todd is an excellent bartender. All the staff are locals and are respectful knowledgeable about Mount Dora. Great indoor and outdoor venues. The owner Rich knows everyone on a first name basis. 
24680 Excellent meal and service tonight. Simce we are in the northeast mama Joyce and I shared Maine lobster - it was delish- for a true New England meal, this place is a MUST! 
24681 The price was a bit much for the quality of the food. It was good overall though. Heads up- the crab cake club is cold crab meat... 
24682 The furniture selection is decent, but WAAAY overpriced. 
24683 Wow. Amazing hamburgers. First visit. Thanks yelpers for a correct review. Had to try the prime time burger. OMG delicious. Poblano burger very good. Sunrise burger delicious. Classic burger so good. Fries and sweet potato fries great. Will definitely make plans to return next time we are in Austin. 
24684 I love this museum because it's intimate... you can get up close and personal with the art. Lovely gardens make it an even richer experience. 
24685 We went to celebrate my husband's 30th our original server was amazing but he had a family emergency and left us with Denise who's service was subpar. Food was great overall. 
24686 Very friendly, very quick. I was a bit overwhelmed as they read off the long list of options for vaccinations and routine meds for our puppy. It felt like they were trying to upsell me instead of explaining the pros and cons clearly. 
24687 I've been getting and sending flowers from Winston's for 10-15 years. Anytime ice had an issue- (only one or two times) they've solved it easily. Great product. Great service. Thank you Winston's. 
24688 Not only was the food great, but the service was even better. One of our entries wasn't perfect and they corrected it immediately. Great wine list and will definitely go back. Thank you ClarkLewis. 
24689 Aesthetic!!! Every time you go their there's something new that catches the eye and it's all really cool! 
24690 I like the 3 mile wings, but the internet SUCKS here. If they can't get this fixed, I might have eaten my last wing at this hooters. 
24691 Fantastic find. Loved the coffee bar and breakfast was very good! Got here close to opening and it wasn't busy on a Monday but I could see why you should get here early! One of the best meals on our trip to Vancouver. 
24692 This is our go-to sushi place for lunch when we're in Orlando. The location is right in front of the Millenia Mall, which makes it very convenient. Clean place, friendly staff and great food make it an easy choice. Get the jalape√±o popper rolls, they're amazing! 
24693 Wow What the chef is drinking and eating is a must! Endive and pear salad, shrimp crevice, lobster and short rib... desert! Loco Stew was fabulous! Empanadas with brisket OMG Great service 
24694 Just-fine trip here from the airport mid-week pre-rush hour, and it's multi-level so be sure to coordinate your pickup accordingly. 
24695 Amazing food and super friendly staff. I and my wife eat dinner there every week and we love it. The yellow curry chicken is delicious. This is a great place to bring family because they treat you well! 
24696 Restaurant is very nice and clean. Food seems to have gone downhill though. The last couple of times my wife and I went the food was just ok. Portions aren't very large for what you pay. Not at the top of the list for places to go in town. 
24697 I have no idea how this place remains open. The philly's aren't really Philly's and everything else is just so meh. 
24698 Picked this place on a recent trip to visit Hubby for lunch. Love the outdoor seating area, very tasty food and the bakery items are yum. Will be heading back again this week. 
24699 Quick in and out, and the owner clearly knows what he is doing. If you are tired of drugstore passport photos taken by a cheap camera (seriously, even your cellphone can do a better job), then give this place a try. 
24700 I am writing this straight after wasting money here..The Worst indian food you will get here... You will get dal takda without tadka, korma is like gravy already cooked.. Please don't visit this restaurant! 
24701 Super busy restaurant most of the time. It's worth the wait. Corn fritters are yummy! They are really good about getting people in and out of there. Staff super friendly. Absolutely love the broiled rock shrimp! Highly recommend! 
24702 Great food and a great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Sometimes the music is too loud, or even worse, Cardi B, but it you can always sit outside. 
24703 Nice environment!!! My son plays basketball here and I love it. The people are welcoming and the atmosphere is very warming. 
24704 The Porchetta Sandwich is worth a trip to Vancouver to just have that. It's the best thing ever! Smiling, pleasant and helpful employees. 
24705 Decent food and sweet, savory bubble tea. I love the hours, and prices seal the deal. 
24706 Really great chicken fingers, sauces and fries. A little pricey, but worth it if you are at Phipps and hungry (since there's not a Chick-fil-A here anymore!) I'll definitely come again! 
24707 The best migas tacos I've ever had. They're $3 each, average-to-small sized, and absolutely delicious and satisfying The place is a little hard to find, but look for the white school bus turned food truck. 
24708 I have been there twice, once with my wife and second time with my mentor. Both times food was delicious and staff was friendly! 
24709 Lobster Bisque soup was fabulous. So was the peel and eat shrimp. This is a great casual place that is fast but has great food. Fun to watch the game there too. 
24710 Well..back again. How can you say no to sandwiches that are so large it's hard to for in your mouth...that are so mouth watering, and tasty..that make rainy days feel like sunshine. Grab the bam...or anything with pastrami..your stomach will thank you. 
24711 Best fresh slices! Quick spot for lunch. Take out or dine in. Clean and friendly staff. They also have lunch specials. Meatball sub and tuna subs fresh and tasty!! 
24712 The best fish tacos I had in Austin, and I tried about 8 different places. Highly recommend. 
24713 Beautiful, very clean spa with amazing service! From beginning to end we were totally pampered. I will DEFINITELY be back and highly recommend (and I'm picky) 
24714 Burgers were good and restaurant quality.The lunch special is a great deal. Also had the vanilla shake which was delicious. The staff was super friendly and attentive. 
24715 Certified inspected my first home purchase! They were quick, professional, and thorough. 
24716 Service was good! Food, so so, the Chicken Tandoori was dry! Keer,(Rice Pudding), do NOT bother, clumpy and not sweet! 
24717 Big-box Italian joint in an office park (...not necessarily their fault, but true nonetheless). Think big drinks, huge portions, over salted food. Limited cocktail capacity. Not your place to discover innovation. 
24718 Consistently amazing, Asters is my favorite place to meet friends. The lunch buffet is perfect, the collards, lentils, and teff salad are my personal favorites. They even offer gluten free inerja for my friends that are intolerant. Great service too!! 
24719 Great food and vibe! Food came out fast and tasted great. We ordered off the happy hour menu. Two pulled pork sandwiches (full size) and mac and cheese (so good) $19! Great value for the awesome food! 
24720 $10-$15 a plate. Vegan and Vegetarian options. Happy service. Drinks looked awesome. Biscuits and jam are amazing! Artichoke sandwich was wonderful. Burrito bowl with corn tortillas was awesome. 10s all around. Happy hour 3-6pm, $2 off small plates. Puppies welcome! 
24721 Great place overall Can get a bit boring after awhile if you work for Florida Hospital you can get 10% discount on your meal by showing your badge 
24722 Thursday night $5 margarita specials! Got the spicy pizza. I was expecting a bigger pizza for the price. Mozzarella sticks for appetizers were really good! 
24723 Good food, nice patio but it is NOT pet friendly. It's funny how one restaurant will treat pets like a pariah whole others welcome them. 
24724 I don't really understand why this place has so many raving reviews. Sure, it was okay. My michelada was tasty enough. But come on - my charro beans had sliced up hot dogs in them. SLICED. UP. HOT. DOGS. 
24725 my husband and I were going to apply to get a store credit card and buy things for our new house but the people working were beyond useless. Rude customer service, they all acted like they hated their jobs, and were non stop complaining about it. horrible. 
24726 The pizza was alright. Everyone that's been here raves about it but I didn't think it was anything special. The steak tips were very good. The place is small and the wait was super long. The servers weren't the friendliest either. 
24727 Great place!! Awesome food!! Definitely try the german meat loaf with sweet kraut. Would return anytime I am in Columbus. 
24728 Quality pizza with a great vibe. They are not bullshitting at Hoek's! 
24729 Frequent this place, but getting tire of being ignored when walking in, even after someone acknowledges you to seat yourself. Employees always camped out at the last few bar seats taking up space. Non-attentive staff. Food is good, so its a shame they don't strive for better customer service. 
24730 I had the red velvet cupcake and enjoyed it immensely! I had to share it witha friend because it was so damn sweet and huge! 
24731 Recommend before a Sox game or to watch any game. More floor space than The Cask. Good bar food, amazing nachos (with cheese, not sure what that person below is talking about) , and reasonable beer. I like this place and will continue to go. 
24732 I live out of town (NYC) but I come here every time I'm in Atlanta and I'm never disappointed! Great southern food and the hospitality is the same! It makes me really happy that I can order brunch on a weekday at anytime! Mimosas and biscuits!!!! 
24733 Great place! Always been my hero and to discover more things about him and what he did that I didn't know great customer service great exhibits loved the place been to 2 other presidential Library's So far this tops them so far 
24734 DELICIOUS VEGAN OPTION! On a trip from Boston to Dublin, this airline served me a delicious tofu dish, better than any airline food I have ever had before. I definitely recommend asking for the vegan option. 
24735 Maybe it was a bad night but we had terrible service, cold food and waited excessively long for everything including our check - it was nothing special at all IMO. On a positive note margaritas were solid. 
24736 The food is tasty, and the online ordering is really convenient. The sauces for the appetizers are pretty sugary, but the main dishes are very good. I'm also a big fan of any place that has duck. 
24737 Update: They reached out and are trying to make it right, and make sure this doesn't happen again. Hope to post a review on the actual service soon... 
24738 We were excited to get a taste of Mexican food after being away from home the last 10 days. Amazing tacos, mojitos, beans and rice. Thank you Hector, for your amazing service! 
24739 The. Best. Ribs. Ever! So moist and smokey! Tender yet firm with so much great flavor! 
24740 Very tasty food, kind staff and spacious. Good prices and equipped with a bar if you want to just walk in and eat or drink at the bar. Come early because it fills even as spacious as they are. I am here on a Tuesday afternoon and it is packed! 
24741 Stumbled across Edible Canada during a recent Vancouver stay. We were very impressed with the menu and enjoyed the several dishes we tried. Staff were friendly and welcoming. Try some of their special creations from the bar - excellent! 
24742 Was brough here when I suffered a seizure. Seems to have every piece of modern equipment. Caring staff and food is ok. 
24743 Hands down. Best Indian cuisine in Austin. Wife and I have been fans for years. Favorite dish is Chicken Vindaloo ordered Demi Hot... 
24744 Easily the best pizza in the area. Love this place - it's the only place I'll order from. Not only is the pizza amazing, but the rest of the menu is delicious as well!! Highly, highly recommend!! 
24745 This studio is amazing-- great vibes, talented teachers, most beautiful setting in Austin. I love coming here every day. 
24746 This student tour was interesting and entertaining. I was a tad skeptical because we received free tickets after taking the duck tour. So glad my fears were wrong. I definitely recommend this 1 hour walking tour to anyone wanting to learn some interesting facts about the university. 
24747 Perks - open late, great for late night coffee dates and dessert eats. They also have a heated patio seating section out front! Cons- want to eat everything on display and a bit pricey. 
24748 Fantastic authentic german food and a wide selection of beers, all at a decent price. 
24749 It was a really good experience, we had fun and the food was tasty. Because was held outdoors the ambience was relaxing and inviting. First time there so let's hope next time when we visit inside, the restaurant, will pair equal or better expectations. 
24750 The best shrimp and grits I have ever had in my life, and I order them whenever I am in NOLA, Charleston or Savannah. I wish they'd deliver to Denver! I'd go broke just ordering it daily. 
24751 I work near by. I go to Banya at least 3 times a month. Everything is always fresh and tasty. Never had a bad roll here. My favorite is the volcano. 
24752 Pretty good wine selection. Sometimes it takes a bit to get the attention of the server but once you order everything goes smoothly! The food is pretty decent as well. I like their half priced bottles specials :) 
24753 Icebox is great. The staff is very friendly and makes me smile every time I am there. The therapy is fast and easy and the benefits are noticeable. I think it is my new healthy addiction. 
24754 A friend took me to this place. What a great experience. The service and food were top notch! I love the linguine... 
24755 Not much to say, standard business hotel, polite staff, well located. Clean and comfy. 
24756 I have only eaten here once when visiting. The burger was extremely friendly, really one of the best I have ever had and the owner/host was not as friendly. Not rude but just not interested in my compliments. I didn't mind I'll just go back to enjoying the burger. 
24757 Good coffee ....shady staff with bd attitudes....wanted to hop over the counter a few times!!. The pie is good. Not like my grandmas but it'll work. Good grilled cheese sandwhiches. I tend to go bout 2pm when there's not so many people with screaming obnoxious kids.... 
24758 Not sure I've had a better burger! Great place - cozy, welcoming and great drinks to boot. So glad to add another place to my DOT list of musts! 
24759 Came in hungry and left hungry. Food 2stars Service 1 star There's other Northern Chinese restaurant that will satisfy you. 
24760 I was really excited to have a dumpling house near by. The food tasted good but everything was super greasy. I felt sick for hours after. Not worth trying again. If I want dimsum, I'll get my lazy butt over to Chinatown. 
24761 Grab some extra napkins with your cinnamon roll because it is definitely soft and gooey. Bagel sandwich was very fresh. 
24762 Im a fan. Great wings, pizza is above average...a bit doughie- but good tops.. Stromboli is very good. Prices moderate..bit high but its a great place with rreally good servvice and local charm/environment 
24763 Excelente....lo maximo. Fuimos a celebrar aniversario y nos trataron de maravilla. La comida exquisita empezando por el hummus, el salmon divino, la variedad de vinos es excelente....keep up the outstanding service!!!! 
24764 Ron and the crew do an awesome job! Two yums up! lol 
24765 Ordered Pork and Kimchi dumplings, Fried Rice and Mapo Tofu. Dumplings were good and Juicy - Thumbs up!! Mapo Tofu was kind of sweet and not to our liking. Fried rice was good. Service was fast and efficient. Would certainly recommend. 
24766 Despite the fact this place has tasty food, there are things I don't like about it, namely the people. To be more specific there is a girl who works there that is super pushy, rude & ignorant. Don't waste your money there. 
24767 I'm a huge fan of ramen and Boston definitely lacks good places for a traditional ramen shop. Sapporo Ramen is by far my favorite. I always go for their Tan Tan broth. DELICIOUS! Positives: wonderful ramen for a decent price. Negatives: rude regular waitress and cash only. 
24768 Great place to take a car. Extremely fast and they will fix a flat for free. Ryan is really top notch. 
24769 Ordered Combo A, $9.89, which is the 6pc XLB & rice noodle soup. The juice of the baos were too salty for my liking & on the opposite side of the spectrum, the soup was too bland. Would've gave it 3.5 stars if the flavours were better. 
24770 Thumbs up!! for Kwame and Steve helped me purchasing an iPhone on Wednesday (05/25) and Saturday (05/28)! 
24771 Now called T'Kilas. Same menu and ownership. We've been eating here for years and still love it. Great food and great margaritas at a reasonable price. 
24772 Had high expectations going in, but left disappointed. Granny's has a great selection but the wait is incredibly long for how few ingredients are in each taco. The tacos are good but nothing special, you can find much better at most gas station parking lot taco trucks. 
24773 Crap!!! Flavourless food never ever again am I going there. Finished eating and had to run to the bathroom. I was doing to try this place and now you will never ever catch me there again!!! 
24774 Stayed here for 5 days - trip from NY to Universal Studios. Great Great Great!!! Comfy bed, big clean room, great breakfast AND afternoon food and drinks included. Shuttle to Universal 10 minutes and seamless. Pool, Hot tub and free parking! Highly recommend this place!!! 
24775 I found hair in the salad so avoid that dingy salad bar at all costs. The burgers are good and I've had good luck with the sandwiches/pasta dishes. 
24776 Ordered a pupu platter on the 4th July and it was extremely bad food. The chicken fingers were the worst... made with the most distasteful parts of the chicken??? Too bad. Usually better food. 
24777 To dream, to live, to eat things from Karl's Sausage Kitchen, maybe not every day, but often enough. 
24778 Best doughnuts this side of the Pacific. If you want to impress your coullegue, buy them the dozen doughnuts! 
24779 Great place for the family! This birthday is a blast! The staff is so accommodating. The grandparents are even her to enjoy the fun. We will come back for sure as a family and to have a birthday for my kids. 
24780 I have had consistently amazing service at Budgies. The burritos here are so good and are always perfectly made. Thanks Budgies! 
24781 I'll Just say this.............................."I'll be BACK!" Customer service was good too! The Mac n Cheese suprised me! The Fried Chicken was fried to Perfection! I got 3 Legs, 8 oz. Mac n Cheese, Cole Slaw and a Sweet Tea for about $9.00! Not bad! 
24782 Fried chicken.. Greens, candied Yams, macaroni and cheese... To die for.. Was the Bomb 
24783 Very cool and Arabic place. I enjoy their food and hospitality very much. I would give five stars but the meat portions usually a bit small. Other than that, its great!! 
24784 We had a great time. The chef was very personable and the food was great. They even gave us free Saki as a part of their welcome. A very nice environment and treat date location... Will definitely be back! 
24785 Last visit was terrible, specialty pizzas are no longer outstanding. The quality of cheese and meats has totally changed. I recommend checking everything before you walk out. I got a soggy, pizza that tasted like stale sausage and half-melted cheese. 
24786 I don't think I can come back here...I got food poisoning coming here after a Blazer game one Friday night. Great atmosphere...but I will never view the food the same. Caused me more time in the bathroom than I would have liked. 
24787 Great food, stunning variety. They are a bit slow in bringing out food. I think they do a lot of take out or delivery. It'd be nice to put a little more emphasis on IN STORE customers. 
24788 Great decor, super friendly staff and yummy food...loved the steak and kids loved having Nutella stuffed empanadas! Thanks to yelp for the suggestion! 
24789 Decent food and decent prices. The best option is to get the salad bar (fixed price, not by weight) and then load up as much as you can! I also like their selection of burritos and sandwiches. Not too bad. 
24790 Greasy. As in holy crap this is greasy pizza. But it's good and the service is immediate. 
24791 Totally scored when I found this place with a living social voucher. Incredible food and awesome service! 
24792 Best latte I've ever had and it's also a great environment to study/do work. My visits to Summermoon are always the highlight of my day. 
24793 Nice desert. Interesting ambiance. Creepy waiter (like, way more creepy than he was intending to be). 
24794 Luv this place. I always get the fajitas especial.... so bomb.... the meat is always soft and juicy! 
24795 The restaurant is really trendy and offering a nice atmosphere to hang out with friends. Ordered the octopus appetizer and it was amazing. Definitely get this one. Service was excellent and everyone was friendly. 
24796 Very friendly service and relaxed atmosphere. Food was good. Only bad thing was there were a lot of flies and a few gnats buzzing around. 
24797 The cheesesteaks used to be one of the best in town, but now I love the meatball sub. I would suggest the meatball over the steak. I wish the bread was a litte fresher. The service is alway good and the price is fair. Alway busy at lunch time. 
24798 This rating is on quality & authenticity of the food and this place is LEGIT ! My mother is thai, and what this place cranks out tastes like her homecooking. Get the larb ! 
24799 My favorite sushi place in Vancouver. You should try the spicy salmon sashimi. I usually hate salmon sashimi but this is something else. 
24800 Great flavors. I wish there was a bit more variety on the menu, but a great location! The jalape√±o poppers are super good. I appreciate that they use whole ingredients. Its nice to eat at a place where you can tell they do that. 
24801 Food was delicious! We got the goat vindaloo, yellow dal, garlic naan. Everything was fresh, bright, deeply flavorful and well spiced and seasoned. The service was personal and friendly. Very hospitable. Can't wait to go back! 
24802 Hands Down the best italian ive ever had! Pumpkin Tortolini needs to be on the menu forever. 
24803 I was recommended this place and I have no idea why. It was flavorless, the waitress was rude and overall an average restaurant. 
24804 Oh lord!!!! being Mexican I thought I already taste the most spicy sauce in my life but here love it food it's delicious 
24805 Finally found my favorite Mediterranean restaurant , the Beef Shawarma over Rice was incredible, staff and service was very professional 
24806 Halal Bros you rock 
24807 Absolutely horrendous experience. Ordered Pho Ga. After digging in the food, i just observed there was a dirty napkin in my food. Despite of bring it to the mangers notice, they apologized and asked me to pay the bill. 
24808 best service ever. The cashier was extremely polite. The food was delicious. We even paid less because they ran out of some ingredient. I would definitely recommend it. 
24809 Here for happy hour 5 for $6. Eating the mushroom ravioli and the chili calamari lets just say I am pleased and will be leaving with a smile. 
24810 The back bar at Bistro is one of my favorite spots in town. Great service, and delicious food! 
24811 We have family birthdays here a lot! Great place! Good prices, clean & nice! We will be back again & again... 
24812 Loved the classic margarita! I also had the llano poblano burger, and it was to die for! Definitely recommend. 
24813 not to great only pass time yaletown foood scene other than earls is a waste of money 
24814 I'm aware that yelp has it right, but elsewhere online it says this place opens at 12pm.... Hopefully it gets corrected soon! 
24815 Tom's Pizza sucks. The bar folks are nice, but make sure to order your food at the beginning of the game, because you'll be waiting an hour for the lazy cooks to get it out no matter how dead it is. 
24816 These guys are efficient, knowledgeable and get it done in literally 10 minutes. The price is fair, no shenanigans. I always come here for my oil changes and everyone is super friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with. 
24817 Very helpful with getting me what I needed while I was shopping in the store, but never got a call back from them on when more parts for my car would be in 
24818 Really delicious tacos! We got the carne tacos and I got the breakfast egg and potato taco with cheese, onion, cilantro and they were all delish! 
24819 Compared to Seattle, it is hard to find good Asian cuisine in Portland. Loving hut has been amazing, every dish is fresh and tastes authentic. It is a huge added bonus that everything there is vegan. Plus the sweetest staff and I love the starter potato soup!! 
24820 This place is AMAZING. They fixed my alero after I got side swiped one night.... they came in 100 bucks under my quote from my insurance and finished two days early. really nice guys who take pride in their work 
24821 Nice to see new places opening in the Chinatown area. The coffee, tea & food are great. I usually come for lunch & always leave satisfied. 
24822 In order to use the restroom, one must make a purchase. I chose the tiny jar of orange marmalade, sold at the counter. Since the purchase, I have invested in a tiny condiment collection. Thank you so much, Cafe Nero!!! 
24823 horrible horrible service. stay away. sat for 45 minutes getting ignored. manager cones from back and says "sorry". ***just left a wine bar near here and had the best service food and drinks. 
24824 3 stars for dark hot chocolate. I had much better in CA and Europe. It tastes like store bought premix chocolate. The drink wasn't thick enough. The sweetness was just about right. Not too sweet. 
24825 Line up out the door. Very limited seating inside. Good donut base - I had the old fashioned glazed and lemon poppy seed. Would have been better if the batter itself was more flavourful and reflected the flavours of the gazes as well. 
24826 MY A2B bike pulled up lame with a flat on my way to work. While they didn't have the correct size tube, they where able to patch it up and get me on my way. Even though they where quite busy, they expedited the work. 
24827 Authentic for sure! I usually get breakfast tacos or a burrito and haven't gone wrong with either. Big plus that I can reliably order from yelp app on my iPhone. Always smells yummy and it seems like business is so good, they stay busy. 
24828 Decent pizza, fast delivery. My complaint is their use of just tomato paste for their sides of marinara. Cmon! 
24829 I LOVE this restaurant. The Lavas bread with hummus alone is enough to keep bringing me back, but the rest of the menu is just as delicious. Great service and lovely location. One of my favorite places to eat. 
24830 Watch out for the fruit flies! Came with my beer and in another's cocktail. Reminded me of an episode from Bar Rescue 
24831 The pho is really well-done. I got the chicken pho with hand-rolled pork meatballs and marinated mushrooms. My husband had beef pho- he liked everything except the meatballs. Server was busy but attentive. Haven't tried other menu items- most people were eating noodle soup. 
24832 Today I had a good lunch with a wonderful friend of mine the food was yummy and comforting it sure does good business on a Saturday afternoon I would definitely go back to this place for lunch 
24833 The customer service in this restaurant is nothing but AMAZING. My wife and I had the Hawaiian Sunshine and Noble Broccoli, and both were delicious. We licked the plates clean. If we weren't just traveling to Portland for the day, we would come back again hands down! 
24834 Best burger I've had in Atlanta. Gourmet ingredients and delicious beef! Definitely give this a try if you're in the mood for a well prepared burger. Got the regular burger with smoked Gouda cheese and Parmesan fries! 
24835 Over 500 beers on the menu. They don't serve food but you can bring it in from next door at chipotle or which wich. The only place I will go for beer! 
24836 The burger has nothing special. It tastes like Burger King. The fries are soggy like Wendy's. The money was not worth it. I would prefer eat at Frudruckers or elevation burger. It is so much better. 
24837 Used the entertainment coupon as its a little bit more than we can usually afford but the food was great, especially the potato salad. Guy working (probably the owner) was nice and checked on us. 
24838 Is there anyone working there that can help or answer a question ? What a joke ... I wandered aimlessly looking for an item .... when I found someone , they didn't know anything , and pointed me in the wrong direction 
24839 Yesterday we had brunch here... the place is great. Food was excellent, the service was friendly and quick, the decoration is really nice... Will definitely return! **Edited on June 24th 2014 And I did return. 3 times so far, to be precise. And will keep coming, I love this place. 
24840 Great location with plenty of parking around. If you have a handicap plate or placard you can park in metered handicapped spots while on your cruise. The folks that worked the checkin process were good and everything was smooth, much better and efficient than bigger ports like Tampa, Miami. 
24841 Nick is an awesome guide! He told us a lot of history and interesting stories. We enjoyed our tour very much! 
24842 Favorite Casual Italian in Atlanta. Recommendations: Mad Mozza Bread, Penne Diavolo, Baked Sausage Diavolo, Chicken Penne. 
24843 Tolle Location, mit Blick auf die Skyline von Boston. Hummer und Krabben werden einem noch lebend am Tisch zur Auswahl pr√§sentiert. Alles ein sch√∂nes Spektakel. Aber doch eher Fastfood-m√§√üig. Aber bei sch√∂nem Wetter toll um mit ein paar Freunden ein Bier zu geniessen. Am Wasser mit super Aussicht. 
24844 Gavin is an honest and sincere agent. He goes above and beyond to help his clients. Thanks again Gavin. 
24845 Mommy made me a sandwich with avocado. Yummy. For desert I tried Mommy's leftover Pad Kee Mao. It was good but I was full. Waiter thought I was a girl, but cleaned after my mess so all in all good service. 
24846 Daisy's is right below Ciao Bella on Newbury street....all the waitresses from Ciao Bella go here after work and get toasted (FYI) Daisy's is a pretty good bar...you can occationally spot the famous movie star in here...Matt or Ben might be around.Daisy Buchanan's 
24847 the chicken lettuce wraps was salty. didn't like it too much. our waitress recommended the duck, since it was her favorite, which has become my fav as well. the duck skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. 
24848 Solid Mexican street food at a beyond reasonable price. Excellent customer service, flavorful sauces. I highly recommend the corn and queso taco. 
24849 Best urgent care service I've ever come across. I wish they provided primary care. They understand good business in addition to good medicine. Lots of other providers don't quite understand business. 
24850 BEST burger's i have ever had! Love the Ghostland burger named after one of my favorite local bands. 
24851 genuinely compassionate and caring. so so kind. did as much as possible to make the very difficult process go as smoothly as possible. would definitely recommend here when the time does come. 
24852 I mostly go to Jason's Deli for the salad bar. Although their Pastrami Ruban is a good sandwich 
24853 Amazing a√ßa√≠! Authentic, fresh, healthy and energizing. Great location near south congress. I suggest the Chuck Norris for post workout or the Over the Rainbow add Avocado. Check them out! 
24854 Definitely recommend trying the Hawthorne Slider with Goat Cheese. Not too long of a wait and top quality burgers and fries. Top 5 Burger spots in Portland. 
24855 This place is nice and cozy! Their food is great and so is their staff. My husband and I go here periodically for date night and we love it! The wonton soup and chicken and rice plates are our favorite! The crab Rangoon is a must try as well! 
24856 Pretty good buffet. I haven't been to a Sizzler in sometime. It has a prompt service and warm food. What else can you ask for. 
24857 The food here is a bit better than the oasis itself and the view is just gorgeous. Not the best service in the world but I rather go here than the oasis. 
24858 We ordered delivery online and they were quick. The pizza is fine. Nothing great but not bad either. The large pizzas were about $13 each. So it is well priced. If you want an average pizza delivery in the area, this place is fine. 
24859 Came here for drinks after a walk around the lake.. Ended up having the buffalo chicken wrap and some beers. The fries were dry and bland and The wrap was greasy. The service and beers were excellent though 
24860 I remember years ago roaming gangs of teens woukd accost people and rob them. It seems thats stopped but im still jumpy when I see kids there. Constant construction, but not messy (anymore). Lots of shops, but theyre usually a wreck. Cheap food. 
24861 Very nice place to stay....staff was very friendly and place is very clean. Free breakfast in the morning til 9 am. 
24862 Knowledgeable staff.& was concise with appliance info 
24863 The gentlemen named Marcus, knew a lot about new plumbing piping & faucets 
24864 This place is great for a view. Otherwise, drinks are mediocre and bartenders are rude and unfriendly. Overrated. =\ 
24865 Cute, but service could be better! Long wait for food. Our order was wrong and they tried to tell us this is what we ordered. They were also out of a lot of their specialty foods. I would give it one more try? 
24866 Wonderful. Please visit. If you can't get a reservation. Try sitting at the bar- even with the little ones - the staff are so good. 
24867 Not perfect but the people aren't automatons like I've seen elsewhere. Glad I went in because I guess I was really sick and the doc was really kind. Hope I don't have to go back, but if I need it, I'll go there. 
24868 Went in today to place an order for my birthday cake! Amazing experience! Excellent customer service and very thorough! Also they had some delicious samples out! Will definitely be back! 
24869 Good fancy guacamole on the app menu. The chimichanga was pretty good. Service was a little slow and the seating was tight. Not much atmosphere. Food was affordable. 
24870 Amazing sushi. And I live in NYC. Get the toro if they have it! Lobster roll was amazing. 
24871 I went here for teeth cleaning. The dentist was gentle while cleaning and trimming stones. It was a bit hard to understand receptionist's english over the phone but it's fine in person. After all done, I got a dental floss, small toothpaste/brush and mouthwash! 
24872 Food was a 5/10. Lacking flavour and just plain blah. We had the lamb dish and some other dish with eggs. The tiny waffles 2/10. Staff was very slow, rarely checked up on us. 
24873 Not a big fan of the food here, I really don't have to much to say on the matter. This place is just not my cup of tea. I should say that it is always busy and in general it looks like most people enjoy it. 
24874 Fast service and great prices. This is where I go in Vancouver to get propane. Gets busy with cans sometimes but lines moves fast. 
24875 Nice selection of pastries, fresh delicious bread, and friendly accurate service. 
24876 Great food made with love. The ribs and service were excellent. I would definitely eat there again the next time I'm driving through Georgia. 
24877 This is my new favorite place for breakfast. Laid back environment, friendly staff and excellent food. I suggest the Mexican hash browns with chorizo. Their green chili is awesome and it is kid friendly. 
24878 This place does great work. Chuck is extremely professional, very personable and I have recommended him to all my friends in the Austin area. 
24879 Very cute shop with just about every type of gift for a friend or yourself you could be looking for! Many handmade items, adorable toddler clothes, an awesome scrapbook and stationary section, cute jewelry, and the list goes on an on. Cannot wait to return! 
24880 Wonderful food, fresh and delicious! Service was amazing! Was in town from St Louis, was able to get reservations at last minute. This is a must see and experience!! 
24881 No parking and the chicken was just ok.......for the price and trouble, i've had better. 
24882 Knowledgeable, experienced, personable and worth every penny! Will work with Trudy from now on with all tax issues and filings! 
24883 Amazing, authentic and delicious persian food. This place is well designed and super clean. 
24884 Nobody gives a damn, waiting in line for a sub but she couldn't be bothered, too busy discussing the game with the guy in front of me, waited a few minutes thinking she would remember she's at work but nah ... who gives a f*** 
24885 We're huge fans of fast pizza. Blaze in DS was our go to until we found Pizza Press. Awesome topping selections, kind staff, amazing taste, well priced, and a Celebration discount. It's our new weekend pizza spot. 
24886 Awesome eggs Benedict, cinnamon roll French toast was like dessert for breakfast. Everything was cooked to perfection and the service was on point. We will definitely be back. 
24887 I have now been on hold for 22 minutes trying to confirm that my online order was received. After hanging up and calling back I still have no answer and no one seems to know how to check for it. Poor customer service. 
24888 All time favorite place for Pho and Fried rice !! My friends and I always come here to eat when we're hungry. It's just the go to place, but come in at a good time to get seated quickly. Other than that you might wait for some delicious food 
24889 Terrible customer service and most of the help has an attitude. I especially dislike the management because they would rather eat their McDonald's food than help a customer. RUDE! 
24890 Why do people wait in line for such mediocre food? I've heard many good things about this place and was very disappointed. The waitstaff was friendly, the patio was a fine place to sit, but lunch was bland and blah. 
24891 The roasted free range chicken is fantastic!! I love the bartender who is usually here in the evenings. His service is impeccable. I always stay here when I have business in Vancouver. I can always count on the restaurant at the Marriott to give me an amazing meal!! 
24892 Went for brunch on 12/30/12. Crowded but service was prompt. I had oysters and grits. Very good! A touch soupy but still a nice combo. 
24893 This place is super cute and the cupcakes are so nicely decorated! They aren't the best cupcakes I've ever had - the cake can be a bit dry - but the chocolate coconut and chocolate caramel cupcakes are great for satisfying your sweet tooth! 
24894 Did a great job removing the dead trees and really knew their stuff. Neat and quick and a totally professional operation. Even helped us save money by offering another option other than removing a whole giant dying tree which would have been very very expensive. 
24895 Great little local Coffee Shop. I've been twice and enjoyed both times. They have a living room in the front and back where you can sit and chill. No frills here, just simple good coffee and relaxing environment. 
24896 Really good meals. Crab ragoon was okay, a lot of fried part not much of the cream cheese filling. 
24897 Super fun spot with very cheap drinks. Very busy on Saturday night!! Bring you back to the 80's for sure which is very nostalgic. 
24898 Keri Moss did a fantastic job!!! My color was a mess (hairstylist before did horrible highlights) and she was able to make it look PERFECT! I LOVE my hair again. Looks like I found my new hairstylist in Austin. Thank you Keri!!! 
24899 Everyone we've worked with here had been incredibly helpful! We are hot tub beginners and they patiently answer all of our questions, and teach us everything we need to know. Their prices are competitive and with the great customer service, we now go there for everything!! 
24900 Do not go here unless you want a lazy salesman to act like you are interrupting his day by merely being a customer. 
24901 This place is everything and more. Wonderful owners, the prices are great, $15 per day for the bikes. Locks and lights included. Fixing the bikes if your in need, and if your hungry, they will tell you where to eat. Support this spot. 
24902 Ordered hot pot with individual meats/veggies. The portion side is good here, they actually give you a good amount for the price you pay. Service was good and they were attentive and filled our soup when it was running low. Definitely will return! 
24903 Was in a fender bender and this shop was preferred with the other driver's insurance. They offered good quality and service, delivered as promised. Would recommend. 
24904 Fancier end sushi, cute and cozy interior. Not a lot of seatings so not good for big groups. Great for 2-4 people friend gathering and stuff. Quite busy! 
24905 Big portions of above average food. Bring someone with you that you like because you'll be waiting a while for your seat. I've never eaten lunch here, but everything I've ordered for breakfast has been good. 
24906 Had the best service here and amazing coffee. If you like vanilla and cinnamon ask for the golden syrup. 
24907 Omg, one of the best meals and service that I have had in a long time.. Buffalo dip was amazing !! The pulled pork BBQ grilled cheese was so delicious & big had to take 1/2home.. Will definitely go back!!! 
24908 What a great experience. Service is fast and attentive, the food was authentic and delicious, and the price is very reasonable. I would definitely come back 
24909 Another great place have tried thanks to Yelp. We had the Fricasse and the vegetarian Paella. Both were delicious and the serving size was perfect. Add in an Americano and a Chai Latte and our lunch was perfect. Will be back to try out those waffles. 
24910 Great brunch place. Food tastes fresh and service was prompt. Seating available inside and outside but outside fills quickly in nice weather. 
24911 Kate is an artist who happens to cut hair. We love her. I would highly recommend- always a great haircut. My son wanted a little design and Kate created a mini masterpiece. My 10 yr old really likes his haircut and gets loads of compliments. She is the best! 
24912 Food: excellent, got the jerk chicken wings, soooooo good. Drinks: amazing, complex flavors, strong. Perfect for a Friday night after a long week of work. Ambience: nice well-lit bar with plenty of intimate, group, and full, but not crowded bar seating Service: patient, helpful, and quick 
24913 First time here, owner was Pleasant and very helpful. Had the curry chicken meal, it's was delicious,will definitely be back. 
24914 Sonic, Lakeway, TX, horrible, horrible, horrible...run by teenagers, clearly the owner does not care what is going on. 
24915 Love the atmosphere! Great appetizers and drinks for happy hour! Food is very good and service is friendly and quick. 
24916 I haven't been to Boston in nearly a decade, and still dream about their bu√±uelos. T_T 
24917 Quite possibly the worst pie we've ever had... sorry, but if you're gonna claim to be a pie house, it should at least be better than the cheapest grocery store pie. Maybe the other foods are good, but our experience wasn't. 
24918 Just spent the afternoon going to Forest Park and then at OKO...a beautiful space filled with skilled artisans. A gem to be discovered! 
24919 Delicious barbeque all around. I especially liked the fatty (juicier) part of the brisket...YUM!!! Classic BBQ atmosphere. Large open tables. Belly up to order and move on down the line. I have been back and back again! 
24920 Not good. food was bland and very expensive for the gross quality. Disappointing because i liked the paintings. 
24921 The cotton candy one is amazing! Although if it's to-go, the cups should not be filled over the edges because they spill long after the initial drip of opening. 
24922 The Lavosh, calamari and shis kebap were all great. The servings are just too big, recommend sharing an entree or you'll have lots of leftovers! 
24923 Pretty delicious but not a lot of food for what you pay. Pre-snack or fill up with a beer. 
24924 Great service! Food gets delivered fast. I ordered the shrimp Alfredo. Beware, the plate is big for kids. My parents helped me finish it up. I would come back. Although, I wish they had more vegetarian options... 
24925 Fantastic! If you haven't already do yourself a favor and eat here!!! The food is amazing and the service is great! (Ms. Millie's the best) 
24926 Great place and have never had a problem getting seated quickly. Servers are great and the food not bad for the area. Great drinks. Mac and Cheese; do it! 
24927 Recent Remodel Good location. Mixed services Mixed quality of freshness of coffee. Average 
24928 The one vegetarian option was "ordering the fish dish without the fish".... So not a great selection. The $25 order of fusion fish and chips was dry. Tasted "Fine". But "fine" is not really fine when you are paying $25 for a small amount of dry food. 
24929 You MUST come find this place! My daughter and I agree that it's the best guacamole we've ever had, and hubby says we're coming back everytime we visit Universal (we're annual passholders, so that will hopefully be really often)! 
24930 Best Pizza Ever! Been coming here since college, and now my kids love it! Parking behind building. And easy to get in and out of. 
24931 Been a while since I've stopped in. Lot's of new faces too. Service was so n so, no smiles. Food was luke warm unfortunately. Portion size was more than enough. Would I rush back, nope!!! Sorry....... 
24932 Great funky place. The best fish and chips I have had in years and I'm British! The clam chowder was gorgeous. I would definitely eat here again. 
24933 Best French fries hands down! I don't eat meat but I will drive here just to order fries to go with stuff I order elsewhere. Depending on the day, the service varies so that's why it gets four as opposed to five stars! 
24934 This is such a great place to find all your kosher wine needs, especially when it comes to Passover wines! They had such a huge selection and they were so reasonable priced, it was great. I will definitely be coming here every year before Passover! 
24935 I have to agree on the chair comment, low and trendy like? Ridiculous like....but in terms of yogurt, flavor, selection and toppings they cannot be beat! The flavor choices are abundant and they all taste great, something for everyone! Cheap also! 
24936 We had a Key Club meeting here during high school. Have of the group refused to even touch the "food" and the half that did got sick. Avoid this place at all costs, unless of course, you like being ill. 
24937 I've never had a need for their repair services however the full service gas station can't be beat.. friendly guys always available to pump your gas..it's the little things and they get the job done right! 
24938 I would have never thought chicken broth based ramen could be so good! The broth is rich and creamy but CHICKEN flavor! YUM!!! Cha-shu is plentiful! Soft boiled egg is a great touch! Only think i wish they had was different noodles. Not the biggest fan of think noodles. 
24939 Yummy macaroni and cheese. Wish the servings were a bit more. The flatbread would work well as an appetizer. We plan to return again when we are in the Downtown Center area. Try the raspberry sangria! It was the perfect balance of sweet and very fruity! 
24940 It was good, but didn't blow me away. The neighborhood was super cool. 
24941 The food is ok. The service is slow. The restaurant is crowded. No good waiting area for to go. But mostly just slow. 
24942 I love this place. Fresh food made the way you order. The only drawback is they take their time making it. Clean, great service, wonderful food. 
24943 Had a fabulous brunch here last week while visiting Vancouver. Latte was great. Avocado toast with tomato salsa was exceptional. Cool vibe and excellent service. 
24944 rude and dishonest staff, very bad Vet hospital 
24945 I'm in awe of the customer service here! Truly amazing! Derrick was such a big help when it came to the lumber department I couldn't thank him enough he is great at his job! Now I can get to this project I been wanting to do thanks Derrick! 
24946 I couldn't live without a good NPR news station and WBUR fits the bill. It is both informative and entertaining in just the right proportions and their schedule fits mine nicely. 
24947 Good lord, don't go here. My boyfriend had the fish and chips and started throwing up about 30 minutes after eating it - the fish or coleslaw, we don't know. He threw up plus...major diarrhea. 
24948 Met some friends for a great meal.. Everyone was spot on and I'm looking so forward to going back.. Tried the Eggplant app and the Mussels ... Yummm.. Chicken parm and a couple pizzas.. All delicious. 
24949 Had the chicken kabob in pita, Really good. Plenty of juicy grilled hot chicken, cold crispy lettuce, cool cucumber and tomato, plus good yogurt sauce. A great balance of hot and cold, veggie and meat, crisp and juicy. In a word - satisfying. 
24950 Stopped in to get a pedicure with no one in waiting area, 3 hours before closing and was rudely told "no openings". Won't be going back! 
24951 Definitely my go-to place for computers and pc parts in Austin. Customer friendly staff shows that great service is not a thing of the past. Keep up the good work! 
24952 great Food Great Service GREAT family. Only prob that I have and prob everyone else is that the turn around to get ya Food and Coffee when it's Busy Needs Improvement. 
24953 The Mediterranean Mcdonalds! Really good food, quick service, and affordable! I don't mind eating here every lunch time! In fact, I have three more meals before I get the freebie from my loyalty card! 
24954 Ok lobster roll but nothing spectacular, expect to possibly loose sight of the roll while holding in your hand, or possibly even if you put it behind a french fry. 
24955 Best cheesesteak I've had to date. I'm hooked. When I need some good comfort food 1776 is the place I go to for solace. Their cheesesteaks beat the ones I've had in Philly. Consistent, delicious sandwiches. 
24956 This place is very nice for groups of folks going out for drinks. The margaritas are nice!!! I loved the cactus bowl too. I have had dinner here and it was good. Good choices of mexican food. 
24957 My husband's cousin took us here to try candle pin bowling for the first time. We had a lot of fun! The service was great and the facility was nice. The computers were a little dated but they worked fine. I would definitely recommend lanes and games! 
24958 Good wings but an even better place to go and kick back and watch the game. Wings, tacos, nachos, drinks this place has it all! The service at this location has gotten a lot worse and the wings were just alright the last time I went their. Disappointing. 
24959 I first time here, but I like this place!) See u soon again , thank you so much for amazing coffee ) and sandwich))) mmmm yammy yammy)) 
24960 True love. Saved daughters' phone after $1200 quote to save photos from Splash Mountain accident. Three acid washes later and: viola!!! Also cleaned lint out of other phones. Use them, they work. They kept in contact and prices are more than reasonable. Do it. Now. 
24961 Nida's @ North Market has the BEST Pad Thai that I have ever experienced..! You can have it as spciy as you would like and it is truly amazing. Definitely try it out! 
24962 Wait time right when they open is ridiculous. Slow service, and the food really isn't good. I think this place is overrated AND overpriced.. Frozen pancakes from the freezer section at walmart taste better than here. Our waiter was nice though. 
24963 I'll keep it short and simple: this place is affordable and has the best pho in town. I've tried nearly every pho place and this has giant proportions and tasty broth and delicious, well cooked noodles and meat 
24964 Vegan so wont read anything about meat ;^) Great fresh food with pure flavors. Ate the veggie combo #5, great rice and beans, great chips and salsa. Streetside location to watch Sanford slow life go by during a Saturday afternoon. 
24965 Great place, we were here years ago when it was amnesia brewery. We were in town for the weekend, visited twice, really dig the outdoor area, good beer and an outdoor fire, oh yeah. The second visit we had lunch, burgers are really good! 
24966 Great coffee and pastries. Baristas are excellent. All the other staff are sooooo lost and vacant. 
24967 Nice ambiance when not interrupted by the staff's Instagram voices. food was OK. The rice could use more saffron, but the kabob was flavorful. 
24968 John was friendly and nice and they were incredibly helpful and answered my questions, it's an incredibly peaceful kayaking on the Willamette. 
24969 First visit during their grand opening. Delicious treats and great sandwiches! The coffee was great too! The owner, Baron Klaus Erich Von Hochgotz and co-host Jensen are very charming and customer-focused! A great little spot in the heart of China Town. 
24970 Friggin' amazing! We usually get sushi at places like this, but we got entrees instead and they were both sooo good! We've only been once though because it's kind of pricey. 
24971 Don't judge a book by it's cover! My brother brought me here, when I walked it I was thinking "oh no this is going to be just the same old food" but nooooo its the best Vietnamese food EVER! good prices, good food, nice people. 
24972 Best tacos in Atlanta! Only problem is the pork belly is so good they run out from time to time. Must try! Great for date night! 
24973 Pros -cheap first run movies Cons -the ac sucks and it gets really hot when there are allot of people in the theater -the movie started more than 15 minutes after it was scheduled -the seats are pretty beat up and nasty 
24974 One of my favorite brunch places! And now they got rid of the short rib eggs Benedict. I am so upset. I guess I will try the new menu and try to give it a chance. :( 
24975 Good haircuts, but good luck getting the style you want. My past couple visits I've told the barber I wanted a simple undercut and left with a fade both times. $18 + tip isn't worth it if you can't get the cut you asked for. 
24976 How y'all gonna send coupons to my house saying it don't expire til May but ya coupons don't even work and y'all don't even have brownies. Why y'all even advertising for? 
24977 I'm not considering the wait on this review, this is purely about the food. The burgers there are, "out of this world." They are the best burgers I've ever had. I've been there countless time and the experience is consistent. I highly recommend this place. 
24978 Average bubble tea. The good thing about this place is that they have board games to pass by the time. 
24979 Already came back and 1 week was too long. I had the soy simmered beef bowl. Fantastic. Now I have a tough choice next time I'm back! 
24980 I'm giving this place 4 stars for the area...prices are better than most and the selection is pretty good. Service is kinda "are you gonna steal something?" but I mean this is Watertown...I hit this place up rather often and I am seldom disapointed. 
24981 We well definitely be back!!! The food was amazing the best we've had in a long time, try the steak slices there so good :) 
24982 Went here for the first time. Small but decent selection, also open later than other liquor stores in the area. 
24983 Wonderful ambience, excellent food and service, amazing wine list. They don't really have vegan foods, but the chef will make something delicious for me. Try the patio! 
24984 Delicious food! The flat noodle lamb soup (winter lifesaver!) and the flat noodle dish with pork are both incredibly tasty. Cash only!! 
24985 Great view! Very short hike up the stairs to the top. Definitely a place to go visit with visiting guests! 
24986 A YUMMY....... IN TOWN FUN TREAT FOR THE KIDDOS to enjoy and moms too lol! Our family enjoys going there straight after school to freshen up. So many flavor to pick from. Amazing people to greet you. We love the strawberry cheesecake... you must try it!!!!!!! 
24987 Pros -Fast secured WIFI -Good espresso and chai -Stand up tables -Great for working for that remote life -Parking lot available but can be limited Cons -Food selection isn't great for the healthier conscious folks 
24988 Locations was clean on Monday morning when I came in. Decent amount of washers and dries early in the morning 10am when I came back to dry my clothes 11ish it was busy and not enough washers. The washers I used were $2.75 the driers $.25. 
24989 Average cafe with slightly overpriced coffee. We ordered a latte with two shots for $4.25. Taste-wise it was decent. 
24990 Excellent experience from reception to checkout. Attentive, courteous, professional, friendly, and highly qualified! 
24991 Precision Movers were a great choice. Phil and Jeff were both super friendly and great at moving all our crap in a safe and efficent manner. Glad we went with them, thanks. 
24992 The food was out of this world. Awesome staff and a great atmosphere!! First time here and would definitely come back before we leave!! 
24993 Pad Thai is sweet (not real pad thai) and quite bad. 
24994 Our families favorite pizza place. We especially like the Mt hood and good Karma Pizza. The have the right amount of meat and cheese. The Rueben is also a favorite. The atmosphere is family friend and fun. 
24995 Awesome Wings, my office ordered takeout one day. 9 paid for the Hanger 4 $69.99, 13 of us ate from it and there was still plenty left. Had a taste of most flavors, all were good. The office will be ordering again. 
24996 Einfach nur lecker! Nicht eben billig, aber jeden Cent wert! 
24997 Want to visit heaven? Try the mandarin chicken wings! Seriously delicious. The place may look a little ganster from the outside, but inside the tables are clean, the service is prompt and friendly and the food I've enjoyed here is kickin'. 
24998 Velentino was great to work with. Took the time to put put in the correct parts for the breaks that needed to be fixed :) Awesome guy and great family. 
24999 One word: AMAZING!!! Some of the best pizza I've ever had! The atmosphere only makes it 100x better! I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone who is looking for authentic east coast pizza that tastes delicious! Service was amazing and made me feel right at home! 
25000 Awesome sushi! Just what I was looking for. I was visiting for St.Louis MO and needed my sushi fix! 
25001 I was really looking forward to checking this place out. I thought this would be a kid friendly place to have fun until I saw they allow open carry...inside their business....their LASER TAG business. What could possibly go wrong? I'll take my business elsewhere. 
25002 Great prices, service, cocktails and food. I had the spicy chicken and it was cooked perfectly with crispy outside and spicy meat. The caparhenia was fab too. $50 for 2 people including cocktails and an appetizer? Oh yes! Great servers too. Definitely going back. Hidden gem! 
25003 Great authentic Chinese pastries specializing in more tawianese style pastries as opposed to cantonese bakeries in Chinatown. So, you will see very unique pastries. Very good and fresh. Best Tawainese bakery in town!! 
25004 From the horrible customer service to the rooms that are very dated, this was far from a relaxing stay and housekeeping that gives you attitude and we had a major issues at this resort. MGR here don`t care about you nor did they get the memo regarding client experience 
25005 I bought their tiramisu for my birthday and it was soooo delicious! For cakes they also have strawberry, mango mouse, and cheesecake, all reasonably priced. 
25006 I love everything about this place except the price. It is located on the stree I live and easy to walk and have a great meal. 
25007 Best Chinese food on town definitely my girl and my favorite Great atmosphere helpful staff and really friendly people working there and the dishes are delicious too Fast service and clean too I really recommend to anyone 
25008 Solid I'll go back for the soup anytime because the broth is too good 
25009 Winna winna chicken dinna!" Even though I had the delicious big ass burger for lunch! The burger was in fact BIG and juicy. Love the little kettles the fries come in. Had the creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. YUM! 
25010 Carnitas skillet had lots of flavor, would recommend it. Chicken was waffles was decent. The chicken was crispy and juicy but the waffles were a bit too soft 
25011 After living here for over a year I recommend this apartment to nice and decent people. This place is full of people like that. The new management team and services group, Danny and O, good guys. 
25012 I really love the Cuban coffee that I had there. The jerk chicken salad was good. I really like my experience there. I love the juices there, it makes me feel like I am in the Caribbean drinking juice. 
25013 They are the best times 87! Not only is their food delish but their customer service is stellar. I lost my keys and they looked everywhere to find them and found them!!! I was a happy camper with them going above and beyond. Go here, they rock! But really.... 
25014 Convenient. Nice employees. But a little over-priced and slow if you're not chilling & enjoying the view which is what Alta's is all about 
25015 The $6 coke/sandwich/side deal is awesome! Had a great pulled pork sammy and pile of slaw. And the ladies working were super pleasent as well. Great experience all around. 
25016 Great medical staff with quality service! They also see patients with complex health conditions such as diabetic, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, thyroid problems, etc. The most important thing is the result! They hold you accountable and doing one on one on a weekly basis. It really works! 
25017 The food, atmosphere and beer selection are excellent. However my server could use a drink. Maybe she was having a bad day but it's doubtful. 
25018 more for the beer and ambiance then anything. its pricey but all in all a great place to get fucked up and enjoy the view of boston:) 
25019 Not bad. Definitely not "fine dining", but decent teriyaki. Interior is old but clean, and the staff is super friendly. 
25020 Prompt, courteous and reasonable (for electrical work). Replaced a GFI Breaker switch for our hot tub, but it turned out the problem was with the hot tub and had to be done by the dealer. 
25021 Consistently the best car detailing services in the area. 
25022 The Model is the best, I wouldn't think about going anywhere else. There's never a cover, the cheap beers are $2.50, and there's always music and dancing. It has everything I need. Plus the staff is super nice. Get there early because there WILL be a line. 
25023 Good small town cafe......needs more of a variety of food. Grits are good, omelets are good but would like to see hash browns and more breakfast combo plates 
25024 What a fabulous find!!! Great selection at fair prices. Penelope is a doll! I will definitely visit again! 
25025 Open on Sundays! Jason, the front man has excellent customer service skills! Too expensive though. I took my car for a second opinion and repaired at Schlott Tire. Thank you Jason for being awesome just the same! 
25026 Great music, decent bar and drink selection. Wish it was a little cooler inside in the summer. Maybe not open all the back sections. 
25027 Awesome for breakfast. Ask for "Adrians enchiladas". They are cheese enchiladas with salsa rosa, with 2 fried eggs on top. Request rice and refried beans. 
25028 This is food for the brain, not for the palette. Intellectually stimulating, not sensual. 
25029 Helpful staff and faculty. There is always immediate assistance whenever there are questions. Inspiring words and advice from every professor as I go down the path of becoming an educator. I feel as if I am definitely getting my money's worth. 
25030 I love this place. Its adorned in Miami white with a reed floor. Downside of this place is its always packed, but there is a reason. The swordfish is excellent as is the pasta. I love sitting outside on a nice day Great, interesting cuisine 
25031 +: Love their HH ordering process and the menu, portions, price and outdoor seating all total a good deal. -: Too snooty. !: LOVE the foie gras protesting during prime dinner time! YES!!! ?: Can I have your HH menu pad? 
25032 Staff was awesome. Fast in and out and super friendly. Was there for a medical and did not see Dr. Hicks, only his staff but I'm sure he is just as nice as his staff. 
25033 Amazing! Every single sides we took was delicious. Surprisingly the short ribs were the highlights 
25034 To quote Guy Fieri; "this place is out of bounds". From top to bottom they nail it. Service is friendly and fast, ultimate margarita was great, food was on par with quality you get in Mexico. On of the best mexican food spots on the east coast. 
25035 Great service at front desk. Comfortable, peaceful work spaces abound in this respite from the hustle and bustle of air travel. Problems are solved. Work gets done. And Delta helps make it all happen. 
25036 Kevin Is simply awesome. Getting adjusted is never an easy feeling for me because of the fear of making my situation worse. However I have been to Kevin many of times and always come out feeling better and able to do things I couldn't do before I went in! 
25037 Really great coconut fish and chips. Fried oyster shooters were amazing. Best deals during happy hour. Will definitely come back! 
25038 this place is awesome- love the pickles as an app :) the food and drinks are delish. the staff is really nice - if you like s'mores they do a smores option 
25039 you can cook them and enjoy them 
25040 Ok..... awesome service department but no spare Speedplay screws.. Fixed my casette so I'm able to destroy Strava segments. 
25041 Pretty good food, best fried rice in town. A little pricey but otherwise good. 
25042 the food cannot be catogorized as asian food. Worst ever. Bad&slow service and definitly overprice 
25043 Just opened 2 weeks ago but you wouldn't know it. Ordered 3 different sliders and truffle fries, did not disappoint. Great service and food! 
25044 typical hk style cafe. I like the steam custard egg. 
25045 Dr. Youngkin and his staff are very professional and I am glad I switched to his care. He takes the time to explain terms, labs, procedures and answers all my questions - which are few b/c he's already explained most things. I would definitely recommend him. 
25046 Happy this place opened up. Great space. Fantastic coffee. Pretty in line with my favourite spot in town - nine bar. Good is surprisingly tasty. Had the potato waffle with smoked salmon and capers and it was satisfying 
25047 Good hearty menu, good variety, big ass martinis, nice servers, good sweet potato fries, baked potato salad yum, good Reuben, awesome chicken pot pie, amazingly delicious grouper sandwich. 
25048 DO NOT order the pastrami combo. Worst deal in town. Almost no pastrami on the dog. (also Swiss cheese not available, no cheese available.) I liked the honey mustard on it though. 
25049 A hidden gem worth trying out! The poke bowls here are so tasty and reasonably priced. The staff was pleasant, the place clean, and quick service. I'll definitely be coming back to try more! 
25050 Very good I mean very very good authentic! I have been to Thailand several times and this has the perfect taste of Asia. Tell them LJ sent you, if you want spicy! 
25051 Terrible service. Be ready to wait and then be told it's your fault. Wish I'd paid for a taxi 
25052 I liked the logo enough to stop by for breakfast. It's an ostrich silouette in a circle. The breakfast sandwich is fab. They show local artists and have some trinkets for sale like handmade purses and "adult" sockmonkeys ifyaknowhatimean. 
25053 Tasty juice, better than Jamba juice. I love that their drinks doesn't taste like sugar in a cup. Super healthy and yummy. Love the greensicle drink. Very refreshing, would go back again. 
25054 bad service dont go here! They needs to learn customer service... They're food is okay but the service is extremely bad..... Im not going here again.... My mom was even disappointed because of their service... 
25055 Small portions, small rolls. Rice is not properly cooked. Not enough ginger. Smells like piss inside 
25056 Good vibes, good food, good drinks, very reasonable prices. The ave has consistently been my go-to bar for 2 years now, love this place. 
25057 It is a very clean, relaxing restaurant with great service. The food is hot and fresh. You will leave happy. 
25058 Eating a Vegan lunch was extremely easy at Sweet Tomatoes. We live on salads, so being able to customize everyone's salad was a real hit with my 7 and 11 year olds. The best part was the free refills. 
25059 BEST PIZZA IN CLEVELAND AREA! We usually do delivery or takeout, and order it A LOT. Cosmic Karma is our favorite, but the BBQ chicken is also great! 
25060 I had a great experience here. The staff was courteous, prompt and helpful. I got my eyebrows waxed here for the first time and I will absolutely be back! 
25061 Friends picked the place against my silent objection. Ordered scallops. Ate scallops. Felt pukey, but didn't quite puke. Just like last visit three years ago. Next visit in three years. Expecting same. Synopsis: Exchanging large amounts of $$ for pukey feeling = 1 star 
25062 Such a simple yet amazing concept!!!! This place is healthy AND delicious! Let me repeat that DELICIOUS!!!! Definitely worth the wait. 
25063 Decent food, better drinks. Service could be better and a little quicker though. Worth going to if want decent Mexican food. 
25064 The service at this place really sucks and even if you complain about the food.. like when it takes over an hour to get it for example.. they look at you like it's not their problem.. only yours

25066 Says it closes at 10 we showed up at 9 and it was closed. Then called and its voicemail and it was full? What the heck. Bad business. 
25067 I'm back at the slowest restaurant in Beaverton. This time there is only 5 people in line. Which now matches the number of workers!!! And I am still just standing here with the line not moving. Why do I come here??? The food is good... SERVICE IS HORRIBLE! 
25068 Omg just fell in love with this place !!! Did cryo and compression oxygen going on to infra red. My sore shoulder got an instant boost. 
25069 Nettes Ambiente, Service zwar freundlich aber unprofessionel. Fisch und Octopus lasch im Geschmack, Burger und Tacos entsprechen den Erwartungen. Sauce fehlt bei einem Essen komplett. 
25070 Hidden gem in college park! Fantastic food, live music. We loved the veg platter and the fried green onions. Highly recommend! 
25071 Always skeptical about Indian restaurants in Boston- iam pretty impressed by the food here... Very good !!!be cause not all curries tasted the same and look the same !!! 
25072 love the salon and love love love garrett....his haircuts are amazing and he is super fun to chit chat with during the appointment. i only wish the salon wasn't in downtown and i would go more often 
25073 Solid Irish pub in the heart of financial district. Great live music and decent pub food. Great atmosphere to stop in and just enjoy. The Guinness was one of the best I've had short of Ireland herself. I'll be back. 
25074 Turkey T-Man makes me smile every time! Chopped turkey, sausage, beans, sauce, and white bread to put it all in. Nothing beats that! 
25075 The staff *is* horribly and consistently unfriendly. However, they have a really good selection of French wines. Your experience of this store will depend on how much 'tude you're willing to take for a nice bottle of Mercurey. 
25076 Decent fast food BBQ. Main draw is the location in Edgewood Shopping Center. Much better BBQ can be had at Fox Bros up the street but they are much busier (with good reason) 
25077 Absolutely love this place! First time we went the kid was not happy we were there until the Russell arrived at our table. She went from mad to glad and any place that can do that to my picky eater deserves 5 stars! 
25078 I love this place, super cheap, delicious food with a fun factor (you can pick a ready made bowl or choose your ingredients - gotta try it to understand what I mean). Friendly staff and clean, easy environment. There is always a good reason to come back here :) 
25079 Appetizer Chicken curry puff was good.Tom yum soup was ok. I think I ordered a entree which was not spicy at all which I didnt like. 
25080 Lunch is the best value in town. Lots of very good. Wife & I take more home than we can eat in one sitting Did I mention that it is good? 
25081 Tommy was great! I called for an estimate he came out that day and within two days the work was completed to my satisfaction and you can't beat his prices 
25082 They had a limited variety of flavored. We were in the area and decided to try it. Got the blood orange cream sickle. It was good for the first few bites and then it got real creamy and heavy. In a cute little space, with fun comic wallpaper! 
25083 Drinks were great, bartender was friendly, and the place had a really nice atmosphere to it. The edamame with jerk seasoning was probably the worst thing I've eaten in the past five years. No salt, overly spicy without balancing the warming spices. Really terrible... 
25084 This place was a great gift. Service and amenities are great. Rooms very comfortable. I would buy in if I could! 
25085 Great experience. Fine food, quickly made, and not expensive. 
25086 This is my go to thai place. I've had noodles, curry, fish, tofu and everything is great and inexpensive. They also deliver. Try their coconut water! And scallion pancake with green curry sauce 
25087 Best arepas in Atlanta so addicting so pleasing yum yum been craving one evryday since I went OMG no place compares 
25088 I would say that these are hands down the best cupcakes in Atlanta! The owner and staff are always incredibly friendly and great at accommodating special orders. The chocolate/ crushed Heath bar cupcake is absolutely life changing! 
25089 Great experience. Their fries are great, the fry sauce is perfect. Impossible Burger is my new favorite. Staff was friendly. I can't drink so I don't know how the beer is but we will be back to eat. 
25090 Good lunch buffet!! The place was bigger than i expected! The price was reasonable, only $8.95 there were enough food, beverages, and salad. 
25091 Love this place. Special shout out to Greg at the front desk and Tomas in the High Ball Lounge for making my birthday stay especially memorable. Definitely recommend for you stay in Boston. 
25092 Wow! Fast, easy, friendly service to get new passports. As others have noted, the wait for the post office appointments was six weeks. We were in and out of the International Office in under 30 minutes. The staff was welcoming and put us at ease. 
25093 Love the dimsums here. They're always fresh and are pushed around in the little trolleys. Service is attentive. My favourite dish has to be the chicken nuggets. Clean. Good Food. Good Service. Definitely will be coming back. 
25094 Good empanadas and great chorizo sandwich, in true Argentine style and taste. Other items are of Argentine and Latin American influence. Good for sharing. The cocktails are great. 
25095 I've loved this place in the past, but the service and food has been less consistent recently. A step above standard chain fare, which is why I go there, but not spectacular. Decent burgers and salads, salmon is pretty good, steaks are hit or miss. 
25096 We had a lot of fun here!!! We went to the room where we sat on couches and then the belly dancer came who was so friendly and she was a good dancer. She engaged the crowd! The food was really good and our server was amazing! Will be back!! 
25097 Best coffee in PDX. I lived in Italy for a year and this is the only place that comes close to that quality of espresso. No one makes a better cappuccino. 
25098 Loved this little sandwich shop. I had the beet sandwich which was absolutely delicious. They also had a selection of raw/gluten free/dairy free desserts. I had the almond butter cup and thought it was awesome! 
25099 The chicken seems microwaved. Very rubbery and tough. Not sure what happened, but this place has gone way down in quality over the years. Not worth the $$$. 
25100 I ordered the one lbs of crab legs, corn, and potato salad. I believe I chose the everything mix seasoning. The food was really delicious! I will definitely order from there again when in the area. 
25101 Had a main line leak in basement fixed. Pipelines showed up within an hour, and were quick to to diagnose and repair. Extremely pleasant experience (all things considered!), and would recommend without reservation. Courteous and friendly. 
25102 Amazing mea sitting at the counter last night! Great view, meticulous attention to detail with my food allergies, and ridiculously delicious food!!! Can't wait to return! 
25103 Great place for brunch. They get really busy though so the wait staff don't pay much attention to you. 
25104 One of the bests brazilian placed that I've ever been. Perfect coxinhas, churros and music 
25105 Great bar selection. The food is decent but it is expensive compared to neighboring sushi restaurants and the portions are much smaller. I guess they can get away with it because it is targeting a different crowd. 
25106 I have been bringing my car to Dave's for years and will continue doing so as long as I'm in the area. Pick-up and drop-off is much more convenient than the dealership, and the communication about my car is much stronger. 
25107 The chips in our nacho plate were stale, and the "cheese" was that weird yellow stuff you get at ballparks. I expect a little better for $6 at a neighborhood bar. 
25108 Delivery took exactly 2 hours and 41 minutes. I haven't eaten the food yet and don't care how it tastes. I'm hungry man. 
25109 Great dog walking company! They were able to fit my dog in within a week's notice when I moved back to Cambridge. I love that they send a day's recap in an email with pictures and videos! Awesome guys :) 
25110 Definitely not fresh!! Tasted like food had been sitting for days. The food was cold. Even the coffee was lukewarm. Over priced for what you get. Wouldn't go back. Service was ok 
25111 This place is basically Korean-run. I like how they torched the meat but the ramen was mediocre. 
25112 this IS the best Italian in all of atx! i could live off of their fettuccine ragu! i love this place so much... the staff is incredibly nice and great faces to see when you walk in the door! 
25113 I have been a client for 10 years. It has really been upgraded inside over the years, making it less institutional and more like a real spa. The majority of my experiences with the students works has been great. Always professional and friendly, I return again and again. 
25114 Very good! The Bento box at lunch time is the best deal. Can be expensive for dinner. My favorite meal is the Shaken Beef, it's delicious and I get it everytime. 
25115 Went to see Pete for instructions with my new Mini-Cooper sport turbo Very helpful and genuinely great guy!! Thank you Pete and CarMax 
25116 Everything was delicious that we ate and they have a great and friendly staff to help you make the best sub. We will be back! 
25117 Pros: - great combination of modern and history - not only a museum, but a fun place to have coffee and relax - unique story Cons: - a little bit expensive ticket for a museum that you can finish in 3 hours 
25118 Brandon and his crew did a great job! Great customer service and great prices! Recommend seeing him and his crew. 
25119 This place is great and right across the street from the Domain. Their baba ghanoush is to die for! Food tastes fresh and their portions are sizeable. Customer service is great too. They delivered our baba ghanoush once-now that's going above and beyond! 
25120 I like the location, drink prices, and live music. Being outside is a plus too. But, I can only give it three stars because I haven't tried their food yet. 
25121 Extremely long delivery times consistently and incomplete orders and lack of concern ! Not planning to order again 
25122 Meh. Seemed like one of those touristy places where food is mediocre and prices are a bit steep but they have a great location. We sat outdoors and missed the opportunity to play arcade games and pinball inside. Service was quick! 
25123 I love this place! I would say they have some of the best burgers I have ever had! The drinks and service rocked! I will absolutely keep going here! Now to make it a 5 star they need a dance floor :-) 
25124 I like this place. The owner/bartender was a great host. The Ramen was excellent. Will be back to try out some cocktails soon. 
25125 I contacted this business via email from their website and never got a reply. Followed up with a phone inquiry and was promised a response on their inventory "either way" and never got a reply. Very disappointing! I'll shop elsewhere. 
25126 This place was decent last year when we stopped on our way through. This year, however, the service was extremely poor, the fries were cold and soggy, and the seafood chowder tasted like it came from a can. We won't be back. 
25127 Great buffet!! 12.99 11:30-2:30. Seafood soup was great! Great service. Just in a strip mall. Brick front. 
25128 Legit place. Good food. Unique and hip environment. Gotta come here anytime I visit BC. 
25129 Every time is a charm. Great food and fun. Fair prices and very casual. Great tastes evry time, can't miss on any menu item. Don't just stick to the fish tacos. 
25130 Excellent food and great service; shout out to our server Xavier; this is authentic Mexican food; fajitas mixta was excellent. This place is where local Mexicans go for Mexican food - that's got to be good. 
25131 Came here around 6:20pm. Asked to wait about 15 minutes cool not a problem except there were plenty of seats open for 2 people. Many people came in and weren't acknowledge standing there awkwardly trying to be seated. Won't come back to this location. 
25132 this place was incredible. we got the gnocchi, the saltinbocca (veal) and the tirmasu. we will be going back asap. the price is also very affordable for the quality. great place, probably the best italian option outside the northend. 
25133 Good price. Good food. I didn't eat at the location. It was a delivery from UBER EATS. Typical Greek gyro spot. They also have burgers fries and other items on the menu. 
25134 Quick, conveinent, good customer service, trustworthy & reasonably priced. What else is there? 
25135 Came with the family & they loved it !!! Me being Mexican knows what real Mexican food is like and this is it. I recommend everyone to stop by. The staff is friendly. !!! Love it !! 
25136 We went for a late night drink and bite around 10 pm. The service was phenomenal and the 3 small plates we shared went above expectation. The charred octopus was beyond! We will be again. 
25137 Just moved to Atlanta and came here for my first wax after searching through other yelp reviews. WAX offers great customer service in a clean, relaxing spa. (Read: cucumber water!) Prices are a bit high, but they have an offer for new customers that definitely helps 
25138 Buy one get one free for teacher appreciation week! Thank you guys so much! I loved my bowls. :) 
25139 Hi, I had a great conversation with Roberto ( aka Roby) the owner of Cycles 128 while one of his mechanical engineers installed my GL 1800 windshield. Nice job , Nice personal to deal with. Head's up ! Cycles 128 will soon be carrying Can Am's. Skip Bertolino. 
25140 Saturday evening, 10:30pm, closed. No explanation. We've given this place several chances to improve, but sadly this is probably our last visit. 
25141 Ordinary rooms, bad service, plain food, but worst of all you have to pay for the gym!! I travel all the time for work and have never had to pay for a gym at a hotel. Just horrible. Not recommended at all. 
25142 I was so happy to hear they have agua fresca!! I ordered the guava It was perfect not too sweet, and came in a large cup. The "tacos de Tinga" where excellent as well. 
25143 good food, good drinks and the workers are awesome!!! the manager, Seth, the bartender, Erick, and the beautiful waitress, Demi, are so friendly and understanding where they would let us watch the bachelorette!! my favorite "sport" bar! 
25144 Brand new place, I like the convenient location right next to Publix on 17/92! Also good atmosphere, nice music and great service. Had a mani/pedi done and both my hands and feet look great! A little pricey tho, but worth it! 
25145 Your review helps others learn about great local businesses. Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees. 
25146 Nice placce for health-concious lunches and dinners - they have an option without loads of carbs (incl. sugar) - it is a rare find for my low-carb days. Food tasted great too. 
25147 I received the most beautiful flower arrangement today from The Concord Flower Shop! The flowers were an awesome arrangement of color, placement and the fragrant Lillie's are amazing!!! This is my new fav flower place by far!! I also received a call from the shop. Excellent service! 
25148 This hotel had a baby roach on the pillow and only means theres a family of roaches somewhere. Never sleep comfortably our entire stay regardless of being moved to another room!! That was their solution!!!! Seriously!! Disgusting and gross!!! 
25149 Great burgers and home cut fries. Was packed opening night and still got great service. Has new style coca-cola automated soda machines. Great experience all around 
25150 Wow! I had the tour plate with the Scottish egg, sausage roll, and the sundried tomato and brie pillow. It was alllllll so delicious!!!!!!!! Everything is made fresh and is absolutely to die for!! I can't wait to come back!! 
25151 I've been coming here every weekend for years. Never had an issue. Seeing anyone post less than 5 stars...they're just stuck up folks or lying. Everything is amazing here, food and service. I've never had any sort of issue with anything at this Diner. 
25152 The best poutine I have found south of the Quebec border and trust me.. it rivals some of Montreal's best. Had been coming frequently for the poutine alone and thought I would mix it up one day. What a great choice that was! Don't pass this place up. 
25153 Yum! Salsa is excellent, tortillas home made. The fish tacos are my have, followed by the barbacoa. Mexican cokes here and aqua frescos are HUGE! 
25154 Service was awful. Forgot 2 items and the seating was cramped and uncomfortable. Food was decent. 
25155 Terrible experience this evening....not worth it, undercooked, chicken was not fresh, French fries tasted like the frozen fries you can buy from Kroger down the street. Overall; disgusted, overpriced, STAY AWAY!!!! 
25156 Excellent choice for Seafood (especially Oysters) in Boston! Great wine selection and beautiful patio! 
25157 Good beer but they don't have big ten network. How is that even possible for a bar in columbus? 
25158 I'm sorry to say this...: it's pathetic...! Commercialized, hipster, unoriginal, meat market -- these were the words that popped in my mind recalling my experience there. 
25159 I apologize ahead of time, but it has been a LONG time since I've gone to Milano's, but I always remember it fondly as a place to get some cheap grub that was actually really tasty. I'd go back there with no problems at all. A fun joint. 
25160 Delicious lamb shawarma. It's pretty big and comes with all the fixins! This is seriously one of the best shawarmas I've had anywhere. Hummus was also VERY tasty. I would think anything on their menu would be good. No complaints. :) 
25161 Delicious but these tacos can add up! I had to eat like 8-10 to get full and an avg price of about $3 that's quite a bit for Mexican food. Food and service was good though! 
25162 Been here twice- first time was okra and cornbread, 2nd time was hush puppies and mac and cheese. Overall, nice concept but flavors need to be stronger. I didn't get the taste of being in a Southern place. Bf's steak was a little dry. Cocktails and mocktails are well done. 
25163 Excellent Baked eggplant and calamari. Service was good and host was thoughtful and kind. My favorite Italian in LAKEWAY! 
25164 We sat there for a few hours doing some work, and at around 12pm the owner came over and offered us a yummy fruit plate. Great place, so sweet. 
25165 Really nice variety of sandwiches for vegetarians and carnivores alike. I've had takeout twice from this place. 
25166 The ramen here is less than great. It came out luke warm and oily. The service we received was NOT good. I will not be returning. 
25167 This was the full experience for New Years brunch. Excellent food, excellent service and clean bathrooms. I had the coconut French toast and a side of hash browns. Both were very good. I'll visit again when I am in town. 
25168 This place is great. They have Murphy's on tap and an excellent waiting staff. They are conveniently located near the financial district and fanuiel hall. This place has a bunch of specials and live music that will make you want to come back. 
25169 The Coop is separated into several buildings and so it has a huge selections of books and Harvard gear. Even bigger than the typical bookstore and has all the textbooks you could ever want. 
25170 Loving the food! Highly recommend to all my friends even if it's pricey. Family love the cozy feel and ambiance. Quite an experience! 
25171 popped in for a quick slash. had a 12z glass $3. good crowd. mid day-weekday. a bit woody inside, there's good things to come here I am sure. beer solid, no sign of food. 
25172 Awesome food, no thrills. The ingredients were all noticeably fresh. I got the shrimp quesadilla and the shrimp was really good. My girlfriend got 3 tacos and loved all of them, but the barbacoa was her favorite. 
25173 One of my favorite brunch places. We've had some hit and miss experiences, but it has been a while since we've had one of those. Highly recommened their coffee (best I've ever had) and La Villageoise. 
25174 Stopped in before getting a tattoo around the corner, seems like a solid juice bar. The menu has some fun/funky names for drinks which I quite enjoyed. The sitting area seems a little oddly shaped, but they cannot do much about that i'm sure. staff seemed nice. Prices are decent. 
25175 Generally is a good place to have dinner. Everything was good. I gave four star just because it is a normal nothing surprise me. You can still go for dinner with friends, family. 
25176 Went to see Christine from the recommendations on this site. Had both nipples done. she is very professional, very clean place, plenty of selections to chose from. Would definitely recommend her for us first timers ; ) 
25177 I think their rice dishes are way better than their Pho's. Also I really like their sandwiches and spring rolls. I took a friend who haven't had viennese food ever. He absolutely love it. 
25178 Atmosphere is nice. Sandwich (New Yorker) was dry. Salad was okay. A bit overpriced for what we got. Probably won't go back. 
25179 Amazing authentic Vietnamese resturant. The food is exquisite, tree staff are very friendly. I loved this restaurant. I will definitely be back 
25180 Today I waited for my rapid pickup order for 10 MINUTES. I finally went to the counter, and it was just sitting there in the food prep area with my name on it, getting cold. Now I'm running late. What happened today, Panera?! 
25181 Tried Syphon Coffee for the 1st time, it was totally cool to watch & Amazing taste. Bridget is very knowledgeable & took good care of us. The most Amazing Chicken Salad Sandwich I've ever had! 
25182 Very cool breakfast joint. Would recommend Have unique options. Not many typical breakfast option like pancakes. Wait times long. Friday brunch time we waited 1 hr. 
25183 Had a lot of fun at Pirate's cove for a date night. They need new carpet layers down every hole is worn out. People that work there are extremely helpful and friendly. Plenty of parking and fun for the whole family. 
25184 A pitcher of blood orange margaritas and a selection of the outstanding tacos and small plates from the bar menu facilitated supreme flavor delivery and maximum happy hour execution. Favorable location near Newbury Street made all members of our unit highly satisfied. 
25185 Best almond milk latte I have ever had! The service is always good and the coffee is amazing. The patio is great, even on rainy days because it is covered. 
25186 Always a wonderful spectrum of colors and flavors at Torchy's Tacos in Austin, Texas! You can't go wrong with any of their tacos- the selection is dynamite and the flavor pairings ROCK! Mr. Pink is a personal fave :-) 
25187 Fair prices, great food, and really nice server (Rafael). Thanks Rafael for your wonderful service! We will come in again! 
25188 Nice establishment. Parking is rough. Like fish? I hope so cause even general tso's tasted like it. Waitress was very nice though. 
25189 The food is delicious!!! The service is warm and friendly; families with children are treated kindly. The place is spacious, comfortable, clean and value is great! 
25190 Its a bar. It has beer. It has liquer. It plays top 40s loud enough to drown out conversation. $1 bud drafts (yuck!) and free nachos during happy hour. 
25191 Waited an hour and half for 2 pasta entree's...maybe recommend the bar, but never dinner. Very dissapointed! 
25192 Food is great!! No wait. Our server Delfino is the best. I had the Diablo and if you like Spice you must have it! 
25193 We were looking to rent a house. We email and called, over a week later no response. Not too impressed especially with such good reviews. First impression was not so positive. Went elsewhere and received great help. 
25194 Hi, I ordered from East Van Pizza, the order arrived and the 3 topping pizza was incorrect and seriously lacking in toppings. I called them and they completely redeemed themselves. New pizza delivered with the 3 correct and fully loaded toppings. Very happy with the service! Sent from my iPhone 
25195 Get the monkey brains. Black tiger is an amazing roll, the wasabi mayo is very mild, and even those who don't like wasabi will enjoy this sauce. Sashimi was excellent quality. Green kimono drink is very refreshing, with a strong kick. 
25196 Everything has gone down hill. They opened their new location and now this one is completely mis managed. Wait time is purposely long and the old Japanese woman is a horrible waitress, she's way too slow. Very disappointed. 
25197 Great work all around. Karlos, Jose, Luis, and Daniel did a great job! 
25198 Bring several books because you will have to wait a long time. Not sure if staff even cares that you have to wait that long. If I were a dentist there, I would be embarrassed to be associated with Greenberg dental. 
25199 Good AYCE restaurant. Very quick service and consistent quality. I recommend making reservations, the smallish space can be extremely busy during dinner hours. My only issue is that the price has been increasing from visit to visit. 
25200 Simple Italian for a fun night out with friends. The chicken parm is big enough to be family-style but without limitations in taste. I'd definitely come back if not only for the post-entree cannolis on the House...yes that's a thing here. So good! 
25201 When I want to listen to smooth cool jazz, this is where I go. Cocktails are very colorful and exotic! Staff was top notch and waiting on me hand and foot. And the restrooms, more like lounge rooms. They could be day spas all on their own. I heart Red7! 
25202 They have this old-school tuscan whatever that might be the best pasta dish I have ever had. And their pizza is delicious (except almost everything has onions on it and onions=blech). I am a fan. 
25203 My family and I Love eating here! Their tacos Al Pastor are thee best!!! 
25204 Bar tender was extremely nice, and I know it's not her fault, but it shouldn't take 45 plus minutes to receive our togo food. On top of that, items on my order were forgotten, so now I wait... 
25205 So pleased! Shellac manicure looks amazing. They have tons of Shellac color options. Manicurist was very nice and did a great job. $40 but well worth it. 
25206 Take a step back in time and get a cup of French onion soup before boarding Amtrak. Old funky decor, but I personally loved it. Caprese pesto sandwich was good. 
25207 Nice small little breakfast place. The host was really friendly. He suggested the banana pecan affogato and it was indeed good. Try their specials. 
25208 Pro: You can eat it, not too bad, fast food Mexican Con: Fast food Mexican, not that good, over priced 
25209 Absolutely amazing! We need a great restaurant like this up north (yet south of Boulder)! We had the sweet potato puffs, Ditka Burger, fried chicken and Oreo cheesecake...all were superb!!! 
25210 Great spot for a good sandwich, good beer, and good friends in a booth. Dark and cozy inside and can be happening on weekend nights. One of my neighborhood go to spots! 
25211 The spicy meat is good, but kafta is not. Great eggplant dip! Worth a try! 
25212 The best. Britton leads a terrific team. They genuinely love animals. I'm always at ease when they're looking after my dog. 
25213 Other reviews have it covered. Very very good and worth the trip. My advice: sit at the bar as you get access to more menu items. 
25214 Been here a few times and the food is always good! Definitely a little on the pricier side, but the food is well worth it! 
25215 About average..... I wouldn't recommend this place. The view is pretty, but the food is just, "alright." Go to the bridge-way inn in marshfield if you are looking for an all around phenomenal restaurant. 
25216 This place is excellent. I got the most wonderful 90 minute prenatal massage from Whitney, and it was EXACTLY what I needed!! Highly recommended! 
25217 This is hands down my favorite pizza place in central Florida. After a recent trip to NYC I can vouch that A Touch of Basil is just as delicious and any of the shops I tried while there. Love it! 
25218 It's pretty good. They make a solid burger, and the shakes are delicious. They have had some execution problems for me (burgers not cooked to the correct temp, etc). Also, the burgers are a bit pricey. Good, but there are better burgers for the money elsewhere in Atlanta. 
25219 Best fried shrimp & oysters BAR NONE! So fresh and lightly battered. Love the complimentary corn fritters. 
25220 Great atmosphere and really nice people. The services are great and a value for the price! 
25221 Adore this place- I always sit at the bar, great bartenders. Always good service, friendly staff, fantastic sushi and drinks- especially the Torrontes wine :) lunch or dinner, this is my spot- I eat here several times a week! 
25222 Had the salmon arugula salad for lunch. Very nice. Very simple. The place is a bit run down but the service was good. 
25223 the best JAzz place in town!! with decent price of drinks good place to go in 6th street!!!! 
25224 Yummy, Yummy, Yummy! I love the queso and salsa here. Service was awesome, food was even better and drinks were the bomb! Can't wait to go back! 
25225 I loved their cake donuts especially the blueberry. I wasn't impressed by their glazed donuts though. Get ready to stand in a long line with no AC. 
25226 Pizzas are definitely good but I think you can get the same quality for cheaper at other eateries. 
25227 This is absolutely amazing Indian food. It is truly authentic!! I rarely write reviews, but I had to for this restaurant. We've had their food (buffet) 3-4 times and our is consistently excellent. I've seen the kitchen - consistently clean. Absolutely amazing. I will go back - God willing. 
25228 Loved their vegan chocolate cupcake and Boston creme pie!! A Boston chain that is both quirky and exceptional in quality. 
25229 + had an amazing dinner here - the chef's special menu + everything was incredible - seating tight 
25230 I am from Texas and we love our desserts. Stopped here on a whim and man, that Boston Cream Pie and Red Velvet Hot Chocolate was so dang good I was speechless. I definitely recommend!!! 
25231 I really love this place. Friendly service and a simple but comfortable space. Food is outstanding. The korma is my favourite. Naan is always fresh and delicious. Most importantly, these people are really nice - goes a long way with me. 
25232 First time walk in: Got the last 2 "pizza's by the slice" peices. Added the Pep. Well worth the $4.00. Will be visiting again 
25233 My doctor referred me to Dr. Macfarlane here. Since it's a walk-in clinic, I couldn't make an appointment. Unfortunately, this translated into over an hour wait to see Dr. M. However, the clinic was clean and the staff was nice. It seems like a fine urgent care clinic. 
25234 I'm being nice giving three stars, being one waitress saved two employees that thought customers didn't even deserve to be seated 
25235 We had an absolutely wonderful experience! "Lucky" went above and beyond to make sure that we enjoyed our afternoon. The food was incredible and the Oreo dessert we got was even better! 
25236 I brought in two dresses. One to be shortened and one to be lengthened. They were done perfectly. Thank you ladies. Just know that they only take cash. 
25237 Had an amazing meal. Started with the mozarella, tomato, basil salad that was simple but perfect! Went on to a porcini rubbed delmonico that was perfectly cooked with amazing flavors. The service was friendly and on top of things. 
25238 Food is really good as well as the service but the multitude of dead flies on the windowsills in the bar area was a big turn off 
25239 The employees are nice but very serious for some reason. The iced caramel bullseye expresso was pretty good but very creamy so I wouldn't order it if you're not into heavily creamy drinks. 
25240 They burnt my shirt and did not have the courtesy to tell me when I picked up my laundry. I am never going there again. And did I mention, they are much pricier than other stores. 
25241 OMG!, it so delicious and filling. The chicken was tasty and plentiful. I cannot wait to devour my left over. :) 
25242 Cheese selection is always on point, and staff members are always kind and knowledgeable about the foods they carry. I always bring people from out of town to this spot and it's always a hit. 
25243 The best breakfast in Vancouver for a great price and huge portions. It's always a treat to come. I get the eggs Benedict or the crepes. My husband loves the omelets. 
25244 Have been here 2-3 times. Pluses: - Really liked their broth. Great on a cold winter day. - Roast pork buns were great. Neutral: - Noodles, egg, and condiments were OK. Minuses: - Salty. I didn't mind it, but several friends did. 
25245 This place is unique to Boston and to the waterfront. Everyone should try it out at least once, especially on a warm summer evening. Take some out of town visitors here after a day seeing the sites and they'll be happy. 
25246 One of my favorite spots in Columbus. Technical, delicious menu and excellent beers. Love the atmosphere and hydroponic wall installments with live plants. 
25247 First time here, very nice & discrete. Right away service, especially with the cheesy bread you get treated meanwhile you order. Prices do match the portions so it's deff a 4Star 
25248 Great atmosphere and the food was bangin!!! My friend and I ordered the Chicken Nachos appetizer and the Reuben Sandwich. The meat was stacked plenty high and was delicious. 
25249 Their Beef and broccoli is pretty decent. Service was not great, unfriendly lady at the front and she forgot half of my order. I got home and had to drive back to get it, which really sucks! 
25250 Pretty solid service. 11am on a Saturday, I dropped off 65 pounds of laundry (kids were at camp for a week). $75 and 6 hours later, I have a bunch of folded clean laundry. Given the late start on Saturday, not bad at all. 
25251 This place is amazing and authentic so don't be deterred by the strip mall location. The hand pulled noodles are delicious and I love the fact that you can choose your noodle shape. The sushi is perfectly fine but if you are coming here, get the noodles. 
25252 Visited the WOB by Lake Eola and loved absolutely everything. The food was amazing and the service was better. I recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area who wants to explore Florida beers, have great food and a better view! 
25253 Golf? Beers? Not lugging clubs around in the rain? It might be hard to find.. Under Dunn's tailors after all it IS under Granville. Drink beer (or cocktails, wine, scotch), hit the range, or play a round. And maybe have some pizza. FORE! 
25254 Love this place. I enjoy sitting outside and people watching. The service is great and it's affordable for the given area. 
25255 This place is one of the best as far as burritos. It's so addicting to the point I usually go 3 times a week. The buffalo chicken burrito is great but make sure to hit the coke freestyle machine first. 
25256 Yaaaaas! Kind of weird to enter since you have to walk around the building to the stairs, but I love the way it's decorated and the food is all really good. Just wish they had soup dumplings all the time! 
25257 Great BBQ, nice wait staff that was very informative on their various plates. 
25258 Flavorful food. Very reasonable. Quick service. Not sure if Ehtiopian food is generally served cold, but if it was hot, I would have been happier. 
25259 Great experience. Hour and half wait, but not at the bar! Crab and lobster were very good. 
25260 What an incredible nursery in the heart of the city! I would definitely say this is the rolls Royce of nurseries in the city, the plants all look incredibly happy and healthy. Atmosphere is great and everyone was incredibly welcoming and insightful. 
25261 This Chick-Fil-A is great. There is usually a lot of customers and it is quite busy, but that is only a testament to their successful business. It is near many schools, one of which is the Westminster Schools. Their service is quick, and it has many seats/tables. Go Chick-Fil-A! 
25262 Chicken pot pie, tilapia biance, pork ribs, strip steak and killer desserts!!! Love this place!!! 
25263 Well I would give the entr√©e menu high marks but... We didn't get passed appetizers cocktails and dessert! Apparently you can't go wrong here. Ask for Kyle she's a great waitress! 
25264 They get the blizzards mixed just right- no extra white ice cream without the mix-ins that I get at some other places. Nice and friendly staff. 
25265 The staff are extremely nice and professional. The food is great and I'm not a sushi person lol food for all kinds of tastes! 
25266 Loved this place and the Vegan change. I also noticed that all the cleaning supplies and napkins were sustainable brands. I got a chai tea and it was wonderful. The music was so cool. Just overall very cute and clean place that supports values I care about. 
25267 It's pretty good. I wouldn't wait 90 minutes to eat here again though. It's just brunch at the end of the day. 
25268 Not impressed. Food selection was sparse for the price. Mongolian Grill was the best part of the food. Hot and Sour Soup was barely okay. The chili oil was pretty good though, and the iced tea was absolutely delicious. 
25269 I originally had a long explanation detailing what happened but instead, I'll just give this advise: Please call me if the pie is gonna be over an hour late next time, even if it's cold & you give an extra, medium, plain cheese with it. Thanks. 
25270 We went there for discotheque. The place looks good after renovation. Food was good, but really pricey. But on top of that, fish was smelling! And our friends got sick from it and was recovering for a week! Definitely not worth the money, avoid. 
25271 The car was great the service was terrible. The woman working at 11:00 pm on Wednesday 2/21/2018 clearly did not want to be there. She was annoyed at the fact they had customers. 
25272 Nice addition to Park Ave. Food is a 4 out 5 but the price is in line with that so I will be going back for sure. Seems like a nice bar as well. 
25273 My favorite chicken place! It is cooked fresh when you order it. Tenders are ok but the chicken... amazing. 
25274 Came here with a friend for breakfast-- got the breakfast burrito. SO good. Great portion. The server came by often to warm up the coffee and the prices were reasonable. Plus, it wasn't overrun like so many Portland restaurants for breakfast/brunch. 
25275 Everything went perfectly. It was raining so I scheduled an in-store windshield replacement. They finished early and the work was as promised. 
25276 Pavia is the best! We are using their catering services for two years now and are always super happy with the great food and service. Rubia and her team are amazing and always provide the best food, right on time, with a great smile! 
25277 Great patio and friendly staff. Very close to Stubbs and the other music venues if you need a place to stop before a show. Everything else is relatively average Austin-style Tex-Mex. 
25278 Total scumbags. do not open a bank account at this evil entity!!!! I am serious and you have been warned : ) 
25279 Super friendly, the bartenders are super attentive. You don't really have to dress to impress (which is awesome because I'm lazy) This is a great place to go after work when you want to relax. Good vibes all around. 
25280 Nice theatre. I totally picked the wrong seats for my group (we were under the mezzanine for an acrobatic show... missed the high-flying stuff. :( I would come back, though, really a classy little location in Downtown and the Theatre District. 
25281 Excellent. Buffet style dining. Choose your sides and have them cut your meat at the meat station. I had he fatty brisket and it was amazing and so tender. 
25282 Really good food. It was cheap and fairly quick. I would recommend getting veggies, they're free and make it a meal. 
25283 food is better than average with some dishes being particularly notable and others less so. also good wine list, nice bar and overall atmosphere - especially in summer with windows all open. reasonably-priced for italian in the north end. 
25284 Bad service! Kitchen very very slow! There're r people all around waiting for their food.... 
25285 A very friendly, open salon with great service. Emily cut my hair today and she was very personable and informative, I felt comfortable trusting her opinion. Would reccomend. 
25286 I've used this broker for several years and they are wonderful. I work with Eric, very nice. I recommend this place. 
25287 This is by far one of my favorite places fie mexican food. I especially love there oil chili pepper! I hardly crave Mexican food but this place is Bomb.com. 
25288 Found this place while working in town and have not been disappointed. Food and service are very good. Prices are reasonable. Lunch crowd gets very busy and parking becomes a challenge, but well worth your time. 
25289 Spectacular experience here. Can I give a place six stars? Good food, great espresso, and the best service I've ever had in a cafe - all in a quirky little spot with charming patrons and staff! 
25290 officially obsessed with sevens ale. the food is not good but the staff is friendly, and though it's packed every time i'm there, i seem to be able to score a table. 
25291 I adore By George and their occasional sales have me reeling in recovery for days. A beautiful brown leather belt for $20?! They carry excellent premium denim like Seven, Paige, Loomstate, AG, and Humanity. The staff is so helpful and sweet! I also love the Hobo handbags. 
25292 Jason returned a few emails saying he would come and fix it but never did. We finally hired a Muehe Quality Heating and they came out and fixed all of Lakeside's mess. $1000 
25293 Great place for family style Italian dining. A little touristy but the food is good and prices reasonable. 
25294 Really disappointed what happened with my BMW 2013, and the way management treated me was sad. Still waiting for the corporate to call me back after i filed a claim with the store manager today. 
25295 We got in just before they closed midday--so worth it! We got soup dumplings, Mongolian beef, and a noodle dish. Everything was delicious and food came out extremely fast! We can't wait to return! 
25296 -Funny/attractive guys working there -Free weekly tastings -Convenient location -Little to no snobbery or intimidating prices What's not be 5-star worthy? Love this place. 
25297 I have used them several times. Their cards are great, they just have a terrible shipping policy. Order a month or two in advance or you will be going to the local Hallmark store as I did recently for a card because they did not deliver in time. 
25298 This is the most amazing place and if I could give more stars I would! Try everything you can the best is the eclair! Also remember that this place has lunch/dinner items. Best service and best treats. 
25299 Excellent service. Celiac-friendly flavors and WAFFLE CONES! Seriously everyone is so wonderful and nice. Try the sorbet. It's creamy and dairy-free. 
25300 Had the $1000 10 course meal and it was so filling and fabulous if your a seafood adventurer. My other friend was allergic to seafood so she ended up only having cake and dessert. Jellyfish, sharkskin, lobster, prawn and crabmeat stuffed crab claws to die for!! 
25301 Awesome! Juicy Awesomeness! Did I mention it's awesomely delicious? I'd go into details but it's better if you just go to this awesome place. Cheers. 
25302 This place was great, went here for a team meeting for work and the service was awesome and the food really good! I had the pork chop and a couple cold beers and would definitely go back! 
25303 Loooooove their sourdough bread - just the right amount of crusty and chewy, mwwah! perfect. 
25304 If I could give 0 stars I would. I called to place a TO GO order and the male on the phone said he couldn't take it because it was a to go order. When I said "okay" and was about to ask another question, he hung up. 
25305 I have been coming here for a while now and the Mofongo is right on point. The service is always great and they always make sure you are satisfied with your food and the service received. This is a great family restaurant will always come back for more! 
25306 Great food, great service, and a great environment. Sure, the line is a pain in the butt, but it's totally worth it and further proves how good the food is 
25307 This is literally the best Greek restaurant in Austin. All of the food (falafel, chicken gyro and chicken soup was incredible. The owners are incredibly nice. Will go back every chance I get. 
25308 Best donuts I have ever tasted. They are not filled with air. The place looks great and the owners are great as well. Try the coffee con leche and you won't be disappointed in this great shop. 
25309 Sunday brunch was very good! The outside patio with live music was also a nice touch. 
25310 Not really sure why anyone would want to come here. You can definitely get better German experience in Columbus. The food here is mediocre and amazingly bland and you've got two mustards, a standard and a "imma choke the air out of you". Really....really really bad service. 
25311 Our family has been Bearden customers for years and I keep meaning to write a review - this says it all: my next car will be a Lexus just so I can continue to use Bearden's for service!!! 
25312 Underground lunch spot. It was easy to get in and really fast service with great friendly staff. Basic breakfast options but just what I needed. Also great coffee 
25313 lifelong Quincy resident... what can I say.. its the cathay.... place is big... plenty of room for a group. ... you can park a convoy of mack trucks outside with plenty of spaces left over. .. not my first choice for take out.. but the food is pretty good. 
25314 Awesome, real turkey on the turkey club, fresh, delicious and with fries for $5.95, man it's worth double, and is it is the best $5.95 you can spend in Boston and beyond. 
25315 This place is great, I've bought my last 2 cars from them and they handle all my service. They are friendly, fast, and always very helpful. 
25316 Nothing special here, It was alright. Cannot believe all the idiots who wait in line for this place ~ what is the big deal ? 
25317 The best way to get some dank food from here is to get someone from Favor to do it. Don't strain yourself, yeah lines can get long and waiting may exceed 20 minutes but they're so worth it. Just pay someone $2 to go get it for you! 
25318 food is great and servers are nice. I recommend this place. I would check out groupon or gilt whether there are deals 
25319 Customer service was not good at all. I will not be buying from this place 
25320 Good food! Prices are reasonable given the location. We ordered the breakfast sandwiches and weren't disappointed. 
25321 The coffee isn't spectacularly good anymore; it's good, but just not remarkable. Service is pleasant and baristas are top notch. 
25322 After getting no help I found another repair shop that did care, they looked and found all it needed was cleaning out a hose that was stopped up, it would have saved me over an hour driving and I would have felt better about them 
25323 I come here for the bubble tea. It's all about their bubble tea. Defintely great and it's nice that are already accepting debit cards unlike yearsbago which is only cash. 
25324 Absolutely delicious. I got the spicy miso ramen which was amazing and the sesame cucumber appetizer was my favorite. They don't have an alcohol license at the moment so it was BYOB and we brought wine. Definitely worth coming to if you want to try the new ramen trend. 
25325 The beer is fantastic and very reasonably priced. Highly recommend filling your growler there. 
25326 Great place. If it has any negatives it may be that it"s too popular. I go for the wifi and the chai. 
25327 I love good bread, I love good Italian food. YAY! (My apologies for being biased toward Italian food, but it really is tastier than just about anything else). ;) 
25328 Great place. Had the fish and chips which was delicious. The staff was very polite and quick. Highly recommend this place. 
25329 I had the risotto and my wife had the scallops. I also had the black IPA which I would not recommend. Over all our server, meal, and atmosphere were all disappointing. Not how I remembered this place when it first open. 
25330 THE best sweet potato fries I have ever had. Ever. And it's a cool freakin bar. We also enjoyed the pork sliders. Not crazy about this Monday night trivia but... whatever. The guy did a good job DJing but the questions sucked. 
25331 Great place to eat!!! Awesome atmosphere, wonderful waitress, great prices, and DELICIOUS pizza! We got the mushroom/onion pizza and the crust was the best I've had... Very fresh and HOT! Definitely worth a try :) 
25332 Pizza is OK... Not as good as Slice of New York over on John Young 
25333 Fantastic place. Cool atmosphere, attentive staff, awesome beer selections, generous food portions and very yummy. The outdoor patio is perfect. Also, this place is family friendly! Love it. 
25334 We went here for happy hour. The food is creative and delicious. The shrimp ceviche was a big hit with us. The service was fantastic. I am looking forward to my next visit already! 
25335 Who knows what's in their Apple Cider with cinnamon stick??? It is the best Apple Cider beverage around! Perfect drink on every chilly night. 
25336 Winner, winner chicken dinner. Held up the best fried chicken in the ATL namesake. The service matched the excellence of the food. 
25337 Dirk Diegel did a fabulous job! He knew exactly what my hair needed without my saying a word, and he was both efficient and precise. I love the way my hair looks now, and I have gotten many compliments on it. Highly recommend. Will be going back! 
25338 Not worth the money I spent. My pedicure and Mani was a disappointment. Very little massage for my pedi and no Massage for my mani. The tech did not buff my feet for pedi. I will not go back. 
25339 This was my first visit to J&J and my first impression was excellent. The staff was very friendly and weren't pushy about up selling (which is a big problem at most salons). The prices are fair and the salon was very clean. I will definitely be going back. 
25340 Best liquor store in Boston! They have the best selection of wine and spirits not carried at most stores in town. They're prices are amazing too! 
25341 Greasy , sweet and ridiculously priced. It's decent, but not for folks that want real Indian food. If you want good ambience and don't mind spending few extra bucks then go ahead. And oh - the naan is pretty good. I'd buy the naan here and the curry somewhere else. 
25342 I initially have this place a less than wonderful review but now that they have been open a while they are doing a great job. Vast craft beer selection and friendly staff. 
25343 ROY IS AMAZING!!! He's an awesome agent, and he helped my roommate and I set up an auto policy alongside our existing renters insurance, and I saved a lot of money, (I had Progressive before, and State Farm is much cheaper). Friendly, helpful staff, and great attitudes! 10/10 would recommend. 
25344 The manager, Dana, is a great chat. Great food for a decent price and the atmosphere is very hip! We got the margarita pizza and it was delicious. Mac n cheese with added lobster is nice too. 
25345 A simply delicious experience. Fantastic service and fresh authentically modern French cuisine. Not outrageously expensive either... Definitely a new Boulder fav! 
25346 Great new nail salon in the area! Very clean and they have tons of cool polish colors to chose from. 
25347 Very Friendly costumer service! ! A very simple coffee shop next to a historical theater. Had a cup of cappuccino! Excellent in taste. I very much enjoyed conversation with the Barista. 
25348 The donuts taste great, but the times I've been there they gave run out of several flavors early in the evening. They don't stay fresh very well, but that's pretty much the same as all donuts. They're certainly as good as Voodoo and the wait is much shorter. 
25349 Wow, amazingly loud employee yapping and joking in their native language "Indian". Couldn't press the right key for my order!!! I ordered the chicken bacon sandwich. He put in no bacon and no sauce!!! I want my bacon!!! 
25350 One of my favorites places in downtown Vancouver for the afternoon happy hour - the fresh sushi is half priced, and the proprietary mixed drinks (like the Purple Rain, Lychee Crush, and the Kiwi Kamikaze) are top shelf excellent choices! 
25351 Amazing! If you like Mediterranean food, the Shakshuka is a must have. Positively delicious. Generous portions. Good price. What else can you say? 
25352 IHOP. They serve breakfast...ALL DAY!! I am a FAN of breakfast. This one is one of the cleaner IHOP's I have been to. We were seated immediatley and our orders taken promptly after that. All our food came out fresh and hot, everyone enjoyed what they ordered. 
25353 The margaritas were amazing and one of the best queso dips I have ever had!!! A great outdoor patio and service was great. The Flautas and quesadillas are highly recommended!!! 
25354 The best ramen in the city, truly! And I tried a lot of them! Friendly service, great food, good price! You might have to wait in line during busy hours, but it is worth it! 
25355 I come from California at least once a month and I never leave without getting my nails done by Donna. Her attention to detail and understanding of products is amazing. She's the type of nail tech that watches YouTube videos to learn even more styles and techniques. She's truly AMAZING! 
25356 Kimchi fries and beef bulgogi tacos among the best I have had in Austin. If you are out north and want a good cheap meal check-out Yummi Tacos! 
25357 not thrilled with my togo order. It was food. That's about all I can say and I didn't throw up. Soup was bland, food was bland, veggies looked over or maybe they were just way overcooked. 
25358 I am all about their frozen margaritas. Icy margarita goodness. Anything that can give you a buzz AND brain freeze is okay in my book. 
25359 Service was fast and friendly. Ryan was an excellent server and kept our bottomless fries coming! Only complain was sitting under the AC was a bit too frigid. Maybe turn it down a notch? 
25360 I've never had a bad experience at Black Bear Diner. If you join their e-club you can even get free meals. Even when there is a wait it's worth your time because your meal will be delicious! 
25361 OH MY GOSH! I want to try everything on the menu now. I had the chicken on a croissant, with avacado and bacon. DELISH! 
25362 Amazing food and dipping sauce for bread. Wine is great, reasonably priced for the area. 
25363 It's like meat heaven! Get your number right when you walk in, you'll still have time to browse. Friendly staff. Delicious bacon. 
25364 First time trying Cafe 26. We got Crepes and the Open Face Sandwich. The food was delicious and the service was great and fast. Definitely recommend! 
25365 Loved the ambiance of the place. Service was above and beyond (we were served by Chloe!) and there was a great wine selection for the parents. Our dessert was spectacular and the stew was hearty and satisfying. Great flavors overall. Definitely coming back to explore the rest of the menu. 
25366 It's a failed experiment today. I didn't like anything. No more comments as I won't say it's bad but I didn't like the cuisine. 
25367 Placed an order two hours ago - no one delivered the food - the shop is closed and do no way to reach them nobody is delivering, no way to reach them. Awful service and don't care about their customers at all ! 
25368 10 27 16, Thankful Thursday. I forgot to mention how beautiful the remodeled location looks. Awesome. Here again, the food and drinks great! 
25369 This is one of my favorite Decatur restaurants. Food and service is consistently wonderful! I've been multiple times and have never been disappointed. Rustic, gastro pub atmosphere with upscale Italian good. Very cool combo! 
25370 I went there with a group of friends. The host were attentive and patient with us. We ordered some $1 oysters between 3pm-4pm,it's sooooooo yuuuummy, and after 4pm you can order 2 set of seafood and get one free! We enjoyed the dinner very much. Will return again. 
25371 Calvin's was great throughout the whole process. They were accommodating and made sure we were taken care of. This was my first experience with a jeweler and Calvin's set the bar pretty high. Thanks again. 
25372 Went here for the first time this weekend. My food was absolutely fantastic, and they're not lying about the fries, they really are probably the best fries in Austin. I'll definitely be back. And I got the fried catfish for the record and it was incredible. 
25373 Stay away I should have known better when i walked in I'm on day two of food poisoning 
25374 I love ethnic foods! The Pirozhki was not the best I've had, but all of the foods in this market were tasty and the selection was great. If you can make it Mon-Fri when they are fresh grilling, I'd go! 
25375 Unique tastes. Well prepared. Not fancy food. More home cooking style (and I believe the food in street-food inspired which would make sense). I think we've tried everything on the menu. Everything is good with some standout dishes. 
25376 They are into my crap list because of a rude doorman who yelled my wife and made her cry. The manager did nothing about it. I won't go back to buy in that place full of douchebags. 
25377 Nice view and good Martinis. Taking off a star because the roof area conks be improved for sure 
25378 I've never had Vegan food this tasty. The shrimp po boy is a must have. The kale salad has a light dressing but it's just right. I'd become a vegan if I could afford to eat this every day. 
25379 Spaghetti it's okay. It's watery on sauce. Not impress. My boyfriend ordered Baked Ziti. He said it's okay. 
25380 Very Bad Experience. 3 hour wait. Worst part was that there were only 2 or 3 people waiting. The front desk staff kept changing out and getting my file misplaced. Awful. Won't come back. 
25381 the employee is bathing in the parking lot while his friend stands and smokes blowing it at everyones car.... 
25382 Pretty good pie for Conway! Will try again! 
25383 Nice counter lady. Easy parking. And a couple of cute girls were inside when I went in. All in all, a very good CVS experience. 
25384 Awesome place! Walked right in, they got the job done in less than an hour and even added a program to my phone to improve it! Nice, little joint for phone klutzes like me. 
25385 Why does it take 10 mins to make a bean and cheese burrito? My girlfriend got a chorizo burrito and threw up after eating it. Fuck this place. 
25386 Solid Thai choice. Definitely coming back to try more curry plates and dessert items. 
25387 Had a leg wax. Was not as painful as I expected. Their wax doesn't stick to your skin. Would definitely do it again. 
25388 I got the Pad Thai and it was absolutely terrible! It tasteded like noddles covered in hot sauce, but it didn't even have the slightest hint of spice or much flavor for that matter. I would never go here again! Beyond disappointed! 
25389 Waffles, fries, and beer. All Belgian and done right. Need I say more? 
25390 excellent food and service. reasonable prices: this place is a favorite for the whole family. fajitas are outstanding. 
25391 Amazing place. Best pedicure I have ever had. Highly recommended try this place. If you have time and are in the area please try this place out. 
25392 Best Macarons EVER! And the Lattes are great! Nothing else I've tried has really stood out to me as being that amazing. Stick to the macarons, they're outstanding. My favourite flavours? Cassis, LemonCherry & Lychee. 
25393 Amazing food with a variety of condiments to choose from! Also they had very clean bathrooms. Food took a bit of time but all in all worth the flavor. 
25394 Elise is amazing. Gave me an awesome haircut and is a really nice person. I'll definitely be coming back because of her. Thanks! 
25395 Unsung hero of Harvard square. Staff was completely accommodating to my dietary restrictions, our server sweet and attentive without being invasive. If you're keto or GF they have a naruto which is not featured on the menu but is available. 
25396 Is this place even still in business? Looks like it could possibly be closed. Went by at 2pm on a Wednesday and no one was there. 
25397 The Coop is great-- it's perfect to get school supplies and warm, basic clothes for myself and plenty of souvenirs for everyone in my family, who constantly want various types of Harvard memorabilia. 
25398 Decent Subway. Come in before the lunch rush and you will get super fast and attentive service. 
25399 I can't recommend them highly enough. I was in a bind. Called several electricians. They were the only ones to call me back, so that's something. They also talked me through what needed to be fixed over the phone! 
25400 Food delicious and refreshing! The service was awesome, gave suggestion and were observant. Go here for yummy ramen!! 
25401 We were really impressed with this stylish and tasty Avondale Estates option. We had the clams, the BLT and a couple of bourbon cocktails. Highly recommend the clams and the restaurant if you need a relaxing night out 
25402 If you like dumplings this is the place to go for sure! We take out frequently, the service is ehhh when you dine in.... but the dumplings are fantastic and the rest of the menu is decent! 
25403 Excellent service and food. Lots of it. The Crab Ragoon was the best I have ever had. 
25404 Service is what kills this place. WELCOME TO BOSTON I guess. Overall food was OKAY. I recommend going to the food court & find something to eat there. 
25405 Yes, the doughnuts are a bit expensive but I thought they were worth the price! The quality of the doughnuts are much better than Voodoo. The chocolate crunch was yummy and rich. The vegan options were also really well done and tasty. 
25406 Love this place. The staff is always so friendly. I typically get the cauliflower rice bowl with salmon and it is good. I tried the baked falafels tonight and they were really good. I would totally recommend this place. I have never been disappointed. 
25407 I give this place 5 stars for the atmosphere and wonderful customer service. We also didn't have to wait very long for our food. SN: This location has free parking and is located outside of Perimeter mall next to Urban Outfitters. 
25408 Fellini's is some of my favorite pizza in Atlanta. Nothing too fancy but always solid for pepperoni or white pizza and it's a good deal. It's worth eating here just for the creamy Italian dressing, it's so good. 
25409 What a train wreck. I almost got run over by a driver who was driving on the sidewalk as they were rushing to get to the valet. Sucky food. 
25410 They have the best meat sandwiches Ive ever tried! The line can be long but usually moves pretty fast. Everything here is clearly fresh and homemade. I do with they had a better vegetarian option for my friend who normally joins me for lunch. They definitely need more seating here! 
25411 Best Barvarim Cream Doughnut and Raspberry Bear Claw and customer service is outstanding. 
25412 Watch out~ some people snatch your phones and wallet while you are in dance! Make sure you take care about your stuff. Because i was witness people taking other peoples stuff! Lots of theft! 
25413 Seemed snobbish at first based on clientele, but the staff was accepting and acommodating of us in our post-run workout clothes. The coffee was excellent and the pastries were phenomenal. 
25414 Wow. What a perfect place for a meeting. Absolutely ideal - facilities top notch in every way, light, airy, drinks and snacks to sustain you, healthy lunch offerings. How could you not create here? Love it! 
25415 Very fun place. Just a cart on the sidewalk. We were in Vancouver seeing the sites and we were intrigued We were not disappointed We had the Beef Kobe Terimayo dog. It was very good and, served with a big smile. 
25416 Too dark and loud for starters. We stayed and ate. Service was OK. We all (3 of us) had something different. it's been a couple weeks and I honestly cannot even remember what we ate, but it was just so-so. The dessert was great tho! 
25417 My friends & I practically ordered everything off the menu because we wanted to try it all. All of the food that came out was AMAZING! Our favorite was the Cachapa. Service was great as well! Very quick & extremely friendly 
25418 Great burgers and fries. A bit on the pricey side. We had three burgers, one order of fries, three sodas, and a milkshake. About $43! Not something that I'd do every day - but very, very tasty! 
25419 Sublime for a quick fix of Japanese food. Casual take-out setting with some indoor/outdoor seating. For hot-food you have to order and wait, but there are plenty of sushi rolls already pre-packaged. 
25420 I wish DAT FIRE much success, they are in the right spot at the right time. The jerk, the rice, everything is on point. Blessings 
25421 Got the ribeye medium rare, blue cheese and creamy horseradish sauce, loaded potato - absolute perfection! 
25422 We ate there last night it was fresh and delicious. Everyone loved it -ages 8-52. They have fresh & awesome homemade lemon drinks. My son asked if we can go back today! He is jonesing for a lemon and strawberry dink. Dinner for 4 was only $30 with leftovers. 
25423 this has been my dunkins for awhile.I love it.Unlike other dds in waltham its fast friendly and clean and a bonus has three tables to sit at. and when i walk in they got my order down.. 
25424 Excellent staff if you just ask them what you need. Quality products. Can check ads online. Membership is lifetime and worth it! 
25425 The best high quality fresh cut meats and cheeses you will ever buy in Ohio. The price is also really cheap. 
25426 Wonderful experience from the first phone call of setting my appointment all the way to me saying yes to my dress! Sara and really the entire staff gave off such an incredible energy and have so many styles of dresses, you're bound to find what you'll love. 
25427 Awesome. Well priced, accurate quote, friendly staff, quick, experienced. Thanks to Jason and his crew for getting us from A to B in one piece. 
25428 Came by around 9:30 pm on a weekday, and all seats were full. The bbt was definitely one of the better I've had, and we did eventually get seats, but I wouldn't come back again except for grab-and-go. 
25429 The pepperoni on hand tossed crust was pretty good. I like how the pepperoni are small. However, the chicken spinach specialty pizza lacked flavor. The garlic butter dipping sauce was also flavorless. I guess we were expecting garlic dipping sauce from Papa John's. 
25430 The food is fresh and innovative. Completely comforting and there's something for everyone. The Seared Ahi starter is a must. The ahi was out of this world fresh and a really good grade. 
25431 Amazing food! Great service! We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and could not be happier with our night. Please request Matthew for your waiter - he is the best!!! 
25432 Delicious. Best Thai that I can remember eating in Austin and better than a lot of places in Dallas. Great service. 
25433 really good choice for a brunch, taste is good, enough portion, like the disk layout too. 
25434 The food is ok but they really need to focus on their customer service skills and food wait times. 
25435 Very sweet bartender, but the place smelled like vomit. If it wasn't within the hotel (with not much else around), I would've left. 
25436 Hard to beat the downtown convenience and speedy service of Gandhi's. The food is quite decent and two dishes over rice for $5.50 is a pretty large quantity. 
25437 Called Tommy yesterday in the afternoon. Came out the next morning and had the job done by 2:30pm. Highly entertaining character and ended up charging less than the quote... when does that happen? Recommending him for sure. 
25438 Cherrywood has solid food and a good beer selection. I enjoy many of their sandwiches and the tacos. It's also a great place to hang out and relax. On the negative, the service swings from Ok to just plain slow and bad. 
25439 The team here does a fantastic job. Amazing service, sushi and sake. They recommended some fantastic sake and sushi. The cocktails are also excellent. Probably the best sushi place in Boston 
25440 If you wanna take yo lady friend to a nice grub,this spot is the bees knees! Been here several times and the food is always legit. It's crowded on the weekends 
25441 The rainbow roll and seaweed salad are amazing. The rainbow had the perfect amount of roe and avocado, so creamy and delicious. This hole in the wall was difficult to find thanks to my maps app, but a quick call and here I was! 
25442 Same horrible experience as others. Totally unreliable and unprofessional Expect a no show! 
25443 Best sliced brisket you'll ever eat!! Order the sliced brisket sandwich and you will not be disappointed! 
25444 Entered the place. It smelled horrible (from their bathroom???). I ran away before they came to take our orders. 
25445 I would like to thank Roger M for the heads up that you can request better cuts of chicken in the dishes. We tried it again and substituted the regular chicken for the white meat chicken and were much more pleased. Thank you! 
25446 $4 for a donut inspired piece of art? No thank you. Different strokes for people with way too much disposable income and no sense of fiscal responsibility. Hey millennials--you're ruining our economy with your over willingness to pay unreasonably high prices for everyday items!!! 
25447 Went today and got the Surf & Turf burger. I will remember it as long as I live. It was mind blowing. The best burger I've eaten in my entire life!!! I highly recommend it!! 
25448 Solid Thai restaurant for takeout. Hands down much better than Little Duck over in Quincy Center. There really is no comparison. Here's a few of the tried and true dishes: Pad Thai Seafood or salmon in red or green curry Seafood Thai basil Pad see you Beef gra pow 
25449 Portion size is lacking unless you get a huge sandwich, which is disappointing given their high prices. Food is good, however, as is service. 
25450 The salmon croquettes were very good, I would order them again. The feel of the restaurant is soulful and casual. Great place to brunch and would definitely recommend this place! 
25451 Great location Terrible service Waited 30+ min to give order Food avg. nothing special Chilaquiles were good though Would not return :( 
25452 unique combination of burger and sushi but, not worth it for the money. too expensive 
25453 Front desk staff courteous and helpful. My therapist, Morgan was exceptional and has an amazingly relaxing touch. Highly recommended. 
25454 An Italian food place this time the pasta portion was perfect. It always tastes good. 
25455 This location is Peet's is large and warm and inviting. Staff is friendly and prices are what you'd expect at a place like this. The heart milk froth on my coffee was a nice touch. 
25456 Have probably been here 15-20 times and it never disappoints. Excellent food and plenty of different beers. Staff is extremely friendly and has a good atmosphere. You can't go wrong with going to Mystic. 
25457 They have closed the doors and building is for lease. :( The food was always simple and awesome. Great dive. 
25458 This place is THE BEST Asian fusion I've eaten in Boston. Every item was amazing in taste and presentation. Totally will come here and bring my guests here. 
25459 Very small, a little grimey but a decent enough college bar 
25460 Aircon not work well stuffy hot. Good WiFi, free. Since I'm a wifi whore, I'm bumping this up to a 3-star rating. 
25461 How is this a goodwill? Not only is it overpriced for a thrift store, but items are overpriced even if they were being sold at a regular store! $35 for a simple leather belt with no brand? I think no. 
25462 Very disappointed. Chicken & rapini stir fry was much too spicy and salty. The rapini had a bitter taste. The wok-charred oodon noodles was also much too spicy. Hardly ate any of the food and will not go back. 
25463 Service was very friendly.Tried the veal sweetbread, duck confit, and bouillabaisse. All 3 were excellent. Had a nice french cote du rhone wine that really reminded me of my trip in France! Definitely would recommend this restaurant to everyone. Price is very reasonable too. 
25464 Sat in the bar area good view 
25465 Great music awesome food. Our waiter Dave greatest waiter ever. And for the price well worth it. Red lobster needs a few lessons from these guys 
25466 Basically everything here is amazing. Awesome food and great wine selection. The curried mussels and mirch masala are two of my favorites (w/ garlic naan). But again, everything is outstanding. 
25467 Great for families, sufficient fast food italian food with fresh ingredients. Love the market. Never disappointed. 
25468 After having another Orlando installer botch up my 2017 Dodge Challenger Scat Pack, I brought to Orlando Tinting Services to have all paint protection and window tinting removed and re-installed. Like night and day. Gerald did an awesome job and his work is perfect. You get what you pay for. 
25469 What a bunch of talent-less hacks. Like many others I too spent the day working at home in the event this bozos would show up. Guess how the story ends? Got the refund from Groupon, but no phone-calls or letting me know the gig was off... 
25470 So the wife needed to eat so we come in, place is done up nice. This is probably the best looking qdoba I have been to. The staff was real friendly manager was really nice. Of course the food was delicious. 
25471 Some of the rudest staff I have ever experienced. Doughnuts aren't that great. Asked for a doughnut that was advertised in the display case and was asked what I was talking about. Oh well it's brand new. Not my fault you don't know your doughnuts. 
25472 Best views and and a great workout getting to the top. This is a "must visit often" Austin landmark. 
25473 A great experience!!! The meat sampler is a good choice to try different things. Everything was fresh and delicious. I recommend the homemade honey wine - not too sweet. Service was friendly and quick. 
25474 I didn't stay long, but the burger was awesome, and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Gave it the 5 stars mostly based on the hamburger...it was that good! 
25475 This is my home away from home!!! The staff is personable and nice!! WiFi. Close to home. Great selection. My go to for life!!! 
25476 This place is great. It is nice to find a hole in the wall place that is cheap and has great food. I got their chicken special which was marinaded chicken breast in an herb lemon sauce over rice. Had it with a date and rose water drink. very nice. 
25477 It's not just a coffee joint, it's an experience. Vacuum pot coffee is a production. Go!!!!!!!! 
25478 Stopped in for lunch after a walk around the Freedom trail. A very nice surprise to find out about the history of the building itself. Burgers we had were good and another had a salad. Loved the roasted garlic mustard on the table. 
25479 Go here for the clearance rack. The plain Life brand scrubs are at a decent price and fit well. Otherwise this place is over priced. 
25480 We have used other pest control companies over the years, but these guys are the best - hands down. Service is prompt, professional and cost effective. They make us feel like their most important client - or their only client. Thanks to Brandon and the Interstate Crew! 
25481 The bar is awesome!!!! Always get there with friends. The environment is cozy n relaxing. The live band was cool as well. Pretty love the old fashioned style. 
25482 Service was good... BUT unlimited pasta bowls are sooo not worth it... They are not very flavorful... I can make way better pasta at home! Lol... But at least I got two bowls of my favorite soup... Zuppa Tuscana!! And the breadsticks... Those are always yummy... 
25483 I liked the barbecued chicken.. it's a bar with a choice of barbecue.. the spinach was the best mix of cheese and spinach I've ever had. I also thought the chips and queso were really tasty.. nice bar scene..I'd come again! This is Stubbs Barbecue.. 
25484 I'm a big fan, this is their newest location, with the same variety of supplements, vitamins and great stuff. If you are looking for reasonably priced supplements with a loyalty program that essentially gives you 10% back this is the place. All major credit cards accepted and friendly knowledgeable staff. 
25485 Love the food+ the service, they always do such a great job decorating for the holidays!! 
25486 Great coffee house ambience. Parking is a bit of a struggle...need more spaces. However, the coffee experience is worth it. Definitely go with the Moon Milk in the coffee--awesome! 
25487 My family and I was at this location for my sister birthday and it was terrible Jason was our waiter rude inconsiderate and untenanted the food was amazing other than that it was good 
25488 It wasn't the best wasn't the worst. There's a laundry mat across the street I "occasionally" do my laundry at. Therefore I may go there occasionally, but not likely. A+ service but that only helps so much. 
25489 Disappointing! Their whole concept sounds really appealing. The experience was not! My salad had so many wilted leafs- I ended up sorting through my entire salad. It was gross. My husband said the pizza was alright. 
25490 Hot, quick, and flavorful, what more do you want with your Wednesday lunch, or football pregame with friends 
25491 Not impressed. Went for the fried chicken. I found it bland and nothing special. Veggie sides were canned grossness. Id rather have Bojangles. The atmosphere was very unappealing. Sticky floors and table mats. 
25492 This is the place you come to try new Thai dishes because you know it'll be delicious! Staff was super friendly and attentive. We tried 2 new dishes which we couldn't stop eating. Very reasonably priced too. Highly recommended! 
25493 very good thai. i tried the salad roll, house special curry with tofu (awesome red curry/peanut dish loaded with vegetables), and the ginger lovely (wonderful tofu/mushroom dish). all wonderful as were the drinks. 
25494 Hands down best bar in austin, this place knows how to do it. Great music, great people, great drinks 
25495 Good quality, affordable, men's hair cuts. What more can one ask for? 
25496 Friday nights there are quite fun if you are looking for some great salsa music and dancing. The atmosphere is great and lively. Food is not bad but it arrived at our table cold. Drinks are ok, it all depends on who's pouring. We will definitely go back. 
25497 $12 for eyebrows, $8 for upper lip threading Overall, loved the place. Very clean and professional. The lady took her time and paid attention to detail which is always very appreciated when it comes to that kind of stuff. Will definitely come back. 
25498 I went to Stephanie for the first time! She was excellent!!! This is the third time I've been to Hush and each time has been great!! The staff is very attentive and I highly recommend them. I plan to stop by again when I'm back in Atlanta. 
25499 Leslie was great! She took my concept (a tribute to my dog) and made a beautiful design out of it. The price was very reasonable and the atmosphere was very friendly. 
25500 I called yesterday to see if they had an item that was no longer available in my size online... They did! And within 24 hours they shipped the item to my house! Excellent customer service!!! 
25501 Wow, food truck goes to store front. Simple menu, quality food and expeditious service! If looking g for quick and good, check them out. 
25502 I have tried at least a dozen nail salons and have finally found one that it clean, comfortable with great service. Tu, the owner, is wonderful. Highly recommend. 
25503 Went there yesterday. Food and atomspher is good. A little pricey but they did mentioned the price first, so u can take it or leave it. I would recommend mussel, crab & lobster plate, share lobster roll(two people) sweet potato fries. Awesome! 
25504 This is a fun concept and really appealing. I liked tasting all of the flavors and the service was excellent. However, a cup of cookie dough was just too much and I didn't eat it all. It's fun, but not as exciting as it sounds. 
25505 Good food and great prices. Huge portions. Good services also. Will come back. I ordered grill shrimp with noddles and a thai tea. My hubby ordered cube beef with rice and spring rolls. Everything was delicious. 
25506 He didn't fix my washing machine, instead of making a service call he told me how to do it myself over the phone. I will be calling him next time something breaks. 
25507 Just spent three hours in Jina's chair with high hopes that she could do something spectacular with my mop hair. She seriously exceeded my hopes and created magazine perfect hair. I sure feel like a super model ready to flaunt this beautiful hair!! Thank you Jina! 
25508 My gripe is that this is a very meat-heavy menu. Not even one pasta dish on the lunch menu was vegetarian! 
25509 Fantastic service and honest folks. That's why I'm sticking with Dave's. Why settle for less than the ultimate experience? 
25510 Only tried the vegetable samosa, which were cheap and very tasty. Came with generous portions of three kinds of condiments. I know that other Yelpers have complained about the cleanliness but it looked clean to me. 
25511 Just the worst. Always takes several days to get your meds. Staff is not helpful. Tell you to request refills using the Walmart app and it NEVER works. Ugh. Wish this wasn't the closest pharmacy to where I live. 
25512 Absolutely delicious! Very low key, but cleans, simple, and to the point. I tried the salmon and it was delicious, very flavorful. My friend got the Kafta and is very satisfied. Definitely recommend! 
25513 Delicious food and fantastic drinks in an unassuming strip mall. Homemade sangria was a wonderful treat. We have been back again and plan on many more dinners here! 
25514 Order the Shrimp & Grits. That is all I have to say. Order the Shrimp & Grits. Most amazing shrimp and grits I have EVER had. Service, slow, but very kind and funny. Wine selection is phenomenal. Just order the Shrimp & Grits!!!! 
25515 I almost had an orgasm from how good the service was, and then I did have one when I drank the juice. Thanks ester, domino, and hunter. 
25516 Love this place! Great value and excellent service. Hot stone during pedi plus a shoulder massage after mani or pedi while drying. 
25517 Our breakfast was absolutely amazing and the staff was very helpful and fun. It was helpful that they had crepes for kids too! 
25518 Just tried this place and it was great. Pork tenderloin was moist and flavorful. My wife had the turkey tips and they were grilled perfectly. Service was great. Our waiter Mike was very attentive. Would definitely go again. 
25519 Such a great place!! Love the theming and the variety of ice cream! We will be back!! 
25520 The place was really weird inside and out. Like, not complete looking? The server was polite but obviously didn't want to be there. The main dishes we had were a solid three, and I'm pretty easy to please. The starters were inedible. 
25521 No too bad. Service was quick and courteous. The food is flavourful. Will come back to try other things. 
25522 This restaurant was recommended to us by friends, and their recommendation was well-deserved. Excellent food, extensive menu options, reasonable pricing, large portions, and great service left us well-pleased with our choice. We will definitely return anytime we are driving in the area. 
25523 The portion sizes for lunch are smallish and while the food is reasonably good it is not something I would bother returning for. The turkey lasagna was pretty much the same as the vegetarian from what I can tell, nearly meat free. The pizza was bland and not very appealing. 
25524 Generous servings. Loved the Caesar salad and veal Marsala. Get there before 7pm, since kitchen closes at 7:30pm 
25525 Great scene! Bartender is friendly and an interesting guy. Good for dancing and meeting friends. 
25526 Dave does good work, doesnt rush and really tries to make you look good. I have curly unruly hair and is really difficult to get right.. I had my hair cut by 2 women there and had to go back and have him fix it. Request Dave, seriously 
25527 Awesome place to visit! Great selection of craft beers, and the daily tastings are great! To top it off, the employees are so helpful and personable, you can tell they love their job. I wish they had a nice big parking lot so I could visit often. 
25528 Bummer. I was very disappointed. So I finally stopped in for take out. I got the fried haddock sandwich with fries. The fries were frozen and greasy.. The haddock sandwich was not good. Tasted very fishy and frozen. I had such high hopes their take out would be good. 
25529 Had the homemade corned beef hash, poached eggs & GF toast. It was amazing!! There was a minor problem with eggs overcooked. They made me a while new plate and it was perfect. The corned beef hash is the best I've ever had! Will be back for sure!! 
25530 Andre is the best waiter ever! My husband, children, and I love him! Oh, and the food is great too, of course. 
25531 Great experience and amazing staff. Shared a full flight tasting with the boyfriend, and was walked through all the flavors and styles patiently. We even came in towards the end of the day, and didn't feel rushed or anything. Fun place to visit and easy to get to. 
25532 Always impressed by the taste. Fitfit is a must have. They have one of the best enjira around here... Serving lady is very nice and polite. Ambience can be improved but food takes precedence for me. 
25533 So, our two-hour fight back to Burbank was delayed FOUR hours. Not much explanation and no apology. Nicely done, Alaska. 
25534 Food has gone way downhill, used to love the food here now they have raised prices twice and the food is awful now, look at the size of that pork belly! 
25535 This is our favorite sushi spot in North Austin. Barely ever have to wait for a table, the waitstaff is super friendly, and the food is wonderful. Our favorites include the mushroom soup, Shaggy Dog roll, Spicy Scallop, and the Longhorn. The desserts are great too! 
25536 Even the vegan crackers were delicious and we are no vegans. Everything was a delight- food, music and quite the ambiance for a food truck! Pickled veggies a must and I hate sardines but the sardine p√¢t√© my husband ordered was to die for. 
25537 Very cool vibe and drinks are so so. The bartenders a bit much for me because he was very intense in his drink making, but that's just me. I think he needs to lighten up a bit:) 
25538 What a yummy burger, friendly staff, terrific food, clean location-this location in Natick is consistently good. Only suggestion would be different music, however that would never prevent me from eating here! 
25539 Great sandwich on a super cold rainy Vancouver day! Got the buffalo chicken and it was legit, so tasty and tender. 
25540 I highly recommend this place for weekend brunch. If you don't know, the menu is seasonal & constantly changing. This weekends poached eggs in nettle sauce, cauliflower salad, lentils w/ chorizo, potato & parsnip gratin, & chard were all made to perfection. Left us in tears of happiness! 
25541 It is just not my style of services and decoration. Getting out of parking is difficult. 
25542 Second time here..I have to say it is becoming my favorite local Mexican place. Food is consistently good, great margaritas, etc. This time, they made a slight error in our order, but fixed it instantly without question. Definite high recommendation. 
25543 Dont bother going to voodoo, just come here instead. They have such unique flavors and everything is so fresh. Oh, and try their cold brew too! 
25544 These guys did such a great job on my car! Only paid 14.99 for the green wash and they cleaned and wiped down every inch of my car. Will definitely be returning and I highly recommend. Very impressed. 
25545 some cool animals I have never seen before up close; sea otter, beluga whale, etc. Monterrey is better in my opinion though. 
25546 Had a set of blinds done here in 2008 and one of them took a beating from various kids and other miscreants. Bolliger's fixed everything like new for a song. It was fun to watch--these people care about blinds! 
25547 The desserts are inconsistent. Some are great and some are mediocre at best. They are way to pricey considering the inconsistency. The place always feels dirty to me-like it hasn't been thoroughly cleaned since the 80's. 
25548 Staff was unattentive. Didn't seem happy to be there... Only stayed for 1 run of laser tag because atmosphere did not seem friendly. Would of stayed for more (and spent more $$,) but just didn't feel 'fun'. Too bad, I was with a group of 15+. 
25549 Worst place to get service. There were two waiters and 6 people at the bar and it took 25 min to take our food order. Then the server rolled her eyes at me because I was annoyed at how long it took to order a burger. Awful! 
25550 We ordered fish and chip. friend were dry...i had to send it back...the fish and chips...more batter than fish..bit disappointed as I have been going to whitespot for 35 years plus.. bill for $50. was a terrible dining experience........i am now jaded here... 
25551 Chocolate. Nuff said. But since that's not enough words for a review. Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Vanilla, chocolate, chocolate, strawberry, chocolate, chocolate, and other flavors associated with chocolates. 
25552 Had to listen to the employees phone while wait for my food. Looked like the manager just sitting there although can't be sure 
25553 The staff were extremely attentive and helpful. My boyfriend works in Austin and swears by Lavazza's iced coffee. My friends and I visited him and we had lattes, the quiche and hazelnut crossaints. The Italian Wedding Cookies are also incredible. 
25554 Denmark charged me $14 for a shot of Fernet. You can get 10 shots of Fernet in the country of Denmark for $14. Not sure what this bar is trying to pull, but it's way out of touch. And its name makes absolutely no sense. Nothing Danish about this place. 
25555 Excellent track sushi.. Don't let the term "track" dissuade you. Jay and his crew do an excellent job creating tantalizing dishes that are sure to please. Sushi is always fresh and flavorable. An excellent value for your money. Great place to take your children too. Very friendly. 
25556 Service was amazing, tapas were really great but super small for the prices, also had a seafood pallela which we did not care for and sent back. The owner was accommodating and professional, I would recommend this place for drinks and tapas anytime. 
25557 Very good Local Grocery Store with nice choice of fresh produce and grocery items and some frozen food thrown into the mix. Staff are friendly and helpful and tend to stick around for a while 
25558 Love going here to get my stand-up-paddling on. Have never had an issue with the service here and I've never had to wait to get a board. Carpool if you can b/c parking isn't always easy. Get to look cool while exercising? Shoot, what else does a girl need? 
25559 Good food spoiled by incredibly slow service. Overpriced. Sketchy street life outside. 
25560 A solid bar on 21st with a pretty good food menu. It's definitely worth a visit if you frequent the area. One draw back is that there are only a couple booths for four. Most are just two seaters. 
25561 This place is so good! Poutine was amazing. Jon had the Hollywood burger and declared it his new favorite. The Bacon- Brussels sprouts were definitely worth trying. We will be back. 
25562 A bit greasy, but inexpensive & open 24 hours. Is anything else 24 hours in Boulder anymore. It's exactly what you remember Denny's to be. 
25563 Our reservation was refused. Very odd. I've eaten dinner there in the past, good dinner. I remember a friendly, knowledgeable staff. Not tonight. Quite rude. 
25564 This place was amazing. Super fun. Went with a group (5 people total). Scorpion bowl was delicious, and food was super fun. It's a bit chaotic organizing food and cooking everything, but I think that was part of the fun. Super tasty, and the szechuan was quite spicy! 
25565 We didn't call for a reservation in advance which was a poor mistake. For a table if two, we ended up waiting an hour and a half, but it was still so worth it. The food was absolutely amazing and the service was superb 
25566 I think some of the clothes are kind of played out, but then again some are very cute and fresh. GREAT FOR: they have a lot of dresses which is always convenient. 
25567 I have been coming to this place over 10 years, since they were at the little place. It has the best sushi around. Good price, great food. 
25568 Extremely nice people, thorough so I always get exactly what I order. The food is extremely good. The prices are great. This place is awesome. 
25569 Mine and my hubby's favorite breakfast spot.. Never fails and huge portions! Service has usually been pretty good not complaints! 
25570 i love kayaking and sailing there. it's very fun, but watch out the duck tours, sometimes they get to close. 
25571 Quick service, crisp tasty pizza for a reasonable price. Definitely coming back when I'm in town! 
25572 Great date spot with friendly staff, tasty wine and tapas. 
25573 Hands down the BEST corner store in Austin. Tired of your boring variety of sodas and beers? Go to Live Oak Market! They have amazing selections of sodas/beers/juices you've never even heard of before! LOVE IT! 
25574 Great service , clean , inviting. Delish drinks , yummy burgers this place is wicked pissah ! 
25575 Terrible meal. Droopy microwaved pita, tasteless gyro meat. Nothing like the Med Grill on N Decatur. Should be ashamed to serve food like this. 
25576 Vary tasty menu. Great place to walk around and enjoy. Lots of people. Lots of options to either sit inside or outside. Outside is great for the kids when it's warm because of the water fountains to play in. 
25577 One of the most beautiful Furniture Galleries in Central Florida. I would highly recommend using the In-Home Design service which is basically free interior designing. The staff was helpful, knowledgeable, but not pushy which was a plus! 
25578 Great gym! The people are friendly and the gym is clean. Not overly crowded and the hours are super convenient. Very sad to be leaving town and find another gym. I hope it compares to Liv Fitness. 
25579 I've been hearing about Ethiopian food lately so I had to try. Well, it's really good. Desta gave us a pleasant experience 
25580 Nice servers, good environment and the food was delicious. We had the vegetarian combo and the fish dulete. We definitely will be back! 
25581 Would have given a different grade but "the system" that processes their gift cards "is down." 
25582 I concur... Watered down mango beverage...better off drinking from the mall water fountain. Sample before you pay is my warning to future customers. First and LAST visit to this "watering" hole. 
25583 Loved my experience at the store. The owners are knowledgable and very patient. Their products are top of the line and discounted!! I can' believe I found philosophy discounted!!! Love this store. 
25584 Solid food and service; the new dessert menu is fantastic and great for the cooler weather. The Polenta cake is a must have, and so is the corn chowder. 
25585 Good waffles! They have breakfast combos I wouldn't have thought of myself- bacon, Brie, and basil! 
25586 Great food, customer service, and excellent margaritas. Get to this spot soon. I can't wait until Cinco de Mayo 
25587 Went to the bar for a quick drink and bite. Service was slow and painful. Never did get to order food. With all the good places nearby they should at least try. 
25588 Poorly run, often without all ingredients, and always a half hour to get through the line. Parking is terrible. 
25589 I love this place! The coffee is perfectly made and the pain au chocolat is delicious. The atmosphere is super cool too. It is always busy and finding a table can be a challenge 
25590 Great Beers and Great Concept, ruined by the staff, who was pretty UNFRIENDLY. Too Bad. There are a lot more locations. Sad as this is the closest location to my house. 
25591 Nachos... best in Portland! One order EASILY serves two. Roasted jalopenos are pretty tasty as well. Both red and white sangria are nice. Sitting outside on a summer day is great or inside by an open wall Fireplace bar is comfy as well 
25592 Ryan is a great aesthetician at the capital of Texas highway location. At Face to Face Spa, they do a lot in the one hour. Face looks younger and smoother. 
25593 Great place for some awesome and a unique coffee taste. I would give it 5 stars if they were not always out of the burritos that are delicious as well. Staff is also friendly, I would definitely recommend! 
25594 A great place for a quick dinner or lunch in Beverly, especially on a nice day, when you can sit at their little tables outside. The vegetarians options are great, and the Lime chicken is one of my favorites. 
25595 Service was great. Prices were very reasonable for seafood. Selection was good. Portion sizes were above average. Over all a great experience. We went around 4:30 on a Saturday and we were seated without a wait. Very friendly and attentive staff. Will definitely go back! 
25596 Cozy and cute! Also amazingly cheap and it was delicious. There was a tonne of variety and also and their rolls were refreshing and the miso soup was great. I will definitely keep coming back! 
25597 The. Best. Neighborhood. Bar. It's a true gem, with a great beer selection, wonderful ambience, and the friendliest owner you'll ever meet. Great place to watch the blazers (happy hour while they lead), peruse old records, and shop some vintage goodies. 
25598 Great place, food was fantastic, our server Christian was very attentive and pleasant. Service was quick. If you like watching sports this is the place for you! 
25599 Just paid my first visit to the Crepevine. Had a great breakfast crepe - super service and the place was spotless. 5 Stars 
25600 I ordered the combo plate with a shredded chicken taco and beef enchilada. I enjoyed every bite, and the cashier was very friendly. Definitely going back soon! 
25601 Joey is the best and my cut grows out evenly and each day is like a new style. Highly recommend him! 
25602 Not a bad place to eat, but it's nothing spectacular either. They get a lot of business during game season, when there's a big crowd trying to catch dinner before, during, or after games. 
25603 They are always so friendly and remember us every time we come in. Food is fresh and made with love. 
25604 I've long hunted for a Turkish d√∂ner kebab food cart in Portland, and I'm so glad I found Kelvin's! Great spices, seeded poker bread that is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, good meats and toppings. Worth a try for sure! 
25605 Wow pizza is awesome!! Makes up for the unfriendly woman answering the phone 
25606 Quaint, good service, great food, great atmosphere and not too loud. This place is quite the hidden gem. 
25607 This is a really nice place to get coffee, or to hang out with friends. It's a nice environment, with helpful, friendly employees. Although the coffee could be sweeter for my taste, overall it's good quality. Great place, with great people! 
25608 Been here a couple of times. Decent filipino food with a mix of chinese good. 
25609 Reliable Thai takeout, and a pleasant casual place to eat in. 
25610 Nice happy hour, great food, great service, and the best alcohol selection you can hope for they have their own and then a relationship with Roscoe's next door...very unique in that respect. 
25611 I ordered the Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs and they were completely inedible. I tried to eat a couple and they were simply deep fried breaded pork bones. They looked like General Tso Chicken pieces without any meat on them. 
25612 The tacos were very authentic and delicious. The service was top notch. Instantly one of the best tacos in Orlando. 
25613 Food is great! Had the stew and jerk chicken. Both were delicious. Jerk chicken was so moist, not dry like other places I have been to. Def will come back. 
25614 Not good customer service, which is something not expected from such a joint. Food is ok. Overall not worth visiting there. I would rather go to Yard House next door or Kings Bowling or Wagamama insead in the Market street area. 
25615 Not a fan of the customer service here at all. Especially when one cashier (anita) states to the cashier I'm at that my items are old, contact a manager & give lowest prices. Purchased (10/18/2015) in the saugus store. Never going in here again!!!! 
25616 Stellar restaurant, great food, great vibe and friendly staff. Would come here again definitely. 
25617 I love this place! My bestie and I have been here 4 times since it's opened! We have never been disappointed. Our favorite is the nachos! I'm not even vegan, and I find myself craving their food! Also the staff is amazing and super friendly! I can't recommend it enough! 
25618 There are no words to describe Hopdoddy because it's in such an awesome category of its own. Every single time I come here, it never disappoints. My favorites are of course the parmesan truffle fries & the red velvet milkshake. As for the burger, I love all of them! 
25619 We were able to put our number in and go have a drink while we waited for a table on a weekend night. Funky/nerdy vibe with tons of memorabilia everywhere and some custom drinks with dry ice in them. Food was decent, service was good. 
25620 Had a wonderful experience! It wasn't busy at all. We got two pedicures 60 and 1 overlay 20 with eye brow wax 7. The place is super cute and very friendly staff 
25621 Good service. Nice folks working. Fast service. Decent prices. 
25622 Food was fantastic!!! My daughters and I loved it and the staff were very friendly and attentive!!! 
25623 Super good! Nothing goes better with a chicken sandwich like a couple of pot stickers. Hot sauce added to it compliments the sandwich and isn't overwhelming to the avocado spread. Mr Miyagi would be proud of his chicken sandwich. 
25624 Huge selection of fresh seafood, friendly and prompt service. I really enjoyed the fried clams, fresh, juicy and exactly what i was looking for. Great for families and lots of room for last minute dinners. 
25625 Amazing food!!! I had the burger and my coworkers ordered other items off the menu. Everything was so delicious I can't even put it in words. You will not regret the decision to eat here. Oh and the atmosphere is beautiful! 
25626 Fantastic! The meat substitutes tasted very much like the real thing, and the flavors throughout the meal were delicious. We will definitely be going back. 
25627 Brian, at Hair Sense, is a great hair artist. He's low key and polite and very easy to work with. He has a great technique for cutting hair. It's the first time I've enjoyed my cut for a very long time. I will return to him for my next cut. 
25628 This place was decent. Lots of options and huge portions. Quality food, but eventually the cheese got a bit sticky at the end. I liked trying this place, but I probably wouldn't eat here a second time. 
25629 Do not go there early. They are supposed to open at 9am on Saturday. I waited outside till 917am. Still closed. 
25630 The service is a little slow but the food more than makes up for it though. I'm so happy when I leave, I forget how long it took to get the food. Be sure to order an appetizer while you wait. 
25631 I have used MIphone doctor on two occasions - once for a cracked screen and another time to purchase a new iphone battery. Leon is friendly and professional and he works quickly. Also the prices are very reasonable. 
25632 Should you cross the threshold you'll quickly find out that the staff do not want to be inconvenienced with your presence. While being rude they will also make you the blandest cup of lukewarm coffee that they can cobble together in the agonisingly long wait you'll be subjected to. 
25633 Stromboli is excellent and I mean excellent and the pizza is the best I've had in Florida hands down! Get the Calabria special! Great place 
25634 Raspberry Rosemary, so good! Cute little shop, surprisingly helpful staff even though they're super busy. 
25635 Best food hands down. Everything was delicious. Barbacoa and chilaquiles with chicken two eggs over was just delicious. Ordered an enchilada on the side to try and it was just bomb! Coffee has free refills and the restaurant was super clean! 
25636 The Burgers are mostly good. We informed them that the lemonade was out waited for them to change it but we were finished eating and it was still not changed. 
25637 The Wiener Wagon has never failed for over 30 years. Used to go there with my Dad. Brings back many a fond memory. Love this original food cart. 
25638 Amazing staff serving the best meats and lunches to go! There is no better place to go for a quick and delicious meal, the butchers have never steered me wrong picking out roasts or giving me suggestions on ways to prepare it. A true gem for the south shore! 
25639 It's a cute little shop with a nice vibe. Awesome selection of coffee flavors - I ordered a samoa cookie coffee and it was delicious! 
25640 Very friendly staff and very large shop! A lot of people but they helped us in less than ten minutes! They put on a screen protector perfectly in less than a minute! Love apple 
25641 The hometown diner of your dreams. Love the Spanish omelet for breakfast or one of their great burgers for lunch. Hand cut fries and house made potato chips served warm and fresh from the fryer. Perfect. 
25642 The lunch combo (1/2 sandwich + soup + salad) is a great value and is delish!! 
25643 Please see attached photos; thanks JN Phillips for leaving my car a mess ! Not professional ! 
25644 Very friendly baristas (I've been 3 times and they already remembered my drink!), delicious pastries, and a clean, chill atmosphere! 
25645 great sauce, not to heavy of a dish... really great combination! 
25646 Great place to stop for a bite while doing the Freedom Trail. Portions were good. After all I would recommend it since it fits the historic feel of the day. 
25647 Didn't have tofu even tho it's on the menu. Good place for vegan/vegetarian to eat at. I got the veggie burrito in a bowl and it was pretty good. Friendly staff. 
25648 Food and great and we'll priced and almost no wait. They place is a gem and a total must go. If you near and the place across the road has an hour wait save yourself the time and just go across the street. 
25649 Jeff makes it fresh and plentiful. ( I get the shrimp/pork wonton) Comfortable any day...but great on wintery days. I try to visit every two weeks. 
25650 Love this place, it's our go to in the Revere area!!! Honestly eat here once a week, great food every time. 
25651 Went for lunch today. I had the Kung-Pao Chicken, Spring Roll & Hot & Sour Soup. Food was excellent, served quickly, and my water glass was never empty. $10 easily covered the meal and tip. Great Value for lunch. 
25652 Love this place! A quick brunch stop or after dinner snack if you get a sweet waffle. I tend to stick to "the whole farm" which is bacon and goat cheese over saut√©ed veggies! Mmm. 
25653 Eric was very friendly and professional, and provided great service! He kept in contact with me throughout and answered all of my questions. I definitely recommend Pillar to Post! 
25654 Worst place ever, please be cautious. Worst costumer service I ever seen. Doctors are not to friendly, rough and careless, wont use it anymore and DBPR should check this place. 
25655 If you want fresh seafood, This is the place to eat. Employees are extremely nice and service is quick.. Food is hot, and delicious. Dessert on the other hand is a pass. I would definitely visit again. 
25656 I love the food at Panera but the service is horrificly slow. When a line is out the door, put more than 1 person at the register. This is a consistent issue at this Panera. It csnt be that complicated. Its lunch time for goodness sake! 
25657 Pizza was very good but a bit over cooked. Nachos not so much. Loud atmosphere geared to a younger crowd. Was very pleasant though after an evening in hot Fenway. 
25658 The almond meal waffles at this place are almost impossible to stop eating. I also like the pesto scramble and the smoothies. 
25659 Ray and his team did an amazing job and worked their tails off for 18 hours including helping to pack. They were quick but careful and I would be happy to use them again in the future. Sandy at customer service is persistent, friendly and polite. A five star experience. 
25660 Delivery pizza was good. It was amazingly quick for a Saturday. Much better than others I have tried. It arrived hot and delivery man was very nice. Bye bye Austin pizza. 
25661 Bad waiting time we were kept waiting for 1:45 hrs not worth go to Mass next door 
25662 Trust me this is overrated 
25663 Great customer service!!! I now save $$$$$$ with the heating & cooling thermostat... Please read the contract thoroughly though! After 172 odd days, it's an additional cost for a technician to come out. Please be aware!!!!!!! 
25664 This place is amazing! I'm not typically a waffle person. But these waffles are magical. Everything on the Farm is the best. It's the first waffle I ever had here, and I'm never ordering something different. It's that good. 
25665 Had some DEE-LICIOUS BBQ catered by Hottie Hawgs for our Memorial Day party! Everyone loved it and ate every last bit. I would highly recommend them! 
25666 First pair of boots. Staff helped me through the whole process. Went on a Saturday and store was empty. Definitely excited to break these boots in. 
25667 they're playing the who, have a store copy of the nytimes and good coffee so I'm moving in. 
25668 Enchiladas were good, strong margaritas.... the churros SUCKED!!! They don't have anything to do with the original Mexican churros. 
25669 I ate here 4 times in my week in Portland. Partly because it was across the street from my friend's house but mostly because it was really good. The oatmeal pancakes were really really good. And the short stack is still huge. Their organic syrups are super amazing. 
25670 My boyfriend always brings his suits and pants here, they always do a wonderful job and at a reasonable price and time. Highly recommend them! There's always street parking which is a big plus. Will certainly be coming back for our future cleaning needs. 
25671 Great tavern, great bartenders, the best poured guiness I've had in many years. Skip the burgers, though, as they seemed pre-made. Maybe should have known better and gotten some traditional irish food here - see other reviews. 
25672 Very pleased. Service was awesome, she took her time explaining the menu and what she referred and what we had to try since it was our first time there. Which were the beignets and she was right! AMAZINGLY melt in your mouth. 
25673 Their deli sandwiches are delicious and i love their paninis. Also the delivery is very convenient being a college student without a car. Personally my go-to order in spot for hungover sundays. 
25674 On a pricey side, but totally worth it! The presentation of the food as well as quality and flavors were amazing. Will definitely be back if enroute through Atlanta again! 
25675 Really enjoyed dinner with the family on the pool deck. The bruschetta was an excellent starter and we all liked our pizza choices: mozzarella, Americano and Margherita. The restaurant and Magic Village Resort are very new and modern. Highly recommended! 
25676 Try the gyro plate! It's sooooo good. I love this convenient food truck. So glad it's in my hood. The owners are super sweet and friendly too. 
25677 Second Best burrito in the city (love El Pelon). They set themselves apart by making their own salsas. Prices are great, service is cool. Can't beat Amelia's 
25678 Affordable foot reflexology Im in love! 
25679 Good donuts loved the Creme br√ªl√©e donut but a little disappointed with the maple bacon it was only ok. 
25680 I'm a fan of any business whose feeding consumers healthy alternative foods. If you're ever looking for some really good Raw Desserts, checkout Simply Pure Foods. They're the specialty Company offering raw desserts at Sweet Tooth's Dessert Bar. The Selection is Yummy! 
25681 It was fast to get in. They have plenty of seating but the food was just okay and not hot. Also the music was so loud that the waitress couldn't here a word we were saying. We had to yell to talk to each other! 
25682 The veggie burrito was FULL of veggies including avocado, not just the usual rice and beans. Nothing fancy, just really tasty tex-mex and friendly service. Walking distance from Universal entrance. 
25683 If you're looking for real Japanese food, this place is for you! Reasonable price, great service, amazing food!! I will definitely come back. :) I had Okonomiyaki and pork cutlet beef curry, both were amazing! 
25684 2 hours and 45 minutes later, we are still waiting for our order to be delivered. Can't phone them either, just a busy signal for the past hour. Never experienced anything like this before, won't be dealing with these guys ever again. 
25685 Consistently good food and service. Fairly expensive but worth it! 
25686 Great food 
25687 Terrible service 
25688 Server forgot drinks and appetizers and did not acknowledge us , would drop things off and leave quickly before we could say anything 
25689 Might come back because the food was good 
25690 Maybe 
25691 Delicious breakfast! Stopped here on our way to the Capitol and what a pleasant surprise. Actually a little hidden gem! Very friendly waiter. Food was flavorful and abundant. All staff were on their toes helping each other out which I thought was fantastic. 
25692 $8 chicken shawarma in pita 
25693 Ick 
25694 Pita bread tasted like cheap generic brand 
25695 Chicken so salty that i could not eat it. Very disappointed 
25696 We came for the vegan oil-free buffet organized by ATX Alive and it was so good. I loved all the food and am amazingly grateful to Aster for making everything that night for our group. I can't wait to go back for another event there! 
25697 They serve up a damn good oyster po boy sandwich.... Fritters are a nice touch, but prefer my sweets at the end of a meal. Good place to stop for meal after a day at the beach. 
25698 I was turned away at 7:15. If you stop accepting patients at a certain time, have it written somewhere on your website. But 45 minutes before closing seems ridiculous to me. I don't know how you can turn a sick person away 45 minutes early. 
25699 One word would work: amazing. Super cute cart, really fast and friendly service, and most importantly; perfect cheesy deliciousness! Can't wait to go back...mmm... 
25700 We got drinks at the bar the bartender was funny and helpful I hope to go back soon! 
25701 This was my first Ramen bar ever and it was wonderful! The environment is really chill & relaxing, the food tastes great and our server Jennifer was so sweet! I did the build your own ramen and the prices weren't bad at all. 
25702 The BEST pizza that I have ever tasted!!!!! This is authentic Napolitan pizza, and I have to say that it even tastes better than the pizza that I ate in Naples. Oh, and the other food, environment, and staff is amazing as well :) 
25703 Wonderful service, but portion are small and a bit pricey since the portion is small. I had chiken karaage but it was slightly smell. I would rather go other places for sushi. 
25704 interior and decor are super cute!!!! so many photo ops. but this is the type of place you only visit once. the drinks are so, so expensive. haven't tried the food but the drinks are definitely not worth it. over $6 for a milk tea? no thank you.. 
25705 Four good options. The spicy selection wasn't very spicy, but there was chili oil on the table. The noodles were really good. The 'Japanese Chicken' was raw in the middle and had to be sent back. The vegan ramen was wonderful. Service was polite and quick. 
25706 Always enjoy a solid treat form Thierry's. Would recommend the pain du jambon. Also had the usual stuff such as the half dozen macarons and a bunch of cakes. You really can't go wrong with anything the serve. 
25707 David was great. He took care of the issue on same day and was very professional and efficient. ` 
25708 Bought a guitar there - no hassle, a week to return if needed. Choice wasn't that great but the guitar (a black Epiphone acoustic) was perfect for my highschooler, and cheap! Just did a good cleaning / waxing / stringing - and that was that! 
25709 What a clean and beautiful place. Popped in on a Friday night with my daughter. They have special pricing for 12 and under which is fantastic!!! They did an amazing job on her nails. The staff is friendly too. I will definitely be back. 
25710 My food was delicious (salmon, mushrooms and mashed potatoes) but none of my friends seemed to like their meals. Our waiter was awesome though! 
25711 Friendly staff, kombutcha and cold brew on tap. What more can you ask for. Lots of selection of beers. Had good checkout experience. Will come back with 64 oz jug for more kombutcha 
25712 Came here on vacation due to decent yelp reviews. I have to say we weren't disappointed! I got the ranchero burrito and it was amazing. Definitely a hole in the wall, but authentic Mexican. No frills, just good food. My whole family was pleased and stuffed. Thanks yelp! 
25713 great place. great team i love the dome. id straight up get married here. one day im gonna buy the dome and name it after my best friend rory 
25714 Worst grooming and boarding experience ever. They suppose to give my puppy a bath and grooming before I pick her up. Apparently, they only did part of their job. His smell was so bad that we had to send her to Petsmart for a bath on the same day. 
25715 Definitely a nice location away from the young crowd at the end of Rainey. Of course it helped to get there before things really got hopping. The watermelon drink I had was refreshing on a nice day. Was a little expensive though. No food but might go back for that. 
25716 The portions are large, fresh and very reasonably priced. My waitress was quick, attentive and cute. I loved this place and will return soon. 
25717 This place is okay. I like the whole concept of natural ingredients and local based. Food is good but pricey. I got the standard chicken, fries, drink and it was around $9. Sandwich seemed small but flavorful. Service was really good and clean. It is a good atmosphere. 
25718 Another awesome sub shop. I got the club, and it was delicious. All the meat and cheese is freshly cut. You only have a choice of white or wheat bread but it seems to be freshly baked everyday. Great service as well! 
25719 For vegan food this place is surprisingly good! The west coast pizza is excellent. Yum yum 
25720 Sharon was our server and she was great! We came in at a weird time just for a bite to eat. I got the fish tacos and my friend got some sort of bean bowl. Both were great. Really cool decor. Defiantly want to come back at night some time. 
25721 My favorite restaurant in Boston.. great atmosphere, food, service. Be sure to make reservations as the place is very small. They don't take reservations after 5. 
25722 Excellent sushi rolls. Very creative and innovative. The menu is vast but they is something for everyone whether they like sushi or not! The service was great and prices are in line with the quality of output! I will be back. 
25723 Yes this is really in the middle of the worlds busiest airport. Sushi is good not great - the other food really rocks! pork belly over arugula and black eyed pea salad. And the bartender mixes a mean cocktail. 1FS I can't wait to be back! 
25724 Wow is the beer overpriced in this place. Actually everything is overpriced and the area is currently overrun with vagrants. Had trouble parking because the parking lot was crowded with homeless people. 
25725 Great local spot. Closer to a 4.5 star place and depending on future visits may even creep up to a full five star. Two visits so far. Coffee has been good, carrot cake was great and the poutine was very tasty with crispy fries 
25726 Good prices and a helpful counter clerk. Convenient location right next to Rick's Cafe. 
25727 They are always super friendly and the panuchos are so AMAZING! You really have to try them! 
25728 The location overlooking the pond is nice, the food is very good, as is the wine list, but the service is less than stellar. We went for lunch, and I recommend the shaved steak sandwich, which is served French dip-style. 
25729 Expensive but worth every penny! If you are looking for authentic New England seafood, this is the place! 
25730 Hands down, best tortilla soup ever! Such a good, simple flavor with big chunks of carrot, celery and fresh avocado! Perfect for a super chilly Friday night! Top it off with their amazing sopapillas served warm with a bowl of ice cream...double foodgasm! 
25731 The hotel is great, and the staff is even better. The gym is perfectly stacked with what you need. The only issue is the price on food. Watch your room service add up quick! 
25732 Much better than nearby El Toro. I ordered the same meal and drink (Margarita, of course) as I tried at the other place, and all was better down the line. 
25733 Best swordfish I've ever tasted. Service was great and I felt very welcomed. Oh yeah and the cocktails were amazing. 
25734 I didn't have a chance to stay, but it looked like a great place to sit with work or a good book. I got a pour-over of Sumatra from Stauf's Coffee Roasters and it's delicious 
25735 Oh, geeze, I must've gotten there too early or had a new barista. I ordered an espresso americano and it was worse than a fast food joint. I complained that it was too weak but no offer to remake or add another shot. Bummer! 
25736 This is one of my top two restaurants in pdx! Great service, mouth watering food and the happy hour is the best! I think we ordered almost one everything off the HH menu. I can't wait to come back!! 
25737 Nice stay in the suite. Beautiful view from 18th floor. Hotel staff was nice and concierge was very informative. 
25738 Yum! my favorite meal in Portland. I absolutely fell in love with the spicy margarita! It was amazing. 
25739 The food was good, especially the dumplings. We ordered appetizers and the waiter brought us a full portion, which we had to send back to the kitchen. Moreover, the service was quite pushy and not very welcoming, and the food is rather expensive. 
25740 Ok hotel, but only running one shuttle during probably the largest conference of the year. Why? You have two shuttles. Takes forever to get one, and when it arrives, it's full. Thanks Hilton for the failure to provide good service to your business customers 
25741 Awesome food!!! No hormones or antibiotics in the proteins. Just became one of my favorites!! Must c try!!! Onion Rings are unbelievably good. Great service. 
25742 After driving by this place a few times, we decided to give it a try. The food is really pretty good. The prices seem high to be a counter service restaurant. The atmosphere is fun and very kid friendly. 
25743 felt sucks. the felt on the tables are all worn out-- its like shooting pool on ice. 13$ for a johnnie black? man i could buy half a harmonica with that 
25744 Love this little office building cafeteria, best soups!!!! I'm a super fan of their once a month Bi Bim Bop dish special!!! 
25745 Good food, decent service. The shuro and the beef dishes are good. 
25746 I still think it's a 3-star place, but it looks like they've removed the tip option from the debit/credit card machine, which I like. 
25747 The service here is awesome. I got very personable and expert advice on fabric dyes today. Selection is great despite the size of the store and the quality is top notch. I can't imagine going to Blick's again! Shop local :) 
25748 Very quick for an inspection sticker. Friendly staff. Took me in right away. Was out of there in 15 minutes. 
25749 Delicious, affordable and staff was friendly. Like many others reviewing, me and my SO spent the day at Universal Studios and were looking for food afterwards. We came across this place and were not disappointed. :) 
25750 The drinks are so good. The food is delicious. The staff is so friendly. The atmosphere is so relaxed. Great place to eat with friends. 
25751 I'm eating a spinach pie right now. SO DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The phyllo dough is so buttery and flakey. The spinach is perfect, and there is just the right amount of cheese. The flavor is so good. I also love the tomato mozzerella pita. Very good place!!!! 
25752 The bacon was great as well as the cappuccino. Didn't care for the hash brown casserole. Very friendly staff and cool atmosphere. 
25753 Fantastic. Oysters were huge, but once you drop em in, they are tasteless. I like the chili oil; makes all the meat taste better. Comes with a variety of condiments. $30. 
25754 Sandwich's were great as was the salad but to pay almost 3.00 each for 3 waters was flipping crazy. I'll go back but won't buy a water for them. Good food! 
25755 This place is so much fun. I love the 80's and 90's music that accompanies the theme. Staff is great. Will definitely be back! If you have not been check it out 
25756 Must try! Best soy garlic and spicy wings around. Growing business that is growing very fast! Love this place alot. 
25757 The food is all fresh, the vegetables are cooked perfectly. I went at lunch and the prices are good for the the generous portions. The restaurant is clean and the staff were nice and attentive. I would eat here again. 
25758 This place is extremely fresh and delicious. The prices are incredible for the quality of food they are serving. I could spend $30 on crappy Chinese somewhere or I could spend $30 on enough food to feed four people extremely well here. I couldn't be more happy about my experience. 
25759 Great cornbread---service was awesome. Great place to meet before heading to Clinton st theater for pacific U film viewing 
25760 Lugar excelente Buenos precios, comida rita y bien tradicional alemana. Variedad en platos y las cervezas deliciosas. Recomendando 100%% Excellent place, food delicious and very tradicional. Good prices for food. 
25761 I still like it here, but beware and be careful to make sure that their soups aren't made with chicken if, ya know, you're vegan. 
25762 My favorite dinner date, birthday dinner, anniversary dinner go to place! I'm a wine club member too! 
25763 Had a great experience with Scott, he was quick and professional and very knowledgeable about my One plus one phone. Will definitely go back should I ever need phone repairs. 
25764 Mmm mm good! Really creative and original menu ideas and reasonably priced. For appetizers we got the BBQ pork egg rolls and my entree was the Turkey Bacon Florentine. So tasty and very generous portions. I wish they had one of these in Illinois! ! 
25765 long waits, soondubu was bland and one of the worst ive ever had. galbi was fat, low quality meat. 2 stars for sweet potato banchan 
25766 Hopefully new management runs things better than previously. Burgers are good. Carry out mistakes we're numerous. 
25767 The Enormous Room is the perfect place to chill - perfectly executed Kettle One martinis, great hummus, and pillows everywhere. It had the air that it could be pretentious, but everyone was very friendly. Perfect for a couple of drinks before you head out for the night. 
25768 Ok the Guac is delicious-the service was good. Friendly and helpful. The Chicken hard taco rocked and filled to the brim. My fav salsa was the roasted salsa. Great flavor!! 
25769 The best BBQ in town! I love this place! The brisket and ribs are amazingly moist and tastes great! The green beans and potato salad are great sides too!!!! The people who work here are awesome and positive. Everything about this place is great and I highly recommend 
25770 This place has the best breakfast tacos in town and for only $2.5 approximately. Love this place 
25771 This is the best Chinese Restaurant around. Food fresh and delicious. Sushi unreal. The owners are so nice. Everyone there is professional and friendly. 
25772 The most amazing sushi I've had in the state!! Bartender was right on top of my wine and I ordered the house noodles which turned out to be to spicy for my liking took them back without question...by far the best customer service I've had in awhile!!! 
25773 I have seen a lot of very contradicting reviews of this restaurant so I decided to test it out myself. Turns out the food was really good!!! the Vegetarian Wings were delicious and so was the Boneless Wings. Definitely be going back!! 
25774 Had another pie delivered from here tonight and they are back in good form. The crust was tender and delicious, the sauce was perfect and the toppings (pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms) were abundant and excellent quality. As always, the service and delivery were superb. 
25775 What's all the rave about? I love eggs benedict, but the sauce tasted like vinegar. Its very busy so other's must be ordering something else. 
25776 The location is awesome. The decor was fun. The presentation was fantastic, but the food was very bland. I really wanted to like it but we will not return. 
25777 I am recovering from Ankle surgery and my sweet school order me food from Instead of Flowers. The food arrived on time. We had chicken Florentine, green beans, salad and Rocky road brownies. It was so delicious! 
25778 By far the best fried chicken I have, but warning it comes with a kick. The Mac n cheese and fried okra were also very good, and the beer selection is very good. Prices good. Only prob is the typical downtown, the parking 
25779 Mac and cheese is amazing! However, as a burgerfile, their burger is lacking. I was hopeful as I believe their sister restaurant "Prato" got it right when it comes to burgers. I walked away not wanting to give Slate's burger a second chance. 
25780 Last night was great. We had a blast we all recommend this place if u want chilled patron. And frozen margarita Marisa is were awesome. I come see u again 
25781 This place is so incredibly cute! Their coffee tastes great, and each location is so thoughtfully decorated. I recommend visiting at least once, just to see how you like it, but I bet you'll go back again. Also, PISTACHIO MUFFINS!! 
25782 Service poor , music loud 
25783 Not the place it use to be. We were sitting at bar long time before being spoken to and longer yet to get service 
25784 Hayk is an excellent dancer. It's not cheap but it's worth it if you want to get trained with the best in the class that's where you go. PS Beautiful facility. 
25785 Awful food and awful service. Was just walking by and needed to get lunch. No much else to day. J 
25786 Frequently understaffed and always overpriced. The TV's and awesome location are hard to beat, though, but their "bat cave" of a downstairs is a bit disorienting, and the staff can be standoffish. Love the decor, some food is pretty tasty, but there are better in the area. 
25787 Charlie's is the best! Absolutely love this place. Great service and awesome food! Never had a bad experience. 
25788 Poor tasting food, ok service, highly overpriced. Add to that 4 out of 5 in our group got sick after eating here. 
25789 My meal arrived an hour later than predicted. I ended up eating cereal for dinner. Should've offered something to make it up to me. Super shitty. 
25790 These wings are flavored just the way I like them! I also love their mozarella sticks, Chicken Philly and the Fries. Can't go wrong here! 
25791 Self seating, took a little while for the waiter to arrive, but great service after that. Buffalo chicken Flatbread was good, medditeranean wrap with slaw was good too. Comes with A LOT of slaw, and the slaw is a bit heavy and spicey. Overall, good experience! 
25792 I love yoga at the YMCA. The "core" class on Monday is really great. Also, Lisa is a fantastic teacher for all levels. I've been attending her classes since I started at the Y and she is always careful to note possible modifications to make positions easier or more challenging. 
25793 I love the atmosphere and the crowd of this place. It really is chill !!! The bartenders were nice and friendy and the crowd pleasant and cool. The reisling was delicious and so were the appy's to share. Great place for a date or to catch up with friends. 
25794 This place is good! You have to stop and try if your in Austin. I had the Raspberry white chocolate shake and a burger. Best burger place in Austin. 
25795 I love this grocery store! It is on my way home from the gym so I stop here very often. I love the layout and their jalapheno bread:) 
25796 Appreciated the food being less oily and more health conscious, but the buffet was not very tasty. 
25797 Good service, good ambiance. I ordered a puffy taco, which was the highlight of my visit. The traditional tacos were good, not great. The chips and queso, very basic, I know, were also delightful. I will definitely be returning! 
25798 Hidden Gem.. fish tacos, salad wraps and bang shrimp.. wish I could've ate it all. Definitely recommend. 
25799 Great tasting ice cream that I think you can only get in ohio. Correct me if I'm wrong but it is good. 
25800 i love for brekfast to get the sampler which comes with three pancacs 2sasage links 2 pieces of bacon and a ham and egg scramble and hashbrounds it is the boom and the choclate lava cake is one of the best things ever 
25801 As a beginner to yoga I couldn't have found a better place to practice, Toni and Jaqueline are so welcoming and take the time to make sure you feel comfortable during every class. I look forward to every class. 
25802 What a pleasant experience. Good food. Good drinks. Good fun. Even packed with patrons you don't feel crowded - and you're always made to feel at home. Great bartender 
25803 It was a nice, quieter style bar. I did not try any food here but the bartender was excellent. I recommend it simply for the atmosphere. 
25804 Mitchell did great job cutting limbs off my roof, clearing branches and cutting down dead oak trees. Highly recommended. 
25805 She is amazing! A truly, gifted healer. The session started with deep tissue work and then finished with her feet. Ashiatsu! I loved the combo. The office is perfect. Very, very ZEN! I'll be back for sure. 
25806 Wonderful service. The people that work there always took good care of me and my needs, no matter what the request, and were reliably polite and helpful. Clothes/sheets always looked good, too! Would definitely recommend to any Winchester resident. 
25807 Finally we got a full refund for the table, after visiting the store and making several phone calls. The owner came to our place and took care of the issue by himself. 
25808 Yummy food, large portions, and great service. The waiters are American Vietnamese and spoke fluent Vietnamese which is nice to see. You know it's authentic. :) 
25809 On the pricey side, however this is one of the things I feel is totally worth a bit extra. Food is fresh, staff is excellent. Fish is fresh, this is how you know they are on top of it! Good sales on staple items as well 
25810 Awesome new restaurant with a unique way of serving seafood in bags. Nice and clean with good service. I urge you to try Captains Boil. 
25811 Went in for deep tissue massage with Linda. Very strong best I have ever Had. Going back next week for couples Massage 
25812 This place is always a hit. Food is cooked perfectly and drinks are outstanding. I've never had a bad meal here and it's my favorite place for a date night. 
25813 This place is great my wife and i eat here on our last trip to orlando and she is dominican and she is very picky and she loved it i enjoyed it very much also 
25814 Best kid's menu ever. Mini hamburgers and the mac and cheese was awesome. Too bad it is only for kids 12 and under. 
25815 Omg the food here was delicious. I had the chicken and sauce and lobster empanadas and they were both incredibly delicious 
25816 Meh. Had the "mixed grill special". The lobster tail was decent, the shrimp seriously overcooked (rubber), scallops decent. My husband had the king crab. His review "crab had a lot of meat in it, pretty good". 
25817 I actually didn't like the taste of the chicken. Pretty basic and flavorless. The sides were worse and the customer service was the worst. 
25818 It's about time they closed. They've had repeated health violations all year. Beware of owners Vivar and Liberty. You don't want to go any where they go. 
25819 Spicy umami pork miso ramen. If it's my pick for food, and I don't have to get up early and run/bike the next day, it's highly likely I will be going here. This is one of my favorite foods in the universe. :) 
25820 This place is absolutely beautiful and always hustling and bustling with visitors. They usually have gorgeous exhibits and have fun thing for the season in the fall. Absolutely love coming here! Definitely worth the trip, check their exhibits on their website! 
25821 Red Cab is great if you have an early flight from Logan. I had called Red Cab at 4:30 am and asked for a cab in 15 minutes to take me to Logan. In 15 minutes - they were at my condo and waiting! 
25822 I came into Austin for the week and wanted to take my parents out for my Dad's 75th birthday. Everything was wonderful and the manager personally comped our table two desserts. Thank you for a wonderful evening 
25823 Food is always good at this place. Parking lot gets a little strange from time to time, it doesn't help with a bar and a bus stop right next to it. must try items: 1) Honey pork chop rice 2) Spicy Chicken Wings 3) Beef chow fun 
25824 Always kind a friendly! And always professional. My suit coats and shirts always look great with Eleganza Cleaners!! 
25825 This is probably best India restaurant in town new management is awesome good people extraordinary food and services love it 
25826 An employee stool my computer out of my rental car- STAY AWAY- worst customer service ever. After reporting the theft the corp office wouldn't even return my calls. That goes for the branch as well. 
25827 Wasn't the best burger I had but eatable. Fries were stale and the coke a bit flat. Milk shake was good. The place is a bit run down and the dining area not very inviting. 
25828 These guys know what I like: egg salad bowl with everything! Like another reviewer, I have never had a bad sandwich (or salad) here, and Daniel is my go-to 
25829 Ordering ahead using the Which Wich app is the easiest way to go, unless you have time to kill. 
25830 I rate this commercial juggernaut only because its geographic placement brings me relief and caffeine on my way to work many days - it's lovely to be greeted with more-than-sufficient and better-than-Starbucks (for the wallet and palate!) coffee even before I've emerged from the T - brilliant. 
25831 This is one of those places you hate to review because soon it will be so busy you will never get in. It is super tiny inside (4 tables) but the food is awesome! The entire experience can be summed up with GO HERE! 
25832 I go this place regularly as I live nearby. Their drunken noodle with tofu and scallion pancakes are a staple in my late week after work exhaustion. I highly recommend as the staff is always friendly, extremely accommodating, and willing to make modifications if needed. 
25833 This place was pretty good. I would love to come back and do build your own tacos some time. Nice poblano tomatillo salsa too 
25834 Holy. Good. Lord. I've died and gone to heaven after deliciously devouring the marshmallow sMores. Marshmallow. Vanilla. Chocolate chips flakes. Graham cracker. Absolutely delicious. 
25835 I buy the same coffee at Dunkins everytime. Why does this one charge more???? 
25836 Pho is my favorite food, and Pho Oregon is the best place to get a bowl of great pho. Good prices and the salad rolls are almost better than the soup. 
25837 So high priced and many booths are so crowded that you can't safely walk thru them... 
25838 Best service and best food love it. Would definitely recommend and come back again. For any one who travels and has tried many Mexican places this is on the top 2. 
25839 I just want to thank them for saving me over $300 on routine vaccines for my 2 dogs. The veterinarian with the tie dye shirt was awesome. They are providing a much needed service to the residents of Portland. 
25840 Place has a trendy atmosphere and food is okay but nothing special. Will probably comeback 
25841 Excellent meat!!!! Tender brisket! The beef ribs are ginormous and fall off the bone. Loved the desserts too 
25842 The best slice of pizza around. Nice size and a fair price. Not a lot of good pizza in the area. Tony's is worth the trip. 
25843 I was really disappointed by the food. Although it was fried, the breading was too heavy and it had no flavor. I probably won't come here again. 
25844 Great service starting at the front desk and especially Betty at the concierge desk. I highly recommend this hotel located in a fast developing waterfront location. 
25845 Back for a second helping. This time introducing this place to my son. We all enjoyed the flavors and the friendly staff was great. Are you here yet? 
25846 We always have a great time when we come here to watch movies. The theater is always clean and the people are very polite. 
25847 I only come here for the wings and perhaps some other appetizers. Pizza is not anything to appreciate unless you are drinking a lot. Beer cups smell fresh of dishwasher if you love that kind of thing. I would stick to whiskey and wings if at all possible while here 
25848 Coffee Rush is still very good, but their prices have gone up recently. Definitely more expensive then Dutch Bros, but they have a great praline latte and their service is always great. It's definitely the place I go if I want to sit down with my coffee. 
25849 The waffle window has AMAZING food, very yummy and filling! The only thing is, they don't have a whole lot of indoor seating so I would suggest preparing to take it to go or don't go on busy days like Sunday if you're looking for a place to dine in. 
25850 Excellent food and service. Upon recommendation I had the buffalo chicken omlet and it was delicious. Portions are large and the presentation is outstanding. 
25851 Don't order for delivery pizza came hard cold and over cooked. They covered it with tomatoes to make up for the burnt taste but still it was not edible took one bite threw it away and charged me $30 bucks for it never again 
25852 Phenomenal food at reasonable prices. I had the tagine twice. The wait staff was fantastic the first time and a little ignore-y the second time. Coffee was kind of meh. 
25853 I tried the fresh apple sorbet and it tasted very good. It tasted like it was made from fresh apple juice. You can see the apple skin in the sorbet too. I definitely recommend this flavor! 
25854 I love the cozy atmosphere in Fin's, and it's never been too busy while I'm there, so it's a pretty chill spot. The sushi is on the more expensive side, but for the size and quality it's totally worth it. The soup is also pretty good! 
25855 Spoke to Bob who is the owner and he was WONDERFUL!!! He apparently operates many of the stores in the area and is sending me coupons. VERY IMPRESSED. 
25856 Such a fun place, especially in the spring. This is your destination for hanging out/studying/relaxing in a beautiful park-like setting near a majority of your classes. 
25857 I shop here for work. Once in a while I get something for the house, but overall this is a supply store for restaurants and bars. The staff is helpful and friendly, and go out of their way to help you when you need it. 
25858 Tasty and a decent value for the price. Also open to 11pm during the week and serves Maine Root fountain drinks--lots of positives. 
25859 Best station to fill up around in my opinion. Attendants are super friendly. They also carry bio diesel! Been running this in my Dodge for couple years w/o any issues. With Safeway right on same corner, the rewards really make this a favorite gas stop. Thanks! 
25860 awful. can't say enough terrible things about this place. the rudest employees ever, but i guess i should have expected it because it is owned by one of the most notoriously entitled families in all of Lexington. will never return here and will advise all friends to do the same. 
25861 Food is what you would expect. The Trivia Night on Wednesday Nights though is a pretty good time. You can win gift cards to pay for the mediocre food! They do have pitchers of beer for only $5.99. 
25862 So good! Tried the tom yum with tofu and chicken pad ga prow. Great flavors and excellent service. 
25863 I've never eaten Turkish food before but I loved it! All the food is made from scratch, clearly family owned. This is the best meal I've had in a while and I'll definitely be coming back 
25864 Delicious food but the wait was ridiculous. Was told it would be about 30 min wait. Ended up being over an hour because a huge party stayed and kept talking 30 minutes after they paid their bill.... that killed it for me. Otherwise, really delicious food 
25865 3rd time here, first this year. Great location, good food, service is very good and I love the beer. I travel every week for work and this place makes me feel comfortable and appreciated and I will always go out of my way to visit here. 
25866 ordered lamb Shahi Korma and Mango Chutney. Shahi Korma = nearly perfect Shahi Korma = toooo sweet I am full and very satisfied with the quality of the food they served. 
25867 Yummy! And pretty authenic. I'm here from San Diego, and I loved the Carnitas! Wanted to keep eating. The flavour! 
25868 Probably, one of the first placesI went to when I got to Atlanta, and it is yummy! Still one of my favorite spots here. I don't remember all the names of the burgers, but my favorite is the Cuban with chorizo and egg. Crazy good! 
25869 Kamron (spelling), is always a pleasure To work with and a good asset. Otherwise, a good place to go for the industry. 
25870 Customer service was absolutely incredible. We ordered take out but while we waited for the order we we given water with fresh lemon. Food was fantastic 
25871 Would love to come again, but Hawaii is a little far away for us. 
25872 The food is amazing! The service was great! The fish and carrot souffl√© was my favorite! Expect a long wait. 
25873 Tried the $8 Porchetta sandwich and its worth every cent. I hope to be in the area to try some other treats. I just happened upon the site and I was pleasantly surprised. It is the perfect blend of pork, spices, sweet......yum yum 
25874 What a great place for sitting outside on a warm summer evening. The onion rings were light, crispy, and tasty. The avocado and beet salads were fresh and delicious, and the pizza was excellent. Our waiter was great! 
25875 Nice alternative to the chains. Tasty latte and blueberry scone this AM. Both were well made and quite large. Some noise from road construction outside was a little distracting. 
25876 Beer list is off the charts good. Solid food too. We recently left Cambridge. This place totally holds up against the old East Cambridge neighborhood! 
25877 One of the top 5 pizzas I've had. My parents are huge fans and go fairly often. The pizza is outstanding - one of the Boston area's best. I rank it slightly below Bianchi's and on par with Regina and Umberto 
25878 Interesting spot. Sat at the bar and watched football. It was not that busy, a few people at the bar and and few people outside. The service was good, we had an order of spinach dip and it was good. 
25879 Love this place. Found it by looking at the reviews. I moved here almost a year ago and couldn't find a salon...so happy I stopped in here! Now I'm going to go every few weeks 
25880 I recently had dinner here on a weeknight. We got a few things to split it between 4 people. I recommend the pork and cornbread, farmers cheese plate, and patatas Bravas! 
25881 Holly cow, amazing! Ordered a boba milk tea which is always my go too anywhere. It was fresh and yummy. Bragging right to the mojo crepe ..Mind blowing good. Frequent flyer miles here I come 
25882 Was visiting Vancouver for one evening. Read reviews for Yuji. Glad I took a chance. The food is very tasty. I enjoyed it. You won't go wrong with this place. Suggest making reservations. 
25883 Great food!!! Amazing service and can't beat the location! Yum!!! 
25884 Worst. They overcharged almost $50. I contacted them first and they told me I was to be contacted and did not happen. I called them again and that manager was even gone for the day without leaving any message. 
25885 Awesome staff, clean facility, and low-cost vet services. I just took my new kitty there yesterday for shots/neuter and everything went really well. Thank you, ATA!! 
25886 YAY! Super glad this spot moved in the neighborhood. Surprisingly enough, good (albeit American style) Chinese delivery was not available in the area! definitely the best delivery around. 
25887 They have a great selection of board games to buy, rent and play. We also came for a board game playing night on Friday and had a great time. Love this place, highly recommend and we will be back. 
25888 Awesome food and awesome staff. They have plenty of selections of beer and food. We loved this place and when we come back to Oregon we will be stopping by. 
25889 I went to return a tablet that I order online.it wasn't working right. I couldn't find the receipt I went in their thinking it was going to be a hassle but it wasn't they looked up my info and gave me a refund. Very easy and painless 
25890 very nice hidden gem in Waltham. Great burgers, great salads and good pricing 
25891 Expensive, poor service and mediocre food. I was very disappointed with the quality and food portions. The only good thing was the view. 
25892 Overall good experience. Strong smell of bread(which they bake there I believe) that was kind of overwhelming so we sat outside and enjoyed our burgers and beers. Would go again but will still opt to sit outside. 
25893 Love how you get a text and then follow the link and boom your car is ready very very cool 
25894 My husband and I stop by this place every time we are downtown !! The Mango and Blackberry fro-yo is the best !! 
25895 Awesome experience! DJ was the best. Did most of it over the phone and then was treated fairly and quickly upon my arrival. Also, shout out to to Gary the finance guy as well.... Can't say enough. 
25896 Looking for a quick tasty sandwich Jimmy Johns is your place. 
25897 Food was incredible. Wonderful service. Our bus gal Roberta was extremely personable and made our experience really wonderful. She welcomed my parents from New York. 
25898 Stop showing your damn commercials in Savannah nearest one is a hour away Damn i miss Atlanta 
25899 This place is closed and it's not mentioned on their web site. Really annoying. I'm so glad we didn't buy tickets on the web site as well. 
25900 Love...... It is a little pricy comparatively speaking but great quality! My husband and I have eaten pho all over the place even at his parents house ( who are S.E. Asians ) and we all love the broth here! Best pho in Oregon by far!! 
25901 The wait time in the drive-thru was ridiculous. Almost 25 minutes from the time I ordered to the time I received my drink! And there were only 2 cars in front of me. The barista at the window didn't even apologize for the wait time. 
25902 Loved how quickly we were seated and served. Server was helpful and on top of everything. Food was delicious and fresh. Great choices on Happy Hour menu - very reasonable! Will definitely go back here. 
25903 Service is always considerate and very caring. The receptionist is friendly and considerate; all in all, I always enjoy my time here. It's truly relaxing experience. 
25904 Our meal was a mixed bag. The Thai Iced Teas were ok. Probably a little below average. The Cashew Chicken was pretty good. The Pad Thai was awful. It tasted like wet the dog. The other two meals were below average. I would not return to this restaurant. 
25905 This review for manager Jacob. My online was done wrong I didn't get the food I ordered. Jacob went above and beyond to correct mistake and make my experience awesome..faith restored in costa Vida 
25906 best filet mignon ive ever had and the veggies are always cooked perfectly 
25907 Good, fresh food. Online ordering for pick up and delivery, and huge luncheon specials at great prices. I get food from here at least twice a week. One of my favorite places. Some of their dishes are pretty healthy, too. 
25908 Clean, bright and festive! The guacamole was delicious and the ultimate margarita is fabulous. We both had the taco salads, yum! Everything is made in house including the chips. Malden welcomes you!!! 
25909 Great food busy location wait times to be seated a bit long. The food tasted fresh and service is great! I ordered butter chicken and naan. One of the best. Portion are small. 
25910 I order my drink on the mobile app on my way there. Should have been ready by the time I walked into the store. Drink wasn't ready and it took another 20 min. 
25911 Last two times we visited they were unable to get the food right. At least one plate was sent back 3 times on both visits. Is there a manager in the house? It will be a while before I venture back. 
25912 What an amazing place. Who would thought that a donut burger with fried egg would taste so great. I'll be back to try SEVERAL others. 
25913 "Meh" would be kind. Average sushi, not wildly overpriced, not better than at an Asian supermarket food court though. But at least the service is only disinterested. It's in Harvard Square! 
25914 Awesome class, awesome instructor. John, you are the best, getting the most out of your students, you are SO patient and so motivating. Thank you! 
25915 Wow- a kid friendly paint your own pottery place. Our experience was fabulous. The staff was very helpful, kind and attentive. My five year old is very active. He loved painting and he didn't break anything. Double win. I highly recommend this place and we will definitely come back. 
25916 This is one of the nicest movie theaters I've been to. Comfortable seats where your feet up, no one right behind you necessarily. Went on a Monday and it was very quiet and the theater only had a handful of people so it was a great movie-going experience. 
25917 The beef was the consistency of rubber. The lo mien noodles weren't lo mien noodles. The service was so bad I was amazed my girlfriend tipped at all. 
25918 One of my goto places for Ramen in Austin. The broth may not be filled with flavor but after adding some of their hot and soya sauce on the table, it does taste good. I love the Wonton Chicken Ramen which has nice dumplings in it. 
25919 Stopped by here literally an hour before they close. All I wanted was a cut, the girl took her time even though my hair was very long. My hair came out exactly like the picture I showed her. Wish I got her name for next time! 
25920 Yes, this location is closed. Their lease is up and are looking into new locations...simple enough to find out by calling the number... 
25921 Amtrack should be ashamed. I'm Guessing no executives randomly check up on all the stations. Parking is horrible, they make riders have to walk so far at times. The staff is great just needs updating. Come on MAN!!!!! 
25922 Not bad. Somewhat clean & great for people watching. Always a game on at the bar on one of three or four TV's. Friendly staff and prompt service. 
25923 The guy at the register was super rude. I order the Dirty Bastard and the Oreos on top tastes stale. Overall, I was very disappointed. 
25924 Decent place place to bring a date. Food is decent. Margarita's are made to order with lots of tequila to choose from. Bar staff is all male, nice dudes, not arrogant rock stars, but still I wouldn't leave my date alone with them at the bar. 
25925 Chicken Pho is awesome!! Under $7 and it cures a hangover. Who would have guessed?!?! 
25926 Terrible barbers, great people just not technical barbers. Great clean barbershop that seems perfect for young kids, but not a legitimate barbershop. I'd say got to clippers on aloma great barbers 
25927 Mom and pop feel to this place. The food was excellent. The staff was very friendly and made us feel welcomed. Heads up CASH ONLY. 
25928 Awesome little market friendly helpful owner. A good variety of products. I get my beer there. 
25929 Great food. Had the trio sampler. Milkshakes rock. Only complaint was service was pretty weak. Hostesses and servers made it seemed like they were slammed, but definitely was not very busy. If service gets their act together, I'd make this a regular spot to take out-of-town visitors. 
25930 This is one of my favourite restaurants ever. My family and I have been coming here for years. The food and value is excellent. I recommend the chow mein, Szechuan beans, fish hot pot. We order tons so we can take the rest home and enjoy it longer. 
25931 GREAT place for adults and kids alike! Food was wonderful, nice beer list and knowledgable, friendly staff. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are visiting Universal! 
25932 Absolutely disgusting tasting Indian food. Would not recommend this place even if it's the last open Indian restaurant in Boston. Don't waste your time here. 
25933 WORST SHOP EVER. The barista is always SO RUDE and she will not brew coffee on weekends ! She won't tell you either she just makes you an Americano and goes back to type on Facebook and talk on her phone. 
25934 This place is very good and the concept is fun! Easy access to parking and easy to get in out of Easton. They have a good happy hour. $2.00 off of drinks. 
25935 Went there tonight and had the cheesy garlic bread and calzone and my husband had the ziti. Amazing! The cannoli is a great finish. My only complaint, if even, is not enough seating. 
25936 Everything you need when it comes to fabrics and buttons. Wide selection. Yeah, the prices could be better but I haven't foundd too many places with this much selection and cheaper prices. 
25937 Great food, but a bit cramped. Price of success, I suppose. 4.5 out of 5 stars. Would eat again. 
25938 Such an incredible experience. I spent 3 years recovering from an injury and now, thanks to this office, I am at the top of my game. No pain, no aches. Thanks to Dr. A and his team of awesome staff. 
25939 Love eating at the bar where Tim helps you figure out the menu, sets the pace, offers a big smile and warm welcome. And let's discuss the food. In a word, it's totally unAmericsn. I feel like I just returned from Japan. What could be better? 
25940 Visited Boston for the first time. A friend took us here. Wow. The service was great. The octopus was unbelievable. I had the BLT lobster roll and I would def have it again. Do yourself a favour if you love seafood. Get in there! 
25941 my go to bar/grill outside of Harvard Square. This place is great. The California Burger is amazing. 
25942 we make our last minute reservations thru open table. this pkace tends to fill up after 9. we order the kavas bread with hummus to start. then we order the mixed grill for two 35.00 has lamb and chicken tastes great always take half of it home. 
25943 Please use gloves in your kitchen. Watching someone touch your bun bare hand. Eww. Not sanitary. 
25944 Wow I'm blown away this place is worth the wait ! The staff and management made us feel right at home. The people we met while waiting made the experience fun 
25945 Food and drinks hit a home run 
25946 This place is a must if you are in town 
25947 I went there for Tuesday open mic night to watch a friend do stand up. The food was great- they have wine- and the staff was nice. I will go back (also... their open mic night has the potential to be awesome) 
25948 Just finished with a Sunday sunset tour. Beautiful sunset on the mount Dora lake. It became a little chilly and they had freshly cleaned blankets for guest to use. Very friendly tour guides.Lots of gator sightings and bald eagles! Deff worth the $20 
25949 A wonderful place with a wide selection of foods, treats, toys and other pet items. The lady working tonight that helped us was super nice and answered all the questions I had. Will definitely be back. 
25950 Great value. Filling sandwiches for $5-6; what's not to love. Especially with all that expensive airport food! 
25951 Stopped in here while waiting for our movie to start. This place had it all posters, pins, shirts and toys... a little too rich for my taste but I'll get something next time I go. 
25952 $5 for 6 miniature cookies would be a rip-off anywhere else. These cookies are, for the most part, fresh, warm, and chewy. They have a variety of different flavors, such as chocolate chip, mint chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin chocolate chip, and others. A solid dessert if you're in Faneuil Hall 
25953 This is the only place I now take my clothes to be dry-cleaned. I always appreciate the friendly smiles of the woman who usually takes my clothes, the quick turn-around on laundry, and the repair jobs they are able to do (e.g., fixing zippers). Perfecto Cleaners does things right! 
25954 Huge portions of good ole southern comfort food. I hardly ever get the meat (except the Salmon Loaf on Fridays) because the sides, both regular and premium, are just too tempting to resist! 
25955 One of my preferred places for hamburgers. Possibly the best onion rings in town. 
25956 Great place!! The service was fantastic and food was just as good! I would highly recommend this restaurant! 
25957 Always timely pick-up and drop-off. This past visit, my car battery was dead when I arrived back at the airport and a staff member (at 1 am) quickly helped me jump it -- she provided great, friendly service!! 
25958 The food is wonderful and the service is great! We were 7 in the party and the attentiveness was excellent. 
25959 We come here twice a year and love the rooms. The views are great. Rooms are spacious and feel like home. The have putt putt, basketball, several pools, tennis, bike rental, and now bowling. 
25960 The goodwill bins can be a fun experience. You never know what you're going to come across. You may want to bring latex gloves because it's not the cleanest experience. 
25961 this place is basically Shucks reincarnated!! Oysters are FRESH and delicious!! And they have half off specials. Service was great. I will definitely be back again soon!!! 
25962 This is now my family's favorite barbecue joint. the lines are not terrible, the brisket melts in your mouth, the sides are good, and the people really nice. it's the perfect place to take out of town guests for a taste of texas bbq. 
25963 Great class today, great instructor! I dropped in since I'm on vacation and felt very welcomed. Make sure you get a tank top, so cute! Class was challenging but made for all levels...make it what you want! 
25964 Amazing! I ordered a vegan burger to go and i was given a complimentary soup while i waited. Very clean place and excellent customer service!! This might become a regular place for take out for me!! 
25965 Fried Chicken Sandwich- HUGE and delicious. The chicken was juicy and crispy and the pickle underneath was refreshing. Fries- Well seasoned and crispy Mac salad - nice and light not so mayo(ey) Chill vibe and quick friendly service 
25966 I had my first massage today and Corbin, the massage therapist was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place, you can't beat the prices. 
25967 We had reservations for 8:00-got seated about 8:30, but the food was worth it. There were 5 of us and we got a variety of appetizers and some great entrees. The drinks were good and the food was exceptional. 
25968 The friend bananas were amazing! Loves the Venezuelan empanadas was great! Nice atmosphere, large portions, and priced right! 
25969 This place is OK, but if you are looking for a great Ethiopian go to Addis red sea, the one in the south end is much better that this one.. 
25970 I love the bubble milk tea here! The tapioca is delicious. I also tried the herbal jelly topping and it tasted so refreshing. Great service and yummy bubble tea. 
25971 Delicious food! Great atmosphere! They did mess up on are order but the manager gave us a round of drinks to make up for it! If your in a rush this isnt the place for you on a saterday night but saying that i will be back this weekend! 
25972 Suan La Chow Show!!!! Go now! This place makes me wish I still lived in Boston. 
25973 Swift service at this fantastic location you'd never get close by. Parking is pretty tight tho. 
25974 I love this place! It's close to my office and we go for lunch frequently. The service is always quick and the food is always delicious! 
25975 We live in the area and love coming to this cafe! Owners could not be sweeter, food is authentic and SO good, and the sangria is awesome. Definitely need to check it out! You will become a regular just like us! 
25976 Not a place for date night. My husband and I visited the bar for drinks and appetizers. They served our drinks in plastic cups. Very tacky. Why would you serve a $15 old fashioned in a plastic frat cup? I won't be returning. 
25977 This place is my new spot!! The guy is super nice and my food was ready quick and delicious, prices are great and they have such a good menu, plus they have my favorite dessert! I'll be back 
25978 BEST ramen I have ever had. Staff is always friendly and always pay attention to detail. My food has never once been wrong and always taste AMAZING! 
25979 I had the carne asada plate. It was decent, but my friends plate had two long pieces of HAIR and it was BURNT. The hair was so burnt that it curled. It was disgusting! Very unsanitary. 
25980 I much prefer this location over the Harvard Square store. Selection/lay-out seems to be better. Employees are usually helpful. Staff isn't as knowledgeable as what you might find at a specialty store (Marathon Sports), but definitely better than a big-box place (Modells). 
25981 Why do I keep coming here? Chicken fingers (more like fried chicken), beer, and sports. In a neighborhood filled with bars that are either too posh or too divey, LW fills the nice dive bar void. Oh, and they've got a good selection of beer too! 
25982 Awesome place to go if you're a vegetarian, even if your not. I go with my veggie friends a lot and I can't even tell what the foods made of, but it taste good. And they have a wide variety of stuff. 
25983 Hands down the best experience I have had at a car wash, AGAIN! These guys give exceptional customer service and pay attention to detail. I have brought 2 cars for a detail and will now continue to come back for washes. All around Great place! 
25984 A cozy little space with delicious food. Everything was excellent and fast. The lineup out the door says lots of people feel the same way. 
25985 Delicious food and great atmosphere. Wine Wednesday is $10 for a glass and all you can drink wine. I'm not a wine drinker but my friends enjoyed this! I'll be back! 
25986 The fried chicken was amazing! Do yourself a favor and get this in your mouth. The honey butter that came with the biscuits were equally on par with this chicken. The price is definitely justified for their quality. 
25987 Best Indian buffet you can imagine. Good number of dishes and good taste to. If in Austin, must go destination 
25988 Best sambar ever. Better than South Indian restaurants. Quality of food is also good even in buffet. 
25989 Really good bagels, great pie, and a wonderful environment to hang out in. The volume of it all does get loud so if you're planning to study, bring headphones. Also, if you need to use the bathroom, choose the elephant. It's cleaner (not due to hygiene habits but from under-use) 
25990 I'm always on the hunt for a good new Sunday brunch spot, and I was highly impressed with this restaurant! The atmosphere was very casual and cozy and the food was fresh and delicious. The staff was attentive and friendly, which made the visit even more pleasant. 
25991 Worst customer service not only did we wait to get sat when there were so many tables open. When we finally did get sat there was no server again for 10 plus minutes. Never will go back and really just wanted a blooming onion. :( 
25992 Always good. Predictable with flavors, presentation and they have happy people. Also, make great drinks. Our go to HH PLACE for a game of farkle and relaxation. 
25993 Decking is multiple levels without sufficient markings. Party member fell, no one even checked on her. No apology. Sandwich was OK. 
25994 My semester was hell but they saved my behind--I had major surgery and they adapted my favorite dish to help. They made bland taste so good. Awesome place great service. Always pleasant. 
25995 Great experience buying a car from Dynamic Motors. Andrey and team are great folks providing really good customer service. Quick to purchase the vehicle, and it runs great. Will buy my next car from them too! 
25996 So yummy, delicious vanilla with lavender lemon, and since I couldnt decide, BlackBerry hard shell on the other. In an omg waffle cone. 
25997 Mmmmm loved it here!! Our service was outstanding!! Food was delicious!! The chefs are very attentive, they are always filling my plate up. The price is a bit high but what do you expect from an all you can eat steakhouse. 
25998 My favourite Greek restaurant in all of the lower mainland. Have never grown tired of their slouvaki or the kleftiko. You get a lot of food for the money so bring your appetite! 
25999 Really good burger and fries. Milk shake was good too. Enjoyed the location and atmosphere. Would totally go back again. Had the Number 6. Loved it. 
26000 Very nice pool. Convenient to convention center - especially West halls. Descent bars. Full gamut of restaurant quality. Clean and well maintained. Speedy elevators. Loud in-window air conditioners. Expensive for Orlando and for what you get. 
26001 Great thorough knowledgeable I felt in good hands (pardon the pun) and will be back! Amanda knows her trade! 
26002 I lived in Argentina for 2 years. This is the only restaurant in the united states that I've eaten at that captures the real taste. This is 5 of 5 stars...and I'm a tough judge. 
26003 This place is great every time I go. The food never disappoints me. I love how much flavor every dish has. I've tried so many and have yet to be dissatisfied. 
26004 Really nice locally owned store with helpful salespeople and a huge selection. Very clean and bright which made shopping for a gift much more relaxing. Check them out. 
26005 Another awesome experience here and the weather was nice to have a coffee outside on a Friday afternoon. Very cool place with great coffee. 2nd time here and didn't disappoint. 
26006 I had the bacon and spinach skillet and it was really great. The toast is thick cut with unsalted butter. A beautiful salad that I brought home because too much food for one meal. Tiny joint with friendly service. A new neighborhood favorite. 
26007 Excellent grilled octopus salad. Service was excellent and quick. Only improvement needed is sodas are $5. That's borderline insulting. Would definitely go back for a quality lunch that's quick and unassuming. 
26008 great place if you like sea life, the shows are amazing with seymor & clyde the sea lions & shamu they make you appreciate sea life & you come out with a totally different out look on the creatures of the seas 
26009 The tiramisu martini is to die for. It was strong but well worth it. I would highly recommend this place. Great atmosphere and friendly people. 
26010 Sip on a Singapore Sling while soaking up the mid-century decor. Priceless! BTW: Who the bleep is Kitty Cohen?! ;) 
26011 I'm adding a star solely on the Spiked Bulleit Bourbon Burger. It's just that good! I've had it a couple of times, and now I look for an excuse to come eat here. 
26012 Courtney Free showed up when he said he would at my office, fixed the windshield perfectly in less than an hour, and charged what was quoted. I couldn't ask for a more painless process. These guys are believable and talented - no surprises, no hassle. 
26013 Hmmm kava for the 1st time and I have to say I will be coming back! Great experience with friends 
26014 Really smooth transaction. They were able to help us find exactly what we wanted and did a great job installing. 
26015 No words can really describe how happy I'm with Kobe. The customer services excellent!! The chief excellent!! The servers and teamwork between them excellent!! The managers were professional, kind and walked around to each table to check on the customers!! Kobe was very clean also. 
26016 My goodness. The absolute best tacos in Austin. Was visiting Austin for 2 days and couldn't stop thinking about their tacos. Also highly suggest the chips and guac. Some of the best guacamole I've ever had. And if you don't get an Aqua Fresca you aren't doing it right! 
26017 Good place to eat, nice atmosphere and good drinks too. Portions are A-OK if you are not that hungry. Shrimps has the shell so you have to use your hands to peel off the skin. Other than that, is a good place to visit and eat. 
26018 I go here 2-3 times a week in the morning for the chicken breakfast burrito, the BEST in town. The staff here are excellent always very friendly 
26019 Overpriced for very mediocre sushi. Cool atmosphere and the porch is nice but not worth what we had to pay for average sushi. 
26020 As a South American, I can def recognize a great ceviche. The Hamachi ceviche with avocado mousse topped with crispy brown rice was really outstanding! This is just the perfect appetizer option for the summer! 
26021 Excellent food. Clean and comfortable atmosphere. 
26022 Service was great! Had the shaken beef! Highly recommend. It is amazzzzzzzing!! 
26023 delicious food, delightful atmosphere! outside seating, awesome dining out experience 
26024 Veteran bartenders. Quality food. Staple beers. I always have a down to earth time here. 
26025 We have had everything on the menu. Everything is great. I especially like the br√ªl√©e donut...sinful. $1 coffee is a plus as well. 
26026 the pizza was soggy as hell 
26027 just oil and cheese 
26028 And the fries were nasty and soggy and had zero salt. 
26029 Solid German food. They have been doing it a while and defiantly have it figured out. Worth the stop in to sample some yummy food. The beer is good too! Prosit! 
26030 Come here when they are slow & get treated like a king. They get a few customers and the hostess decide they don't need any more. 
26031 Great food with ample proportions, with a friendly environment. The staff was great seeing to our needs. We will definitely be back for another meal. 
26032 came in on a Friday morning at 9:30am. wait for 2 was 20 minutes and got seated at the counter. had a white chocolate pistachio rosewater mocha, the cassoulet and granola. cassoulet and granola was really good. couldn't really taste the pistachio in my mocha though. 
26033 I really enjoyed my takeout lunch from here. The shrimp taco was my favorite, but the chicken and pork tacos were also good. It's nothing fancy, but the prices are fair and the service is quick 
26034 Service was good and food tasted good but I got sick both times I ate here, as did my roommate although she never went back a second time. Don't think I'll risk a third. 
26035 Need some "soul food" or "country cookin"? Go here. I felt like I was back at my Grandma's table. Great fried chicken and pot roast. The cream corn and green beans were great too! 
26036 This place is super fun especially after or before a baseball game. Walking distance from Fenway. Drink specials are great and has a great environment. 
26037 $16 for 2 people-- house pho + salad roll....decent- clean place parking lots....no signage so had to find this place;i just stumbled on it as i was going to order pizza hut beside the place. 
26038 If you want average Chinese food at high prices, this is the place to go. The classic Chinese decor is what makes this place worthwhile, but you can get more authentic Chinese food at divey buffets like Din Ho. 
26039 Great for one beer and a game. If you expect more, go somewhere else. Food is mediocre at best - and over-priced. Wait service isn't great either. The upside is that it's rarely busy and there are many TV's for great sports viewing. 
26040 Awful! Very bland and disappointing. I ordered chow mein and they delivered mixed vegetables and told me chow mein doesn't have noodles. The definition of chow mein is pan fried noodles. Wouldn't recommend! 
26041 I got a groupon in my email at 10:47 this morning advertising a cut and botanical hair therapy for $29.00. It was a great deal so I hit buy at 10:50. All sold out but the more expensive offers were still available. Seems like bait and switch to me. 
26042 Delicious pizza and frozen custard concretes! The place was packed but still delivered tasty food. I'll be back to try the other concretes! 
26043 Yoga Sakti is such an amazing place. The numerous classes they have to offer and the space itself, puts Yoga Sakti in my top position for yoga studios on the North Shore of MA. 
26044 Enjoyed our stay here! Rooms were comfortable! The restaurants on the property were excellent and convenient! 
26045 If you have an Arizona ID, don't even bother with Gordon's. They won't accept it. Come back with your passport. 
26046 Very nice place. I had the Belgian Waffles with bacon and scrambled eggs...love it so much!!! 100% recommended!!! 
26047 Tzatziki with shawarma?? Garlic sauce when you ask for it tastes like garlic mayo, not good. 
26048 I stumbled through here in the middle of my bar crawl. There was great live music, cold beer, and my feet stuck to the floor. All-and-all a great 6th st experience. :) 
26049 Karen is great!!! she's efficient and fast. I have told all of my friends about this place and the wonderful work she does 
26050 I've been eating here for years and am surprised by some of the lower reviews. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, the food is good and a great value. It's definitely a go to 
26051 Bad Food and even though its an all u can eat buffet is way over priced. Employees are OK but not exactly friendly enough. Food Quality- (out of 5 stars) 1 Atmosphere ( out of 5 stars) 2 Service ( out of 5 stars) 1 
26052 I live and work downtown so this is a no brainer for me. Staff is great the store is always clean and well presented 
26053 I always find what I want and sometimes something I wasn't really looking for. I highly recommend stopping by here it's a beautiful store 
26054 While it is incredibly small, the food is amazing! Homefries are well seasoned and in abundance, egss were perfect...flavored iced coffee and this ridiculously spicy Brazilian sauce cleared out my sinuses but was excellent. I will definitely be returning the next time I'm in Boston! 
26055 Awesome customer service, top-end equipment, great location, fair prices and a good selection. I highly recommend getting your eyewear from Dr. Rhodes - you won't be disappointed! 
26056 pretty good local seafood restaurant. We sampled 3 types of raw oysters which were really good and I had a tasty dish that included fried Calamari & shrimp with vegetables. The wine was just okay but the fish options are generally really good. 
26057 Rocks had quick service and I enjoyed my meal. The mushroom Swiss grilled chicken was excellent. Juicy chicken and flavorful mushrooms. 
26058 Good food and good atmosphere! I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the horrible service i received from a server named "Alecia" hands down worst service i have recieved from a server, will not be returning if she is still working at this restaurant 
26059 We made reservations here and it was pretty awesome! Try the Ahi Nachos! They are amazing! The dim sum was also pretty good. Server was very attendant. Bathrooms were very clean. 
26060 Thanks to Saul for going out of his way to save our leftovers! Great place and great service. 
26061 I love this place. All you can eat sushi is the best thing on the menu. 
26062 Ate dinner there last nite. Great waiter.... Wine special was great and at a good price.... Had the Children Pot Pie and the Meatloaf... Both had amazing presentation and were excellent. .. We would highly recommend the restaurant.... 
26063 Some of the best baked goods in Austin can be found at Fat Cats. Their vegan doughnut offerings are tasty, perfectly executed, and always leave me wanting more. Also, try their one-of-kind vegan cinnamon rolls baked fresh on Saturday mornings. The c-rolls will be the highlight of your weekend! 
26064 Rangzen is better. A decent option for vegetarians and people seeking to try a different cuisine. 
26065 amazing food, drinks and service. the atmosphere is perfect. the tap room is such a gorgeous space, my husband and I used it for our local elopement. 
26066 Ordered chicken fajitas with a sweet tea Fajitas where very good beans where salty rice had no flavor services was slow for refills and more chips cheese dip wad good. Was a ok mexican food experience for Orlando the store next door has great mexican bread and cakes 
26067 Javier was very helpful and informative. Facility is clean and would highly recommend !! 
26068 One of the few taco trucks that the employees speak English - a plus! The food and prices were both very good. 
26069 I love you guys! A wonderful place to climb and the environment is unpretentious. Friendly people all around and awesome music! Plus the events (pub night, holla!) are great! AND free yoga for members! I could go on and on but just go there. You get the the idea. 
26070 Kim is awesome! Very professional and friendly. I've been going to Great Nails for a very long time. I've never had a problem. I would recommend asking for Kim. 
26071 Good! I would come here three times a day if I had no self-restraint. I also love that they offer "for here" glass cups. 
26072 Good service, pleasant waitress, food was well prepared and tasty, comfortable atmosphere with a view of downtown Atlanta lights. Our group of 8 was very pleased. 
26073 This place is UNREAL. The food is great! Go early to get a seat as they don't take reservations. 
26074 Alex was an awesome server. The cheese plate was over the top with Icelandic caviar! The patio is cute and a great place for a margarita. That's what I had, yum! Def will return. Just moved to the area and have been trying different places. This is a winner. 
26075 Great little eatery - tonight I had the falafel roll up sandwich. Yum! Second time here, and both times was delicious and good value. Ps get the lemonade! 
26076 The food was good! Cute little vibe. I got the smart starter which is basically avocado toast. The service was good, I will def be returning. 
26077 Great food, great atmosphere. Can't wait to come back. The ribeye & gold standard beer were fantastic. Kris is a phenomenal chef! 
26078 I love this place. Dr. Blick is so friendly and funny. Her staff is excellent and they have a great selection of frames. Definitely would recommend them! 
26079 A great cafe I stumbled upon by accident in downtown. The food, service and price were all amazing. Plus it is locally owned. I will definitely be back and recommend it to anyone in the area. 
26080 Inconspicuous little place with a very warm interior and attentive staff. Quickly became my "definitely come back to" place. 
26081 Nice historic place to see. See the statue of Captain Parker, a memorial for those who served on the USS Lexington, and the town's parish. 
26082 So many food options. I had flautas it was delicious and the buffalo cauliflower. So yummy and very cute ambiance.. lots of outdoor seating. Great place for vegan/vegetarian 
26083 Decent place, if i could give it a 3.5 stars I would. the Shrimp Grits were surprisingly delicious and make sure to come in on a Wednesday for "Wine Down Wednesday". excellent deal. 
26084 Always great service. They explain things the way you can understand, they are friendly, and professional. 
26085 Never disappointed when I eat here. Everything is so fresh. I LOVE the panang curry. 
26086 The best place for breakfast on the run! Big yummy tacos at a good price. 
26087 Great fro-yo, and tons of choices. I like the choose your topping buffet line, where I can get as much or as little as I want. 
26088 Have fallen in love with this restaurant!! Will start to miss the taste one week after the previous visit. The pork belly rice bowl is amazing!!! The owner of the restaurant is so friendly as well!! 
26089 I stopped in Memorial day to try a Caramel Bullseye to cool off. It was amazing! So much better than any commercial espresso drink that I've ever had. I will definitely be a weekly customer. 
26090 Z√© Avocado toast brunch offering is super yummy-wummy! The building is lovely modern simplicity. Thank you. 
26091 Everything at Scott's was excellent. The food, service, lots of parking! A hidden treasure. 
26092 Yummy Yummy donuts well priced and great for a late night snack after eating!! So many flavored to choose from and friendly staff - great experience I'll be back! 
26093 AFter reading several good reviews, I went here and was very disapointed. They advertise it as a BBQ place, but there was not a large BBQ menu. The food was decent, but certainly not noteworthy. Maybe since I come from the South I have a higher standard of BBQ. 
26094 Love very this place. Friendly and they did a great job! I'm not from here and took a chance. Locals there said they have been coming for years. 
26095 Delicious food, wonderful people, and friendly family vibe in a small cosy restaurant 
26096 Friendly people and the food is good. Price is about average. The side dishes are good. 
26097 The best clam chowder we had while visiting Boston. 
26098 Great customer service. Very friendly and courteous in the service department. They went above and beyond amazing customer service! I would recommend them. Repaired my truck properly. 
26099 WENT HAM. The Tikki Marsala is a must have. Make sure to order naan with the curry mussels because they load you up with that DANK sauce. The wait staff is great. Must make a reservation! ~1.5 hour wait at 7pm on a Saturday without one. 
26100 Wine club with a dynamite restaurant. Definitely one of our favorites. Good value on the wine and the food is wonderful at a reasonable price. Nice atmosphere and good service. Strongly recommended. 
26101 Jen and Jen are amazing- they are courteous, professional and carry the best in healthy organic products. They are an asset to Arlington in every way! 
26102 Friendly staff, but incredibly claustrophobic inside. It's fine, but it doesn't stick out in my memory as particularly good or bad pizza. 
26103 Absolutely stunning mocha, think it's the best one I've ever had! The owner is really sweet and friendly. She really cares what goes into her product. Let's keep this place in business! 
26104 Incredibly good hot sauce! The atmosphere is fair. The food overall is below average. Their cheese is the worst I've experienced in any Mexican restaurant ever. The staff however is extremely friendly and offer good service. I wouldn't ever return unless they ditch that horrible liquid microwave cheese. 
26105 Vicki has done an amazing job tinting my eyelashes, I had a bit of an eyeliner effect for days afterwards! The color didn't fade until 2 months after! Will definitely be back! 
26106 The good- $1 beer on Thursday nights, drunk college students, boys singing Nsynch and Back street boys, dj upstairs The Bad- Not too many people dancing upstairs, $7 for drinks, 
26107 I've been there twice. I don't have anything bad to say, and Dustin is the most fabulous waiter ever. He was so funny and awesome, really brightened up my day. Definitely will come back. 
26108 My go to for great seafood, have some of he raw oysters, definitely won't regret it!!! 
26109 Amazing Caribbean food!!! Live music was great, he played some good Jamaican tunes.. great atmosphere! 
26110 Best popcorn in town with probably the best prices. On a Tuesday you can see a movie for $4. Good beer selection. Quaint old school theatre. Seats are ok some are kinda broken but you won't mind because it all makes sense. 
26111 Not at all express. Tried to get an oil change 2 days in a row. 2 hour wait and they dont offer appointments. Went to Hondacure and hey got me in n out in less than an hour. 
26112 these folks are on the ball. they pay attention to each person in the store. they never hesitate to come out from behind the register to offer help. I've really enjoyed my trips to the store. 
26113 Fresh! Everything was spot on fresh. We had a group of meet eaters and vegans. Perfect location for all 
26114 The most glorious deep tissue massage I've ever had! 
26115 Great place, good staff and friendly owners. Best sound system in a bar and venue of its size in PDX. 
26116 There is nothing Thai about the Thai bowl. The peanut sauce hits your mouth the wrong way and then doesn't leave. It's aggressively... bad. Props for the raspberry hibiscus agua fresca, though. 
26117 Done with this place. They messed up my order. Charged me regular price during happy hour because I ordered to go. And the quality was like Taco Bell. Never again. 
26118 I've had ramen from Japan to New York and places in between. The ramen was way too oily. Pretty gross, actually. 
26119 Coconut cream pie ...... just get it I promise you! The VIP martini or the margarita!! The guy always at the bar makes the best drinks. The prime cheeseburger... you won't regret it ! 
26120 Great food, great service, i love this restaurant! The dolmathes, kalamarakia, gyros and souvlaki are my personal favorites and they are the best. 
26121 Can't get enough of this place. Right around the corner from where I work and it's def a good treat. 
26122 Worst experience EVER! Not only was the staff unprofessional and unfriendly, but the food gave me food poisoning and ruined the middle of my SXSW spring break trip. What a waste of time, money, and a meal. Beware... 
26123 Last minute reservation via a cheap car app. Worked out great, ended up extending the car a day.1 easy phone, done. Good price, ez pass, xm radio and COLD ac... And the car didn't stink! Bonus.. Thanks Action car rental. William is a great shuttle driver. 
26124 Very friendly and easy to work with. Did an awesome job on two of my suit coats for an unbelievable price. Also, the work was done remarkably quick - only about 4 business days. If you need a tailor, go here. 
26125 The ambiance, service and food were OUTSTANDING! The burrata was the best I've ever had and our other dishes were absolutely delicious! I absolutely recommend this amazing restaurant! 
26126 I have gone here twice and I definitely enjoy the food. The presentation is beautiful and the servers are attentive. However, for the price of the food I feel that flavor is lacking that "wow" factor. 
26127 Bronson gave the most perfect customer service! Kudos! And the quinoa porridge rocked! 
26128 I had the Crispy shrimp, crispy fish, and beef tacos... All of them were really good... It's a different type of sauce with some tang for the fish tacos.. The service was good... The young lady was very knowledgable of the menu... I would definitely recommend.. 
26129 Very casual little joint. I found the food to be bland and forgettable, which is too bad because this is a place I wanted to like. The people seem nice. 
26130 Place was rockin! Had the Hawthorne and Tilikum sliders. They were amazing. Never woulda thought that strawberry jam and gruyere cheese on a beef patty would work together. 
26131 Worst customer service ever. Wouldn't even let me use my birthday coupon. These guys should not exist 
26132 Delicious soups all the time. Love eating there and then buying frozen soups that I can enjoy for home. Check this place out. 
26133 Such a great variety of food, and the staff is great! I love the tapas menu, and the locating is great. The patio is perfect, and there were lots of kids playing in the park area just off the patio. Our boys had a blast and a great meal. 
26134 This place is officially back on my A list! Ordered for delivery today. Everything was perfect, delicious and hot! Get the fries "well done" and they'll be crispy and delicious! 
26135 The people who work here are great. They get the work done fast and for a fair price. And they are so nice! Everyone is so friendly, even the guys that don't work in the front office. Definitely coming back if I have more tire problems! 
26136 Awesome service! Very reasonable prices! They did a full and honest inspection. Went over every detail and service turn around was pretty quick relative to other shops! 
26137 Good burgers, not amazing. Not as good as I remember from years ago in another city...but okay. Cheese sauce was a little weird...tasted like it's from a can and pretty plain. Not sure the kobe double was worth the money, but always a pretty good burger, nevertheless. 
26138 Definitely not bad. Really cool set up. Very good beer list. The lobster perogies were definitely the highlight. My cheesesteak was very basic and my girlfriend's veggie burger had the consistency of a sloppy joe, pretty disappointing. We'll probably go back and try it again. 
26139 Hands down , this is one of the best food carts in Portland. The shrimp fritters were delicious and the kaleguen mannok was amazing. The kaleguen mannok had the perfect spice and flavor combination. I cannot wait to go back. 
26140 Leo is an extremely knowledgeable piercer. He was patient and hilarious. He has the perfect personality to make you feel at ease. I wouldn't get my piercings done anywhere else. 
26141 Love love love Hopdoddy. I get random cravings for the Kobe Burger and just thinking of the chili cheese fries makes me melt :) 
26142 I'd give it a three, but ....you know what to expect when you come to a place like this, and fine, it serves that up with a smile. And the outdoor patio is nice, the traffic sounds kind of fade into the background. 
26143 Got some take out from here Friday morning and the woman bartender was delightful! Just came in for a snack and a beer, waitress is very friendly. Cute place, great service 
26144 I had the grilled cheese and chicken noodle soup on my lunch break. It was absolutely wonderful. The woman working were very pleasant also. I can't wait to try a "take and bake" dinner!! 
26145 Quality gone down a bit since it first opened. Ordered a half sweet sago milk tea and it just tasted like cold milk, no tea taste at all- kinda gross. I've had the same drink in the downtown location and it was a lot better. 
26146 Pretty good. It's not the biggest house, but they do it well. Really dark, for those of you for who care about that. Nothing innovative, but a classic example of the genre. 
26147 This is the best nightclub in Austin. I love the sound system they put in place and the lighting is stunning. Kingdom is definitely the spot for after hours or catching a good edm set. 
26148 Perfect desserts with fresh fruits and ice cream made in house. Pricey. Go for: perfectly prepared desserts, good service Don't go for: budget desserts 
26149 I shopped here again for my birthday. My spouse called them ahead of time and they had set up a room with champagne and all the clothes in my size and style. LOVE LOVE LOVE! 
26150 Awesome tacos!! My husband and I stopped by for a late night taco(or 4) and were amazed. Some of the best tacos we have had in Texas. Highly recommend the steak tacos, in a word, delicious! 
26151 Friendly owner, very good food and even better service! Very generous portioning! Will be a regular after today 
26152 Great brunch material, had the Migas scramble and it was fantastic: peppers, cheese, chorizo, and tortilla strips. Great coffee too. My friends and I sat and talked for a couple hours after we ate and weren't rushed at all. Hit it up! 
26153 Had a blast!! We had Captain Nicholas, he made the excursion so fun! The tour was also informative, telling us all about the history of bridges, boats and buildings. Would highly recommend. Wear sunscreen!! 
26154 a madhouse at lunch, but the service was unbelievably friendly and personal. i'm a vegetarian (!) and this was a big group/family lunch w/ my 2 year old and they were so accommodating. i was impressed. 
26155 Absolutely awful! Meat was boiled and hard. The salsa tasted like chemicals. The chimichangas were completely stale. They are supposed to be crispy. Otherwise you might as well order a burrito. Gross waste of time and calories. 
26156 I have a mission in life to try everyone of Gourdoughs desert dounghnuts!! I am in love!! 
26157 I had the most pleasant and nice experience at this lulu lemon. Staff, one woman in particular was very kind and helpful. If your looking for a great lulu experience I'd go to this one! 
26158 Very good food. Friendly owner. "Hello my friends" reasonable prices. 
26159 chode overload. 
26160 Coolest little hole in the wall. ABO has to be a hidden gem! If you like seafood this one is for you. The service is great and they have some good beers on tap! If you go be sure to order an oyster shooter! You won't be disappointed. 
26161 Our car was in service for a week. We have been calling all week to get at least some feedback and a plan of action. Nothing yet. Awful. 
26162 Great food and service perfect location Def recommend for date night Great wines to choose from The salmon and steak were great Salads very tasty too Don't fill up on bread though Sides and apps are def shareable Don't bring the kids 
26163 Great food, drinks and location in gastown. Had a fantastic tuna tatare here and sampled some great micro brew beers. nice to sit outside in summer. 
26164 Authentic Mexican tacos! For real!!! Really good flavors. Tried carne asada, al pastor and shrimp tacos. Customer service also outstanding. Definitely coming back for some Mexican Street corn. 
26165 They do amazing work and have a fast turnover. I would trust Josey or any of her staff with any alteration. They've fixed my bridesmaids dresses and hemmed pants for reasonable rates. I live in Miami but wait until I'm in Orlando to get my clothes altered-- they're that good! 
26166 this place was much better before they grandfathered in all of the old Bally's members...now the place is overcrowded and they STILL are trying to sign up new members every day. YUCK! 
26167 This is a great place for slurpees and bus passes....come ON!!!! ...whoops. 
26168 Always love the Wolf! Great food, atmosphere is cool! Sometimes a long wait to eat but it's worth it. The bar is fun to sit at and the staff is always nice. Would recommend this place for a low key Mexican meal! 
26169 Susan was so helpful in helping me spec out our door knobs and hardware for our house in Wellesley as well as our home in Maine. The product lines that she carries are very unique. Highly recommend NDH. 
26170 Great food great service..Rammers a long time..and again..a great cook! Been to this place several times..never disappointed 
26171 Wonderful service and wonderful food. Hosted 53 Girl Scouts and their leaders this past Friday. Food was quick and HOT - which never normally go together. The servers were wonderful and it was so very organized. Greatly appreciate the A+ service. Excellent venue for groups! Highly recommend! 
26172 What a fun place! I'd never been and my girlfriend took me here for desert as part of a magical mystery tour / scavenger hunt date she arranged for us. This place screams Portland eccentricity and backs it up with great tea and deserts. Definitely going back. 
26173 I love this place. Excellent live music most nights, wide variety of styles (try Friday night), cheap drink, unpretentious atmosphere, crowded and tiny and everyone in high spirits. One of the better night-places in all Boston, I opine. Open as late as it gets around here (~1 am). 
26174 Always very pleased when we go to Pet Life. Our pup likes going there, and she always finds something to take home. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and always ready to help. We've made Pet Life almost a weekly trip, it's enjoyable for us and our pup. 
26175 Donna is great! She's the perfect massage therapist! She makes sure you're comfy and warm! Her technique helps me relax and she's super friendly! I highly recommend her services and I'll be returning for more massages in the future! 
26176 Nice cozy atmosphere with wood and dark colors. Very friendly service. Georgia Trout entree was excellent. Fresh fish with nice flavors. Corn souffl√© was to die for. Also had mushroom side dish which was also very good. 
26177 First time experience at Kublai Khan and it was delicious. Nice staff, friendly service. Will definitely be back when were in town next 
26178 I received the best salon services and was educated as to how I could keep up with my new and fabulous look! Bill Boley gave me a fresh, modern cut, color, and style that I can maintain with minimal effort. I highly recommend Bill as a forever go-to expert stylist! 
26179 Food was pretty tasty (especially the octopus). Service was absolutely fantastic. Food made me and my GF feel very sick though and resulted in diarrhea the next morning. (Maybe the cheesecake?) 
26180 Like all vintage shops Hattie's can be hit or miss. One thing that is never amiss is quality. Always exceptional quality in the hand picked items here. A frequent turnover is motivating to always check and see what's new and lovely! 
26181 Costco is great. This one also has a tire place with GREAT deals on tires. The best part is, while they change your tires, you can shop! Everyone who works here is friendly and nice. 
26182 I write as I wait in line at lunch time, as I do frequently. Long line, one person working, the place is dirty...ridiculous. 
26183 What a great place! Beautiful displays, friendly staff. I saw the most beautiful coat ever - a Chloe with print fabric and great detailing. Too big for me, but there were loads of things in small and extra small. I'll definitely be going back here! 
26184 Best breakfast wrap! No cheese, eggs, chorizo, and yam! Great seasoning and very filling! 
26185 Great toppings, great onion rings, real farm raised beef, great fries. Loved sitting on there outdoor patio. Fast service even though the line was horrible. 
26186 Long wait time on weekend mornings, and tables are close together you feel like your sitting with your neighbours.. Breakfast is good, I enjoyed my waffles and yogurt, food came fast. Speciality coffees and lattes are also great. 
26187 Delicious homemade ice cream!! Classic flavors (vanilla, chocolate) as well as new spins on classics such as chocolate and roasted cherry in almond ice cream, as well as totally unique flavors, like blue berry cobbler, fennel, and lemon meringue pie! All homemade and fresh! Can't wait to come back again. 
26188 This place has great produce, but even better, it's got a cafe with free wi-fi, without which I could not be writing this review right now. Thank you Harvest! 
26189 love this place, great prices and good tasting viet food.. 
26190 The food is great, and so is the service. We ordered beef tenderloin and Bouillabaisse. I especially like the crab cakes. 
26191 Love the penne rosa with the parm chicken. Great prices. 
26192 I didn't appreciate how they can charge what they charge and have HORRIBLE CHEAP silverware. The 2 must match. Waffle House silverware is better than this place. Our waitress was nice and attentive. But i won't be going back. 
26193 Wonderful staff. The owners are very friendly. We take our border collie to them frequently and are never disappointed. They are wonderful with all breeds and dog personalities. (Ours is a little coo-coo and they handle her well - with care). 
26194 Had brunch there yesterday and was very impressed. Excellent steak tartar. Would go again for sure. 
26195 It's the perfect tavern. Shoutout to Riley who makes a mean Bloody Mary! The tavern burgers are the perfect size and price. Yum! 
26196 Sweet potato fries with the Chipotle sauce was amazing. Laid back atmosphere and live music. Would recommend for dinner and a few drinks. The sandiamo is by far my favorite cocktail! 
26197 European Aromas World Class Tastes Yummy Gluten free options Sugar free too Good place to see the world go by ... WE sat outside , just a perfect experience ....my Coffee was The BEST so far this year .. this is a "Go To place for Cakes that taste delicious 
26198 Recent opening, 2nd week Dec last year. A narrow layout, busy corner one so takes some pressure off the Alberni. one, just a few blocks away. open 24 hrs. Nice fireplace area with lounge seats at the front. Window seating in the back. Friendly service, as usual. 
26199 Sarah was extremely professional and her space was comfortable. She described everything she used on us and offered extras without being pushy. Also the First time I got my eyelashes tinted. I love them! Thank you for taking care of us. 
26200 All I can say is this place is outstanding, it's clean and the people that work there are the best ,I hope the same people are here when I come back again. 
26201 Great car wash and very personable will be back again soon !! Love the fact that they are open till 7 and right off the highway ! 
26202 Not only is this a convenient walk from my office, but the service, the food and the menu selection is just superb for a small family-owned restuarant. Would highly recommend. 
26203 Came here for an afternoon pint during memorial day this year, and like many bars it seemed a little scruffy in the daylight, a dankness which I'm sure becomes a large part of the atmosphere come nightfall. 
26204 Lifesaver to my daughters and myself. Fair prices, fast service. He doesn't do work that is unessessary like other shops. Owner Sam is honest and trying to build a reputable business after the previous owners. ...don't hesitate to have auto work done at Z&S Wilmington 
26205 Consistantly good salads, pizzas and a delicious veggie sandwich. These folks care about serving a quality product. Service is very good and they have a great bar. 
26206 These are knowledgeable, kindhearted, and benevolent folks. They will treat you and your pups\kitties right! Amazing people. Highly Recommended! 
26207 Shared a number of date night specials with a group of girlfriends. I got to try plenty, even as a semi vegetarian. Delicious, fun, and satisfying. Will be back with my husband. 
26208 An amazing way to spend an evening. I had no idea how much fun live comedy is. It pleasantly exceeded my expectations. 
26209 Been here half a dozen times, tasted almost every one of their salts, never got hassled or pressured to buy anything. Now I own two finishing salts. Ask them questions and be prepared to be astounded at how much you didn't know about salt. 
26210 Mystic Florist is awesome! The flowers were delivered on time and looked great. I had a time sensitive order and even though they were busy they got the order out. 
26211 Awesome food and service. Drinks are different but still enjoyable. Great ambiance and overall mood to the restaurant. Try the empanadas they are amazing!!! 
26212 Kathy is amazing!!!! It's been years since I have had the pleasure of having nails. I leave feeling pampered and taken care of. This place deserves more then a five star review. 
26213 Excellent service, great food... Just very impressed with everything!... The constant attention and friendliness of the staff as well as the cleanliness!.. Just wow!! 
26214 Nice hotel. Clean and neat. Great service. Room a/c is perfect. Conveniently located near the Orange County Convention Center. 
26215 The Doctor is very good and so genuine 
26216 I highly recommend this business 
26217 He is treating my foot problems with great success 
26218 Oh how miss this place. This place was so convenient for me while I was at work. They have one the best Cuban sandwich in central Florida. Along with that, they have amazing customer service. 
26219 It says you close at midnight tonight. Attempted to enter at 11pm and you are closed. Bummer. 
26220 This has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in my new area. The food is delicious and the prices are absurdly cheap. Yum! 
26221 Love the vibe and food here. One of my favorite drinks on their menu is Moscow mule but they no longer have the copper cups for serving.... not as good. Otherwise would have gotten a 5 star. 
26222 I've never had a more perfect cocktail in this city... if you're a HUGE Columbus Alive! Follower.... that's fine.. go somewhere else and leave me seats at my favorite cocktail joint. ....I should have married Gary when I had the chance. 
26223 When buying a new home and coming up with decisions for flooring can be difficult. Rashida made our process so much less complicated. She is an expert in what she does and very knowledgeable. I highly recommend simpleFLOORS. 
26224 Very tasty ice cream, love the espresso flavor. Another favorite is their seasonal Oatmeal flavor one. Would go back for more I like this place a bit more than the other carts for ice cream. 
26225 Great drinks over happy hour. The wine that followed was awesome!!!... The salad I had might not have been the best but it was good. Prices were to not extensive. The vibe of the place is good and service was decent. 
26226 Great food with giant portions. It was pretty late Saturday night, but the service was still quick and very friendly. This is some of the best Chinese I've had. 
26227 Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. These are the BEST donuts I've had in a long time. 
26228 I Love Huetiful. Or maybe just Lashea lol just joking but she is awesome seriously. Everyone there are very polite and knowledgeable. I've been to her, Jennifer and Christina. The steam treatment is like no other. The wash the BEST. THE products are the BEST! Just Go!!! 
26229 Target does not price match with other Target stores. " because they are competitively priced in each store neighborhood. This sounds like price discrimination based on where you live. I do not agree with the policy. 
26230 Had a mixup about an appointment (my fault) and they were great at following up to resolve it. 
26231 Food was okay, nothing special. Prices were also middle of the road. I'm a tough critic so only 2/5. It's an okay place to eat, though I probably won't come back unless I have friends who want to try this place. 
26232 Food was amazing. Did notice they were a bit short staffed. Nonetheless id return! Very satisfied 
26233 The food was 'eh. I can't say it was bad or delicious. A bit too Americanize to be a great Mexican spot 
26234 Love this place, prices are reasonable, normally they don't charge me for nail cut for my Boston Terrier, $10.00, they did this time, there for I couldn't leave a tip :) but they are great, I love helping animals. 
26235 This place is affordable (that's for sure!), as one person can eat for $10 or less. The burgers have creative toppings, but are always too greasy for me. However, one thing this place has that will keep me coming back: sweet potato tater tots with maple bacon ketchup. Excellent! 
26236 So much fun! I went with three friends and we did the ship room. We didn't solve the mystery but it was still tons of fun. 
26237 Two words the morning after a sushi takeout: Food poisoning! Both my wife and I are dealing with the after effects. Buyer beware! 
26238 The BEST pizza in town! A little pricey compared to other pizza joints, but I can't help but to return over and over again! The Caesar dressing is the best! 
26239 Dang good brunch. Biscuits are to die for, and I love the potato cakes. Highly recommend! 
26240 I booked two rooms and only one room was available at 4pm. However the bed was not made, sheets unchanged, food on the floor. As of 4.30pm the second room is still not available. Very disappointed! 
26241 Amazing place - very fortunate this is in Central Ohio 
26242 Ordered Dokla's to go today. They tasted old and rancid. Quality has gone way down here. 
26243 I love this place! The new owner is very welcoming and it's her personality that really makes this place special. We had excellent drinks and the wings were perfect. Neither of was hungry when we got there but they smelled so good, we couldn't resist. No regrets. 
26244 I LOVE this place. The owner is the sweetest gentleman, and makes sure everything you order is exactly how you ordered it. My coffee was fantastic. The whole experience was made that much better just by seeing the owner's smile light up the room. Would HIGHLY recommend 
26245 Accidentally pass by this place. Friendly and knowledgeable staffs - specially Lucy. great ambience ,very affordable and has wifi enable. We ordered cafe con leche, cafe americano, pabellon arepa, Venezuelan empanadas ,ham and cheese sandwich. Fast service but delicious. Highly recommended. 
26246 We had a long wait for food that was mediocre at best. It's a shame, because we were looking forward to having an option for Middle Eastern type food in College Park. 
26247 Best gourmet burger in Austin. Other places (in my opinion) serve a better 'grease burger' (Wholly Cow, El Camino, etc...) but this is the best high-quality-meat-burger I've had in Austin...so far 
26248 Great Soup and Sandwiches. Freshly made on premises. Too full to try the Shoo-Fly Pie. But will take away and have it for dessert at home. Yum! 
26249 Great food, great drinks, great service and great guacamole! I came here with a group of friends a couple weeks ago and can't wait to go back. 
26250 Not impressed. Got a combination dinner, none of the items were good and the spring rolls tasted like chemical cleaner. 
26251 This McDonalds is kid friendly. They have a stool in the bathroom so the kids can reach the water and a small library of kids books. Every so often they bring in Elmo or some other character for the kids. 
26252 wow, all these reviewers have no idea what good Cuban food taste like. The croquetas were not fresh or homemade. The eggs with ham were okay at best. The COFFEE (a prime reason for Cuban breakfast) was mediocre. I'm actually stunned - avoid it 
26253 They deliver! Amazing burger and great service. Interesting beer list, good soda variety and Merlot on a carbonated tap (spoiler: Yummy!) So many choices at the PCM, glad we made this one. 
26254 The steak was absolutely delicious last night at dinner! I have never tasted one so splendidly cooked before in a restaurant! Please kiss the chef for me and tell him how incredibly talented he is! Definitely peeps, go check this establishment out! Worth every penny!! 
26255 This is the best bubble tea for mango lovers. They use fresh cut mangos in your drink with tiny cubed gelatin. I enjoyed every bit/sip of the signatures go drink. This is seriously amazingly delectably the best. You have to come and try it. 
26256 I was originally terrified to get my lashes done because I've heard/seen so many horror stories about losing your lashes and bad reactions, but I've been coming to Mink for years and never had an issue! Amazing customer service and technicians leave my lashes always looking their best 
26257 Our server was great, the pizzas were amazing, the meat sauce could have been better, but all in all it was a very nice experience after a long day in the parks. Very kids friendly and better than most places in this price range in downtown Disney. 
26258 One of the freshest fish and sushi available in Boston. You can also go to blanchard's next door to pick up alcohol and they will serve it to you. 
26259 Vegan Chocolate Peanut Butter Milkshake = Insane. I'm in love. Thank you for being awesome. 
26260 We came to see what all the buzz was about..had good burgers and good drinks but no Marky Mark :( 
26261 Exactly what you should expect from a hole in the wall neighborhood bar! This is always our last stop on the way home. It's dark lighting, dart board, and shitty Vegas carpet are why I actually like this bar (judgement free). 
26262 Everyone keeps talking about happy hour this and happy hour that... Get the muu burger. Done and done. The burger is incredible. Like nothing I've had at other places. Just do it. 
26263 Stopped in for a quick bite and was More than pleased with service and the meal what a good place for sea food 
26264 Good jalape√±o poppers, huge order of fries. My milkshake was ok I was expecting better but it was just ok. Definitely will need to try a burger next time. 
26265 there thai coconut is a staple in my diet, there pizza is pretty good considering they're fast casual- go here for great salads and sandwiches! 
26266 It's a simple ride above Tomorrowland, but it is very enjoyable. Be sure to ride it at night, if it's the only chance you get. The night views are beautiful--you can even see the castle. 
26267 Website is easy to use, and they post pictures of each tire. Tires were delivered in less than a day. Came in on a Saturday and they changed out all 4 tires in about 30 minutes. Tire Kingz is the real deal. 
26268 We've had two truly excellent meals here. The food seems more authentic than most American Thai restaurants, very delicious, and served with classic Thai friendliness. The staff could not have been more eager to please or more accommodating. A gem for all who love Thai cuisine and hospitality. 
26269 My 3 yr old and I came right at lunch rush. The lady behind the counter was very kind and helpful, as I had no clue what I wanted. The food came out much faster than I expected. The food was delicious and priced well. 
26270 In our visits to Portland to see family, we regularly visit Bijou Cafe, and it does not disappoint. The eggs, pancakes and french toast are all done to perfection. I believe they do more than just breakfast, but this is clearly their specialty and it should not be skipped. 
26271 This eatery is very convenient to Boston Common and accommodates a wide variety of food preferences, which works well for our family- meat-loving kid, vegetarians, a finicky eater, and eat-anything types. The food is good, but not great. 
26272 Stopped in here this morning on the way to the airport at the end of a vacation. Excellent tasting and presented Belgian waffle, Rio Bowl and coffee and very reasonably priced. I wish we had something like this place back home. 
26273 Very Portland. Long lines, but worth the wait for unique flavors. Perfect place bring out of town guests for a portlandia experience! 
26274 DO NOT HIRE THIS MOVER!! HE took my $1,000.00 "deposit" and never made the move - did not call me, text me or email me. He is a scammer. The sheriff has been made aware of him and his theft. DO NOT HIRE!! 
26275 Great snacks, interesting drinks, short and to the point menu, wonderful service and atmosphere. Wish I stayed for dinner!!!!! 
26276 Not only were the drinks creative and fun the service was excellent. While you definitely pay for the creativity it is all worthwhile! I would recommend it to anyone stopping in and visiting. 
26277 This place was great! We split the Country Clucker and the Southern Belle for dessert. We are from Houston, but this will be a new go to when we are in town. 
26278 The greens are very sweet and delicious. I got the large chicken and there was enough for two people. Its a small hole in the wall but it is definetely worth trying to locate. I would go back to atlanta to try it again. 
26279 Favorite breakfast place in the world. Delicious food and the best Bloody Mary you'll find. I really appreciate the many locations! Definitely recommend. 
26280 This must be the SLOOOWEST BK in the country, if your in a rush stay away...I do like that my food is hot no matter the long wait. 
26281 I like this place. Good prices on beer and food. TVs everywhere. 
26282 I've been doing 1v1 work with John over the past year and I can't say enough good things. I had always wanted to try boxing and am very lucky to have found Back Bay. he helped me learn all the basics...and fun way to get back in shape. 
26283 The food was good, first time eating there with family. My husband loved the sea bass and lobster mac & cheese, I got the stuffed chicken breast with the sweet potatoe casserole. Very good food, a little pricey thou, good thing we had a gift card. 
26284 One of the best happy hours in northwest Austin! Great margaritas and the view of the lake is nice. It can be hard to get a table during happy hour though. Would recommend getting their early! 
26285 Good place for darts earlier in the night (too crowded later) or if you want to hang out w/ a bunch of BC kids. Also good to have a beer while doing laundry next door. 
26286 Great food and service. Best chicken marsala we have had. Baked ziti was great too. Totally recommend the garlic toast with cheese. The paper on the tables seemed a little odd to us. Overall a good experience. 
26287 Awesome pizza, I love this place. Just like new York pizza and staff is very friendly. 
26288 it was some of the best fried chicken that i've had. cant believe it took me so long to finally get in there and try it out, will definitely eat again! 
26289 Decent ice cream rolls. Just not enough flavor in the ice cream itself. Sweet workers. Artistic while they create. 
26290 My friend told me about this place and said we had to go. We both brought our ladies and all 4 of us enjoyed our food. Very casual place. You pour your own coffee which I think is convenient. 
26291 Everything was very well prepared. Friendly staff. Definitely recommend to tie food aficionados 
26292 If you haven't been to Willow Tree yet, then what are you even doing with your life? The best German food you can possibly find. Theo is awesome. This place is the crown jewel of downtown Sanford. 
26293 I want say that the previous issues have been resolved. I tend to react before discussing the problems and apologize to the provider for this. There was some misunderstanding and this has been worked out. 
26294 By far the best fried chicken from a restaurant I have ever tasted and the fact that the batter has a little spice to it is perfect! Hands down the best friend chicken spot in Texas! 
26295 I reserved a truck for a one-way, three-day move to another city. The truck was ready even though we arrived about an hour before our scheduled pick-up. The staff was very friendly and the truck was clean. 
26296 Nice atmosphere and convenient downtown location with decently priced and artfully crafted coffee. Recommended. 
26297 The service was great. The food was excellent. I ordered the Minestrone soup and the Canneloni al Panna. It was delicious. We went Saturday evening. The restaurant got crowded very quickly. So making a reservation is a good idea. 
26298 Food is decent, but waited in line FOREVER. Not quite the same experience as 4R. 
26299 Hands down the best hair salon! Natalia is awesome, and the staff are all super friendly. I always leave looking like a million bucks. Highly reccomend this place! 
26300 Waffles? Good. Corn dogs? Good. Pomme frites? Goood. The only downfall is that it is very cramped, maybe 5-8 tables for two? Much more suited for grab and go. Try the truffle ketchup. It's to DIE for! 
26301 Warning, Cash only at ALL registers. The cashiers are not friendly and appear to be angry. There is lots of trash thrown in corners of bathrooms. Overall an unpleasant visit. 
26302 Caffee Medici is legit. The quality of their coffee is amazing. The location is trendy, study friendly and the baristas are coffee experts. By far my favorite coffee shop in Austin. 
26303 Took my pants in for an alteration. They never called to notify me the pants were ready AND they incorrectly altered my pants. Thus completely ruining my suit for a wedding I will be attending. Not recommended you go here fir alterations. 
26304 Brown Butter Blondie ($7.50) - 3/5 - Not a big fan of the blondie. Rocky Road Magic Cone ($7.50) - 5/5 - I only like marshmallows in s'mores and now, in this magic cone. Next time: soft serve, root beer float, and/or milkshake. 
26305 Good happy hour selection, so may beers on tap. They can get really busy happy hour with no seating in bar area though 
26306 What a nice little reflexology oasis in midtown. One hour of bliss and relaxation. I love it all. Even the head and Dave massage coupled with the should and neck rub. What would have been even more fantastic if the technician played and combed my hair. 
26307 This place is a treat. I was excited to hear a place in town sells katsu chicken. I wasn't disappointed... their serving size, price, and quality is perfect for me. 
26308 My new favorite place to eat in PDX! The drinks are really great! They do $5 wine before 5pm and it's usually really good. My favorite is the charcuterie board for an appetizer and the mushroom pizza add prosciutto! 
26309 Yummy. Great salad with steak, corn empanadas and some egg dish we got and was delicious. They have outdoor seating also. 
26310 I love Engine House! I live in Cali and every time I come to visit Salem, I must have a meatball sub or the Italian sub. Pizzas are great here as well. But I love this place. 
26311 OMG this building is fricking beautiful! 
26312 House of blues is a pretty decent venue. It tends to be overpriced but the sound quality is quite good. I like that the Floor admission is pretty much the whole venue, I just wish it wasn't so packed all the time! 
26313 The pizza is way overpriced and so thin with barely any toppings that my partner and I end up eating the whole pie... we always have leftovers with other Portland pizzas. The employees are pretty nice but that doesn't make up for the shitty pizza. 
26314 ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The spicy seafood pasta is to die for! The atmosphere is quaint and relaxing. Highly recommend. 
26315 Best Chinese delivery I've ever had. Generous portions- I can eat off one entree for 3 days. Speedy delivery too, it's never taken more than 45 minutes unless they were super busy. 
26316 Liked it very much. Pleasant environment, owners are very nice and appear sincere, and the food is very good. Salsas are excellent. We've been needing something good around here and now we've got it! 
26317 Loved this place! Service amazing, food was great, and the people overall was amazing. The atmosphere had such a great aura 
26318 Great lunch spot! Staff, lunch specials, pizza all amazing. Nice outdoor seating on a sunny day 
26319 I got a pulled pork plate, cup of soup and a sweet tea for $20 with tip. Got real expensive real fast. Would have given 5 stars if prices were better. Waitress gives good hugs though :) she was sweet and the food was great. 
26320 What a great experience! A neighbor recommended we take our bike here to get some problems looked at before selling the bike. John went above and beyond to help us out! Seriously- coming back here with any bike questions/problems/purchases. 
26321 when you want a nice and cheap meal or it's 3am. This is the place. 
26322 Jamie was both offensive and hospitable lol the burgers were amazing Shawns chef skills were amazing. Thanks for the wonderful evening you guys! RAD! 
26323 Good flavors, very cool location across from the Mexican Consulate. Unfortunately I discovered this place in the post-lactose phase of my life. The Interior Mexican Salad is quite good! 
26324 Loved practicing with Debra. Had the privilege of practicing with her one-on-one and she's very easy to follow and attentive to making sure you're pushing yourself without hurting yourself. She's knowledgeable and a great instructor. Enjoyed her class immensely and will definitely continue to go back. 
26325 Their vanilla is the best I've ever had in my vanilla latte. Always a good coffee here. 
26326 Fabulous spa experience highly recommend! Friendly nice staff that provide best quality service! 
26327 Horrible service. Slow service. Dirty. If you like getting ignored then come here. The waitresses and waiters don't care. The mango pudding was like yellow water. 
26328 For the past 3 times espresso has been brutal. 0 crema which is never a good sign. I hope the training can improve as I do like coming here bit will stop if espresso doesn't improve. 
26329 The best Chinese food I have ever had, not to mention it's 100% vegan. Decent prices, top notch service, and ah-mazing food is an unbeatable combination. 
26330 It's your typical authentic (Americanized) Chinese with a sushi bar ( that should be a warning!). Fills the stomach but doesn't leave much taste in the mouth. 
26331 Delicious with reasonable prices. The food is authentic, the Cuban sandwich is big, the plantains are perfect. Would recommend if you want authentic cuban food. 
26332 If you are looking for a less crowded alternative to Spice with more accessible parking and equally good food, come to Tamarind House. Some of the selection is kind of limited, but the staff is dedicated to making you happy. Great Pad Thai! 
26333 The manager here is absolutely awful- he doesn't like his job and shouldn't be a manager customer service skills are EXTREMELY poor. Not ever Going back to that location simply because of him. 
26334 Decent room; good value near airport. Appropriate for 1 nights-stay. Shuttle is available for airport. 
26335 Location is really pretty but service sucked and the food was okay. The workers dont seem to take the job seriously and having to pay for parking is ridiculous. Its a shame that the place isnt better considering the view. 
26336 The aroma of coffee and cardamom is to die for. Be prepared for slow service though 
26337 This place has great bubble tea and good prices. They provide friendly service as well. The only negative is the bad parking around the area as it is on a busy part of Kingsway. 
26338 located in mulligan's old space. beautiful interior. completely redone. open air, lounge, lively. currently has limited menu. items sampled were tasty. service was good. would definitely go back. 
26339 They have a great brunch! The food is fantastic! Lots of selection and fresh local ingredients and ideas. The charcuterie is spot on. 
26340 I go to Dutch bros fairly often, but this place blows Dutch bros out of the water. They use organic coffee beans and give rewards points very generously! Swing by and get some coffee the staff is always friendly! 
26341 Fantastic local restaurant. If ambiance is high on your list, this may not be the place for you, but it's got great food for a reasonable price! 
26342 The food and service is amazing. The restaurant is also clean and I could tell some of the workers really care about the customers. Although a few workers don't really show amusement, many do. 
26343 My new favorite restaurant in Atlanta! Really great service and delicious food. I got the petite steak, baked potato & rice. We also got the Thai chicken skewers for appetizer. The ambiance is perfect for a date night... My fianc√© and I will be coming back :) 
26344 Great veggie burger. Quinoa fried but not "heavy" red beets other stuff beautiful taste. Garlic Parmesan fries with the table side pepper vinegar sauce beautiful warm meal ate outside was super nice good sweet tea too good prices 
26345 The large pieces of jalepinos made the vegetarian dish way too hot. Otherwise trendy and tasty. A twenty minute wait in a Friday night at 7pm. 
26346 So the service and food was good... my only complaint or issue would be the cleanliness of the restaurant! A bottle of cleaner and some rags is just what this place needs! 
26347 I love this place! Its like a BBQ lovers Disneyland! It has everything you could ask for and will provide even novice BBQ'ers with the tools to kill at their next BBQ event! 
26348 We had Love Noodles, Dumpling soup and steamed dumplings. It was very good and since the place was nearly empty at the slightly after lunch time we went, we had totally personal service. We enjoyed the meal and would for sure go back. 
26349 They treat teenagers like theives! they sell overpriced generic crap to teenagers and then accuse them of stealing it. I mean their cd's are cheap...sometimes... and it's not half bad really, but the cramped atmosphere is lacking to say the least. 
26350 I rarely rate as high. food is always reliably excellent. sometimes a hole in the wall is a gem in disguise. keep in mind one important thing - everyone has a different opinion. 
26351 I like the taste of the wings here a little more than pluckers, but it's not right that you have to pay an additional 86 cents for a side of ranch unless you get fries and a drink with your wings...makes your establishment look very cheap. 
26352 Great food, great hookah, and even better service. Ibrahim is very cool and very accommodating. This ain't the Ritz so don't expect that, just relax and have some hookah and enjoy a bit of Turkey! 
26353 Had a wonderful lunch here today. The food is excellent. The owner Charlotte sat with us a bit and gave us a few tips on preparing Lebanese food. It's an hour drive each way but we will make a special trip and go back. 
26354 The fodd was awful, the service poor, the beer was warm and flat, and they di not change the telvision channel when we asked them to do so. Maybe this place is good for a big game, but when it is dead, beware! 
26355 Service: snooty if at all. Food: okay, but nothing special (and pricey). Atmosphere: the patio is in the shadow of an enormous billboard for goodness sake. Nope, won't be going back here anytime soon. 
26356 Love the margaritas here, so fresh and tasty. The decor is fun and beachy, atmosphere is cool and relaxed, I love to come here for a few bites and drinks. In winter they have the outdoor fireplaces - yasss... 
26357 Live music on a Sunday afternoon. Had some drinks and chips/queso. Just came to relax and enjoy the atmosphere. Good place with a nice view of the lake. Same food/drinks as Ollie's in College Park. Little more laid back vibe though. 
26358 Great spot! We sat at the bar and had a few tacos, beer, and margaritas. All of it was good. The house margarita was excellent, good beer selection. The service was really good. 
26359 Great place for full device auto cleaning. The staff are courteous, professional and do quality work. 
26360 I go here mainly for their huge closeout section, but their grocery section is distinctive for an assortment of products from Cleveland and Youngstown, which sets it apart from its competitors. Definitely an excellent choice for the cost-conscious shopper. 
26361 pretty good burgers, but probably the worst ordering system ever invented. I have a suspicion they keep that that ordering system so they will always have a long line. 
26362 Food is good as always.. but the prices are outrageous. $14 for half a turkey sub, bag of Doritos, and a drink. Also, my husband saw a cockroach run across the fountain beverage area. Won't be back if we pass through MCO again. 
26363 Like many businesses in Wakefield, this has such potential but fails to deliver. If you want to differ from the regular groceries, please offer me something worth buying that is unique and tasty. Not just overpriced. 
26364 Absolutely the best meal I have had in Austin in a long time! Super staff and friendly people they go out of their way to serve you delicious food. Expensive but well worth every penny. 
26365 Great service and the food is so good!!! The place is very aesthetically pleasing. I had the crispy chicken noodle soup with chicken dumplings. It was fantastic!!! 
26366 We stumbled on this place by mistake and it's become our favorite go to. The staff are super friendly and the ice cream tastes delicious! So creamy! Many options to choose from and not to mention watching them do the "roll" method. Recommend for sure! 
26367 I would consider going vegetarian if good burgers didn't exist. I got the one that has the jalapeno on it and it was delish!! They also serve drinks while you wait ;) 
26368 Great selection of art/photography classes for adults, reasonably priced. 
26369 Place was very clean. Eddie the waiter was excellent. Very friendly and on top of things. The food was great. Finally found a good place for Chinese. I had been very unhappy lately. This place was great! 
26370 They've changed management and are seemingly running a better business. I carried out cheese cheesebread.. cheese was skimpy but it was still good. Would visit again. Keep up the great work and dont skimp on cheese! :) 
26371 This location as improved so much, must've had some management changes. Now this is such a nice Panera location! Very clean and the employees are very nice and efficient. We feel right at home at our Panera, we come here often and will continue to do so. 
26372 My boyfriend and I came for his pre-birthday celebration and had a blast!!!! Music and drinks were great! Don't come hungry because they don't serve food even tho its on the menu! 
26373 Good Breakfast/Brunch spot, good service, solid menu choices. A bit pricey and not sure if it's worth a long lineup. If you don't have to wait forever, its a great brunch choice. 
26374 Love this place!! I've been going here for 10 years. It is in fact one of the oldest food carts in Portland and the best. When going here bring your appetite! ! Thing burritos are bigger than my head. You can eat on these things for at least 2 days. 
26375 First time here and it won't be our last. We ordered the Banh Xeo as an appetizer to share, which is a good thing because it was a pretty large portion. Was very happy with the Pho, very flavorful. 
26376 My first visit to mod pizza, and I loved it. Despite the long line in front of me, the service was fast, the pizza tasted great and I like the one price no-matter the toppings model. I look forward to introducing my friends to MOD Pizza. 
26377 Honestly... least conveinent fast food i've had. I'm trying to recall that exact morning, but there's some sort of block in my mind filled with four letter words.... At least they gave me a free side serving of Big Mac sauce. 
26378 cool little Starbucks!....and hey, it's open til 10! 
26379 This is under new management. The wine for a Yelp Check-in offer is no longer a deal. I suggest that because it's now called Bistro Coq at Vin that they have to start a new Yelp or get rid of the deal. 
26380 Love her blueberry cheesecake pie and double chocolate cupcakes (gooey chocolate in the middle as well as the icing). The red velvet cake is also delish. Tried some other items which were ok but the three I mentioned are what I'll keep going back for. Support our local businesses! 
26381 Moist lukewarm chicken patty on a doughy bun with wilted lettuce. Disgusting. I have no idea what everyone sees in this chain. 
26382 This was a fun little lunch spot. Kinda like a subway for pizza! And way better.... Parking was a nightmare and I almost gave up on finding this place but I'm glad I didn't. It was delicious. The crust is thin and crispy just how I like it. Definitely recommend 
26383 Great burritos, something different from Anna's / Chipotle / Boca Grande. Very fresh, fast, and cheap. Love the steak burrito, fish burrito is also good (with chipotle sauce). 
26384 De-licous! I got the Miso Ramen which should just about make this cart famous. For a small price you got a lot of what you pay for and it's tasty! 
26385 The only thing that could make it better would be some way to control the Texas heat. Great for lap rides and training. Great people. 
26386 Ted's did a great job of taking care of this issue. My family and I will definitely be back. 
26387 Not impressed. Had to ask 3 different people for help. I was told product not there, that it was discontinued and also told to check the as-is section so after that run around, I wasted about 40m & found it myself. Thanks IKEA! (Sarcastic voice) 
26388 Amazing...enough said. I brought a frozen brisket so my family can join in deliciousness from Austin, Texas Kelly. Winston-Salem, NC 
26389 It has the best Greek food in town. A friend mine is a first generation Greek-Ameican says it is better than any Greek restaurant in Houston or Dallas. They are busy during lunch and slow during evening - they are slightly off beaten path for good night time crowds. 
26390 Most serious chinese noodle I've ever had since I came to US! Hand pull noodle, man I miss that a loooooot! 
26391 Super expensive, Dryer died shortly after it started. it was like $20 to wash and 3 loads. no TV no wifi. Horrible! 
26392 This is probably my favorite Thai restaurant! The food is phenomenal with great spices. My mother makes Thai food at home and this reminds me of her food. I would recommend to go here with family and friends. Also they have great options for if you're vegetarian. 
26393 This place is so good! Yummy breakfast burritos and agua frescas! Only giving them 4 stars because they're not so cheap 
26394 Love this joint! Creative menu, comfortable, great video to watch the game. Had the " fungus amongus" portobello mushroom burger. Delicious! As was the "pot de creme" for desert! Check it out! 
26395 Can't beat this place. Great service and you gotta love their cakes and allergy sensitive service. 
26396 Great place, since it's the original old school location. But I really like the new Peabody location better. 
26397 Lovely atmosphere, massages, and people. I appreciate that I can walk-in and get a quick table massage for an affordable price. I never plan to have pain or an injury... it just happens and I need help NOW, and this is where I go to get it. 
26398 Team had blast doing City Hunt's Scavenger Hunt today. Ran all over downtown San Antonio. 
26399 I always make it a point to stop in for a bowl of soup when I am on the North Shore. They also have a great variety in the fridge! 
26400 This has been my Go-To grocery store for a couple years now. So glad it's finally in my neighborhood 
26401 A waste of money and appetite. My wife blamed me for the food I got during a midnight hunt. Not any more. 
26402 Most incredible meal I've had in Portland. None of the ingredients overpower the others. I highly recommend the wine flight. Each wine was well paired and the wait staff was knowledgeable about each one. 
26403 Everything on the menu is so delicious and sinful. I had the Ron Burgundy donut burger and my girlfriend had the country clucker, two of my favorite items on the menu. You can't go wrong. Your only mistake was not coming here sooner. 
26404 The salad bar is good. Everything I need for a healthy lunch. Just get there early, for the freshest selection. 
26405 Best flavors, best selection, more fruits than all other yogurt places. The owner is a friendly guy and cares about his customers. 'Nuff said. 
26406 Great food and atmosphere. Went multiple times and was never disappointed. Nothing special but nothing disappointing as well. 
26407 Really good sushi with a chill atmosphere. Easily coming back whenever I get a craving for sushi. 
26408 Such a lovely little breakfast spot! I loved the unusual twists they add to the dishes instead of having the same dishes every other breakfast place has. The service was also very pleasant. It is a little out of the way in less touristy Dr. Phillips; however worth the jaunt. 
26409 This is my first ever bad review for a restaurant 
26410 I am food poisoned after eating at this place today 
26411 I suffered from severe diarrhea and vomiting within 15 mins of eating my dinner 
26412 Now I just hate panda express and I am never gonna go back 
26413 Nice piece of haddock today for lunch. Also had the shrimp cocktail to start. Service was a bit slow for a fish plate and sitting solo. All and all good place to have some nice sea food outside the city. 
26414 Way better than other local competitors. They serve their BBQ with warm BBQ sauce, not like other restaurants that leave it on the table cold, in a crusty squeeze bottle (yuk). The pork ribs were very tender. 
26415 La Feria is always my number one choice for authentic Mexican food. Whether it's lunch or dinner, the service is always great and the specials are easy on the pocketbook. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone craving Mexican food in the South Austin area. 
26416 Awful motel i had surgery on may 18 ,2016 i blocked motel days a head for my husband & my niece & they wanted another 150;00 for a junky motel and days before that i gave them my credit card do not stay this motel very disappointed 
26417 2am on a Saturday, they are out of ground beef. Isn't that their staple? A little disappointed, but not horribly distraught. At least I get to have Taco Bell! 
26418 The setting was beautiful with a lovely view of the harbor. The food was good but the portion sizes were small. The wine seemed quite overpriced. The service was abysmal. The slowest we have seen in good restaurants in Boston. not recommended. 
26419 Real Tasso. Can't find that deliciousness outside Louisiana, usually. Nicest people. Amazing. 
26420 Their sizzling Red Snapper with spicy tamarind sauce is heavenly! Also try their roast duck and green curry chicken. 
26421 Great food and excellent service! The best dining experience we had while visiting Orlando. 
26422 Such a yummy Oreo banana crepe. Super great and fast service. Definitely will come back here. 
26423 I eat here at least once a week and can tell you it's a very fresh and tasty. There are other Thai options nearby and they can't touch the flavor and customer service that I receive from Yummy.... A must try in my book! 
26424 Love this place! Big open spot...plenty of seating. And most importantly, a super friendly staff with delicious coffee & sandwiches. Oh- and free refills! Can't beat it. 
26425 I saw two movies in one month and both times the reel (do they still use reels?) broke. 
26426 I received free cookies delivered to my door as a promotion from my apt. They were warm and delicious. I loved the service! I'll definitely order again 
26427 I stepped in to try the neighborhood sushi joint that has just changed management. It is very nice, with a tasty bento box at a reasonable price. Hopefully they will get more customers, because my only complaint is how quiet it was. Recommended! 
26428 This is our goto place for interesting foods, primarily the candy kind. They have nice dishes and a mix of stuff mostly from asia such as furniture and textiles. We occasionally dropin to pickup a bottle of wine as well. 
26429 This DD is the absolute worst. Every single time I come here they are always out of normal things, and when they actually have things in stock, it takes forever to get it after you order. 
26430 This place made me pretty much fall in love with scallops and cous cous. I'd liked both beforehand but after having them at Olives I couldn't get enough of either. 
26431 Sorry, it was not good. The prime rib sandwich tasted like it had been cooked on old an dirty grill. The onion rings are very good, the french fries were not. The cherry pie was old, the crust was very soft. Sorry, I would not come back. 
26432 Overall the food is good but not over the top as would be expected for the prices or the old North End. The most memorable portion of the meal.was the bread and dipping oil. 
26433 Food was great. The pepper chicken is the best. This place is neat and clean. The staf are sweet. I recomend them to anyone !! 
26434 We loved it and will come back! Seated right away - server was excellent and just the right amount of attentive! Strawberry Chicken Salad, Buffalo Cicken Taco and Fish Spread appetizer we all 5 star! 
26435 Love this place! They always have wheatgrass in stock for juicing. Their smoothies are amazing (try the Butter Face) and the staff is friendly and welcoming. Plenty of parking in the garage adjacent to the shopping center. Prices are competitive and it's a short drive from Downtown Orlando. Win! 
26436 Hands down best friend chicken and fried tofu sandwiches in Portland right now. The fries are pretty good too. And don't forget to try there cool-aid soft serve, it's killer on a warm day 
26437 Samson is the hardest working newfoundland is all of Boston. 
26438 Do not conduct any sort of business with this company! They overcharged me for a system that wasn't even installed properly. When I asked to remove additional components that weren't even installed properly, they refused to take these items out. Shoddy workmanship, way over-priced, and extremely poor customer service. 
26439 Great tapas restaurant! Close to our home, friendly staff, and delicious food. A little pricey for what you get, but the food is usually outstanding. Their cocktail are really solid, I would recommend the Ol' fashion sense. Amazing! Recommended. 
26440 If I'm ordering pizza, its usually from this Fellinis. I would rather drive and pick my pizza up from here than to order from one of the places that deliver to me. I only wish you had chicken as a topping! 
26441 LOVED the Smashburger!!! First time trying smash fries and they were delicious! I lovelovelove thin burgers with the cheese thoroughly melted into the burger! Definitely will be back! 
26442 Hands down best small bar, in the small community of Charlestown in Boston. The pretzels and their own draft is excellent. Will definitely be back and buy you a round! 
26443 A taste of restaurants all over the city. The pork butt sandwich with papaya salad rocks my world. Always friendly cheerful service. Yes sometimes it gets really crazy busy in the summer but they do their best. Even their dessert is surprisingly good. 
26444 My son is loving his double bacon cheeseburger! The meat is perfectly cooked and there's lots of cheese & bacon to put his taste buds in their happy place. 
26445 One of their employees helped me find my burned out headlight and even put it in for me. Love this place and Thank you so much!! 
26446 Such a lovely place for a giggly girls HH. Patio is spacious and nicely shaded. Lamb Lollipops are spectacular. Cheese plates are marvelous. Prosecco is bubbly. Service is attentive. BUT, the women's restroom is unique and, perhaps, is set up for communal peeing. No doors on the two stalls. 
26447 Super friendly service, easy place to bring the kids, very tasty coffee (americano was great) and the Diablo was awesome, best breakfast I've had in a long time! Highly recommend. 
26448 Awesome place! I grew up near Treadwells and it's an icon in the neighborhood! The owner is a great guy! 
26449 I went to Le Nails b/c they were close to my home. Phan did a wonderful job with eyebrow waxing/manicure/pedicure! I found their pricing to be higher than what I've been paying in Circle C and elsewhere. Otherwise, I was very pleased with the spa. 
26450 Large selection of drinks and decent bubble waffles. It can be a bit busy during after school hours. 
26451 I love this place. The rolled ice cream is so awesome. If you want to try something new in Olrando, you should come here. 
26452 Good as usual. Been here many times with only one bad experience. Every other visit has been good. I really like the cod fish and chips. Everything else is second place. Best to come when the place is not busy. Fish and Chips special on Mondays is an unbeatable value. 
26453 Barista is grade A. Can't get a better cup of coffee in town. So glad this place opened up a block from my office. 
26454 A nice little coffee house that had a decent little breakfast. I went there and hung out for a while. Cozy but nice. 
26455 Yummy and fast and they don't skimp on portions. I had chicken teriyaki no rice extra veg and I was fairly stuffed. Good value 
26456 Best wings! Its a great local, chill spot to split pitchers of beer and hang with friends! 
26457 Not bad, I had a corned beef sandwich from the takeout deli and it was just OK nothing to write home about, also very overpriced! 
26458 the people there needs an attitude adjustment specially the old guy, grumpy bad attitdue, ever heard of cusomers are always right. the frozen yogurt is awesome one of the best in boston but the people there have really bad attitude and service period. 
26459 This store has a nicely curated selection of handmade items. On top of that the woman that owns it is super nice, and there's a charming little terrier that greets you at the door and loves belly rubs! 
26460 Really cute bar... Our servers were very sweet n we got quick service... Also the location between the domain and the capital metro train was a perfect pitstop on the way to the train station :) 
26461 With all the retro modernized - wanna be Lebanese places popping up in the city of Boston, this place still has the best falafel sandwich ever, hands down! Get the Jallab drink as well, amazing! 
26462 Combine overpriced yet insipid food with frankly indifferent to bordering on hostile service and this is your winner 
26463 There was a lot of confusion. The owner went around to each table apologizing for this or that. The portions were small for the prices. The food was not that good. I wanted a restaurant in Weston but not this one. 
26464 They made me 4 mirrors for me to frame. Daniel gave me excellent customer service, and also had the mirrors ready faster than he said it would take. 
26465 I had dinner and drinks at Javelina tonight for the first time. The wait staff was attentive and helpful, the food was surprisingly good, and the ambiance was very inviting. A "must visit" on the increasingly-popular Rainey Street! 
26466 Best service at any restaurant than I have been to in a long time. Cameron and Brandon were very accommodating with our out of town large group! Can't wait to return next year! 
26467 Dropped in for a New Years Day Breakfast, El Potro exceeded my expectations. Lovely atmosphere,friendly wait staff. Complimentary, fresh Chips and Salsa. Delicious egg & bean dish, perfectly spiced, artfully arranged. I'll be back soon with friends to check out the dinner & drink menu. Highly recommend. 
26468 Ran out to buy a couple of bottles for a work event and I'm so happy work near the Wine Bottega. Great service and the selection was incredible. A perfect mix of small production, the rare, and the unusual. 
26469 dont come here. greens and fairways were in poor condition, and even worse than that their employees are RUDE. range balls are cracked and old. SO many other clubs at comparable prices make it stupid for anyone to play here. BEWARE 
26470 The most delicious and authentic cuban food in town! I truly enjoyed the casual and relaxed ambience; exceptional customer service. I would highly recommend this restaurant! Desserts and coffees absolutely AMAZING! 
26471 Great dessert and cafe. - high quality and ingredients go into every dessert. - have organic and gluten free options - not too sweet, which ultimately means quality dessert. - fresh and very busy (especially on weekends) - sweet tooth? Definitely come check this gem out. 
26472 Great hotel with a wonderful fitness center. The rooms are spacious and modern. However, it's far from the tourist areas and the bellman were not helpful at all with the luggage....could it be due to no tip policy? 
26473 Staff are very friend & helped me with information about Vancouver. I've just recently moved here & this was the first hotel I had to stay in. 
26474 Great yogurt. Very clean feeling. Fresh and simple menu. Owner is behind the counter. Delicious and refreshing. 
26475 A favorite! Every time I come to town this is a must stop! I am Cuban and this is as authentic as it gets! 
26476 Amazing food. Great patio. Great music, great vibe. The Menu is so well design and easy to understand. Great place for a quick sandwich as well as for a formal dinner with friends. 
26477 The ice cream is bland. Why are there no strawberries in my SB cone? --Haiku Review. 
26478 Good cheap lunch slices (1.49 I think) and a nice sauce and crust. Not much room for seating but they have 3 small benches. Friendly and fast. 
26479 I liked this place until I realized they had been writing in their own tips on my check. Was in there yesterday for an order that cost $8.86. $ 10.86 devoted from my account. AVOID. 
26480 Great food and warm atmosphere. Service staff was very informative, helpful, and flexible. Overall a great experience! 
26481 ive always liked newbury comics... all locations, really. everyone is always very friendly and helpful, and i usually find what i am looking for. 
26482 Staff was great!! Food presentation and taste were fantastic!! Definitely coming back!! 
26483 I was very happy with my pedi. The girl who did mine was very sweet and did an awesome job. I will most likely return for another one in the future. I do wish the girl would have paid less attention to her phone. 
26484 Really yummy place to get a dosa - sometimes it takes a long time to get food, but basically great street food. The eggplant dosa was well-flavored, perfect seasoning and texture. Nice mix of crunchy pancake bits with well-seasoned eggplant and potato inside. The bathroom was kinda dicey. 
26485 I went for the free late-night wifi, and bought a summer galette to be polite. But I saw the plum-ginger pie with crumble top and had to try that, too. Crispy, buttery, yum on all fronts! My counter guy was genuinely nice, clear, and accommodating. I'll be back. 
26486 I searched "car wash" on Yelp by my house. They did a great job!! The prices are competitive, the customer service was good and my car is SPOTLESS. I'll be back and you should too! This is my new spot. Yep. 
26487 One of my favorite restaurants in Orlando. Their wine club is worth every penny, and I've yet to find a less-than-amazing item on their menu. Our favorite server is definitely Britney... If you want a fun and attentive experience, ask for her! 
26488 I meant to review this place a long time ago. I absolutely loved everything I had for brunch here. The only downside was the longggg wait.. but in the end, it was worth it. 
26489 This place is great, everyone food was delicious, staff was funny and friendly. Drinks are great! I'll be back! 
26490 Great food, lovely atmosphere - another Sandy Springs delight. Shawn in the parking lot was also really nice and attentive. 
26491 Shouldn't open a restaurant if you have horrible server with terrible service. Unbelievably unfresh food as well. 
26492 Kelaguen mannok and shrimp fritters are great here. They have limited hours so GO and TRY IT during their small window of business hours. 
26493 Out of all the sushi places I've been to, I have to say they consistently had fresh fish each and every single time I've been here. The prices are fair for the amount and freshness of the fish. I find myself craving the soft and sweet salmon all the time! 
26494 The best! Friendly staff, cozy location, efficient service. The beef tongue and the smoked pepper are my personal faves, but everything I've tried was delicious. I still have a soft spot for the original Gastown location, but this one is brighter and closer to my usual haunts. 
26495 Fast delicious food with extremely reasonable prices. I fell in love with the cry baby burger I just hold the special sauce and ask for the sirachi mayo! 
26496 Been going here for years. Always do a good job, always pleasant, always on time. 
26497 Amazing fried tomatoes and mac & cheese!! Make sure you get here early, the wait can be a little long. Chicken is also great! 
26498 Guero is MAGNIFICENT! Fresh, light, nourishing and flavorful. If you're on the fence about trying this cart, jump down. Can't wait for them to have a brick and mortar. YUM I had The Diego bowl with carnitas & added avocado. Lots of veggie options, too. Im drooling while eating! 
26499 Fantastic beer selection. The bartenders are wonderful and the decor is a serious upgrade from the crossing. They're still working on food but I'm sure it will be amazing once they figure out what type they want to serve. 
26500 I like WBUR when they're not fundraising. I like Car Talk. I'm tired of Bob Oakes. But what I really want to know is this: Who's Hugh and why does he sponsor everything? Seriously, thanks, WBUR. I don't know how you and the other NPR stations do it. 
26501 Great place for entertaining 
26502 Food was good but not great as you may think. The gumbo was only fair so as the red snapper wrap in potato. The fish would have better grilled with Greco style prep. 
26503 Pretty great food in a totally random location. Love the butter chicken and the Buffett made it real easy to try it all. 
26504 I loved this experience! My Brazilian took about 20-25 minutes. My esthetician was very professional and skilled. The clinic is in a series of suites called Sola Salons, which has about 30 different rooms in the building. I bought a Groupon for 2 Brazilians for $43 
26505 While this gym is pricier than others, the culture of very helpful staff, impeccably clean environment and friendly gym goers far exceeds everyone else. Ozonated pool, a variety of classes to join both in and out of the pool and a relaxed atmosphere is what this gym has to offer. 
26506 Great service and wonderful pizza! We had a meatball pizza with extra cheese... The garlic buttery crust was perfectly cooked and then chocolate chip cookies - warmed for us? Fantastic! 
26507 Awesome atmosphere. The food menu was a little bland and a touch pricey for the quality of the food. Ordered nachos and I'm pretty sure it was Pace salsa out of a can. 
26508 Absolutely amazing! Had the Golden Yum Melt (think Crab Rangoon/cream cheese wontons), Sweet & Sour Divine,and Chow Mein. And we received complementary soup! Everything tasted clean, fresh, and very flavorful. Even though I live almost an hour away, I will definitely be coming back! Mmmmm..... :) 
26509 I've only had breakfast here but service was fast and friendly, the food was tasty and inexpensive and the atmosphere was homey and welcoming. 
26510 Great hotel! Wonderful people and easy to do business with this establishment! All the employees were helpful and made our stay very enjoyable! I would stay here again while visiting Portland! The hotel is near many eateries and tourist destinations! The rooms were comfortable and the restaurant had yummy food! 
26511 I'm in love with this place. Great food! I try to visit at least once every three months! 
26512 Just old fashioned american comfort food. The bar area has been beautifully renovated; the menu has stayed basically the same. Allude celery for me. 
26513 Great Burger joint. Nicer than I expect the Monte Cristo egg rolls were wickedly good. 
26514 A great post college, frat sororstitute bar scene. Kinda dive ish inside but a real fun place. Real southern as well. 
26515 There is a reason they are called Shawarma King. Incredibly inexpensive and incredibly tasty. I love their falafel and shawarma. My friend from Russia thought their pastries were fantastic, just like his grandmother used to make- and that's good enough for me. 
26516 Pretty cool irish bar. The food is good but the service is always slow. But they do have some imported beers you are unlikey to find at an average bar. They have music and dancing in the back room or you can just chill in the front section. 
26517 Great experience our server Alice was so accommodating. Even with it being busy she took great care of us. I definitely will be back. Thank you. 
26518 Excellent food, excellent prices, excellent service! We've had friends from out of town come and this is the first place we thought of to take them! This is truly a gem! 
26519 Worst experience ever! Bad service, ridiculously over priced.. Chana masala with no bhature was priced at $18.00.. we paid $90 for paneer and Chana sab Ji and 3 naans.. I would never recommend anyone going there.. wish we had read the reviews before hand and avoided.. 
26520 Best sandwich place this part of Hyde Park. The Philly cheesesteak is fantastic! The girl at the counter isn't always nice, but she is proficient in accommodating! 
26521 Didn't even order our food after waiting in line for 10 mins. Place was a mess. Owners need to do some serious reworking of their staff and training. Won't be back. 
26522 Best roast beef ever, I've been eating here every time I come back to the area since college (when I ate here multiple times a week. Super with sauce and cheese.... Yeah Buddy! 
26523 Not a fan at all the service was weak as well as the food. Nothing was cooked correctly and even the ginger cake dessert was not great. 
26524 Not worth it. Pricy. Limited number of 5 tickets and you will still wait 30 minutes outside in the rain. 
26525 I love Tommy's Market. They don't always have the most aesthetically pleasing produce, however, what they do have is cheap and great for smoothies and or stir fries. Cheaper and more family friendly than other places that I've been to. The lettuce and tomatoes are a very good deal. 
26526 Wow Dr. Kopman is awesome! My Cinnamon is under his care. He is so knowledgeable I completely trust his judgement. Highly Recommend!!! 
26527 It's Chinese style but fresher. Not typically fried. The kids meals are extra large and definitely enough for most adults. 
26528 This place is amazing! I had the our burger, fries, and Bloody Mary which were all great! Love that they have gluten free options for when I'm doing a gluten free diet. 
26529 They're not open even though it's says they are. better communication to your consumers who crave your food would be great. Thanks ms 
26530 Underhanded substitution of VIP program for a booking for golf. Swine. 
26531 I can honestly say that everyone that has posted reviews for this restaurant must take there wife to McDonalds for their anniversary. Is Olive Garden your favorite Italian? 
26532 Went here to get all of the bugs of the front of my car. I could have saved my money considering my car looked the exact same after going through the car wash. 
26533 Love everything on the menu, starting with the bread! The eggplant parm pizza and bolognese pasta are my favorites. My vote for best pizza in Charlestown! 
26534 I needed to renew and change my name on my passport. Went to this office expecting to wait over an hour but was in and out in less than than 15 minutes. They were very organized and professional, great experience! 
26535 Very delicious I recommend it for seafood lovers The service was amazing very fast and polite I order fried fish with sea soup bowel 
26536 Been coming here for years... Great atmosphere, great staff, great food.. Portions are quite filling especially the cheeseburger Poutine!!! Great selection!!!! 
26537 I hosted a baby shower in their private room and was very pleased with the Owner Dwight, the chef, and the service staff. Thank you Front Row everything was awesome! Will definitely come back with my husband to catch a live show. 
26538 4.5 stars. This donuts are great! I loved the brown sugar hazelnut the best. Not cheap but great quality - long lines on weekends. Also tried the raspberry jam which was very good and the honey dipped. 
26539 This place is awesome. Great service, great food. I got the Hercules (paleo version) with steak instead of chicken and it was filling and delicious. Definitely will be coming back to fill up my punch card. 
26540 This is a keeper, CloClo Bistro is a wonderful place for dinner. It's a French Bistro in Dr. Phillips Shopping Area. Great service good good and high prices 
26541 I dig the vibe of this place. I especially love Saturdays when my favorite food truck stops by. Even if I'm not a huge beer drinker, they do have a couple I don't mind sipping on from time to time. 
26542 Excellent boba tea shop! Will definitely be recommending to friends. Huge variety of options from classic to adventurous. There is lots of space to hang out or speedy and helpful service if you're doing a to-go. 
26543 This food here is alright, but they just raised prices and it's now unreasonable. My go to meal went up by $4. $12 for a small lunch takes this place off my list. 
26544 Food is great but service is soooo slow - owners of Japadog need to organize this better as they are losing lots of business and a lot of people will not come back next time Great business just poor organization 
26545 Very small place, tables are for 1 or 2. Servers are ok, I found prices a bit expensive for 6-8 sushi pieces. Mango Salmon roll is very good. 
26546 The pizza is awesome... Crust is on the thinner side which is just right. Also, the pepperoni rolls are great. I live in Texas and will likely never have opportunity to come back... But you should! 
26547 The food was fresh. The faces were friendly. The fries had an ample amount of cheese on them. My cat watched me intently, has I ate the whole thing. 
26548 When I want wings, I go here. When I want grilled chicken, I go here. This is a fantastic casual joint. And by far the best Roosters I have been to. Happy hour? Check. Good food? Check. Friendly staff? Check. 
26549 Delicious! I keep trying other seafood restaurants in town, but I always end up making a comparison to JP Seafood because it has set my expectations so high. I love the bulgogi and the beef dumplings! 
26550 Amazing brunch! Had the breakfast special which was Fried chicken- delicious, crunchy, and accompanied by grits and gooey egg. Coffee was plentiful and ambiance was perfect for a great conversation in the sunny window seats. 
26551 The employees are great, the food's great, but the shoppers drive me nuts! I haven't seen this many affectations since my college days. Stop thinking about yourself so I can get through the aisle. I don't know what you're doing here, but I came to get some food! 
26552 Good place with a good vibe. Loved the tandoori chicken! Portion size is decent. We order ala carte though so I have no idea if the buffet is good enough! 
26553 Cookie ice cream sandwiches. That's all you really even have to say. Every flavor sounds great and the cookies are great as well, an all around great place 
26554 I thought it was really good. Service is a little slow but manageable. Menu is slight over whelming but I guess that's most ice cream places because of the toppings. 
26555 China Cafe is our favorite spot for eastern cuisine. MaryAnn and Cecil are always warm and welcoming, know what we like and take great care of us. Lots of gluten free choices. 
26556 Every time, so good. I've ordered the pappardelle the last three times I've been there and decided to branch out tonight with polenta and sausage. All good. Great Italian Wine selection. We will be back. 
26557 Mediterranean sea bass,chevre chaufer salad, creme br√ªl√©e. Bass was one of best things I've ever eaten. Everything was exceptional. Highly recommend! 
26558 Awful awful awful. Parked there to pick up my food across the street at a Tuesday night with an empty plaza. The order took a while and waked out, the car is gone. It is 150 and cash only. Very good tax strategy. 
26559 Stayed here last month and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel was clean, new and the staff was extremely courteous! Try to stay here every time I'm in town. Looking forward to the next stay. 
26560 This is hands down my favorite nail salon in Orlando! I usually get dip power nails. Every single time I go someone else has done them. They do not disappoint. 
26561 Great survive, food was better than I expected. I honestly went here for convenience but was blown away by their quality. I just wished they had more menu options. Also low prices was a plus. 
26562 Love Kekes. Whether its for breakfast, brunch or lunch. 
26563 Friendly staff and wonderful service. Beautiful and huge facility. Donation-based payment for coffee, tea and pastries. Recommended! 
26564 This place is really good for everything! The diavolo is delicious. What a great addition to South End! Look forward to trying other items on the menu. Thank you for coming to this neighborhood! 
26565 The food and service here were excellent. Our server made sure we had everything we needed and made great suggestions. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Columbus! Also, I recommend the "Bahama Mama." 
26566 The quality of the food is surprisingly good and even when it's busy my orders have always come out pretty quick. I've never had a bad meal here. 
26567 I think most of the positive reviews were written by the owner, his family or friends. While the pastries are good, the owner is simply rude and the service is terrible. 
26568 Very simple restaurant lacking in any sort of ambiance but service was great and the pizza was phenomenal. 
26569 An Austin classic! Outstanding food and great service! I highly recommend stopping in for their happy hour if you're looking for a stiff drink at a great price in a low-key classy environment. 
26570 I LOVE THESE DOUGHNUTS!!!! They have Voodoo BEAT by a mile!!! It's the BEST and I love their fried chicken doughnut, It'll make you wanna slap your momma. 
26571 This experience was fantastic. Blue is an incredible server. We had a blast. The Southern burger double patties was absolutely perfect! Try this place out and get Blue. It's worth it. 
26572 The original owners are back, which is a huge improvement. Standard Greek pizzeria fare for unbeatable prices. Highly recommend! 
26573 The Ben Franklin was the best cheese steak I've ever had. The garlic fries are amazing too. 
26574 This place is great! Fresh delicious homemade Thai cuisine with a great beer selection. Never been disappointed. Love their homemade spice concoctions. This place rates on the top of my all-time favorite Thai places, and I've been to a ton! 
26575 The food was delicious and I loved the atmosphere but the music was too loud. I felt like I was having dinner in a club. It was also too dark. We had rouse our phone lights to look at the menu. I probably won't be back anytime soon... 
26576 A Orlando best. Food, spirit and service top notch. Plenty of upselling, but well worth it! 
26577 Fantastic service, friendly staff. Great explanations of what the doctor was doing throughout the procedure. I'll definitely be back next time. 
26578 Cristhian was great! We briefly talked about a cleaning plan and he made the place sparkle! He worked with detail and didn't miss a single spot. Seriously my apartment looks (and smells) better than it has since I moved in. 
26579 Sandwich heaven. Despite the relatively cramped quarters, my Cubano and my spouse's tuna melt (with real Tillamook cheese) were both mind-blowing. To repeat, mos def. 
26580 This place offers up a really solid pie. Tasty solid, crust has a good texture, cheese and toppings were delicious. It's really good, but it's not stellar. I've had better pizza but would still probably rank Home Slice in my top 5. Definitely worth checking out while in Austin. 
26581 They lost all my clothes and they shouldn't be in business. I called and stopped many times with no return call. 
26582 For a large chain restaurant, this place never fails to fill my hunger and Italian cravings. Stuffed mushrooms, mushroom ravioli, chicken parm are a few of my favorite things. The dishes are so large that I get an awesome lunch for the next day 
26583 Nice buffet for lunch-- reasonably priced. Great service. 
26584 Liked this clinic a lot-- may make it my regular doctor. Nice, community feel, with pharmacy on-site. My doctor and nurse were great as well. 
26585 Everything is good here! Burgers and drinks are unique. Lines can be extremely long on weekends so try to go at an odd time. 
26586 Plesant staff. Pretty good food to an affordable price. Don't expect the best asian food though. Great dumplings. 
26587 My best friend treated me here for breakfast for my Birthday and it was good. Be sure you try get the strawberry orange juice!!!! 
26588 Wow what a place great time 
26589 Good, fresh, fast, cheap eats. Looks and feels like a fancy but it's just a very nice casual. Perfect spot! 
26590 Way more authentic and delicious than I was expecting, especially with it being located in a mall and all. The homemade chips and salsa blow me away every time. 
26591 Quick service, sushi was delicious and price was affordable! The ambiance is inviting. I would recommend for groups. 
26592 Really like this place! We'd go more if it wasn't so darn popular and hard to get in to! Great tapas, good drink specials on select days and great atmosphere and service. It's becoming one of our go-to places for dinner. 
26593 The food was excellent 
26594 I had the chicken and waffles and it was delicious 
26595 I wish I had a water refill especially since the place wasn't very busy 
26596 Over all food was good and service was fine. 
26597 Simply the best! One of our favorites. They rarely change the menu unlike other restaurants but always put out great food!! 
26598 All the five stars these guys get are well deserved. We sampled the Broadway, the Ross Island and the Tilikum and each was super delicious in its own way! Great way to start our Portland food truck crawl 
26599 The food was not traditional Irish food, more like traditional bar food. The atmosphere was nice, but more like a sports bar. The servers were friendly, but slow. If you're just looking for sustenance, this place will suffice. 
26600 Quick and professional, I can trust my customers vehicles will be well taken care of. Great value! 
26601 Decent drinks at reasonable prices. Food is typical, solid bar food, but nothing to write home about. A little dirty in here and you'll most likely be waited on by an angry hipster, but if that's your vibe not a terrible place to get a drink on Ponce. 
26602 Great experience, professional and streamlined process. I was able to email my jewelry evaluations over and get an estimate before even having to make an appointment. Eric is friendly, easy to talk to and it was a quick and simple process. I recommend them! 
26603 Such a cute little spot, and the staff are very nice and sincerely want to make your day! The coffee is my favorite in Portland. Their latte really hits the spot. 
26604 Walked in on a whim, left on cloud 9. The Bourbon Sea Salted Caramel donut was life changing! Plenty to split with my boyfriend, although difficult to share because it was just that good! I have a feeling this is going to become a staple treat for us. 
26605 Decent food, but I don't see the point in paying that much money for such a mediocre meal. If you're hungry, it will get the job done; however, don't expect it to be the best food to hit your craving spot. 
26606 Just average. I had the small chic greek salad. It was pretty usual and the chicken was very over cooked and too chewy. But reasonably priced at 8$. Good alternative for the area bc there just doesn't seem to be many creative choices at this intersection. 
26607 Delicious, but service was relatively slow. Their pizza has extra thick material at the center, so each slice might have a sloggy side that you need to bite off first so that the rest can be held firmly. 
26608 Smallwares' inventive spicytasty menu has expanded to brunch too. Might be the best fried egg I had in town, and even better that it is over gravy and a chinese sausage bao. Kanadian Kale, fried eggs with rice cakes and horsey potatoes rounded it out nicely. 
26609 Exactly what we were looking for - an escape from all the chain restaurants in Orlando, good food, well priced, seats in the shade, and incredibly friendly service from the staff and owner. And loved the mojito-flavored iced tea! 
26610 I love this salon, everyone is really friendly, and they love to have a good time, and joke around. I go to Trina, and she's amazing. My friend Sabrina recommend her, and she does a perfect job. 
26611 This restaurant is a great place to take family or visit with friends for a good meal, some great brew, or nice wines. We like the food and the service. I will continue to come back when I'm in the Orlando area. 
26612 Food was very good but the services was OK. Very busy Saturday evening. 
26613 Fast service, better than unchained and the slew of greasy boston pizza (extra cheese and half pepperoni). 
26614 not bad for late night food. not the best burrito in town but after midnight is certainly isnt the worst. cheap price and all the basic ingredients. nothing fancy inside. better option than pizza 
26615 The best place to volunteer! Brittany is an amazing coordinator! 
26616 I called to have delivery after spending a long time organizing our order and they don't do delivery unless they have a driver. False advertising no delivery 
26617 My wife and I came to Bluetop this afternoon for lunch. Amazing environment, great service, and very delicious food! Everything was on point and the atmosphere is incredible. 
26618 Best food at Ponce City Market! We had the Torta del Dia, the Charcoal Grilled Chicken Wings, and the Queso Fundido. Amazing food, amazing atmosphere. Always busy so come early. Expect a wait, but definitely worth it. Great service. 
26619 Great neighborhood hangout. 1st choice place to grab dinner from Patrizzis and a nice cocktail from the bar. Could use a few more tables outside for seating...it fills up fast. 
26620 Good old school Za's, pasta, ribs and salad at below average prices, very little going on inside and kinda better to go or delivery, if you pick up and it's over $20 make sure you get your $2 
26621 Everyone here is awesome. They are so nice and professional. I went in to get a sunkissed look for graduation and i ended up being a golden godess, ive never looked so good all thanks to these ladies! 
26622 Clean, classy salon with great service. Brianna gave me a fantastic cut, and with a Groupon it was a great deal. Will definitely be going back! 
26623 the cheese burgers are the best with garlic fries.omg foodgasim 
26624 Very good place to try a Persian experience. Kabab is very delicious and tasty, weather chicken or lamb. Also the persian ice cream is really nice but you need to let it melt a bit before you take it. 
26625 Eva is fantastic! She listens to your concerns and can make even the most difficult type of hair look fabulous. I hope I never have to go elsewhere! 
26626 I've been here a couple times with my wife. The foods always delicious and they have brew on tap. I'll keep coming back when I'm in the mood. Thanks Thai Orchid! 
26627 Had also reviewed CC on Open Table (since I used it to make the reservation). Ended up getting contacted by the owner to follow up w/ the issues we'd experienced - SO refreshing when the managers/owners of a place actually care. Haven't been back again yet, but definitely will. 
26628 There are times in life when you just happen to luck into things. This would happen to be one of these cases. A large bin of Italian designer shoes in size 6 for $10 a pair!!! I have found HEAVEN!! Great shoes on a budget, ow can you lose. 
26629 This place is tasty, has a nice beer selection, and a parking lot right across the street. The food is a bit pricey for what you get though (that's the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) 
26630 Great service. Very reasonable prices and large portions. The food was great quality and tasted well. 3 adults and 2 kids ate lunch here for $83 + tip. Nice experience. Also they validated our parking for the nearby deck. 
26631 A good place for breakfast or brunch but I don't get why the line ups are so long Don't get me wrong the place has great food and I would go again 
26632 Tasty food, just met Frank the kitchen manger. Nice guy. My suggestion to the restaurant is to offer half size or "lighter" size portions. They give a lot of food, it's not cheap but considering how much food they put on the plate... well, again it was tasty 
26633 WOW, what a surprise... hadn't been here since they changed the name. My friend had he brisket and I had the pulled pork sandwich... baked beans and coleslaw we're homemade really added to the meal.... This place it great! I'm definitely coming back. 
26634 Cool place. strong coffee. I like how they always remember mine and my daughters drinks. Its conveniently located across from the library and her dance class we can have father daughter date over coffee and hot coco. 
26635 The water park was fantastic!!! My granddaughters had a great time. Despite a minor issue checking in, the staff and general manager couldn't have been more accommodating. I highly recommend the water park. The girls liked the arcade too. 
26636 Amazing oysters and giant peel and eat shrimp !! The cats that work here are super nice and fun to talk to about the area and beers. If you want great Saturday tunes, amazingly fresh raw bar eats and a great locally crafted draft beer... Look no further. 
26637 New owners....everything is new and clean Great pedicure and gel manicure - lasted a long time. Check it out, you will be happily surprised. 
26638 Superb porchetta sandwich. For $8 its pretty expensive but the meat is cooked just right. The panini might be a bit tough at times but its worth it. I've had many porchetta paninis in Italy and have to say that this is even better. 
26639 Very impressed with this place, great friendly service, great quality sushi, decent portions that aren't overloaded with rice, all for a very reasonable price. 
26640 Delicious gourmet pizza in the North End. Reasonably priced and good service. We split one pizza between two people and it was a good portion. 
26641 Three of us shared a mushroom pizza with red sauce which was really delicious. Arugula salad was very refreshing. I also ordered a sangria and really enjoyed it. Would go again! 
26642 Love Firehouse!! Great food and tea. Their sandwiches are the best. Bread is fresh and the staff are friendly. Go Firehouse!!! 
26643 Good atmosphere! Great for a college kid! Their chicken fried steak is really good and so are their mashed potatoes. Definitely a classic and should go there if you are looking for a good feel of UT. 
26644 These guys make some seriously delicious cupcakes in all sizes. I find them a little on the pricey side, which makes sense because they are the only ones in the area. They also do custom cakes which is great if you are hosting a birthday party or other festive event. 
26645 It's okay. It was lukewarm and bread was dense and chewy. The meat was dry and for the price it should have been packed more. 
26646 MMMM MMMM MMMM! This vegan lunch buffet is out of this world! Zucchini smothered in spiced tomato sauce, spiced potatoes, red lentils and other veggies filled my belly with delight! and the best part....only $10! This was a steal! They also always have one chicken dish for meat eaters....go today! 
26647 The service was pretty terrible. Food was really good, though. Drinks and food were expensive... $10 for a cocktail. We changed waiters later in the night to Luis and he was great. He's the one with the "devolved" fish ear. 
26648 Great park for dogs! And I think the only one in the area. There is a green area where dogs can run and 'socialize' and a small fenced area too. I don't think dogs demand anything else but that:) 
26649 Such a beautiful location...right across from Jonathan Rogers park. The coffee is always above and beyond and I have a constant supply of their in house roasted beans at home. Bryan Turko is such an inspiring entrepreneur and makes everyone feel really welcome. 
26650 Absolutely adore this place. If your looking for a quick bite to eat this place has got it. Their shakes and burgers are amazing. I love the drive in feel of it, very cool. The prices are reasonable, especially for how good it tastes! 
26651 We recently moved to the area and were in search of an eyebrow threading place. We were happily surprised that a nail salon offered threading. Tammy did a great job, and we will definitely be regulars! 
26652 Amazing food, awesome variety, excellent service. The chicken and steak are great and the salads are also fantastic. The waiters and bartenders are so helpful and friendly. Get the banana bread pudding! 
26653 Best nail salon in the East Point/south Atlanta area. I've been to MANY salons in the area and this has quickly become my go-to. Every nail tech is professional and does an A+ job every time. 
26654 Great place. My dog comes with me and enjoys the massive outdoor patio. The servers are friendly and the beer tastes great. I enjoy the Obscura Stout. Coffee early they close at 11 on weeknights. 
26655 Their recent overhaul of the menu (and probably the chef) is an amazing improvement. We ate there recently after swearing off the place for a long long time. All four off us thoroughly enjoyed our meals...well done McCray's! 
26656 One of the very best brunch spots in Portland. Get the brunch board and smoked trout! 
26657 decent selections of food, reasonable price, chicken wraps tasted ok 
26658 Cute, cozy North End restaurant. Got a seat right by the window during a busy feast weekend. Nice waiter, really good food. Solid dinner spot off the main road. 
26659 Great spot! It can be really busy at times but worth the wait. Prices are reasonable and service is what you pay for. The food is great and I highly recommend it for all out of towers looking for a quick reasonably priced meal! 
26660 We LOVE Mama's Teriyaki!! Always exceptional customer service, but we keep going for that chicken! Definitely best teriyaki Ive ever experienced! Such fresh and quality food-with best flavor! And you can't forget to mention how incredibly clean the restaurant itself is! 
26661 Had a work party here and ended up staying over. Not impressed for what My company paid. Should have paid an uber and drove me home to Charlestown. I would go back for drinks and a meal 
26662 Way to overpriced for a goodwill, i like a good bargain! However they did have nice stuff! 
26663 The setting is very nice, it's cute you feel like you aren't in richmond. The staff were all super friendly, and of course knowledge. The food, there isn't a whole lot of options, but I mean there are a lot of cheeses! It can be very pricey though! 
26664 TRIED to get a haircut here today (swear to god) but it was closed. Looked at the hours - "Mondays: 9-7" or whatever it said. Well, it was closed. With no sign explaining why. ONE star until an explanation is furnished. 
26665 This is where old school earns respect. Nuthin' fancy. Just Best of Boston. And baking pizzas as long as the L Street Brownies have been doing the Polar Plunge: 1903. 
26666 Some of the best chinese food in the area! Everything is much fresher than you're average chinese restaurant...don't miss the chicken wings! 
26667 Fun family outing. They do a great job with this tour. Humor, wit and etoh. Lots of it. Family and friends from Out of town will enjoy. 
26668 Just tried this place last night and it's probably the best meal I've had in Portland for a while! Try the empanadas, octopus, smoked trout, smoked old fashioned. DeLISH. Very cool old building and reasonable prices. 
26669 The best avocado margarita and spicy salsa! Other than that the food was pretty mediocre/bad 
26670 The place use to be great. The service is terrible. Takes forever to get food. Staff can't work the computers. Not worth the hassle. 
26671 Good beer. Good service. Nice view of St. John's bridge from the deck. Bartenders are very friendly and the pretzels here are delicious. Good spot to hangout with friends 
26672 Untrained and could care less Customer Service and Cashier. Slow service, staff could care less. Worst Lowes I have ever seen. I stopped here because I was in the area. Never again! 
26673 Possibly the best vegan pizza I've had in Portland. They're generous with the "cheese," and the crust is made with just the right amount of thickness. Unfortunately, they only have one vegan option available, but here's to hoping they add more in the future! 
26674 The pizza is fantastic! The service is great and the place has a nice casual atmosphere. Perfect place for a relaxing beer and bite to eat. 
26675 I've eaten here : times during my trip to Orlando and have loved it. Fast food that doesn't taste like fast food and a great price point. Best desserts I've ever had from a place with a drive through. Wish we had one where I live! 
26676 Definitely a SOLID choice for quality BBQ that you don't have to wait 2 hours in line for. Their turkey is amazing and they have a really great sides, beer/wine selection too 
26677 Beware they don't take cc/debit cards for payment anymore but rather direct you to an ATM in the corner of the salon to withdrawal $ and pay cash. I was charged $6 in transaction fees. Very unprofessional! 
26678 The food was delicious. We had a variety of dishes. The service was slow however. The shopping center where the restaurant is located is probably one of the scariest shopping centers I've been in. But it's definitely worth going regardless of the shape of the shopping center. 
26679 I've been coming here for the last 5 years and have never had a bad experience. There are always appointments open to get my eyes checked, Dr. B is great! The staff is friendly and helpful, they've helped a lot with understanding what I have available with my insurance. 
26680 Excellent food and service! Kayla was amazing and is the best! She was very attentive and not to mention kind with great energy! Very nice patio dining as well! 
26681 Great food and service. Highly recommend calling 1 hour ahead to put a name down. My table ordered the short rib hash, crab cake Benedict, and steak and eggs. All were delicious! 
26682 Very fresh and pretty authentic Japanese sushi and food. Very friendly people working there. 
26683 Had the flat iron steak. Well done. It was cooked perfectly. Juicy!!! Not dry! Had it blackened. So good. Small side of fries but I was full already and didn't eat them anyway. Service could have been a bit faster in my opinion. Waitress was slow. 
26684 A wonderful tour in the springtime rain. Lexi was Amazing! She was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Great way to see the campus. Highly recommend. 
26685 I didn't think this place was so great, unless you like drinking out of plastic cups and your food served on paper plates eating at a picnic table with strangers. Would never return nor recommend. Not my style 
26686 Best gluten-free pizza crust I've ever had. I took my girl here and we both loved it. We shared a couple slices of Hawaiian and then played a game on the pinball machine. Great first and everyday date!! 
26687 Locally roasted Stumptown coffee (my wife says all other coffee should be illegal) and house-made soups, quiches, sandwiches, pies, and other treats make this one of our favorite caf√©s in SE Portland. Just don't eat the last apricot jammer, please. 
26688 Asian tapas! So many great flavors and really cool atmosphere! I was surprised by the expense, but we did order very nearly everything on the menu- several of some! Pricey but yummy- the paradox of great foods! Charred corn was awesome and the spring rolls were amazing! 
26689 One of the nicest "Sports Bar's" I've visited Ask about their daily specials. They're usually a good deal. Lobster dip is a must! I ate the blackened tilapia for dinner, which was delicious! 
26690 Honestly one of the best Mexican meals I could have ever imagined. A step above porque no, which was previously my preferred farm to fork quick Mexicano meal. Best part is it's in the neighborhood. 
26691 I've traveled to Italia many times and this is the closet to authentic Italian pizza I have ever had in the US. The ingredients are fresh and it shows. The Bufalina is my favorite I highly recommend it. 
26692 While the flavor is good with this pad see-ew there are no carrots and again it's broccoli stalks! It's greasy which detracts from the sweet black sauce. I shall continue my quest. 
26693 Great people here! Been looking for a place that actually appreciates my visit and does an excellent job. :) 
26694 Love the classes here. Shannon is my fave - plays amazing tracks and gets you pumped! Facilities are amazing. Brand new, clean, can't say more good things about SS. :) 
26695 Delectable shawarma and kafta. Take out or dine in. Only complaint is no tap water available. Food is delish! 
26696 Service was excellent and the food was very good. So happy to have a place close to home where I can get good sushi. :) 
26697 This is a where to go for a real Mediterranean food, their chicken platter is awesome and the falafel is one of the best in town. 
26698 Todd does all of our business' framing and it's always exactly as promised. He does a fantastic job on a wide range of sizes for us. No complaints and we will continue to do business with them! 
26699 Fast service and beautiful arrangement. Looks just like the picture. Will use them again for sure 
26700 The food is good! The burgers are great! It is a little bit over priced. But always tasty! 
26701 i had been wanting to go here for a while (cuz of the name). and it was just alright, not great. prices way high for a tiny little cafe with soup and sandwiches. of which, the soup was good but the sandwiches ok. 
26702 Excellent dental service and welcoming staff. I would recommend Dr. L to others seeking quality dental care. 
26703 Delicious sandwiches and great service. Very friendly staff too :) 
26704 Coffee is sooo good here. Smooth!! This is a coffee shop located in the St John's business district and only about a mile away from me. 
26705 UNBELIEVABLE. Best food i've ever had. I started eating here almost 7 times a week. Best italian deli i've seen. ever. 
26706 I don't remember their steaks being of mediocre quality in the past, so maybe my party had an off night, but meh. 
26707 Delicious Latin food at a terrific price. Its really easy to love this place. You order at the counter; then it's all great food and friendly, efficient service. 
26708 I had the tofu taco and the falafel taco! Both were very delicious. Customer service was good. The bathrooms are very clean and nice. This is a pretty chill spot. Will definitely go back. Didn't have time to take a pic of food. I was starving. Lol 
26709 Good place to chill and grab a bite and drinks. It's nice there is a lot of open area if you want to be in a more secluded booth or in the bar area. 
26710 The atmosphere is great. The food choices are decent. I had the grilled cheese and it was excellent. The hazy Jane beer is fantastic. 
26711 Great service topped off this experience. The BEST lobster bisque I've ever had, and the lobster roll wasn't far behind. The first 5 star rating I've given, and it's well deserved! Next time I'm in the area I will definitely make it a point to return! 
26712 New customer to Lbj Independant Honda and Acura and very impressed! Professional, knowledgeable, and very reasonably priced! I am a new client for sure!!!! Highly recommend them. 
26713 Love the food everything food wise is always great but the service sucks, seems to me that every time we come we get extremely bad service. 
26714 Thank you Richard and Steph for recommending the philly cheesesteak which was absolutely amazing. Great service, excellent food 10/10 would recommend. Best cheesesteak in Atlanta 
26715 I recently had dinner here to celebrate our anniversary with my wife. We've been living in Austin for over two years now and this was the best meal we've had in this time. We'll be back. 
26716 Great for a quick bite. Chicken Bento's go fast. Items that I commonly order are Turkey and Salami Sandwich or Chicken Bento with a Peanut Butter Cookie. get there before 3:00 pm because they do close early. 
26717 The dumplings wrapping isn't typical Chinese dumpling wrapping. So don't expect too much. The ginger pork stuffing for dumpling is good. The Thai bubble tea is ok. 
26718 The best burgers I've ever eaten. I love that you can get an Ahi Tuna or Veggie burger too or a spicy humburger on lettuce. Their red velvet milkshakes and sangria are also out of this world 
26719 The best tacos in Portland. Home made tortillas, kickass salsa bar, super cheap. No point going anywhere else. Parking sucks though. 
26720 This place was terrible. I got my friend the strawberry cake for her birthday and it tasted old, dry and absolutely disgusting. I will never come back 
26721 This place is alright. The decor is spot on and they do have a good drink selection. Music is pretty good usually. 
26722 Amazing quality for donuts. The price is a little steep but its worth it. Voodoo is all hype but the quality is meh. Remember that not all people who eat donuts are fat, but all fat people eat donuts... 
26723 This was a go-to tinder date location for me. Food was ok, and the restaurant closed early.. So was never stranded. I guess I was expecting better in a place like Lexington, considering how much money is in town. 
26724 This is one of my favorite, Saturday afternoon stops. Lando and staff are friendly and very knowledgeable with their constantly updated beer list. 
26725 I have lived in Orlando for 23 years. I have always wanted to find a place like this. Cheapest crab and best tasting. I love this spot. Don't let the area turn you off of going in this spot. You won't regret it. 
26726 this is one of the better tim horton's that i have been to. I go here for lunch on occasion and the service is good and food is better than most tim hortons in the lower mainland. 
26727 Food was amazing, it took a little bit, so just plan a little extra time if you come here, the service was good too. Not hovering, but not dismissive either. Great place for a late dinner. Check it out! 
26728 It's awesome to have a place that does both car and scooter/motorcycle inspections all in one shop. I got both sets of wheels inspected today, easy peasy. Guys who work there are super fast and friendly. One drawback--there are tons of mosquitoes over in the waiting area. 
26729 Service was great! The hair braiders were very friendly and I love my hair! The prices are reasonable too. I highly recommend this place. Also, it is very accessible by the train. You can take the red line to fields corner and walk a couple blocks. 
26730 Went here today. Love that I can get house stuff & clothes in the same store. Amazing rug selection. Unique furniture & decoration options. Great prices. Clean store. 
26731 I would give five stars, but I am keeping in mind that I only one thing from La Mamma's.... the Empanadas!! They are made fresh, steaming hot and delicious. Lots of options. I usually just order 10-20 and pig out with a friend. Amazing, inexpensive, fine delivery. 
26732 Food was good.. but no food is worth waiting for 90 + minutes. The service was so very slow and some things got ignored.. nobody got us a second glass of water and never refilled our first. One star is for the wait and service 
26733 The sauce is so good, I have tried similar food in LA before but this one defiantly is the best. 
26734 I park here often for my business travel. It has always been a good experience. It's fast and easy, good pricing, and the people are very nice. They always have a cold bottle of water waiting for you when you leave. It hits the spot. 
26735 Reasonable price. Huge portions. Great service and food. 
26736 Beautiful place. Wonderful food. We loved exploring the menu. It's all so fresh and delicious. Highly recommend. 
26737 All 5 of these stars are for my friend Bobby. He showed excellent customer service and executed his job flawlessly. He also seemed to be an honest guy. Not just jiffy lube, but the world needs more people like Bobby. Thanks for helping me out with my tires man 
26738 I use golfnow.com all the time. And so far have always felt that the course have out worthed what I paid. So I have to say its a great value for the money so far every time. 
26739 We had an area rug that was in need of cleaning. Peace Frog did an awesome job removing stains and cleaning it. Looks brand new! Service was prompt and friendly. Thanks Peace Frog for a job well done!! 
26740 Love this place. The breakfast croissants are awesome! Very fair prices! Oh yeaaaaaaa boiiiii! Can you tell that I've had a lot of coffee???????? I CAN!!!!!!!!! More espresso please, my fair Korean prince! 
26741 Probably the worst Wendy's in the Columbus area. Cold fries and dry sandwiches on numerous occasions and it's a nightmare trying to navigate through the parking lot. 
26742 Call ahead and they will have a nice order ready. I did the dozen assortment and all of their flavored were great. My son loved the red velvet and the pecan was the rave at my house. I personally liked the carrot cake. 
26743 My husband and I booked this tour, and Larry was our guide 
26744 He is vary personable and had a lot of info to pass on. Would recommend, but we didn't know we had to also pay for tastings on top of tour fee. Very pretty area, clean van and comfortable. 
26745 Seriously... if you don't order the steak tips, I am not sure I can help you. Flavorful, generous, seasoned, and melt in your mouth delicious. Awesome service! Cool vibes.... and decorated for the holidays! 
26746 Pasta, wine, and great service. Fantastic date spot. 
26747 Rubia is fantastic and gentle with eyebrows and eyelash extensions. Her attention to detail and perfection is unparalleled. I've been coming here for over 2 years and always get compliments from friends. Bonus- She also make great conversation! 
26748 Well.... It is good coffee, same as other branches, and prices the same. But, there are relatively fewer chairs and tables than other branches, and no sofas or comfortable chairs... So it's a quick drink and bite and then go to get the day started! 
26749 Misleading event description and discrepency on honoring offer listed on tickets. Visit a different location. 
26750 Shekia is the best! Great personality and knows her craft. She knocked the kinks out of my neck and back and I can't wait to go back! 
26751 Marfar chicken, egg rolls, hot and sour soup - couldn't be any better! Great place to catch up with loved ones and eat great food. Will be back. 
26752 A different concept but excellent food whether you're a sushi fan or not 
26753 Staff if very nice and helpful. Almost makes you feel comfortable and all. Baked goods, not as good. The bakeries were a bit. It's a decent place but 4.5 stars is a bit high of a rating. 
26754 I can only comment on the smoked turkey that a friend had to drop by to get. It was delicious with very good smoke flavor and just incredibly moist. Can vouch for delicious smoked turkey. Yum! 
26755 We need a place like this in MIAMI! The Guava and Cheese tequenos were to die for and the service and food were excellent! 
26756 I cannot say enough good things about this company! Very professional, amazing custom woodworking, and delivered them all the way across the country! I could not be happier with my barn doors! 
26757 This is a standard pizza place with a hit or miss menu. I really like their buff chick calzones but delivery is inconsistent sometimes the food gets to you in 20 minutes and other times it takes up to an hour and a half. 
26758 It's open 24-hours and in the heart of Central Square. Usually, there's a long wait at the registers and the self-check-out machines are broken. 
26759 Ehhh... "carne asada" no es carne asada. Los sopes parecen tabiques para darle en la cabeza a alguien! Porq est√°n tan gruesos?? No entiendo. Wouldn't willingly go back, there are FAR better options than this. 
26760 This place is literally a hidden gem! It's located in the hidden gardens near Boca. In fact, it shares a kitchen with Boca. We loved the rustic ambiance and outdoor seating. The cold beer, fish dip and oysters were excellent. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about oysters. 
26761 Our favorite sushi spot! The yellowtail jalapeno shots are mouth-watering! All of their rolls are innovative and delicious! The service is great and the past few times we have gone, we were seated immediately without reservations. 
26762 It's a $6 car wash. You get what you pay for. That being said, I've been to cheaper car washes with better amenities and better customer service. 
26763 I'm mystified by all the good reviews. The portions were insanely tiny (and pricey) with way too much mayo. The atmosphere feels sterile and generic in a mall like way. The only redeeming thing was the service which was quick and friendly. I won't be going back. 
26764 The sushi was way overpriced. It was plain and the rolls were small but priced like they were something special 
26765 Love Zo√´s! Food is always fresh and the people are very friendly! They give good portion sizes for the price. 
26766 This place is consistently top shelf. I took my 19-year-old son and he now understands the difference between really good sushi and cheap pop culture sushi. 
26767 Free tour, free beer, free glass. 
26768 Needed a poster for a work-related project. Rang up, told the guy what I wanted and he had it ready for me when I came into the shop a couple of hours later. Super friendly and a painless transaction! 
26769 El Patron the best restaurant ever! If I could give it 10 stars I would Our waiter Rene was truly Awesome!!! 
26770 Delicios hamburgers...very rich in flavor. My favorite is called the Primetime. Extremely good service. Highly reccomend!!! It gets really busy after 7pm and in the weekends...you have to wait out the door so either go early or plan to wait. 
26771 This place is near my office and oh boy! The breakfast tacos are huge and oh so good! We tried lunch a few weeks ago and it is also amazing. Great flavor and good prices. Their portions are huge, so plan for that when you order. 
26772 Great steaks and seafood with a beautiful view. Tonight my wife and I both had the prime rib and it was PERFECTLY prepared. The calamari appetizer was very good and a large portion. Another great place to eat in Titusville! We will be back. 
26773 If you haven't eaten here, you don't know what you're missing. Turkey Po-boy? The best. Chocolate eclairs? You won't find anything better. And if you're a chocolate lover, give the Chocolate Bomb a try. Just don't try to eat more than one... 
26774 The restaurant stays true to the name. It is old school French with an American twist. The server was great and while the food was overall great, to be better, they would have to stop doing things like serving asparagus in November. 
26775 Holy crap this place is good. Had the grilled pork bahn mi. It was outstanding. Six stars. 
26776 Staff was great. The restaurant was noisy and a little dark. Menu was rather limited and expensive. Bread was great. Nice wine list. With so many great restaurants in the Orlando area, i won't return. Table in Wonderland discount helped. 
26777 Contrary to what others say, I really like this location. It's a gym, I don't expect it to smell like roses. They offer a wide variety of new equipment, and I can always find a machine, even during the rushes. 
26778 Best street corn I've ever had. So rich and delicious and sweet. The employees are nice and polite. The atmosphere is perfect for an after work taco (or 3). 
26779 Things have been great since I switched to UFCU. Don't hesitate if you have the opportunity to join. I walked out with a loan at half the interest rate I got elsewhere. Customer service was outstanding! Someone needs to give Irene a raise! I couldn't be happier! 
26780 Good authentic Mexican restaurant. Salsa is pretty standard with standard chips to compliment. I ordered the super burrito, yet there wasn't much super about it. Really just a standard chicken burrito. The food was good, but I've had better in Columbus. Ambiance is pretty cool, very colorful. 
26781 Great place for big groups and drinks. The food is good too but a little pricey for me. It's huge so there is rarely a wait. The staff is pretty friendly also. Definitely get you some queso. 
26782 One of the best taco places, definitely the best in Austin. They do more than just the standard fare, they run with things and create unlikely but very tasty combinations. Like their trailer trash and jamaican jerk chicken tacos. BEWARE: They are called torchy's for a reason. very spicy food. 
26783 Excellent pie. They have salads and sandwiches too. Give 'em a call. They will also make large delivery for office party. Good location off of 360 and 2222. 
26784 Amazing brunch deals and specials! Loved coming here for different tastes and the brick walls are pretty cool. Everyone is pretty friendly and there can be a wait. But like with most brunch places you'll want a reso. 
26785 Best latte in van hands down powerful yet smooth. I also really enjoy the spinach and feta scone. 
26786 Love this place! The service is always amazing and the food never disappoints. Loved bringing my mom for Mother's Day! 
26787 THIS DELIVERY TAKES FOREVER ( more than an hour and half to Fenway !!) and they're liars over the phone. Never again and ruined my night. Would give 0 stars if I could 
26788 Pretty quick turn around. Prices are just right for my pocket. Totally will come back! 
26789 Don't ever use there airport parking, their shuttle will never show up and they don't answer the phone either. Waste of money! 
26790 Id give this place no star if i could ... all i gotta say is WORST waitress EVERRRRRRRR. 
26791 Went here with some friends for a drink after work. They had some great specials for liquor and really cheap pitchers. The pizza was good (although nothing spectacular). The patio outside was pretty cool, and the inside is dive-bar-y. 
26792 Great place for quick lunch. Always good food and friendly service. Rolls are good but bowls are better. 
26793 The Porchetta sandwich might be the best sandwich I've ever had. The hot sauce and the mustard were amazing. Top it off with an artisinal soda or craft beer and you're all set for lunch. 
26794 Love LeChon for happy hour! Fantastic food and friendly, attentive staff. 
26795 Place is wonderful. It is a north Austin Jem. The staff is beyond sweet and wonderful. The lamb gyro was fantastic. Love the cute quirkiness over all. Bingets on the house for my first time here were on point. I will def be back! Cheers. 
26796 CASH ONLY I will admit this is the first place I have been that is cash only! The food was amazing! We got the raspberry fool and the brownie fudge and Icecream desserts. I also got hot spiced cider! All delicious and will definitely return (with cash). 
26797 Wings and beer. What else do you need? Seriously though, this place is fun. Always a good crowd, sometimes a little too much but a great place to hang with friends and watch games. Menu is decent and staff is usually quick and friendly. 
26798 Such a cute breakfast spot! Drinks and food where great. Service was okay, but definitely would go back. Worth stopping in. 
26799 This is a man-meal of a sub...prices aren't too shabby either. I swear by a large #3 
26800 Do they not have a menu online or am I blind? It says they have take out but I don't even know what they serve so how do I know what to order? 
26801 Pretty good place, I've always been treated well by these folks. The prices are a little high, but I guess that's to be expected with designer pizza? It's pretty darn good, however they have some stiff competition around town. 
26802 The quality continues to decline each visit. Our pizzas crust was so hard I had to chisel it with a knife to cut it into bite size pieces, barely any sauce and even less toppings:( I remember when Twilight Pizza was the best in town! We won't be back. 
26803 Great Italian food. I always get the Minico's Speciality and eat part of it for lunch the next day! Samantha is a great waitress and she moves fast around the place. 
26804 Love this place.Best hibachi in Columbus.Go here very often and everything is always great & servers are courteous and attentive. 
26805 Wait staff was super sweet and seemed to be doing everything they could, but they can't control the kitchen. Food took an hour to come out and the quality was not good. After a $100 tab for four people and crappy food, I will not be back. Maybe for drinks.... 
26806 Had lunch here with some friends. Food, service and atmosphere was real good. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, no complaints. They are very efficient when it comes to lunch. You will have enough time to eat in peace and enjoy then get back to whatever. 
26807 The best Mexican food we've had since leaving Southern California. Great food, fun staff who were very attentive and willing to deal with my multiple food allergies with grace. I'm near to jumping up and down with happiness to find Mexican food again! 
26808 Food was really good! Got it from door dash and it was delivered in a timely manner and the food was still hot! The flavor is great and the queso is so good with the chimichangas. I would recommend this place! 
26809 Fabulous food from Asian dishes to sushi and sashimi. Good cocktail and beer. Nicely decorated. Loved our server Brianna. 
26810 The building is beautiful, but service was really slow. Don't go for lunch for sure. Took 45 minutes to get a burger and order of fish and chips. Burger and sweet potato fries were decent. Fish was terrible, At least a day or 2 past being fresh. 
26811 Plain and simple, this place fucking rocks !!! Nothing to complain about other than the crawfish lacking in the meat department. Other than that, flavor and portions are on point !! 
26812 Favourite indian place ever. So beautiful I've been coming here even before Renervations. The hot galab jamin is to die for! Also the mango milkshakes 
26813 Delicious, simple, quality ingredients. They only have One thing with two size options but love this place! 
26814 I've gotten take out dinners from Shangri-la twice and enjoyed it. The food was fresh and good, and the orders were correct and on time. During both of my visits, the restaurant was full with customers, so it seems to be a popular place! I will be back. 
26815 Great place.. good burgers.. surely like this one! 
26816 One of the best vietnamese food in town. Friendly staff, delicious food. Prices are reasonable. 
26817 Decent breakfast, but indifferent service...not friendly or welcoming as the name of the place. No greeting when we were waiting to be seated, coffee refills not offered (had to ask). 
26818 Best food in town!!! Love the lamb sis kebob and lavish bread mixed appetizer!! Trust me you don't want to pass up this place it's the best!! 
26819 Great atmosphere, very knowledgeable bar staff, the French fries are amazing and the oysters were the freshest I've ever had. Highly recommended checking it out when visiting Boston 
26820 I'd walk a mile for an iced pour-over. actually 0.9mi, 22min from home (I walk mucho faster tho) per google maps. 
26821 Purchased a Groupon yesterday and was able to get right in. Shannon did an excellent job! I will be returning! 
26822 Had a sausage and a chorizo breakfast taco. Tasty but nothing amazing, I was expecting more from the Yelp reviews. Maybe the normal tacos are more inspired. 
26823 Foods ok. The onion rings are great. Service is always slow. It took us an hour and a half to get lunch one day. 
26824 Came here to try their new S'Awesome sauce with their chicken fingers combo. Chicken was really good. Fries were cold and the sauce was just ok. 
26825 Been to this place many times and always order the Surf n Turf. Never had a bad one and its always delicious. Not the best wait staff but the food is first class !! 
26826 I always recommend this place to my friends. Various specials on food during the week that really give you a bang for your buck. Great food with even better service! 
26827 nice atmosphere and fancy cooking. but pork shoulder is dry and too salty!!! 
26828 Excellent service and good food! Had the corned beef hash with the home fries and bacon and I don't have anything negative to say about it. 
26829 The grits are awesome and I love the beignets. They have home made hot sauce and jam. Tables are small and it gets really crowded. 
26830 Got delivery on a Thursday at 2pm and it took an hour and forty min for a small order. Still pretty good, but not as good as the Amherst ma location. 
26831 Great greasy spoon for Sunday morning breakfasts. Nice local feel, good service, friendly folks. Standard greasy spoon breakfast options and reasonable prices. No cards here--cash only! 
26832 Favorite Vietnamese spot I've had so far after living in Austin the last 3 years. Highly recommend the tofu bahn mi, spring rolls & pho. Other perks: quick service, very casual environment, lots of parking. 
26833 Best spray tan ever!! Would highly recommend coming here to get nice and tan with out damaging your skin!! 
26834 If you are working in the Fort Point area, this is a nice place to go for lunch and to enjoy a refreshing beer/drink. I had the crab cakes, which were seasoned perfectly. Casual atmosphere and they are very accommodating with larger groups as well. 
26835 Yummy enchiladas! There's not much seating as this is essentially a shared commercial kitchen. I wandered here for lunch after dropping my car off at Discount Tire and was very satisfied with my meal! 
26836 Great place to chill, get work done, and enjoy some coffee. Limited food menu, but the coffee and atmosphere makes it worth it. 
26837 Excellent restaurant! The service was fantastic and the food was amazing. Live entertainment was perfect and not too loud. Loved it!! We went back two nights later and it was just at good. 
26838 I love this place. It's quiet, beautifully furnished and sunny. The waitstaff is nice and just attentive enough. There are plenty of vegetarian options and their turkish coffee is delicious. A perfect place for a quiet coffee date or a lunch alone with a book. 
26839 We ate here in April. It was really good. Love the atmosphere. Dark and intimate. The food was authentic. Delicious flavors. Prices reasonable. Will definitely be back. Loved the free parking service. 
26840 Delicious!! We tried a number of menu item and all were amazing, it's a cozy restaurant with top notch service. Great place for a date, casual lunch or romantic dinner! 
26841 The food is always good here but they're fairly crowded. They always manage to keep the line moving and offer pretty good customer service. This is my normal chipotle location and I'm never left unsatisfied. 
26842 No stars. No customer service. No ability to work with customer. Rude and crude. After spending 8000 Needless to say, we cancelled our order. Now waiting for return of. Funds. Anyone know a good lawyer ? ( retorical question, I'll look on yelp) I should have checked their review first 
26843 Lunch with clients here on 27 July. Service was very attentive. Vegetarian version of Cobb Salad was good. But there was lipstick on my water glass. Gross. 
26844 Great split pea soup. Not salty like most restaurant soups. Loved the turkey cranberry croissant. The cranberry sauce and cream cheese created a top notch sandwich. Great stop for a quick bite on a busy day. 
26845 My wife and I have been going there for 6 years now. He does great work. They see my tattoos they ask me who done it. So I send them his way 
26846 Went back a few times and didn't see the bin of clothes where you can fill a bag for $20. Not worth going if they permanently stopped keeping a box to rummage through. All their regular priced clothes are overpriced... Even some of their clearance sales seem to be overpriced. 
26847 Absolutely loved this Tapas! I enjoyed a nice atmosphere and some music sitting on the outside patio with my oldest son. Food is great, I would definitely recommend. They have hookah but that's not my cup of tea so I didn't indulge. Price and drinks 
26848 My kids are now too old for their products, but Feather Baby is still my go-to spot for baby shower gifts. Great selection of unique, organic baby attire. The staff is down to earth and helpful. Highly recommended. 
26849 Really great vegan bakery. So happy to have stumbled upon this place. Very responsible and delicious. They were also very kind to me and my son which helps! Can't wait to go back to try more! 
26850 Great service and atmosphere. Wish I had been able to check out the Clough Club, but was only there for a quick bite. 
26851 I have only been here one time, due to my crazy schedule, but man was it worth the wait! Brilliant setup, tons of variety, good service, slick design. Pure and simple. Best burgers in Austin. 
26852 rude customer service - inexperiences and unprepared personnel - you can definitely find better around 
26853 There are many wonderful restaurants in Winter Park---this is in the top three. Great presentations, fresh, inventive menu. I've been for brunch and dinner and both exceeded expectations. The new location is wonderful inside. I'm a big fan! 
26854 Great Shop with Great Service 
26855 Great drinks, price for a pitcher is the cost of one beer somewhere else. They have karaoke!! 
26856 Another Yelper pointed out to me that '8 Days a Week' is a shout out to the Beatle's song and perhaps and homage to the owners' love of music and shared passion. I like it. 
26857 No shuttle, standing for 30 mins. Already read about this issue with them, but still took chance and experienced the issue first hand. 
26858 Unimpressed with the lemon pound cake (very little lemon flavor and rather granular), or the cinnamon creme cake (dry, wondering where the 'cream' part of it was?). The cinnamon roll, however, was very nice. 
26859 I ate here recently and everything was really fresh and delicious, the service was low-key, pleasant and cordial, and the seating was comfy. All good and no complaints. 
26860 Although their space may be small (6 stools inside and two patio tables outside), their coffee is definitely big. Any coffee shop serving exclusively Roseline coffee knows what they're doing. From their basic drip to their carefully crafted specialty coffee drinks, Never hits the mark every time. 
26861 I've been trying to get off their mailing list for months, I've written them several times and keep getting unsolicited emails from them. I'm sure their food is lovely but it's illegal to not have a working unsubscribe option on unsolicited emails. 
26862 For the most part I enjoyed it but the bananas were not ready which made for a weird flavor and somewhat bland a√ßa√≠ bowl 
26863 Q was amazing. She worked with my style and made me feel comfortable with a cut, root touch up and highlights. Highly recommend! 
26864 Wish I could give zero stars. Paid $466/night for this horrific place. Do not stay here. Very over priced. Unhappy with how much it cost 
26865 They are a class act, for atmosphere, food, and specials. You can't go wrong; a sure bet when visiting the SoCo in Austin. 
26866 This restaurant is so fun! Love the atmosphere and menu options :) Great view of the river and fast/friendly service. My new favorite place in Vancouver! 
26867 Store was fine but the restaurant was awful. My cinnamon roll could have been used as a hockey puck, stale and hard. My sandwich roll was also stale and needed 45 secs in the microwave to be edible. Employees were not very friendly 
26868 Perfect environment for watching a Timbers game, hanging out and having drinks with friends, and to let loose with some pool, skeeball, shuffleboard it buck hunter. 
26869 My favorite place to go! They have any kind of atmosphere you could ever want. Can sit at the bar, have a nice meal at a table, or sit down with your significant other in front of their fireplace. A+++ 
26870 I love this place! They have great quality of food and one of the few places I can get a gluten free burger! 
26871 Food is incredible. Like seriously. Service is very polite. BLACK OWNED BUSINESS. It is clear they care about their customers. Will definitely go again 
26872 Second time we've noticed bad service - Slow and Luke warm food. Probably our last visit here - just not worth the $40 I paid for me and my wife. There are much better places here in Columbus. 
26873 This is place is in the bottom 1% of my Chinese food experiences. The atmosphere in the restaurant is creepy and the food tastes bad. 
26874 Awesome food, the waitresses were very nice and gave great service! I would definitely recommend this restaurant! 
26875 This bleepy lady answers the phone and I ask a question she answers it and quickly says good buy and hangs up as I am asking another question. Lost my money and I won't be eating here again. You can find me at GOOD BROTHERS PIZZA. 
26876 Great food, breakfast tacos rock 
26877 Seriously tasty food. Mouth watering goodness and really generous amount too! I usually get at least 2 full meals out of an order :) 
26878 Cupcakes are fine. Nothing too exciting. The gal with the purple hair is the best person in the universe. 
26879 Thought they were Japanese run but to my surprise, it is a little higher end Korean-run sushi restaurant. The portions are smaller, dishes are fancier, prices are a bit higher as well. Quality is there too so I'm not really complaining. Oh one complaint: their chairs are really uncomfy... 
26880 I couldn't find the Orlando PF so I went to the one in Kissimmee. The gym was clean but rather small even for a short guy lol. 
26881 Have always gotten take-out for convenience sake so I can't comment on the service or ambience, but the food never disappoints. I like the pad thai and the cashew chicken. 
26882 I love going to Genies! They have great coffee, cagefree eggs, and friendly service. There are very creative choices, and breakfast is available all day. I have also had some excellent soup at Genies! I highly recommend it. 
26883 I went to Dimitri's office and opened a mutual fund. He was so helpful and knowledgeable. I had no idea what I was doing so I had tons of questions and they had snacks bonus! 
26884 Healthier than regular donuts but wayyyyy less tasty. I mean, if you are going to eat a donut, then eat a real donut!! That being said, I know a lot of people that like it. I'm just not one of them. 
26885 Food is amazing. Great service, too. Just a really fun place to be! The patio is great, and they have done tons of updates. Great menu & the staff os awesome! A+++++ 
26886 I wish I read the reviews before heading there. A very short menu, not many options. You will wait forever for the food, and it won't be spectacular. Otherwise, location is great. 
26887 Super barbers!!! have had my hair cut here a few times - everyone who works here is really great, fun to talk to, and they take their job seriously - I'm impressed! 
26888 Basil duck and pineapple fried rice is mind blowing. Online takeout, friendly staff, quick delivery. Can't go wrong here!! 
26889 This gentleman catered our wedding. Yes, that is how addicted we are to his tacos (he makes killer enchiladas too, just not at his truck). He makes his own chorizo. You can't beat his al pastor. Give him your money. 
26890 Excellent meal. Had avocado toast (which was fantastic), octopus and beet salad. Liked the octopus the least of the 3 but they were all good. Had the snapper special for the main which was great. Only negative is that there is no desert. 
26891 I've never had Peruvian food before, but everything I ate was delicious, and I only stopped eating because my stomach couldn't physically contain anything else. The seating is cozy but there are a lot of bar seats and it creates a nice cozy atmosphere. 
26892 Great atmosphere.Terrific service. Industrial chic styling, good music, plenty of seating. The coffee is very good, and pastries are fresh and delicious. I'll stop in whenever I visit Brighton. 
26893 This place is amazing! I am very picky when it comes to my hair, and I was truly impressed. I received numerous compliments on my haircut. 
26894 I cannot say enough good things about Michelle, Bob and Wicked Good Dog. Our Lab comes home absolutely pooped from play group. I would absolutely recommend Wicked Good Dog for anyone in the Quincy area. They are fabulous!! 
26895 Food taste was great, but I doubt they serve with fresh food. It seemed like stocked food. Each dish Comes with chai/coffee which is unusual but it's good. Place to try though. 
26896 The ice cream here is tremendous but people need to be made aware of the fact that this place is also selling the best breakfast sandwiches in the area on Saturdays and Sundays. 
26897 Kevin and Megan are a fantastic addition to the Kirkwood Community! We haven't had a bad thing since we started going there. Thanks so much for offering a fantastic experience all around!!! 
26898 The fish and chips were good. The beer was good. The river view was great. The service was just okay. 
26899 Great service, lovely people and delicious food. The vegetarian friendly lunch buffet is a great way to catch a quick bite of healthy food in the middle of your work week! 
26900 Simply amazing. Great drinks, the sangria was phenomenal. I don't really like octopus, but it was delicious there. Short rib was cooked perfectly. The coconut ice cream was extremely delicious. Also, our server Michael was great ! Highly recommend dining here and I'll definitely be back very soon. 
26901 Poor attitude and not even decent prices. Would not buy from them. Did a purchase some time ago but no longer freindly 
26902 Crappy service. We were the.first people in the restaraunt that day and the last served. We never had our drinks refilled and were ignored the whole time we were there. 
26903 Had the best time! The staff was friendly tons of songs danced all night. Everyone should check this place out ! Its by far the best place to karoake that has opened in awhile! 
26904 So good. Vegetarian platter and the lamb were perfect. The mother was the cook and her daughter the server. Very authentic. 
26905 Just go and get the Thali. Simply amazing. Kind staff. So reasonable. 
26906 Best selection of dried fruit ever! Did I also mention the cheapest? I'm obsessed with dried apples and mangos, and this place has lots. Even dried cantaloupe! So many different types of raisins to choose from too. Writing this reminds me I need to go stock up! 
26907 Heaven and Bliss. Bliss and Heaven. The best espresso based coffee beverages around, Bar None. 
26908 Great place for coffee as usual...but if you have CLEAR Wi-FI you can not connect here inside....only outside. Sucks. 
26909 Decent. I had the sushi entree, which was a good variety of fish. Fun atmosphere, but a little too expensive for what it is. 
26910 The food is really good overall! I am a big fan of the pork tenderloin sandwich especially I would leave a star out for the menu. It'll probably help if they rotate items in and out to change things up. 
26911 I have been a patient of Dr. Nussbaum's for a very long time. Really, has it been that long? He and his staff are simply the best! I very highly recommend! 
26912 Long wait and pricey, but best Ahi tuna burger with avocado that I've ever had. They even let me put a fried egg on it. 
26913 Some of the best ramen I've had in the Portland metro. Noodles are perfect, the broth rich and full, and the pork in the classic Shoyu was impressive - fell apart and not chewy or weird. Pricing seemed normal for portion size. Service was killer as well. Great little spot! 
26914 Awesome spot to find some lesser known mens brands; they had some great quality raw denim too. One thing to note: they recently moved locations from the North End to Newbury & Dartmouth. May be a bit tough to find, it's in a basement level shop. 
26915 This place is AMAZING!!!!! I loved the alfredo and baked ziti was phenomenal. I am so happy I have found a great place to eat in the north end! I can't wait to go back!!! The service was great and the atmosphere was dark, perfect for date night!!! 
26916 The place is eclectic near Grant Park. The people are all very friendly but Kylie was superb! A cute southern girl that listened to my vision and then helped me make it a reality. Very clean place and would definitely go back. 
26917 Food is OK, but the service is bad.: Battle Tracey is very rude. When I asked a simple question about the manual, she said "really?!!" , looked at me for 2 seconds like I was idiot. 
26918 This is my go to Chinese place while I'm at lunch. Its tasty, cheap and fast. 
26919 This place has some really awesome burgers. Granted, you stand in line for a while but it is well organized for the crowd they get. The beer selection is also good. The fries and the burgers are great! 
26920 Pathetic food quality. Yesterday we order chilli chicken and the chicken seemed stale and very old. We got stomach pains after eating that food. They have increased the price like 5 star restaurants, but not determined to give quality of food. 
26921 Decent selection but doesn't compete with taco deli or taco flats. Convenient for a post drink bite On Rock Rose. Great interior and attentive staff. 
26922 Really great food! Service is a little slow but I went in around lunch and it was packed! Tried something new and really enjoyed it! If you are looking for a great Korean place, check them out! A little pricey but worth it! 
26923 Great service and wonderful Italian food. My wife and I stop here for the bolognese and it never disappoints us. 
26924 I have only had one bad experience in this franchise... But I love this food. And the team members are always very hip, courteous, helpful and sweet. Way to go! 
26925 Staff here is always super friendly. Sometimes it can get crowded because of various activities that are scheduled, but it's never too bad. Availability to a jacuzzi and sauna make this my favorite 24 in the area. 
26926 Service was horrible food was okay my fork was dirty as well as the table we asked for table to be clean "they cleaned it" clearly they did not we had to ask again to get it clean. Plus the drink took forever to get 20 min for one drink. 
26927 Not a bad place for a coffee! Nice atmosphere, a bit like Starbucks. Coffee was fine, blueberry muffin was wimpy. Opt for the local joint if you can. If Peet's is the last place open, go for it. 
26928 Good little neighbourhood convenience store that also serves up decent falafel/donairs. As a vegan, a good option and the store also carries some healthier options such as Amy's soups, coconut water, almon milk, cliff bars and more. Service is always friendly, too. 
26929 Scratch is awesome! I've gone a couple times. It is very apparent that all of their food is made from scratch. The portions are generous, and the prices are reasonable. 
26930 Have frequented this restaurant for a few years. What was once consistently good food and friendly service has turned into a crap shoot over the last several months. I contacted the Clackamas County health department after my last visit, which by the way, was my last visit. 
26931 Eat here all the time! Greg sushi and noodles at a great price! And their happy hour is fantastic! 
26932 Went with some for reverse happy hour. EVERYONE was very friendly. Great atmosphere, even better food. Highly recommended!! 
26933 Green curry was excellent. The lemon flavor accented the sauce and the lobster was cooked perfectly. The fried rice had a nice blend of ingredients - really enjoyed the sweetness brought on by the chunks of pineapple. The octopus dish was mediocre - a bit gummy and bland. 
26934 It's good like mall Chinese food or Taco Bell as long as you know it's bland and not authentic it's enjoyable. 
26935 Great bagel BLT's and yummy chai tea lattes. Service is always fantastic and they never disappoint. 
26936 I've been for breakfast and lunch. Yes, the service is slow, but it's not pretending to be anything other than a laid back granola-y type of chicken joint. Roast chicken is very tasty and I love the cookies! 
26937 this place is incredible! The tortas are so good. A little slice of Mexico 
26938 Chris at Lamb's Tire and Automotive along with rest of the guys are super! Extremely friendly, honest automotive work at a fair price. Will continue going back for my automotive needs. Thanks 
26939 Outstanding food, service, and ambiance. Have been twice so far and both times a home run. Scallops, steak, lamb were all superb. Tried three different deserts with same result. First courses run small, although excellent. 
26940 This place sucks from the food preparation, to the oven they use. Pizza is just awful. You get better taste eating the pizza box.The Arby's of pizza. 
26941 Best Indian food I have ever eaten, too bad I didn't refrigerate my leftovers and they got bad. Delivery was super fast. The delivery driver was so nice. Will definitely come back for more delicious food:) 
26942 I kicked at this place with Blake and Ann-Marie and it was good. Kabobs and dirty rice was on point. Also the Flan was slamming as per Ann-Marie. Blake had the egg burger. Will definitely come back. 
26943 Steak was excellent, otherwise, not my kind of place. Older crowd, on the verge of too formal for no reason. Busy happy hour crowd in the bar area. 
26944 Such a cozy spot! Food is good, favorite was the sriracha glazed Brussel sprouts 
26945 Excellent food and drink, average services. It took a long time till someone came to us after we were seated. The sandwiches are really exceptionally good and drinks were ok. 
26946 I rarely wait to eat at the airport, but Fuel is the place I look forward to going back to. The Panini's are from another world, especially the Turkey and fig spread, mmm yam yam. Great service and very friendly staff. 
26947 Excellent Chinese food!! Very clean establishment, huge portions, great prices!! The combo meals come with a meat, fried rice, soup and an egg roll. Big enough to feed two people, no question!! 
26948 Love this place! I always order the strawberry passionfruit w pearls. It is fresh, with delicious chewy peals. Only negative would be the long lines and there are usually only 2 ppl working, so expect a wait during weekend nights. 
26949 It's a major sausage fest! Great food, great times. Give the boot a try but make sure to use uber..... 
26950 The drinks were inventive and tasty, and they were made to have outside on the patio on a sunny day! The ahi tuna flatbread made for a great lunch...loved the fresh arugula. 
26951 Never actually been to park but rec center next to it has a great basketball league. The court is a little slick so make sure your Jordan's have some tread left on them. 
26952 AMAZING FOOD. I guess the AC wasn't working and I was sweating pretty badly, but FORGET THAT the food was GREAT. I had the lamb plate and it blew my mind away. 
26953 Stopped by to grab a frozen caffeinated drink. Ghirardelli chocolate is always good and they handed out some free ones 
26954 While on a getaway about a year ago to Boston, I enjoyed spending the afternoon at this place. Kind of like a small version of Hearst Castle here on the west coast. Whenever I get back to Boston, I'll find my way back to the Gardner Museum. 
26955 Stopped here for carryout driving on 71 and got the chicken parm sandwich with all the toppings, so good and great price!! Definitely would love to go back 
26956 Mexican Vanilla!!!!! Theres no place like amys 
26957 theres no place like amys 
26958 I guess, I'm too spoiled and being biased because I love Powell's on Burnside so much. For some reason, it always a little dark for me at this location! But I'm still at big fan! :) 
26959 This place would rate higher in my book if you could enjoy their dine in experience without having to listen to excessively loud screaming music. Food is 4 stars. 
26960 The meat is a 7/10 the rice is a 2/10 and the purple sour crap is a -4/10. Only had catering from them- they are expensive (overpriced). Also the pitas are NOT homemade-meh 
26961 This place is amazing! Great drinks, really good breakfast sandwiches. The owner, Lucy, is super rad. I felt at home right away here, and knew this would be my new favorite coffee spot in the neighborhood. What a gem! I'm in love 
26962 Came through for a quick "drive thru" only because I heard bad things about this place. The food I ordered hit the spot though! Delicious! 
26963 Such a wonderful and memorable experience! Unlike any museum I have ever been to- really talented and funny actors bring the whole Boston Tea Party to life. A job well done: great hands-on experience with yummy tea and extensive gift shop. I didn't want the tour to end! 
26964 Awesome service! The food was good too....it's a definite recommendation for a great night out of drinks, good food, and a great atmosphere. 
26965 Overall great service! Nice little thing they got going here. I had the Korean tacos: beef, shrimp, and chicken. Beef and shrimp were amazing! The chicken was a little disappointing but the awesome side of dumplings and sweet potatoes were my favorite! Haha I highly recommend :) 
26966 Great view! Worth the time and money! The entrance was at a fair price. The ride took about 20 minutes, which was just enough. 
26967 This is the last day of Christmas trip from Southern California and we found this restaurant. Food and service are excellent!! I definitely recommend Saigon Noodle & Bistro! 
26968 UH-MAZING!! Seriously......even just the $2 plain waffle with butter...i would be willing to do some pretty questionable things to make the two bucks that these waffles cost just to get one! Those people giving it the pooh-pooh should just suck it....it doesn't get better than this! Especially on the go! 
26969 egg crumpet sandwich was great! if i was a local this would be my breakfast spot 
26970 Had a good experience with the threaders here! I'm not from the area so was glad I found a threading place that kept up with my shape-demands. Pain wise I would give them a 7/10 for average, not the most painful but not the least painful. 
26971 So delicious. Dinner made out of donuts. This is what America is about. The South Lamar location is amazing and the food is super filling. Chicken fried steak is always a winner. 
26972 Its a nice and long walk, both sides of the lake. You see a lot of the city. Plenty of fun activities along the way, involving the lake as well! Grrat for a jogging or walking path. 
26973 Although it was delivered late, rightfully expected during an epic snowstorm, it was amazing! I highly recommend the coconut tomato soup on a cold winters day! 
26974 This place is an experience. I absolutely love it and have every intention of going back. The pork belly was delicious. The dessert was beautiful. The service is personal and well-executed. 
26975 When I tell you guys this is the best massage I have ever gotten believe me! Vivian did a fantastic job, she was very friendly and had me feeling brand new! I will for sure be coming back here! 
26976 Had a great time at this location last Friday night! The pretzel with beer cheese was killer, and the bartenders Mike and Heather made sure I wasn't without a drink the whole time. Exceptional food, drink, atmosphere, and service. What more can you ask for? I will definitely be back! 
26977 Solid Mojitos and Venezuelan fair. Love their empanadas mechadas. Their Brookline Village location is poorly lit - not enough light inside and no window treatments makes everything backlit. 
26978 DO NOT hire this bus company. They will rip you off. Christopher needs to learn how to run a business and he needs to learn about customer service. He took our money and left us stranded because he never showed up to pick us up. Completely unprofessional and rude! 
26979 This was my first visit and it was delicious! I ordered the chicken kabob with saffron rice. It came with a cucumber salad and tziki (sp?). The saffron rice needed a slight umph to it so I added the yogurt sauce and hot sauce to it. I'll definitely be back! 
26980 Wow just got my nails done by a lady who was facetiming with her man friend while painting my nails. Completely unprofessional and sloppy. She could have at least pretended to make an effort. 
26981 Good bottled kombucha. Outdoor seating. Friendly staff. Great place to study or work. 
26982 Perfect addition to our neighborhood. Love all the instructors, especially Jonathan and Bob who encourage you every step of the way through the most intense of sessions. Be sure to sign up for a Yoga class. Great way to balance things out! 
26983 Cheap price, fast service , many many selections. Vietnamese, Cantonese, Chow Zhou cooking, and Korean style too. During the weekend, it is easier to order togo then eating in because the place is very crowded. And the noise level is very high as well. 
26984 Jessica is a great massage therapist! I really enjoyed my deep tissue massage yesterday. I'll definitely be back. :) 
26985 Captain Rick is professional and very knowledgable!! We had a great time and saw several large alligators!! We had a blast and the kids loved it!! Entertainment money well spent!! Highly recommend you take a spin with Captain Rick! 
26986 Expect to wait as there is a long line up to be seated. Food is great, try the waffles... cozy interior. Servers are friendly 
26987 Best pizza place for hawaiian pizza! My Fianc√© and i have been eating here everyonce in a while since our first date almost 6 years ago. The quality is great, the customer service is on point. I recommend this place to everyone! :) 
26988 Awesome shop! Great customer service! Small business like this is what makes Portland great! Prices are very reasonable. Worth the trip. 
26989 I love this place. Great bartenders, live Irish music, and always open until 2. Truly one of Boston's finest. 
26990 Hands down THE BEST Publix in the area! I know the store's layout and everyone working there is so nice and helpful. Love the BOGO's they have each week. We are very lucky to have this Publix in our community. :) 
26991 Went here Sunday night for dinner and it was outstanding!!! Pita and hummus tasting was impeccable. Sea bass and lobster were very fresh and not drenched in sauces. The capers gave it a nice taste. I want to go here more often!!! Thanks for a great experience Kyma! 
26992 I had the short stack of pancakes and they were huge and super fluffy. And they were also super filling. I love the breakfast they have here and I am sure I will come here again for sure! 
26993 Latte was good but matcha napoleon was soggy despite it was made today. Earl grey cake was just ok. It was not worth the price of $6 something. What a disappointment. 
26994 While I originally stopped in for the great drinks and atmosphere, the food nails a delicate balance which is a bit difficult for me to describe. All you need to know is that you should go. 
26995 Jacks has the best pizza for a cheap price and what I also love is that they stay open late and they have cheap Beer. The only draw back is the service isn't that great. But the food makes up for it 
26996 Cucumber salad - check Taiwanese pork belly buns - check Steamed buns - check BYOB - awesome - The store next door has a beer cabinet with Kirin Ichiban six packs ... converting my six pack into a keg Order at the counter and enjoy the friendliest service imaginable. 
26997 Christine's is a homey restaurant with attentive service, but mediocre food. I came for breakfast and was immediately seated and greeted by our server, who was knowledgable of the menu. The offerings are pretty basic (breakfast combos, omelettes, etc.), but do the job, and coffee refills were constant. 
26998 Bad experience! The food we ordered were not worth that price and the service was slow. 
26999 Had a very good blackened tuna sandwich and a very nice cab, Hwy 12. Don't miss the Monday night special, vino burger plus a paired wine for $15. See you Monday night! 
27000 Convenient with a great selection (nicely priced wine too). It's family owned, and they are always friendly and helpful. Best brownies ever (hoping to get my hands on one of their lunch specials soon). 
27001 This is the Wednesday spot, $6 Pho!! Plus they always have soccer on, that's a big plus for me. 
27002 Fried pickles are the best I've tried in Vancouver, both times I have eaten here it has been great. Nice work guys, not just another burger place - fun and interesting sides, too. Highly recommend trying something adventurous on the menu =) 
27003 Delicious food at a reasonable price. Endless meat that had good flavor. Recommend definitely and will go back 
27004 Le did such a good job on my SNS nails and cleaned up my cuticles super nice :) really nice and relaxing salon. Everything is clean and organized and they had a lot of colors! 
27005 Great atmosphere, great pizza, and cold beer. A fun place to go with friends. Try the Caesar salad - very good. 
27006 This place is one of my favorites. You get food when you want it and the ambiance is fun with good energy. Great crowd. 
27007 The food has good taste but if u want a bad stomach ache then go for it , not healthy at all even if its a ''third meal'' late at night. 
27008 The dumplings and pancakes were great. I also ordered the beef noodle soup. The noodles were good but my soup was below average tbh. I didn't really want to continue eating that dish so luckily I had two other dishes to work with as a friend and I shared today. 
27009 Boba is good. Hella sweet (ask for them to tone it down and it's excellent). Staff is nice if not a little ambivalent. Excellent rewards app! 
27010 SABRINA had the worst attitude at the register! Might want to move her to the back and wash dishes if she is going to continue to work there. 
27011 We stopped in for something sweet on our way through town, OMG the tarts are amazing! 
27012 This is the best Iranian food I have ever eaten! The restaurant feels like home and the customer serves is great, super nice people! 
27013 Nick was really cool. Mashed potatoes and broccoli were great. Chicken was a tad dry. Extensive list of wines, but we didn't have any. Service was super fast. Bit pricey. Lots of glasses of water. Probably would go again. Thanks Nick (he was our waiter). 
27014 All you can eat salad and breadsticks is always great! We finished our night off with the black tie mousse cake. It was delicious. Ronnie was an awesome server! We love the tablet on the table you can pay with. Very convenient! 
27015 Love the food! Happy hour is great! No complaints! Oh and their curry mussels are the best! 
27016 Came in from out of town. First off, it cost to much to get in considering the overall ambiance. 2nd, the God damn speakers are turned up WAY TO LOUD. Louder is NOT always better. Overall horrible place. Go somewhere else. 
27017 Kyle is very rude bad customer service! He ignored me and even helped someone else that came in after me. He made need a customer service course. Never again! 
27018 walked into Bobs thought ok nice little store ,prices kinda high,watched the guy behind the counter making a sandwich then he stops sneezes into his hand then keeps making the sandwich yea ok turn around and head out never to return,good luck with that mucus itailian. 
27019 Extremely pleased with service and staff- especially Gennie. When entering the store you're greeted but left alone if you wish. No heavy sales pressure or presence. We purchased a close-out product and the staff assisted in loading into car. 
27020 Wowzers!! They say everything is bigger in TX well they are right!! Man, one breakfast taco can feed a village! I am now a Macho Fan! 
27021 Best Cuban restaurant I've been to so far outside of Miami. They even have Cuban bread! And their prices were reasonable. Very impressed. 
27022 Never again !!! Found a dead bug in a dish from the buffet!! When I showed it to the staff, the response was just a sheepish grin, no apology or anything. They just don't care for the quality or health of customers. 
27023 One of the best soy London fog. I love London fog and have tried it from many places. It is very well blended and not too sweet. It is very smooth and frothy too. The place is awesome but it is very busy in the morning. 
27024 I love to dance, meet new people, and have awesome drinks thrown in the mix too and this is the place.I could go on about this place, but I'm wasting precious dance moves.......so.......later gator. ;) 
27025 Was excited to try this place. Saw on yelp they are open until 10pm. Came by at 9pm (other people were eating) and they told us they were closed? Disappointing. 
27026 Nothing fancy but the food is good, great place for a bite to eat. plus a bit of history always adds to its charm..........that was my original review, went back last month and the food wasnt good at all we actually sent back the calamari because it was really fishy!!!! 
27027 Best bloody mary's, best eggs benedicts, cute setting, awesome staff, love it! 
27028 Very good food. I have only been once. Went on a Sunday and had a 15 minute wait. I can see why though. Everyone at the table really enjoyed their food and it came out quickly. Will definitely be back. 
27029 SO GOOD. Ate here 3 days in a row while on vacation. Amazing menu. Really respect the recognition of different countries each specific meal is from. Prices are super reasonable. Drooled each time. 
27030 Fun place, great food, good drinks! Hoppin on a Monday night at 10:30 so I have to imagine it'd make a great happy hour or late night workweek spot any day of the week. 
27031 The staff at La Raine's was great! We couldn't have been all around more happy with the boutique. My future sister in law said yes to the dress here today! Thank you again for everything. By far the best place we came across in Georgia!!! 
27032 Completely yummy. Best Cuban food I've ever had. Satisfying lunch of grilled fish, salad, plantains, congria (rice/black beans mix). Healthy, fresh, nicely seasoned, moderately priced. 
27033 I don't like burgers but I'm a fan of Hopdoddy's Primetime (because I love brie and truffles). All they need is sweet potato fries! 
27034 SLOWEST PLACE EVER. I have been waiting for 30 min for 2 freakin tacos.. I can see the girl on her phone when she should be working.. 
27035 Great food, actually a good veggie menu. Fried green tomatoes was amazing! The service was attentive and accommodating. Would definitely go back! 
27036 I love there shrimp and grits tacos!!!!! Those are by far the best tacos I have had!!!! If your reading this you need to go and get a shrimp and grits taco. And a slice of red velvet cake as well. Tell them I referred you!!!! 
27037 Excellent selection of succulents, desert plants, and air plants. They also sell small containers and pots for your selection. Great place for a housewarming or host gift. 
27038 Good food - shockingly rude service. My husband and I were so uncomfortable with the bad mood the girl was in. Maybe she should've stayed home today. 
27039 Meatball Sub and Grider: A+. Tight squeeze in there with all the customers. 
27040 The wait staff are super friendly and pretty helpful, but sometimes a little slow depending on how busy it is in there. The food is super yummy! I have been several times and cannot pull myself away from the Vermicelli Lover's dish. 
27041 Fair on service they were noticeably not happy by the lack of smiles. Food was what to be expected but it was served lukewarm. Overall experience 2stars at best 
27042 Decent restaurant for a quick, good lunch. Usually crowded but we always find a table. I've gone with the lunch group a couple of times now and have been pleased. Luckily I have a coworker to help guide me through the menu. A-Ok! 
27043 excellent!! food was great , service was excellent. absolutely no complaints. this was my first time at this restaurant and it will not be my last. 
27044 Lots of cool stuff, but WAY understaffed...I shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes at a cash register to buy a pair of shorts. Three registers, one cashier. BAD! 
27045 Amazingly good. Had a Reuben and it was perfect. My wife had the Lobster Bisque and a salad. I must admit. All was in the top 10. Brown ala mode was top shelf as well. A must if you like chocolate. 
27046 Sign on windows says 'Permanently Closed'. Save yourself a trip downtown. They were pulling ovens and cooking utensils out. Doesn't look as though they will be reopening. 
27047 Came in for a dessert donut because I heard so many good things. Ordered the funky monkey. Great service. Amazing donut. Game changer. 
27048 It's really hard to find good places for outside in Orlando, and this is a hidden gem. The large outside patio offers a quite, shaded environment for breakfast any time of day. But my favorites are their salads, particularly the ones with salmon or fruit ingredients. Light and refreshing. 
27049 I can't complain...Sam and his team did good work for me twice. He showed up when he said he would, and the results are great. He's a little gruff, but who cares? Angie's List rating is an "A" BTW. 
27050 Bad portions and they changed how they cut the steak which leaves the gristle now and is absolutely disgusting. Nothing like Genji at all. Not worth it. 
27051 Excellent place Prices are super affordable Food is Delicious..prepare yourself to embrace the experience.. 
27052 GREAT atmosphere. GREAT drinks and drink selection. Bad food. Typical of the last 5 or 6 suggestions we have received from friends in Austin. Too cute with the food again. How can a $20 burger be b-a-d? We did have a wonderful evening as it is truly a great atmosphere! 
27053 Love love love this place! The band was awesome and it was such great energy and vibes. If you get there around 6, you don't have to pay a cover charge. Im pretty sure this is gonna be my new favorite spot. 
27054 Five stars for everybody at Heathrow urgent care. The staff is friendly and professional. I drive all the way from O town to Heathrow urgent care because every time I'm so satisfied with the results of the care, it's outstanding. 
27055 Another great Mediterranean grill. Awesome service and food. Owner was personable and great, must visit when you are local. 
27056 The tacos were excellent. Great atmosphere, not too fancy and not too causal. Margaritas were also tasty. Great service as well. 
27057 Fast and cheap! I brought 4 new tires to the shop to have mounted and balanced. They were done in 15 mins and it was far cheaper than any other places I received quotes from. A++ 
27058 Amazing! Burger was cooked perfectly. The bun was so good. I have to say this was the best burger I've ever had. I tried the Guacapotle. Looking forward to trying more. 
27059 Today was my first time in Salon Borealis, Michael was fantastic!! I highly recommend him and this Salon. Every one was very warm and friendly as well, Great cut and amazing color! Very satisfied!! 
27060 First time here, ordered steak and onions, and it was delicious. Really liked the restaurant and atmosphere, prices were very fair. Will definitely be back! 
27061 I don't even remember my sub. The wait was way too long. I was late getting back to work which was only 5 minutes away. It is purely chaotic in there. It's hard to move around the tables. Not set up well. 
27062 I come here way too often. LOVE the sushi..so friggin good those special rolls! and the spicy wonton chips with salmon?? MMMM. THe scorpion bowl is nice and the atmosphere is chill. 
27063 Excellent working with Erica. Had an order for new blinds plus cut down some old blinds for new windows. Complicated but everything came out right. Nominal fee to cut the old blinds, very ecological to be able to reuse them. 
27064 Ordered a hotdog and fries. Service was great and the food was delicious. If you are in a hurry and want to grab a quick bite to eat this place is great!! 
27065 Great food overall, good service, friendly family workers and lively atmosphere. 
27066 I love love their cakes!! I get one for every occasion. We are getting our one year anniversary cake tomorrow. Already planning my next cake for my birthday!! Highly recommended. Staff is always great!! 
27067 Amazing as always! Started off with the queso con carne which was great. I had the Howlah sampler which was absolutely delicious and my son had a burrito with grilled chicken and black beans. Generous portions, attentive wait staff, and incredible food at reasonable prices! 
27068 We ordered our food for delivery and were told it would take one hour. They were over an hour late. The restaurant was rude and unhelpful when we called wondering where our food was. When it ultimately arrived, the food was cold. 
27069 The Good: -Authentic -Great food -Good service -Affordable The Bad: -None 
27070 Bose is an awesome company. They honor their warranty and the employees have the best customer service! John and Linco specifically helped me when I went in and made sure I got the right product at a good price. all day. 
27071 Their baked goods are on point. I went for fried chicken burger, unfortunately it was sold out. Tried egg sandwich instead. Not bad not bad. Willing to visit anytime soon. 
27072 First time and I will say that the shrimp po boy was delicious, the wait staff was awesome. Thank you Danielle and Christine were great. Will come again 
27073 good, but not the most amazing brunch place EVER (like many reviews state). Worth the trip, but if there's a line, come back another day. Not worth the hour long wait. 
27074 One phrase...."Shrimp is what they do". The portion sizes are on point. The seasoning on the shrimp is sheer perfection. The sauce is unbelievable. We definitely will return! "Shrimp is what they do", and they do it very well. 
27075 4 words: Emory frat boys. Yuck. 
27076 Poor customer service, I ordered online and when I arrived they said there would be a 30 minute delay, although there weren't many other customers. They promptly made my bowl, and it is subpar. The produce seems mediocre at best. Not necessarily worth the money in my opinion. 
27077 Love their chocolate cherry cookie bars. Seriously delicious. Just wish they opened earlier on week days. Stopping by for morning baked goods is impossible when I have to be at work by 8. 
27078 One of our favs. The beer is never a disappointment and always happy with the brews on tap. Always a good mix offered each time we go. The location works well for us and easier to get to than other local breweries. Definitely worth trying! 
27079 We sent in our dog to get his summer hair cut, and he came back with fleas! Never taking him there again!! 
27080 This place has AMAZING gluten free cupcakes! The lady behind the counter was pretty awesome too! LOVE THIS PLACE! We'll definitely be back! Yummmmmmmmm... 
27081 It is our first time here, and it is the best hookah experience I have ever had. Low cushions for community smoking, amazing customer service, and great flavors. I couldn't have asked for a better time with my friends. Thank you, Kasbah. I will absolutely be back. 
27082 I need them to know how to cook what's on their menu. I got the Morning Flatbread which came without crumbled hash browns and melted cheese. They took it back and just broke up the hash browns on top no melted cheese. The service was great #knowyourownmenu 
27083 The rabbit dish is delicious! The service is great! Great restaurant for a date! 
27084 Last post but the owner so happily apologized for the mistake and I came back and gave it another chance and the mussels are too die for! Also desert was so yummy! Service was good even with having a big party! Thank you again 
27085 Very friendly and attentive staff. Their Chicken Korma with their fresh Naan bread Is The BEST, I Love It! 
27086 This was a great choice near our hotel, Inn at Northrop Station, which was no more than a 5 min walk. Yummy!! 
27087 Great food, quick service, nice staff. No ambience to speak of, and they may not give you free chips but they have a great condiment bar with a variety of fresh house salsas, limes, etc. Authentic Mexican! 
27088 Excellent food, great service and easy parking. We arrived at 8:45 on a Sunday so plan your arrival before the crowd starts coming at around 9:30. Highly recommended. 
27089 The reviews clearly speak for themselves. Anticipate waiting in line, most likely wrapping around the corner, as well as unique, delicious burgers. 
27090 Started out slowly with our waiter missing our table, but the quality of the meal made it entirely worth it. 
27091 Yummy!!!! Always good and they always remember me. Go here about once week and order yellow curry. More expensive than Titaya's but they put more chicken in the dish. When your'e up north, by far the best thai around. 
27092 I absolutely love the booths in this place. The menu is quite large and the food is fairly cheap and portions are large. They decorate very nicely for the holidays too. 
27093 The coconut soup is delicious i get mine with chicken also the the thai curry dishes are really good i get either the yellow curry with chicken or the seafood service super friendly place very clean 
27094 Absolutely love the vegetarian sampler platter. Delicious light fluffy falafel, dank grape leaf wraps, creamy hummus, tasty tabouli, excellent rice and pita. Very solid healthy vegan option. There are a couple other great Mediterranean restaurants in the neighborhood but Phoenicia has my favorite falafel. 
27095 Good place, however it's now closed. There are signs on the door saying they the owner had to return to his country. No re-open date. I sent pictures and contacted Groupon to remove their deal so people don't waste money :-/ 
27096 Busy bee was my go to place for food. But over the years the food and the service has declined. The food can get a bit pricey 
27097 IKEA - - We went Friday Evening - the store wasn't busy and very easy to Navigate from One design display to another. IKEA's prices are affordable and comparable to other furniture and home devour stores. The food selection include holiday treats, IKEA's famous swishing meatballs and 
27098 A 50-minute massage for $40?! 'nuff said. AND you can get some yummy oils, lotions, candles and even organic lip balm in their store! 
27099 Fast and efficient and getting in and out and the place was packed. Rented a tandem in good condition, just wished it had a kickstand. 
27100 ...Amazing. Duck breast was incredible! Accommodated my surprise bday party of 14 flawlessly! 
27101 Love that they're in a lower traffic area. Really enjoyed my friendly cashier. Love that they have the old school version of my favorite drink on the actual menu, and that they did it up right! I'm a fan! 
27102 Consistently delicious!!! Went back 3 times in one week!!! Their soup dumplings!!!! Beef stew soup!!! Duck noodle soup!!!! I have tried these three things and a couple others, but these three are strong favorites that I will keep coming back for over and over!!!! Awesome service and super nice people. 
27103 The old-fashioned donuts are the way to go, particularly the lemon-poppyseed glazed. But keep in mind, a great donut is still just a donut. 
27104 Optician was arrogant. Nasty attitudes will make me shop elsewhere. There was no need to keep me waiting while she talked on the phone on personal business. I won't be back. 
27105 Best coffee Shop in town!So much more then just a great latte!Been going for 20+years. 
27106 Corn tacos filled with fresh Pico de Gallo and luscious meats: steak asado, Barbacoa and pulled pork. The quesadillas are individual tortillas. All accompanied by green jalapeno salsa and rich red salsa. A great place for a great meal. 
27107 Great vibe, good music but too crowded and not enough seating for the size of crowd. Small place 
27108 So far this has become my favorite coffee shop in Portland in terms of style and atmosphere. This is a community friendly coffee shop with excellent espresso! The place is lively with plants and wooden-rustic furniture. It's like drinking coffee in the middle of the woods/forest. It's legit! 
27109 This is my neighborhood cafe. They can be very crowded, especially in the morning, but they are always friendly snd efficient, and the food, while nothing unique, is better than decent. A nice place to sip a cup of coffee while catching up with friends, 
27110 This place is slap-yo-momma good. Best middle eastern I've had in CBUS. They offer the full spread and will give you samples of everything if you ask. Love this place! My personal favorite is the shwarma w/ the pickled radishes. 
27111 Delicious crusty bread, fresh veggies, quality meat and fair prices. Ask for your sandwich "spicy" and you'll think they are punishing you. Love it. 
27112 Amazing place. Amazing food. Friendly staff. Great history in this place too. I can't reccomend just one thing to order because everything is a must have. Actually please try the morir so√±ando beverage you will thank me later. 
27113 Excellent food...great prices...fast delivery!!! I'll no longer order Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Dominos after eating here!! 
27114 Chocolate fondue was waxy. Yuck! Food in general is poor quality. Chewy beef, etc. 
27115 Wonderful good, beautiful atmosphere, great menu! FamIly owned... Go! You won't be sorry ! 
27116 In not going to write this out of anger. Just the facts. Terrible There you have it. 
27117 They do a really good grilled cheese sandwich. Really good. Almost five star good. The tomato soup I had tasted more like it came out of a can. So, they don't quite get five stars. But I certainly recommend the grilled cheese sandwich. 
27118 Good food. BTW, the mussels curry available with buffet only on Friday 
27119 They told me otherwise when phoned in but wasn't available in buffet. Was disappointed since it's my favorite and went in just to have that :( 
27120 My omelette was fairly basic. The owners are lovely though and the ambience is very cute. 
27121 Staff here is very nice and extremely helpful. They even send you text messages to keep you updated on your car that's being serviced. Always a pleasant experience coming here! 
27122 Great sandwiches (Iggy's bread FTW!) to refuel with after wandering through SOWA. I got the Roast Beef and it was enough for 2 meals. My friends got the Tuna Melt and the Portobello and loved them. No complaints here! 
27123 Great weekend buffet. If I lived closer I'd be back more. A very wide variety to choose from. I think it would have been nice to have at least one fish item on the buffet. Overall very good. 
27124 Variety of food and timely service. A good spot for vegetarians too. They are situated in a great location that makes it easily accessible too. 
27125 Best taco's, ever. Prices are awesome, flavours are awesome, guys behind the counter are awesome. They are quick and SO GOOD. 
27126 The food was great .. we had breakfast... the service needs some work... we had to ask for everything ... hopefully the waitress was just new 
27127 Not a place for traditional spanish food. The food & the service was mediocre. Roasted pork not seasoned well and not shredded. Lots of fat. Empanadas has potatoes filling inside so not what i was looking for. They serve everything on foam plates and plastic utensils. Not recommended. 
27128 Received a call from customer service. Very nice and addressed the issues. Problem is they are a smaller organization than fast park and cant justify as many shuttles. Trying fast park today. Will post initial experience after the trip. 
27129 Ordered pizza and fettuccine. Both were terrible and greasy. Only the bread was worth it. 
27130 Slowest delivery service possible. Expect to wait 2+ hours for your pizza to arrive. 
27131 Rad shop, perfect place to session when it rains. Buy their stuff, free some animals! 
27132 Good burgers. The staff was very helpful and attentive from the time we entered until we left. The burgers were delicious. The garlic parmesian fries were just ok. The lemon Fresca (lemonade) was delicious! 
27133 I had a fantastic experience getting my oil changed. You stay on the car while they perform the service, offering cold water, and were honest and didn't tell to upsale me at all. I would absolutely recommend them. 
27134 Yum! A bit pricey, but very good food. Fish cooked perfectly and each dish had multiple surprise items to round out a well prepared meal. 
27135 Went there as one of my tour of Watertown places. We were very much pleased with the place. The burgers are flame broiled, the fries and onion rings are excellent. The salsa is just spicy enough to enjoy it. Friendly service. This actually may be our go to place... 
27136 I wanted ribs... I got a chew toy with sauce. I thought I'd try the sides... Worst potato salad ever (the potatoes were very undercooked). Told the waitress, she brought the bill and said "sorry". Might be ok for music... Not for food. I won't be back. 
27137 Tried out this food truck at the One Music Fest and was disappointed. The food was terrible in that it was very bland. Barely any seasoning. I would not recommend. 
27138 What an opportunity! Justin was terrific, explained every stage of my glassblowing what will be the most beautiful paperweight ever. The crew very helpful, I thank Faith for her help. Everyone has to try this at least once in their life. 
27139 On the more expensive side but the sushi is sublime. An authentic experience and a must if you're in Richmond's city centre area. I suggest guests to sit at the sushi bar and order nothing but nigiri sushi. 
27140 This is one of the nicest Starbucks shops, though you have to wait too long to get served, and sometimes you find no place to sit down. If you are a student, this is not the best place to study. 
27141 Mussels and lobster roll were good but the lobster mac and cheese didn't have any taste of lobster. This place is very pricey but has a chill vibe. So I give a 4 star just be prepared to spend if your dining here. 
27142 Great menu and extremely reasonable. Food and drink are phenomenal. Reggae night on fridays is the best kept secret in Boston. Highest recommendation. 
27143 Nicest Liquor Store in town. Always greeted when I enter the store. If it's not on the shelf, they happily will check their stock room. 
27144 It will cost you a $100 for 2 people unless you drink then it would be even more, and you will leave hungry Mark my words 
27145 This is the best ramen you can get in Vancouver so far. Way better than Kintaro, Motomachi, Jinya, and Santouku. Broth is flavorful, soft boiled eggs are made just right. They have roasted sesame and garlic flakes available which will make the already great bowl of ramen even better. 
27146 Went here for Valentine's day. Nice atmosphere, the live piano was nice. Food was pretty good. Tables were a little close to other customers to make it an 'intamate' evening. 
27147 They were solid. Close to the airport itself, although you have to somewhat find your way (down escalator into the mini shopping area after you claim luggage). Selection was good, nothing too crazy, and Emerald Aisle got us checked and on the road fast. Would recommend. 
27148 Incredible Japanese food. The pricing is appropriate for the quality and variety. Found our new "date night" and"impress the parents" spot. 
27149 The last two times I've flown Southwest. Were delayed over an hour both times I think they're getting worse on service they try but I think they're over booking the planesm 
27150 First time dining here and it will not be our last. The food was fresh and inventive, the service was perfect, and they had a nice wine list. One of us had their 4 course special which was wonderful. The frozen chocolate bar dessert was devine. 
27151 Recently went to this location for my birthday dinner and I had a great time. The hummus was the best I've ever had and the meals are a good size portion for the price. Overall a pleasant experience 
27152 Ordered their breakfast burrito while connecting at the airport. Ate two bites and threw it away. Just disgusting food. 
27153 Excellent service by the doctor and the staff. Good selections, I could improve in quantity. My first visit and I'm very pleased and will be coming back! 
27154 The sashimi is fresh and delicious. Plus, the lunch special provides a lot of food for a very reasonable price. I will definitely be back. 
27155 Great food, great service, great cocktails and great decor. That was easy. Get the Tuna Tower and Beef Hot Rock for sure! 
27156 gave me heartburn, not that good, expensive. go to austin habibi 
27157 I really enjoyed this place. Pleasant staff, nice atmosphere, great food, and excellent margaritas. I wish I travelled more to Austin so I could enjoy Casa Maria more!!! 
27158 Good news: No wait. Bad news: The food was just okay. I tried the Krispy Kreme shake. Well, I'd say the Arby's Jamoca shake is better. The burgers were good, but not as good as all the hype. 
27159 I had a cin-a-bomb doughnut ... it was really late and needed to eat something. It was very very sweet but very very good, as well. Interesting place with a mixture of personalities ...very eclectic .... just my kind of place. GO!!!! Experiment ... 
27160 Can't say enough. Service for 9, seamless and attentive. Food devine, menu had something for everyone, ambiance was serene and warm.....can't wait to go back. 
27161 Beautiful pieces of art for ice cream (I got the sundaes). The mochi in the hibiscus ice cream was amazing. However, think I prefer the regular salt &a straw instead for its simplicity. 
27162 The food was delicious. Highly recommend their jerk chicken. It has just enough kick to it unlike some places that will have you drinking water by the gallon. However, there's no type of air circulation in there. If I get a chance to return, definitely doing carry out. 
27163 Thank goodness I found this place!! Best sushi by far!! Ever since I left Californian it's like I've been a food snob because there's so many good places in the la area alone. This place is really a breath of fresh air!! 
27164 Amazing! I saw Lindsey today for a massage post-marathon and she was incredibly professional. I've had a few massages in the Boston area and I'd absolutely recommend her to anyone especially athletes! 
27165 Loved the Quatro mini tacos and the Austin Mule! Fun and festive - fresh ingredients. 
27166 Awesome steak tips and reasonable prices! Pulled pork isn't bad either. The servers and bartenders are nice. Lots of TVs and keno. It is a nice local place 
27167 This is a great store you get so much of what you are looking for. Target can be over pricey at time but it will a 5 star. Target is the best store to get great holiday things and have a great store overall !! 
27168 Terra Terroir is a favorite neighborhood spot for us since moving to Brookhaven...the atmosphere is cozy & there's a great enclosed outdoor space... interesting menu choices, well-prepared dishes to please everyone--fabulous wines & desserts as well...some of the wines are really pricey, so beware when ordering! 
27169 Fantastic pie options, each time i'm here i want to try something new. Both cherry and pecan pies were very enjoyable. 
27170 Awesome food (and prices) if you can find this out of the way stop. Breakfast is my favorite meal and these guys did an amazing job. Highly recommend the latte which comes in a pint glass. 
27171 So nice for a spring night! Custard was delicious and the 2 guys working were so nice and attentive. We will be back! We had Valet parked for one rooster so no problem with parking. 
27172 I dont know why this place has bad reviews. It was a fun course for a decent price. Nothing amazibg but definitely worth it. 
27173 This was my neighborhood bar last year. I moved away and I miss it dearly. Great welcoming spot and a really cool alternative/indie culture. I'm backing it as a hangout, music venue, vinyl shop and more. 
27174 Bruce Eyewear is on top of their game. The staff is friendly, easy-going, and above all knows what they're doing. It's nice to see a shop specializing in serious, high quality eyewear at a time when the market is being flooded with cheap commodity glasses. 
27175 Worst food ever. Garden Burger is inedible. Had to throw it away. Horrible. 
27176 Great beer selection! It doesn't feel like your typical "brew pub." We had tasty beer and yummy pork sliders. Several selections on nitro. 
27177 Excellent. Don't walk, run. Excellent chicken and sides. Great atmosphere. Great meal. 
27178 Almost the last day of the month, many cars getting inspected, and it's 4 degrees outside. However, the speed and friendliness of this inspection station was great! Thank you! If you think you're not going to pass the inspection, don't "shoot the messenger". 
27179 Food is too expensive for the quality. I ordered pad Thai that had no flavor, won't be going back any time soon. 
27180 The best! Wonderful selection. Everything is always delicious and fresh. Super friendly and knowledgeable stuff. Love this place. 
27181 The atmosphere is really laid back. The variety of food is good and seems fresh. The breakfast sandwich is big enough for me and my friend to split. Just not a fan when it is packed cause you have to hunt for a table. 
27182 Love this spa, it's absolutely beautiful inside, nice facilities and very clean. The staff are wonderful and the masseuse listened to what I asked for, the RMT is great and my body treatment was so so. Will try again. 
27183 This place is great, couldn't fault it. The staff were friendly and more than helpful. Just grabbed a slice and a salad but was really impressed. Everything was super fresh, the pizza sauce is awesome and it all came out really fast. This place is on point. 
27184 I only just moved to Portland in December, but this is the most delicious food I've eaten here. That cauliflower taco is no joke. The flavor, the texture, omg... Amazing! I could eat them every single day. Even the tortilla is perfect. The green salsa... muy bueno! 
27185 I have never had a bad experience here and I've been coming since kindergarten! Great carne guisada tacos. 
27186 The service was nice but extremely slow. It took at least 20 minutes to get our Mango Mochi Bubble Waffle and it wasn't impressive. The waffle was soggy and I wouldn't get it again. The Bubble Queen in Richmond is definitely 100 times betters. 
27187 Great baked Haddock and garlic mashed!! Super cool decor and love the racetrack, giftshop, and waitstaff!! 
27188 Omelet on grill - not pan. -10 points. French toast was unexpectedly great. Above average breakfast and service. 
27189 Dr. Weissman and her staff are amazing! Had my teeth cleaned and fillings done in such a timely manner. She finished 40 minutes earlier than planned! So happy with my results! 
27190 Love this place. Great prices for work shoes (steel toe variety). My wife needed steel toes shoes, I called around and other than being in Porkland they are a great deal. Will come again. 
27191 I am heartbroken that Jaho decided to remodel. My favorite table and sofa for meeting friends over coffee or getting work done just gone. For what? It was perfect as it was :-( I'm sure I'll get used to this new look but I'm really sad about it. 
27192 Always our first stop when we come to Austin. Never ever disappointed. Pizza's always great. Maybe one day we'll be adventurous and order the meatball sub. Looks amazing. Get the humongous Rice Krispie Treat for dessert...nothing like the boxed version. 
27193 The pizza is awesome for the price its been this great and consistent for years Quiet clean and i love the garlic on the pizza wish i had it back in seattle Closed but just relocated. Check them out. Owners are very cool and their gluten free crust is aweseom. 
27194 This is our go-to sushi restaurant in the neighbourhood. The portion sizes are big and the service is great. I highly recommend! 
27195 I love getting facials from KC!!! I am KC's graduation project and I look forward to seeing her ever week. I own a spa so I'm a little picky. 
27196 I agree with you yelpers, the upscale bar food is AMAZING! I love the atmosphere, dark wood, booths and friendly service. Skip the chicken buffalo dip which is way too spicy but try the butternut ravioli which is fab! Thanks to Phantom Gourmet we tried this place and LOVED it! 
27197 Very good sushi. I got the combination that was about $20. Very good selections. I will come back again since I have to be in Orlando for 2 weeks. I might get the same plate again. 
27198 Great value, lots of gluten free options and very nice staff. 
27199 Great acai, great flavor with a lot of fruits and options. I recommend the bebe's favorite! That is my favorite too. :) 
27200 Great food...always a fresh new menu Great drinks...try the truffle fries and gatherer salad 
27201 Great food! Great atmosphere! Definitely one of my favorite places to go in Columbus. Get the Bombay Burger. 
27202 Love this place. Come here regularly for their gyros. Have only tired them for lunch. Typically get their hummus and then a regular or philly gyro. The service is attentive and you get your food in no time. Very effective lunch place with great food. 
27203 I genuinely think they have the best tasting yellow curry with chicken in Vancouver. Been going here for 15 years now. Hard to imagine! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone. 
27204 It's sad to say but they're going down in quality, they are starting to serve tainted/rotting meat, and their beef broth tasted like gasoline, at least the aftertaste in my mouth.......sad another good restaurant gone bad taking short cuts....I certainly will not be coming back here again 
27205 Parking is a nightmare in this restaurant, but farm to table food (bread!) and wine in massive glasses provide more than sufficient reason to visit on a frequent basis! 
27206 Decent drinks, but one of the bartenders was a complete douche, who complained about having to work that night. Also expect the long islands to come out as practically rubbing alcohol or just soda--there is no in between. Go to the container bar instead. 
27207 This burger place is amazing and totally worth the wait if you go on a weekend night. The Greek burger is still my favorite but I'm working my way through the menu! 
27208 Fantastic server. I wanted to take her home and/or be my friend. Everything I tasted here was good. Got the veggie plate: cheese tamale, fruit cup, salad, and lentil soup. Was the bomb diggity. I'd visit at least once a month back when I lived in Austin. 
27209 Ask for Otter if you need help with gluten free. Had the pollo a la plancha. And get this! Separate fryer for yuca so no cross contamination. One of the best places we went to in Orlando. 
27210 Some of the best pizza I've ever had. Sauce and crust are good, toppings are awesome. Takes some time to cook but well worth it, and there's a ton of beer selections as well. 
27211 Don and his wife are really nice people who take good care of their shop, but I did dry and fold here and they shrunk all of my clothes. I had to give them away and buy new stuff. Super expensive mistake. 
27212 I really Like the food at this Carrabas the drinks are decent and the staff is professional and courteous. The only problem is this restaurant is extremely SLOWWWWWWWWW........ It usually takes 30 minutes to get your food after you order. Even on slow days. 
27213 Absolutely fast, accurate, price is right Good stuff! Thanks to the reviewers and shattered screen on my 4S just like new $70 I paid and it took about 40 minutes. Hopefully this doesn't happen again but if it does this is my place to go! 
27214 Fast, polite, skilled! Brought him dented iPhone with inoperable volume buttons. 10 minutes with the tiny tools + ball peen hammer and it's as good as new! 
27215 The Bun tit nuong was good, service was disjointed and not good. The Place is dirty, in fact I am watching a baby cockroach crawling across the table which is what prompted me to write this review, didn't feel like eating after I saw this. 
27216 Cash only here. I have never eaten here, just had the bubble tea aka boba tea. Always good on a hot day, these are made fresh with pure√©ed fruit as you wait. The do a steady business on the food side, maybe I'll try them next time. 
27217 Delicious!!! The fluffy griddle cakes were like eating cake for breakfast. We both had the traditional breakfast, the BF had the sausage which has herbs and spice. The prickly pear mimosas were very refreshing and not too sugary. 
27218 Best drive thru burgers on the North Shore that I've found. Price is reasonable too. 
27219 We loved everything we ordered. The food was well cooked, he spices were delicious and well balanced, and the service was very quick and attentive. We will definitely be coming back here and certainly recommend it to others!! 
27220 Found this quaint place on a whim from an app to find a place to eat. So happy we found it! The seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. The Lobster Bisque and Clam Chowder were top notch! I hope to males it back someday. 
27221 Ben eats here all the time and swears by it. I had the pan fried noodles without msg and they were very tasty. Ben had gen tsao chicken and crab Rangoon .... free tea night and day... 
27222 Two words: SPRINKLE COOKIE! I live within walking distance of this place and I cannot get enough. While all of their flavors sound amazing, I can't stop getting the sprinkle cookie. It's like birthday cake and cookie dough had a delicious edible baby. Worth every calorie. 
27223 Dining room is a bit outdated, service was good, food was ok. The octopus appetizer was the worst octopus we've had (skin was slimy and didn't have much flavor). Paella was good but very greasy. 
27224 Great salon and friendly staff. Claudia gave me a blowout for a wedding and it looked awesome. She was very easy to talked to and listened to exactly what I wanted. Thanks, Claudia :):) 
27225 It's a good bikeway - and good for rollerblading and running. Well-designed, well-kept, a good recreation idea. 
27226 The doughnuts melt in your mouth. So many unique menu items and really cool atmosphere. Reasonably price. 
27227 Overall their prices are competitive and have a good selection for supplies and wholesale food. We usually go there when we have large parties and family gatherings. Way better than buying at grocery stores. 
27228 First time visitor here. VERY impressed. Best chicken, beans, and cornbread I've ever had. Will definitely be returning. 
27229 Very creative sandwiches and love the outdoor seating for lunch at work. Gets crazy crowded around noon, though. One of the only sit down lunch places in the area that I know to have a wait. 
27230 Nice bar, good food and in Winter Park. What else can you ask for? 
27231 I love Clay Pot Cafe, this one is probably the best I've had since I went to Hong Kong. Authentic with an option for everybody. My only problem is that the tea and soups are never hot enough. Get the chili oil. With everything. 
27232 This is the best beer in Vancouver! Get in here! Really! Great IPA'S and interesting Belgian Styles. On the downside, no food. But nothing is perfect, but the beer is really good. Did I say the beer is REALLY good? 
27233 Treat yourself better and go somewhere else it is not that cheap for having such mediocre quality. 
27234 The viva mexico burrito is the best burrito I have ever had, and the chips and salsa are up there as well. I come here at least once a week and I have never been disappointed. It. is just so god damn good you guys. Seriously. 
27235 This was surprisingly pretty good. Loved their congee and noodles - went around 10:30 pm :) 
27236 Stay away from these people. Will never show up when they say, repeatedly lie and make excuses. 
27237 *** 05/16/2018.... this food truck is no longer open. The owner works at the food truck in the same lot called The Flying Carpet. I spoke with him and he said that he plans on re-opening in a year. 
27238 I hope they close down soon. 45 minutes to return a router. Lazy, ignorant and incompetent workers are going to bring this excuse of a chain down. 
27239 Hard to find a more consistently AWESOME place for breakfast or lunch! Jon and his crew are the pleasant and on point people in the biz! 
27240 My favorite is the turkey, cranberry, stuffing sub. Hands down. If you like subs, you can't go wrong here. There are many, many choices. Super laid back place to chill, grab a beer, sit outside, and enjoy life. Worth a visit.... 
27241 It was expensive but soooo worth it!! Their filet was amazing and the wine selection was very good! 
27242 Loved loved this spot!!! Reasonable prices, great service, quick food, and taste amazing! Sliders were so unique and delicious. Will def be back. 
27243 Great food, very clean and had nice TVs But the service is needing some help. After 10 minutes had to go up to bar, after they watched us walk in and still kept talking behind the bar. 
27244 They have an amazing happy hour! Make sure you make a reservation. Definitely a must in Boulder! Try the crepes! 
27245 An accidental find. The promise of a cold Sapporo & Gyoza turned our heads. Attentive service as we feasted on pork belly (kakuni), Gyoza, Chicken (Jidori), Risotto & Cheesecake. Three weeks travelling from Australia and this was the best meal we have had. Delicious!!! Must haves: Seafood Risotto Jidori Kakuni 
27246 Anyways slow lines no matter what time of year. For the quality of the clothes and foot ware prices are way to high. 
27247 I love this place because of all the gluten free options. They can make any pasta with doodles (zucchini noodles) and even have a gluten free brownie sundae. We love their lambchops and salads. My kids love that they can make their own pizza. 
27248 They need to figure out their process. I waited 20 minutes for 2 tacos with no explanation. Not impressed and would not go back. 
27249 Stopped in to grab some food before catching our connecting flight to San Antonio. Hostess directed the customers quickly and our order was filled in under 5 minutes for a family of 5. 
27250 A disappointment. The food was lackluster at best and the service was terribly slow. I wouldn't go back even with a Groupon. 
27251 I used to visit the Cambridge location that was unfortunately closed, but Bertucci's has excellent fresh and hot dinner rolls and pizza. 
27252 One star is more than they deserve. I went in to help my daughter pick up a car that she wrecked. They were rude and hateful from the VERY FIRST WORD! No service, no respect! I would use another towing company if I were you! 5 thumbs down! 
27253 It is a large chain store that to me is like any other chain stores. The parking lot can be a bit scary, but the inside is decent. 
27254 Highly recommended for food and drinks. a hiiden treasure. a bit stuffy. worth the wait.....food portion on small side, but bursting with flavor. Most have is the Pork Belly Sliders and Mango Quinoa Salad! 
27255 Excellent pies, excellent salads, excellent service! The staff is friendly and well mannered. The food was served in a timely manner. The manager came by to make sure we were satisfied. A must visit eatery! 
27256 Steak was more tough than I remember at other locations but the restaurant was nice and not crowded and the shoestring potatoes are divine. 
27257 Everyone loves this place but my food was nothing except cold. Bland and cold and not particularly recognizable as a doughnut. Great drinks tho for sure, inspired cocktails! Ima try again and if it's better the second time y'all be the first I tell. 
27258 Bartender from el Groucho recommended this place and he was right. The food has several Mexican/Cuban/American fusion breakfast items which were delectable. They get their incurred bacon from a local farm and all of their vegetables are organically grown. Great breakfast and very nice server 
27259 I love the owners of this restaurant. It really makes a difference in your dining experience. They were card I'm provide really good food at an affordable price. It's one of my favorite place to go for pho. I will definitely go there again and again and again. 
27260 Yes. Done with the 6$ pizza. This place stinks. The phones are either busy or they aren't answering. 3 out of 5 kids at my house tonight flat out refused to eat the plain cheese pizza. Something wrong with that. By the way-horrible salads!! 
27261 Smaller portions than I would hope for for the price, but very fresh ingredients were used and the service was fantastic. Would definitely recommend. Go for the margaritas. 
27262 Very good authentic Hawaiian food! The kalua pork is the best I've had outside of the islands. Their hot sauce is good on everything! Highly recommend if you like Hawaiian/Asian fusion style food. 
27263 I love this place and so happy they have vegan options! If you have a dairy allergy you can still get a delicious donut. 
27264 Beautiful and delicious vegan sushi. You have to try this place. He makes some of the best sushi I have ever eaten! 
27265 Needed a place to study for a bit and decided I'd give this place a shot. I was not disappointed! There mocha is very good (little on the pricy end) but the atmosphere, scenery and outdoor patio make up for it. Definitely will be back soon. 
27266 Put on hold for more than 30 minutes and then call dropped because pharmacy closed. Unacceptable. 
27267 My hubby & I love this place for a quick dinner before movie. Quick and friendly service, which what we both looking for. Price is very affordable with big portion. 
27268 Really poor service, the waiter was smoking outside, she spend 15 minutes outside with each cigarette, and inside all customers waiting for her. After 9 they move your table to make a dancing space and turn this pub into a nightclub. 
27269 Back in the 90's I use to go here with my family it was a hoping place when pizza was a mainstay. It brings back memories but I've moved on since then to more healthier alternatives. 
27270 Twilight pizza is a favorite when I'm in Camas. The karma pizza and the t-Rex pizza are the best. Loaded with lots of toppings and a nice crisp crust 
27271 I've come here more than 10 times. And everytime it never disappoint me. The natto is delicious, my favorite is the unagi udon. The tempura is delicious aswell. 
27272 Their food is awesome! We pass by almost everything we are in Orlando! We try to go as much as possible! All the staff is wonderful! Can't wait for my next trip to Orlando to pass by!! 
27273 Always love the fresh sushi options. Enjoy the crab ragoon dip and the sushi burger. I've visited the location and ATL and Orlando always had a good meal and service. 
27274 Went there twice. Chicken is great and the service was even better. I really liked the mac and cheese. The fith star is for the great service even while at maximum occupancy. 
27275 I never enjoyed this bar. Terrible food and service. But...it's a great place to run into the Boston bro crowd and I saw Rob Gronkowski there once. 
27276 I've been to Zuzus in other cities and those were much better than this location. Everything was tasteless- watery salsas, blandly seasoned meats, etc. What a disappointment! 
27277 I renew tags for both of our cars here every year. Small office but very fast. Like it a lot. 
27278 One of the best a turkish food. Small potions but all were amazingly delicious. Service was excellent. I am hoping to visit this place in the future. 
27279 Great Indian food that's not overly spicy or takes over your sense of smell. If you don't like Indian food trust me you'll love this place! 
27280 Good Smkd.Turkey, jalape√±o sausage, Giant "Flinstone" beef ribs...#1 goes to the moist brisket. #NoSides for me! Bring on the #BigRed & The #BBQBrisket!! 
27281 yummy yummy food, standard restaurant ambiance. not fancy, but fine. nice waitstaff too. and tofu pad thai is YUMM-O! 
27282 I like Schoolhouse and would go there a lot more if I didn't have to shout to talk to my friends. The music is so loud that we left after one beer. Don't go if you have a sore throat. 
27283 They have a lottery ticket scanner and keno monitor. And good selection of scratch-offs. Unfortunately, the super small parking lot only has 6 spaces, and they run out of Sunday papers too early. And, occasionally there are sketchy people loitering in the lot (probably because it's not the greatest neighborhood). 
27284 I was impressed how elegant this place was. We had to wait about 40 mins to get seated but this place is definitely worth it! The food and the drinks were fabulous! Loved every bite! Definitely listen to the water for suggestions THEY KNOW THEIR STUFF! 
27285 Definitely one of my favorite places for vietnamese grub! Very authentic and although they hardly speak english, the people here are really nice. Will always recommend others to try it. 
27286 Good live music, great drinks, nice staff. We had a good time! Drinks were well made and generous. We went for St. Patrick's Day, but this isn't our first time here. Always enjoyable. 
27287 We found this wonderful little food truck one day and what a find! we were driving around looking for lunch and found it. Wonderful carnitas and really friendly crew. Its worth driving out of the way for. we will be going back! 
27288 Not the Katzingers we remembered...Rude service, average food, and charged us 25 cents for both ketchup and mustard for a hotdog. Too bad this icon has become such a disappointment. 
27289 So amazing! They don't do acrylics but managed to give me a manicure that looked seamless. Love it here. Great staff and relaxing!!! :-) 
27290 Great food and very fresh! Coffee is good and strong. Omelettes are loaded with goodies - veggies and Greek were delicious. Hash browns are crisp and tender. 
27291 It's an classic style italian food. I like, you can't expect a super surprise nice meal, but you will also not being disappointed ! Good place to celebrate. 
27292 The sushi here was some of the best I've had in Kitsilano and it was well priced. They did forget about our table at the beginning for 15 minutes, but were very apologetic and brought out a free dish of tuna tataki. 5-Stars! 
27293 I can't get enough. I love coming here. Food. Coffee. Beer. Live music. You really can't go wrong at Cherrywood. 
27294 I haven't had any food I liked. The burrito and pizza are okay but I will not be return. Drive a little further and get something better 
27295 Great little place. Yummy momos n curry. Looking forward to my third visit. Depending on the day of the week they might have a discounted price on either veg or chicken momo which is pretty nice. 
27296 Homeslice is pretty good but there are plenty of better pies in town: Hoeks, Hoboken, East Side Pies, Nikis (in Round Rock), Stonys with the best being Little Deli to which Homeslice just can't compare. 
27297 By far the Best service around!!! Thank you! Every time I have been here it has been a great experience! 
27298 The avocado 'rita is a novelty item. Not much avocado to it. It is basically a green lime frozen margarita. The food was good. Service was slow. 
27299 Cheap + Close by + good taste = Solid Win My only issue I have had with this place is my food was cold once, other than that everything has been perfect! 
27300 The pastries are mediocre at best. I rarely write reviews, and I felt obligated to write this review because I went there based on high yelp review ratings. Honestly go to the dunkin doughnuts up the street, and you will have a tastier experience. 
27301 Omg! Steak is amazing! Drinks spot on. Ask for Kelly ... she'll take great care of you... ask for her! 
27302 Excellent in all three phases of the game...food...service....atmosphere....absolutely fantastic. 
27303 This place is just plain great! Food is consistently excellent. Whole belly clams are the best I've had. Portions are always big, and I can eat!! Great for lunch and dinner. Do yourself a favor and try this place. 
27304 Michele is fantastic! Her salon is so cute and clean, there are no over whelming chemical smells. Gel nails are fantastic and much more natural looking that nanything else I've tried. 
27305 Went once for brunch...it was a good meal..but the service wasn't good for a Sunday meal with a group... the waffles I had were great and the ambience was fantastic... 
27306 I got the spicy hot pot, it was good. There was lots of tofu and intestine pieces. I refrained from giving this place 5 stars because it is cash only and I did not think their milky coffee was worth 4$, it was good but just not worth $4. 
27307 Big. Lots of light. Tons of tables/study space. Free Wi-Fi. Small food cafe with VERY SIMPLE food, but will do for a quick snack. A couple study rooms if you have a group, but I'm not sure if you can reserve them ahead of time. Free parking!!! 
27308 This is the traditional spot to get your sushi and ramen fix. The staff is friendly and the food is soulful and never skips on the flavor. It's hidden in a foreign strip mall but don't let that discourage you! 
27309 Blows Halal guys out of the water. One meal can be easily shared by two people. Red sauce isn't as spicy as HG but quality of meat and rice makes up for it. 
27310 My 1st Dosa experience- had eggplant, lamb vindaloo and chicken dosas - all 3 very tasty - lamb had good luck. Also a coconut curry chicken - pretty good. Definitely going there for the dosas. Chai average. Service ladies very kind. Overall reasonable price and good food 
27311 Wonderful place! Love the enthusiasm of the owner. Food was outstanding, as was the beer and cocktail selection. 
27312 These guys did an outstanding job for our condominium complex. They were super pleasant, fast, efficient, and affordable! Thanks!!! 
27313 Good Beer, and probably one of the best brewery open air patios in town. The bartenders are always nice and able to give a good recommendation for what to drink. Great place to sit in the sun and people watch on Mississippi Ave. 
27314 Love this place for Sunday breakfast. Great fresh roasted and brewed coffee. Get their egg sandwiches 
27315 Fantastic!!! Best burgers in the world. Long lines but worth it!! Fries to die for! 
27316 Enjoyed our lunch fine. It is as good as every Hardrock. What made this experience awsome was our waitress Phoebe! Remember that name PHOEBE!! She takes great pride in her work and treats you like a king. Just Wondeful. I'll be back next time I'm in town. 
27317 I love this spot. Excellent food. Order some tots and a beer and this is the start of a great night. They do not have smoking indoors either so you don't smell after being there. 
27318 Auto Zone is great for accessories for your car. A little over price on some parts, but always have what you are looking for. Be in the Zone! 
27319 Unfortunately it's really hit or miss with the food. The beer is always good but we went the other night and I got the schnitzel and it was burnt to a crisp. It was so bad I only took 1 bite of this $15 meal. 
27320 Took my mother here for high tea on Sunday afternoon for her birthday and it was a really nice experience. Everything was delicious, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was lovely. We will definitely be back! 
27321 Been here several times for dinner with both large groups and for date night. Delicious food, friendly service and lots of great options for both food and drinks. 
27322 Who doesn't like a little outdoor action in the heart of downtown during the summer months!! Nice private outdoor patio, good service by Adam our waiter and all 3 meals tasted good. Laughs and giggles enjoyed by all. 
27323 Being that Laotian is a rare cuisine in Atlanta, I enjoyed its uniqueness but the portions were small and the rice was too firm. 
27324 I was going on a trip the next day and i have been here before. Very good haircut both times. 
27325 Ummm.... Awful all around! Please save your money and go somewhere else. Service is the worst. And you will be waiting forever. Seriously, plenty of other places around Disney that will take your money! 
27326 Fun times here. Sat at the bar and had a great view of everything. Loved the Pork Slap drink and the mussels were serious, in a delicious way. 
27327 Limited choices, varying quality, pricey for what you get. Chicken lacked flavor, salmon ok. Best aspect was the dessert assortment. 
27328 Overpriced. The only great thing about this location is their jean selection. Sign up for a session with their jean specialist who will help you weed through all the cuts, colors, and fancy schmancy labels to find you the perfect pair. 
27329 The relaxing business casual atmosphere makes it a great venue for a bite with colleagues. The meatballs are especially homemade with different types of cheese! Delicious. I wish they offered more meal options, but definitely my favorite place around. 
27330 This is probably the best tacos I've had in my area! They're so good and they always seem to be open which is so nice. Just make sure to bring cash. Highly recommend it's amazing. 
27331 This is a lovely spot with great seating. Check out the upstairs area which is clean, airy, and you get that perched-up-top feeling. Decent amount of electrical outlets. I like the breakfast burritos they sell. Good stuff. Bathrooms were clean and well-appointed. I enjoyed using them. 
27332 Best cheesesteaks I've ever had outside Philly... or maybe even in Philly. Just awesome. 
27333 Lakeside serviced our heating unit and they were very professional on time and courteous. I would recommend them for heating and cooling issues. 
27334 Host to great artists, but the noise from the club next door/underneath can ruin a quieter show. Not really much they can do about that, but it's a shame. 
27335 Good for some cheap BBQ, just don't have the highest expectations (come on it's BBQ in Boston). Some pretty great happy hour/late night deals too I've noted. I'd totally go back for the Thursday $10 fajita + margarita deal. 
27336 Glorified Motel 6. Patched ceiling in the room, tiny elevators, filthy rugs, indifferent staff. Must buy Febreze by the 50 gallon quantity judging by the overwhelming smell. Certainly not a $250 a night hotel. 
27337 Bertucci's is a great addition to the Kenmore/Fenway area. You get good food at good prices, and it's a welcome change from the bar food (Uno's, Beerworks) or gourmet (Eastern Standard) options. It's a yummy, happy medium. 
27338 Buying our first home should have been complicated, drawn out, and all together overwhelming. Thanks to the Ryan Leahy Team the process was lean, streamlined, and straight forward. A pleasure to work with. 
27339 Great crispy spicy chicken. I ordered lunch special 3 piece dark with baked beans and cole slaw. $7.50 I would come back here when visiting Austin, assuming I have craving for fried chicken. Waitress and staff very friendly. 
27340 Im right next door at Coco Baby & I order here almost every time I am at work!!!! THE BEST HOTDOGS AND SANDWICHES. 10+ stars if I could!!! The employees are so sweet and bring my food over since I cant leave the store. Thank you for your service 
27341 This place is awesome. And badass in every way. I will always come here if I really had to choose a place to go to. 
27342 Brittany was a superb hairstylist!! She listened to my tremendous list of hair needs and worked with me to ensure my needs were met. Great ambiance and comfortable surroundings. The only issue was the parking; dodging traffic to cross the street was a bit hazardous. 
27343 You cannot go wrong at this place! Excellent ice cream, house made cones and reasonably priced for the serving and quality. Not quite the location in San Francisco (impossible to top) but holy guacamole this place is good. 
27344 Spontaneous trip for happy hour, super pleased! Their $6 tortilla soup is delicious and served to perfection, right in front of you. $3 fireman 4 drafts. Absolutely will be back. Fancy and fun at the same time! 
27345 I spend about 200 a night and mangers don't like to hear a honest opinion that this place doesn't take care of customers that spend a lot money 
27346 Always reliable, honest and friendly!! Another great job guys. Thanks!! 
27347 My husband and our kids came for lunch. The food was very good and good portions I tried something new I wish I could remember the name it was delicious. Our server was nice and recommended the entree. I'd definitely come back again. 
27348 I have been to A LOT of Peruvian restaurants and this place was lousy. The prices are a bit overpriced for the food. Not a good place if your trying to get tasty Peruvian. 
27349 Helpful at arranging business meeting 
27350 Taco shells where hard to eat. Chicken in my tacos tasted old and the chips in the bag for the queso where in a million pieces. Had been looking forward to eating there love P Terrys but my daughter and i where not very happy about our first experience. 
27351 Caught the truck for the first time today on the Greenway. Good CBLT and fries with a special lemonade. 
27352 My girl and I have been coming here for YEARS. We come from far just to have a burrito here and there. Their shrimp burrito is always great. Well seasoned. I wish their portions were a little better. 
27353 Stayed here during July 5th weekend for a friends son wedding and the hotel is fantastic! Close to major venues like the St. Ives County Club. Clean rooms good food and staff is very friendly. Highly recommend staying here when in town. Bed was great 
27354 This is how chicken is done!!! Super juicy and no dryness inside. A little spicy but nothing you cannot handle (unless you dont eat spicy food at all). 7 of us shared a huge plate and some appetizers. Will definitely come back again!! 
27355 This place is great ive come here a few times very friendly people regulars are very friendly food us great i really like this place 
27356 I do like the creepy gothic haunted house feel of the place, but its a little run down and the drinks are really expensive, but its actually a fun place to go. 
27357 You can't ask for a better restaurant, what makes Coquine so special is that it's also the perfect neighborhood spot and the combination is perfect. You will be very happy if you eat here. I won't muddy the waters by suggesting any particular dish They are all great. 
27358 I went there the other day for takeout. Staff is Friendly, restaurant is friendly, clean atmosphere and the chicken Pad Thai was perfect 
27359 This place is great. The flavours are spot on. The hibachi show is great. And very affordable and you get tons of food. They are located in the publix shopping center on the corner of Chickawsaw and Lee Vista. I highly recommend this restaurant. 
27360 Had lunch at Nagoya and this little gem never fail me. Food is as good as always plus more. No wonder this is a 5 star rating place. The star never lie :-) 
27361 One of the best Authentic Greek restaurants in Atlanta. I'm from Athens Greece. I never miss eating here when I'm in the area. As a full blood Greek, I know the best when I eat it.... :-) 
27362 Really chill place with good wine. Nice and chill ambiance with great customer service. Will come back here again and update with a more thorough review. 
27363 I went here a few weeks ago and Kelcie did my cut and color. She did an amazing job and I absolutely love it! It's also a great location and I'm overall very happy and will definitely be back! 
27364 Hugh is great. The whole staff is friendly. I love the color to blend my white hairs to make it look more natural. and the prices are reasonable compared to what I have gotten in the past. 
27365 Excellent ambience and extremely delicious food. Service could improve on terms of speed. 
27366 Love it! Try the hot and spicy shrimp and roasted duck. I eat there at least once a week. 
27367 Cool place but drinks are alright, nothing to write home about. We were over charged and they were not going to bring attention to it until we said something. They do have a mechanical bull which looks like fun. 
27368 The food is good and the sushi is fresh. The service is terrible. I called during lunchtime to order sushi and they were out of rice??? Seriously? The best rolls they have are the New York and the Alaskan 
27369 One of the best hamburger restraunts in Atlanta, such a good restraunt go there all the time 
27370 I drove thru at approximately 9:30am (and a short line to my surprise) and ordered two breakfast tacos. They were fast and friendly. My tacos were great! Excited to have another good drive thru place in south Austin. Now if they only had Topo Chico... 
27371 They did an amazing job. I got the silver package (inside and outside) for $22. The guys really take the time to get over every detail 
27372 Food is delicious!! Served in a timely manner. In and out kind of place. Other than the wait staff not looking like they want to work and the cramped seating space food is on point. Oh and There's a lot of msg!! That explains why it's so good. 
27373 Love this place! I've been twice so far and both times I've gotten an awesome shellac manicure. They are fast, friendly and do an incredible job! 
27374 Just a basic clinic. They are designing all their new clinics to match each other, and that can be convenient. Very clean, and well organized. But recently they upgraded their medical records, and not everything transferred over. 
27375 4.5 stars for the sun rail. It's always clean, on-time, affordable, and a great option to winter park for dinner. Plus, my son loves it. If they were open on the weekends, I'd give them a perfect 5. 
27376 Had a great time here on my date night! Was treated really well my Olivia! Definitely looking forward to picking up our pieces and coming again soon! 
27377 This is a good place. The food is very good and the portions are good. The people were nice and everyone had a smile which made my bad better. 
27378 Fantastic old building, cozy feel inside, good wine list and very unusual food, and wonderful tasting food! great for 2-4 people, quiet and calm place! 
27379 Amazing happy hour. Accommodated a group of 45 on short notice. Great Paloma. Amazing and quick service. Hider was awesome. Great patio! Had so much fun. 
27380 Huge selection of alcohol at decent prices. Just watch out for the ABC undercover in the parking lot, they've tried to bust me more than once... 
27381 SUPER quick service. My scooter was inspected in t-minus 2 minutes. My total time here was ~5 minutes. 
27382 I've been here twice, got the dukboki and the baby octopus. Both were flavorful and portions were big. Could have been better for the price 
27383 This place is awful. The massage therapist bruised my leg and inner thigh really bad. I've been to the other location and this one is just trashy inside. It's not even mediocre; atmosphere and lighting don't make for a relaxing experience at all. 
27384 I loved their fish and chips..the best in Portland so far!!! 
27385 Not sure what all the hype is for this place. The owners seem really nice, and the donuts were good, but the food was just ok. 
27386 My wife and I came to your location this past Saturday evening to celebrate her birthday. When we arrived the hostess was so welcoming, The food was great, the service was great and the wine topped of our visit. Just wanted to say thank you for a great visit!!! 
27387 If you have a car, and need anything! and I mean anything wrong or needs looking at, I recommend this shop. The mechanics, honest (if not the lie so good you are happy to accept it as truth), and efficient, knowledgeable like you want in your doctor. 
27388 Best lamb over rice in TX! Houston's Jones fried chicken is a close second. Family owned restaurant and the owners really care about maintaining quality. If you are in Austin this is a must ! 
27389 waiting for a shuttle that "is just coming in a minute" for 30 minutes If you value your time just take a taxi - not much expensive but really more reliable. Why lie to people with "we are leaving in a few minutes" if you know you are not??? 
27390 This place has unfortunately gone downhill since the move. I know it's roughly the same menu, but somehow the quality or taste of the food has suffered. Chambar, their old next door neighbor, has breakfast now, with a similar menu. It's fantastic! 
27391 This is the worst service ever at rental car in Airport. In line for 30 mins & still 4 people ahead of me Only 1 person at the counter w 10 people waiting. Don't Bother to reserve w Budget at Orlando airport 
27392 Went there on a date. No/little wait for a Saturday. Very romantic setting. Candle lit. Brick architecture. Very small setting. Had chicken fettuccine alfredo (so goood)! Despite the high price, very good. 
27393 Not bad for Shanghainese food, I do enjoy their sweet and sour grouper fish and they have acceptable Xiao long Bao. It's centrally located across the street from Pricesmart and consistent service. Not the best, not the worse but fairly good. 
27394 After a hiccup with an online order not received by the store, the manager gave us excellent customer service ensure it we received our order quickly. I highly recommend this store for their customer service. 
27395 Excellent breakfast menu and amazing salads. The service here is usually very quick, which makes it a great place to stop in before work or during lunch. They also have a decent selection of fresh produce which is nice since Seaport doesn't have a grocery store. Highly recommend! 
27396 Great food & service. Manager checked on us several times & interacted with guest. Salad bar was fresh & neatly prepared. Waiter wasn't too knowledgeable of the menu, but took care of us more the less. Entr√©e was awesome as expected. Will return if I'm in the area. 
27397 This place is solid. tons of space for people to work. Good food options. Live music at night. Incredibly attractive baristas and clientel. 
27398 Tried this place for the Vietnamese sandwiches, which were very tasty. Not much in the way of atmosphere, but the sandwiches were worth it. 
27399 Real food. Real good. The sauces are full of flavor. A little slow so don't come if you're in a hurry. 
27400 Pizza was.actually pretty good here. Mine had a bounty of meat on top and I ate the hell out of it. Service was eh. 
27401 Quiet place in a quaint little part of Grandview. Nice for getting work done on a cold day or just stopping by for some relaxation. I can't say much for the drinks because I only had their tea, but this place is definitely worth the check out. 
27402 Normally, Great Clips gives average service but it's fairly cheap and quick, so I go. Portia, at this location, was the best stylist I've had in the 5 years I've been going! I'll be coming back to this location for sure. 
27403 Obviously not the classiest of establishments but you already knew that going there. It's appeal lies in the cheap beer, campus location and yes, they take the Husky Card! 
27404 Marika is a wonderful at what she does! The atmosphere is very relaxing and in a great location. She gives the best massage in Atlanta. Very relaxing and therapeutic. I will definitely be back! 
27405 Great place for lunch or dinner. Great hummus and salads. 
27406 Worst americano ever. Staff can be arrogant and with attitude. Been there twice, will never come again. 
27407 Absolutely amazing place for great food, cocktails, and conversation. The menu is different but expected from the type place it is. If you want snooty and fancy, go somewhere else. This is an experience that you can bring your family to week after week. 
27408 Way better than the Roxys grill on the lake. Great katsu and best Hawaiian food other than Bamboo Grove. Between this and Matshita's you can't go wrong. 
27409 Our server was great. Our wine was incredible. Our mashed potatoes were insane. Our steaks were indescribable. 
27410 DO NOT USE!!! Will take your order and never deliver. Will be contacting BBB and already reported them as fraudulent to credit card company. 
27411 Can't go wrong with Olive Garden ever but Becca and Josh (the manager) are fabulous and will go out of their way to make sure you are happy and satisfied! Highly recommended 
27412 Coronas and fried clams sum up this place. Laid back atmosphere and a fun wait staff. Great for groups at the picnic tables. 
27413 This place! In all my years of travel this place blows away many of the hotels I've stayed. The staff are all exceptionally friendly and helpful. The decor is to die for. The rooms are clean, fresh, and perfect temp at night. Love everything about this hotel! 
27414 Amazing place for a haircut - Mo is an artist. I appreciated his attention to detail and the price cannot be beat. My new go-to barber shop - can't wait to be back. 
27415 Awesome! Don't miss it. Wanted to see it a second time but our trip wouldn't allow it. Amazing experience! 
27416 Great wine, nice people in an excellent setting. Jeff was pouring delicious, interesting wines. 
27417 My son and I had lunch here today. The waitress is a funny Vietnamese lady that likes to tell you she loves you when you don't split checks :) She's awesome, food is great and affordable priced. Great little restaurant overall... 
27418 Great brunch spot! We absolutely love this place. Definitely the Biscuits with gravy is a must and chicken and waffles! 
27419 what a fanciful shop! there is always so much to check out, so many treasures to find. one of the BEST gift shops in all of portland. the new kitty is a great addition, too!! 
27420 You don't fuck with this place. Not your Nouveau-Portland white subway tile interiors or your sour-ass South American boutique roast bullshit. Time itself can't touch Rimsky-Korsakoffee House. You hear that, God? You. Can't. Touch. This. 
27421 Inoffensive and healthy lunch (if you don't have an almond croissant for dessert) Pretty good and fairly healthy lunch, with powdered sugar all over your coat (if you do) 
27422 Amazing staff. Great prices. Excellent menu. Fantastic special menus for daily customers. I personally love the coconut cupcake latte and the cinnamon bear latte.... But so many great choices I urge you try and find your favorite!!! 
27423 Great lunch experience here. Really well seasoned dishes, and the atmosphere is lovely. Our waitress gave us a sample dish while we waited of sarma and carrot hummus. 
27424 This place has the best Thai food I've tried in Portland, also very affordable. I'm lucky that I work on the hill and can walk over when craving it. Jason is the owner and he's awesome, too. My favorite dish is their pad kee mow (drunken noodles). 
27425 Always a good choice. Food is homemade and plentiful 
27426 The best corned beef hash I have ever had on the north shore. Fast and polite service. 
27427 We ordered something called "Sizzling Salmon Legs On Stage." Next time, I'd like to taste "Hockey Pucks on Fire!" This menu does not disappoint. 
27428 Updated to 1 star. No response from them, not to mention that the manager never even dropped by to talk to me that night. 
27429 This place is amazing, my new BBQ love. The meat is so smoky and tender, the hot sauce rocks, and the baked beans are incredibly seasoned. Just go. 
27430 Delicious bagels & cream cheese. Curt but quaint servive. 5 stars for the chicken pot pie-ate the whole thing waiting for my bagel to toast. Soo tasty ...best I ever had. 
27431 I have eaten at pokie joes in Hancock shopping center and never experienced such awful old dried up food. All the meat I ordered was sliced paper thin. The mac &cheese was so dry 
27432 Everything looked old and dried up. I will never eat at this location again lserrano 
27433 Came in this morning with what turned out to be an allergic reaction to penicillin. The staff was wonderful, very professional and efficient. I was out of there in one hour feeling much better. Thank you! 
27434 Giving them two stars because the service was very good. They must make their money from us tourists, because the food was not really good. I would not order again. Everything tasted so sweet! Vegetables with garlic sauce should not taste sweet. 
27435 I've been conditioned to despise Doctor visits. One medical won me over immediately yet. From an program that enables me to schedule & reschedule appointments on the fly, to the spectacular (& serenely quiet) office, to the top to bottom customer oriented staff. 
27436 Best sandwiches in the city -and I would give my first born for an order of those onion rings. The bartenders and waitstaff are always friendly and the service is great. Great beer selection too. My go-to place for good food and good beer. 
27437 Always have a pleasant staff & my lattes have always been top notch. Great spot to catch up on some work. 
27438 Best sushi in portland. Always fresh. Great prices, great staff. I love this place more than most anything. 
27439 A yummy place to eat Cantonese food. Both lunch and dinner :) In my humble opinion, this is the best place in Kerrisdale. 
27440 Stopped in for lunch and this place is awesome. Lots of TV's, hot girls, and good food. The service was great and had a lot of energy. 
27441 We didn't have their pizza but we had some wings. It was a game trying to find meat around so much fat. Pretty awful. Delicious breadsticks but stay away from the wings. 
27442 I've had better service since my negative review and that employee seems to have been let go so I'm upping my review! Great pizza. 
27443 Enjoyed our experience! Service was excellent for a party of 26! Highly recommend :) 
27444 Just WOW. A most excellent cheese steak. You have to try it. Worth the money and time. Great service too. 
27445 I have been here a couple of times and have gotten the pho combo and claypot combination. The pho is not bad but the claypot dish is really good with sweet and savory sauce combined with the rice. 
27446 Amazing Italian food with no pretense. This is the best Italian food I've had since moving to New England. Fresh, large portions arrived hot out of the oven, but not too hot. 
27447 I have only gotten the cuban sandwich here, and let me tell you that it is by far the best cuban sandwich I have ever had. Those 5 star are solely for that sandwich. 
27448 I had a great experience at South Point Nissan when I took my Juke in to get serviced. The staff was prompt, attentive, and fast. I will for sure be taking my car there again to have them to any needed work done on it. 
27449 Here's a great, and by the way, gluten-free, restaurant find. Yummy casual food and kitchen counter atmosphere. They have no wifi, their sign says, to talk to each other! I'm coming back. 
27450 Noodles and co. Used to be excellent. But it has gone done hill in quality and in employee appreciation for the company. The food has lost some of its flavor and the employees don't often wear smiles. 
27451 Is it just me? I have called 5 times in the last 24 hours, left a voice mail 24 hours ago and still no call back and no one answers the phone. Their voicemail is now full. Really? This is not good customer service. Please don't call me back. 
27452 good pizza/calzones but I highly recommend the honey bbq steak tip sub as long as you catch em on a good day 
27453 Awesome perk for DVC members. Vacationing here with friends and access to the exclusive lounge helped make our time together amazing. Bartender Mike and server Luc were awesome! We had a great time hanging out and talking with them several nights. Food was great and drinks were amazing! 
27454 Theres a decent chance you'll hate yourself after eating here, in a good way. Delicious food, and a lot of it-- the doughnuts are excellent. The beer selection is good and the vibe is friendly. 
27455 I was take a shower. First 5 min coming hot water, but change for cool water on 5 min later. Check out time is11:00am. My Flight schedule at 18:59. I wanna baggage storage. But Not storages service this Hotel. 
27456 Not the world's biggest Chinese foodie but I've had my fair share and this place was BOMB! The place was clean inside. Great service. Food was fresh and delicious. Good prices. And late night takeout. 5 stars all day. Ill be back next week. 
27457 This place is super cute and I may have to say that it and Avery are tied for my favorite Boulder Brewerys. Definitely try the berry wheat! 
27458 You are missing out if you don't come in here. I only hope that it doesn't get too popular and the prices start rising... because right now it's delicious and affordable. 
27459 Stopped on our way to the Hill Country. Worth the wait, freshly made fish tacos. Plan to go soon. 
27460 A staff member kindly assisted me for find the problems on the wheels. Fast service and nice price. 
27461 Reminded me of my mom's Italian food, i.e. they tried real hard but in the end I was not satisfied. 
27462 Quick, easy and friendly service. I went there today to print a few documents, they did it precisely as I wanted. I highly recommend this place. P.S. Thank you fellow yelpers for helping me out in choosing everything in this new town. 
27463 The food was fantastic, the setting is beautiful, and our waitress Meghan F. was so helpful and friendly. We took all of her recommendations, and she wasn't wrong. Definitely try the doughboys for dessert. They were my favorite part of the meal. We will be back for sure! 
27464 Sat outside. Ordered mimosa and the banana rumba. 12$ total. Very good eats and it's super filling. Great local eats 
27465 Best place for wings and beer! Service is always great and food is always fresh. My 5 year old daughter loves the chicken tenders and frys's. 
27466 The owner was very pleasant & friendly. The baklava was awesome & everything we ordered was very good. We had great service. Parking is a bit challenging...if you can manage, it's worth stopping by. 
27467 A great taco and one of my weekly haunts. I'd rather pay for a taco from Art of Taco's than eat a free taco from any of the other trailers on the street :) not trying to be mean... just saying. 
27468 Mediocre food, sour coleslaw, and an inattentive server...No thanks. 
27469 I love this place. The wings are the best in the area. The online ordering is very convenient. They also deliver very quickly. You don't wait around all night like other delivery places. I would recommend Wings over Brookline. 
27470 I love my three pepper chicken sandwich on ciabatta bun. Was not too enthused with the potato salad. But the sandwich itself was well worth the price and I would go there again. 
27471 I just really love the food from here. Nothing fancy but still satisfying, hot and freshly prepared Thai food that is as good to take out as eat in their cute decorative lit restaurant that is a romantic hole in the wall for an otherwise blah strip mall in Hillsdale. 
27472 This place is the best Italian spot in Austin! The couple that runs it moved here from Italy and make the noodles and sauces from scratch. It is very affordable and could not recommend them more! 
27473 I came here pretty late and I was surprised the were still serving breakfast tacos at 11:30pm. The classic breakfast taco was alright but I really enjoyed the Reuben. I would recommend trying the sunset lane if you were looking for a light and fruity drink. 
27474 Fantastic food, people here know how to playfully create the taste. We ordered Eggplant Caponata, beet salad, batata bravas. all of the items had distinct and tasty flavor. Service was quick and amazing. All the suggestions from Jannelle tasted awesome. 
27475 I like this show 
27476 WOW. So good. I've been disappointed by other Mediterranean options in Austin, so I am stoked to have a new go-to spot. 
27477 Was back on Friday, August 7th. Only had a Sam Summer Ale....but the service and beer were excellent! And for a 22 oz draft to only be $6.50 AT AN AIRPORT! Very nice! I'll be back again when I fly home in 2 weeks. This is in Terminal B. 
27478 The best place in Newton center for little gifts, halloween costumes, cards, pinatas, and stationary. GREAT FOR: Pinatas --how can you go wrong? 
27479 I take all my overnight guest here. It's better then my breakfast. Lol. It's like home 
27480 Great pizza! Tried the Smoky Joe's crust (Garlic & butter). Amazing chicken buffalo bites & lasagna bites. Wonderful & beer prices. Only complaint was that it was much too loud to carry a conversation. 
27481 Omg!! This place is a total surprise!! Tacos with an Indian twist. The shrimp tacos are out of this world delicious! Grilled fish taco is also great! the flavors are spicy and Indian... so yummy and totally unexpected. 
27482 Jon and his crew are top notch! They went above and beyond, and I will definitely have him come back to do additional tile work. Jon is extremely easy to communicate with and my whole experience was easily 5 stars. 
27483 New Orleans style country breakfasts are outstanding and unique to the area. The setting in an old home in downtown Boulder is unique as well and convenient. This is more authentic and delicious than other Boulder breakfast and lunch options. 
27484 Very friendly staff. Donuts weren't as fun to choose from as pictured but they all tasted very good. Husband got the maple bacon and he absolutely loved it. 
27485 Great sandwiches and nice spot to quickly grab a sandwich at lunch...I like the toasted sandwiches. Counter service and fill your own drink. 
27486 Amazing experience and extremely delicious food! Lynn was absolutely amazing. She has a lovely personality, extremely nice and caring. Will definitely be back and will request Lynn as my server. 
27487 The waterfall is a refreshing surprise. Grounds are clean. Burned plenty of calories on this hike. 
27488 Good ingredient selection. Small bowl. Nice service. Didn't try sushi. I'd go back again. It was good, not great. 
27489 This place is a great local credit union! They have a fabulous small business feel and the local art work is great. The staff is very professional and courteous. 
27490 Always a great line up of beers. Always. Food offerings are always excellent, if a bit off beat, throughout the year. Friendly and professional staff. 
27491 My first time eating Ethiopian. Wonderful experience. Service was superior, food was excellent, even got some to go !! 
27492 Had a fantastic salmon salad, served with a herb vinaigrette. Just the right, heathy sized portion. Dessert was a decadent brownie sundae that was just the right amount of sweetness. Don't let the exteriors fool you - very rustic inside! 
27493 early 20's, beer sticky floor...and if you havent found that special someone to go home with for the night...just stick around till the lights come on round 130!!! Its like a free for all!!! 
27494 Northeastern hang out. Always too crowded at night Thur. - Sat. - impossible to get a drink. Grimey, though not as dirty as it's Comm. Ave counterpart. Come here if you enjoy the close company of strangers and pushing your way through large crowds! 
27495 E. Boston - Good food & service. Just don't like the parking & waiting 20+ minutes when visiting. Compared to the new Peabody one - think I like it. Peabody has parking, clean, didnt wait & the food was amazing. The waitress was AWESOME!!! 
27496 Amazing food at a great price with great service. What more could you want? If you haven't eaten here, you're missing out. 
27497 I love this place--the food is always fantastic, the servers are friendly and know their stuff, and the cocktails are excellent. The avocado colada is worth a trip here just by itself. 
27498 We live nearby and this has become one of our go-to places for takeout. Menu has good options with Indian/Nepali basics and some interesting things I haven't seen elsewhere -- samosa chaat is worth a try if you like either of those two things. 
27499 Great service, awesome pho!!! The lady was super nice and friendly. Food came out in a timely manner. The place was very simple yet classy. So glad we stumble upon this place! 
27500 Makeup was a little over the top but the El Paso Chili was excellent. I added cheese and jalapenos to take it up a notch and it was "just right". I'll be back! 
27501 Love this place! Everyone was very nice and helpful when it came time to order. Great beer selection, large menu. I would highly recommend trying the chowder fries. We will definitely be going back! 
27502 Best Bloody Mary EVER, with tons of Vodka options - many of which are house infused. The food is pretty good with some interesting options, even though the wait is usually considerably long. But I see that simply as an opportunity to enjoy a few Bloody Mary's. 
27503 I was in need of getting to sprinkler heads replaced. They were able to come out the next day and fix the problem. They also did a check up on the whole system. So at least in my case they did a great job. 
27504 PJ is an ok bartender a little slow. The bald guy I think his name is Shawn? He was really kind of a dick. Overall stiff pours and poor food. Just dont go on weekends when the bald dude is workin and you'll be cool. 
27505 Great happy hour place! Personally feel that their regular dinner menu is overpriced for the food you receive but I'd recommend visiting for their HH if you haven't. Great selection at a great price! When I come here with friends we usually end up ordering the whole HH menu! 
27506 My new fav place in Austin. Try those little yogurt dessert things. Wow. 
27507 Every time I pop in to browse, am impressed with the friendly reception. There are items, including jewelry, tops, dresses, I never see anywhere else. Higher quality than other women's shops in Coolidge Corner. Always enjoy shopping here. 
27508 Kind of pricey but the service is great! Lily was really sweet, she threaded my eyebrows very carefully and left no stray hairs!! 
27509 Good food. Good price. Friendly staff. I'm cheering for these guys. OLE 
27510 Some of the best gumbo I have ever had. Order the bowl, it has about 4 cups in it. Other menu items were quite tasty as well, but OOOO the gumbo. 
27511 Very enjoyable atmosphere. A step above what you usually expect in the North End. Food was great service was good. Priced a little higher than most places in the area but worth it in my book. 
27512 I had the gnocchi with crawfish and it was spectacular. The service was super friendly and accommodated our children with a table and menu for them. We all had a great adult brunch! 
27513 Just amazing. The chicken is juicy, flavorful, a kick of spice, perfectly crunchy and the waffles... Just go try it out. I've been to most places in ATX for breakfast and brunch and these guys are doing something different. I'll be back for more. You should too. 
27514 The massage was pretty good, the foot massage and steam was interesting (definitely felt good on my feet) and they are very attentive. I'd go again. 
27515 Slow service. Too pricey. Converted my odometer to kilometers per hour for some reason. Don't waste your time 
27516 TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL. Rebecca Decharme left me a message, then i called to leave a message and never heard back. So why bother to call me in the first place. Management must allow these rude individuals to continue working 
27517 They charged me 15% tip although there was no waiter/waitress to give you service. The food is not any good comparing to authentic turkish kabab. The price is pretty high. The worst part was there were NO parking lot! 
27518 Great! They the have a nice selection and the price is right. The store is clean and I don't have the feeling that someone needed to sell there video collection to get some crack, like I get from stores like this on the outskirts of town. Will be back. 
27519 No lemon!! How does a oyster bar seafood restaurant not have lemon. Alcohol was way over priced and tiny portions. Definitely not worth its current rating 
27520 Had a blast. Came with a group including a small child make sure they are at least 36 inches to get the most out of it. Brought 1 souvenir cup that we all shared (free refills). No lines in the morning. 
27521 Amazing sandwiches and good selection of drinks. My gf said the chicken sandwich was the best she has ever eaten and I agree that it was next level. The pork belly was equally yummy and I added a side of flaming cheetos mayo. 
27522 I love this place. My nails are on fleek whenever I come here. I even take the bus if I have to in order to get my nails done at fancy fingers. 
27523 I'm starting to dread the walk from my apartment to the laundry room :( also all the people in my building use more water than I do. I wish it could be split by unit rather than allocated throughout. 
27524 Love love love! Not only the ice cream but the atmosphere and the vintage feeling! Can't wait to go back and try more sundaes!!! Oh, the Isla sundae was AMAZING!!!! 
27525 Have been back here quite a few times since my original review. Have tried additional items on their menu, and the deep dish pizza seems to be their best dish (at least in my opinion). 
27526 Shoot bruh, me and my wife went in on some eats. It was too good. Some of the best ethnic food in Sandy Springs. Very glad we went there. Huge portions 
27527 The pizza here was fast and delicious, and the toppings selection was awesome! I like the restaurant theming, too. Prices are a bit high, but not that bad, considering how close it is to Disney World. Perfect for a fast dinner after a busy day at the parks! 
27528 I booked with Handy using a promotional code, so I got a great deal on it for my move-out cleaning. Amelia was outstanding -- responsive, kind, funny, attentive, etc. I can't say enough good things about her. 
27529 Nice place, good people, huge menu. Toast burned, but potatoes, poached egg and oatmeal were very good. I did not even ask for almond or soy milk for the coffee. Woburn is not progressive. Reasonable prices. 
27530 Service was fine and attentive. The Sandwich was met expectations and I was in and out within 30 mintues. The servers also appeared to work really well together and incredibly hard. 
27531 better dough ingredients and over the top prices. I still wanna support the two that I go to though. flavors and toppings are of the typical eclectic cross fusion choices. I go for the simpler choices, cause the better ingredients come out best in the flavor of the dough. 
27532 Have ate here three times. Every time, food has been delicious and service has been excellent. No complaints. Their sushi is amazing. 
27533 I'm not a big Pier 1 kind of person, but the staff at this Pier one were really really helpful! 
27534 Spicy miso ramen is yummy. Not so spicy, either (at least by my taste). This place has a nice vibe too... people just chilled and enjoying a good meal without any pretense. 
27535 Honestly my favorite restaurant of all time! Service and food are amazing never let down!! 
27536 Food is decent but overpriced. Service is attentive and prompt, but bathrooms smell like open sewage. I don't come here unless someone else suggests and insists on it. 
27537 Excellent food & service. Pizza is much less greasy than other places in the North End, and they have some unique toppings. I'm not sure why this place wasn't more crowded, but I definitely plan to go back. 
27538 If I lived in Columbus I would apply for a job at Pattycake and just have them pay me in cupcakes. Being vegetarian is important to me... and I love that Pattycake makes it taste better. They have good graphics, fun contests and the treats are tops!!! 
27539 My husband and I were in town for a few days and stopped to have dinner here one evening. Jay was super friendly and the food was simply amazing!!!!! Would definitely eat here often if we lived here. 
27540 Review based off of take-out, but this place is legit. Awesome sandwiches, and friendly, reliable service! I've had the grilled veggie wrap and the chicken parm sub, and both were good! So excited to have another go-to takeout place near home! 
27541 I eat here a least twice per week. The food is delicious, the service is over par and the price is right. This is a great establishment. 
27542 Not a hard review to write. This place is off the chain good! Cozy and inviting and full of flavors. Louisiana flavors in Orlando simply the best! 
27543 This is a great park, lots of free field space to play, whatever! Definitely a great place to chill with the fam 
27544 I love their waffle! Fluffy and flavorful! I usually order Strawberry waffle (with fresh strawberries and whip on top) Their onion rings are very good too! Onion ring sauce (horseradish flavor) is finger licking!! 
27545 Hey Tico, if you advertise a new online ordering system make sure it works!! 
27546 At Riccardos. Just had the polenta tartufata with a great Sicilian red. Cinghiale stew next. Second home!!!!! 
27547 DO NOT come here under any circumstances. They do really poor work! Didnt properly remove my nail polish and cut my nails really unevenly and insisted it was fine even though I protested. I regret coming here. 
27548 Best beer selection around, period the end. I'm so glad I now live near this place. Staff is very friendly and helpful, especially the bald guy with the plugs. Buy your beer here!! 
27549 Really cool dinner atmosphere and delicious drinks and food. My favorite was the fish tacos and bruschetta! 
27550 Love this place! Excellent food and staff. It has a great vibe and cool staff. Good luck with parking :) 
27551 Sorry guys. I love shake shack but am really frustrated that the taste of shake shack in New York City is so different than the one outside of NYC. The beef is not juicy and it's just not tasty. We were pretty disappointed , but the service was great 
27552 Great sushi, but DON'T order anything hot. I ordered the udon to go once and it was so bad I threw it away. Kinda burned the place for me too havent been back since. 
27553 Food was simply awesome. It is the best combination of flavors I have ever tasted. By far the best restaurant I've been. 
27554 The tacos al pastor are the absolute best I've had anywhere in Austin. They also have an excellent variety of unique margaritas. 
27555 Convenient and super friendly/helpful drivers. 
27556 Amazing sushi. Among the best in town. I've not been here before because Thai food isn't a personal favorite, knowing they have this quality of sushi, I will be back. 
27557 This is the best flower shop in the area- the freshest flowers, varied plant selection, friendly and helpful staff and the cutest pups too! I always call The Concord Flower Shop when I need flowers for any occasion. 
27558 Here during SXSW, so it was a Zoo. Great Bird, Great Fixins. Great prices. A totally enjoyable feed... 
27559 Shake Shack was definitely worth the $20 I spent just for me. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town. 
27560 Purchased a www.restaraunt.com certificate for this restaurant a while back, so I decided to try it out. A friend and I drove out there, and the server informed us that they are not accepting any www.restaurant.com certificates. Very disappointing. Can't remark about the food, as we chose to dine elsewhere. 
27561 After living in an area with no 24 hour convenience stores the Plaid is a great relief. Late night snacks combined with cheap prices and a close proximity make this location amazing. This store seems quieter than most and the staff are friendly (they say hi) 
27562 Horrible salsa. Horrible food. You will most likely get sick after. This place is not worth the visit save your money and go elsewhere!! 
27563 So delicious! Came here with a friend after taking a pole dancing class nearby. Good quality espresso and the salmon toast was delicious! I'm definitely coming back :) 
27564 Super unique location! Fountain that kids can go in, terraced seating around, and under cover seating options as well. Also beautiful indoor shop. Best Starbucks ever! But don't go cuz then it will get too crowded! : ) 
27565 Inner space too cramp, I would recommend other Summermoon Coffee. The coffee is the same as any other summermoon. 
27566 Amazing experience. I loved it, everyone should give it a go. You really feel like you are flying!! It just should be longer!! 
27567 It is now closed and replaced by a new sushi restaurant..so so not as good as Sushi Bar..going to miss this place 
27568 they were supposed to be scary but someone tried to kiss my friend. would not recommend unless you want to be kissed but hey maybe that's your thing if so i recommend 
27569 The best of the best. The only dentist AND staff who have ever made me excited about going to a dentist appointment! 
27570 I've only been twice hence the 4 stars, but each time I've been reallllly happy with my order, Hawaiian pizza and a Greek salad. So good. The 4 stars is also because I think it's a bit pricy for pizza, but hey I'm from NYC, home of the $1 slice.... 
27571 This is my favorite inexpensive food stop in Austin. I adore the grilled avocado reale with added roasted corn as well as the #1. They have the BEST tempeh bacon and their nachos are the shizz. Thank you guys for doing what you do and keeping my tummy happy! 
27572 I always bring the tourists here. This is a must visit place. I shall not tell more nor ruin the surprise. But just go about the place. Maybe check your table. The coffee is good and the desserts are great ! 
27573 This is a nice gym in the financial district. I go there occasionally with my classpass membership. Everyone is nice and the gym isn't too packed. I really, really wish they had a steam room or sauna though! 
27574 These stars are for the people in the Copy & print center!! Friendly and fast service! Thank you!! 
27575 This place has a good vibe! Their customer service is also on point. Shoutout to JoJo, he took great care of my girl and I on Saturday night. 
27576 As a Chinese, I have to say that it is very delicious. Even though many of dishes are a little more sweet than the tranditional taste. I will come tomorrow night for another dinner. 
27577 Oishi! If I could, it would be 6/5 stars. Came in from out of town at almost closing, they graciously stayed late. the sushi was amazing. really fresh and beautiful presentation. 
27578 Spectacular food, drinks and service. What more would you ask for. P.s. Try the bacon jam. Holy amaze balls!! 
27579 Great front patio seating for people watching. The food is, meh. This review is for atmosphere only. 
27580 A friend went by here yesterday and reports it's CLOSED. Neighbors report it's been closed for two years, which may explain the lack of reviews since Jan 2012. 
27581 Great service & yummy food. Andreas was so attentive and polite. 
27582 Consistently great meals. When the in-laws come to town it's the only place we go. Great ambiance, but also excellent as take-out. Pad Thai is spectacular. 
27583 Not as good as five guys or shake shack but the options are pretty cool. I love how diverse and exciting the menu is. When I return I'm more likely to just order sides or a salad, I'm good on the burgers. They aren't bad, just not memorable. 
27584 The best authentic Mexican food in town!!! Great people! Great food!!!! Outstanding service ! 
27585 Came in for a quick stop and it's a cool bar. Lots of great people. Sarah gave my girlfriend and I excellent service. Cruise in for a beer. 
27586 Awesome beer selection! I always come here and try something new, awesome staff and definitely an Keep Austin weird kinda place! 
27587 Just picked up an As-Is bike at a great price and got a couple minor repairs, all for around a hundred bucks. If you're on a budget and just need a decent commuter, you can't go wrong here. 
27588 Nice place to get Brunch, Lunch and cold drink. Great for Hangouts. Always busy. Better to pre book a table. If you are lucky you might find a table on spot. Tasty foods, good service. Overall Super experience 
27589 Ordered their coffee shaved ice w/ rice cake, can't say I'm impressed, but it ain't bad. Had 2 ask them 4 the food twice tho, but I do appreciate the whole basketball theme! 
27590 Nicest staff ever (I have never seen the guy not smiling), fantastic thin crust pizza and cheap! So good! 
27591 Had to try them out due to their yelp reviews and sick of Walt Disney over priced food. This place is the best of the best! Came back over and over again while in Orlando. 
27592 To Nat Below...Myers and Chang HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PF CHANGS! Please don't even put them in the same category as that chain nightmare. 
27593 Service was pretty awful. Was completely ignored even though I was the only person in the shop. When I did ask questions I got one word answers. Don't waste your time 
27594 Fluevogs are my love, my weakness, my indulgence, my favorite of all favorites. They are pricey but worth every cent for the comfort, style and construction. 
27595 I love going to Dr. Warstadt and have been for about 7 years now. He always remembers you and what you are doing in your life. He is patient and thorough. We would definately recommend him to anyone in the Tucker/Northlake area! 
27596 Great Happy Hour Deals. Great food, environment and sports on the screens. Conveniently located near the airport. 
27597 Morgan is a great server. Made sure we were well taken care of. Love the patio seating and brunch menu. Kid friendly too! 
27598 Delicious food, great drinks,fast and friendly service. What more could I ask for? Melon Margarita was so good... ceviche and seafood enchiladas too!!! And the bean dip with chips!!! So good. Highly recommended 
27599 The Fish tacos were amazing!! I went on a Friday during lunch and I waiting for 30 mins for my food which is pretty long regardless. But over all I really enjoyed the food! 
27600 Awesome Cajun food 
27601 Hard to find good quality Cajun food .. Definitely our new fave 
27602 Try the consolation prize. Also who can say no to free beer? Really nice atmosphere and friendly staff. It's a former marble manufacturing facility so the decor has a lot of nice marble craft. 
27603 By far the best indian food in the area. My bill for lunch is $5.75. This is fabulous!! 50% off lunch buffet M-W. So, it looks like this is my new indian spot!! I'm so happy I finally stopped in here for lunch. Great food, great price and great service! 
27604 This is some really good chicken, it's gotta bit of spiciness to it but that makes it good. It's really juicy and isn't chewy or over cooked. Really good chicken!! 
27605 Great sushi! We sat on the non-hibachi side. Friendly & fast service on a Friday night. The crab Rangoons were perfect. The volcano roll was huge and topped with a ton of fresh avocado. 
27606 They just opened and they don't know what they are doing? Went there and just got fried okra..... COLD as ICE! Why would you serve a customer cold food????? Anyways never going back! Just one bad experience ruins it all. 
27607 Love these guys. I go to them for my eye exam and to purchase contacts. They're super friendly, convenient, and take care of all my insurance work for me. 
27608 I stopped by February 20,2013 and found the place didn't exist so I went to the mall customer service desk and was told they went out of business in November 2012. 
27609 Outstanding friendly & helpful service. Will shop there again and looking forward to trying out their cooking classes. Great range of products and product knowledge. Very happy customer! 
27610 Cal Skate rules! Awesome staff, amazing selection, absolute best prices! It is by far the best possible place to buy a skateboard in Portland 
27611 Love the building I voted for it along with an architect friend, we discussed the chances, slim to none we thought, you can't imagine our surprise when they announced it would be built, the alternatives were two boxes one tall one short. 
27612 Absolutely obsessed with my balayge!!!!!!!!! She did exactly what I wanted I could cry with happiness 
27613 Beautiful ambiance with delicious authentic Puerto Rican food. Literally one of the best Mojito's I've ever had. Very fresh and refreshing! The Cuban Sandwich was outstanding. Definitely in my top 5. Highly recommend El Super Pan. What a great addition to The Battery! 
27614 Their salad was oily and unimpressive. Each leaf was covered with oil. I would advise staying away from ordering their grilled chicken salad if you go there. 
27615 The food is always fresh and delicious. The plantains are the absolute best. I order the veggie plate, my son order the jerk wings, and the jerk chicken plate. If you are in the ATL; stop, eat, and enjoy! 
27616 I went back and requested a refund for the salad I tossed. They were very polite and gave me my money back. Thank you. 
27617 Great ice cream and reasonably priced! The ice cream did not taste watered down and wasn't too "icy". Looking forward to trying a specialty blizzard next time 
27618 The dosas are both gigantic and yummy. The curry inside is also great. Friendly staff make up for the drab interior. 
27619 I haven't order food from you guys in Years and now I know why. My tacos sauce container was open and all over my food. The tacos were too burnt. My 5 yr old brother couldn't eat it. Deliver took over 1 hour. 
27620 Great coffee and pastries. Baristas are excellent. All the other staff are sooooo lost and vacant. 
27621 Great food. I've been coming to this place for a while now. They never disappoint. Small spot. The parking sucks but that's not their fault. 
27622 Great salad bar, haven't tried the deli though. Usually average service but last time the service was terrible. 
27623 Maple bacon, old-fashioned... you name a Blue Star donut and I like it. And for someone who is not generally a donut fan that is saying something. Donuts are always fresh and the staff are friendly. A great morning stop. 
27624 Prices are competitive to online shopping, but selection is limited. Sometimes you need to wait for someone to be ready, but the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. 
27625 Yikes, I love the food here, but today the lady serving seemed so annoyed that I was ordering food (one bowl...). It was super uncomfortable. Not a great look. Hopefully she was just having an off day and this is not how customers are normally treated. 
27626 I love their food. It is really good. It is one of the places that I would love to go over and over again. They have outstanding food and customer service. If you go there you have to try their bread. You also have to their multi sides veggie appetizer. 
27627 Quick and easy dinner when you're in a pinch for time. I mean what teenage doesn't like pizza? The only complaint I have is that i wish the crust was more crispy. Otherwise two thumbs up. 
27628 I come here regularly for lunch and the service and food is always decent but they really need to change their menu. It is always the same old stuff not interesting at all. 
27629 I went with my girlfriends for pedicures here. The manicurists are very sweet and professional 
27630 Prices are fair and appointments are not necessary. My friend has been coming here for over 10 years. So happy with my pedicure here. 
27631 Had the chirashi bowl and it was delicious. Super fresh sashimi. Well made food and good portion sizes. 
27632 The daily special is amazing, delicious with great portions. Highly recommended for lunch. 
27633 Great HH and reverse HH everyday, and all day on Sundays (includes select sushi, appetizers, and sake). Sushi is high quality, recommend lobster roll appetizer, crazy roll, spicy yellowtail, and tuna. Seaweed salad and miso soup are cheap and tasty too. 
27634 We ordered the Country Chicken Curry over noodles and tofu pat see eew and it was all delicious, the potions are fit fit for the price and the restaurant really reminds me of Southeast Asia. Everyone was friendly and kind. My boyfriend and I will order again soon! 
27635 Cinnamon latte was steaming and salty(?), glad they have mighty leaf tea and they do make pretty heart art on their drinks. Cute, wannabe hipster place, with way too many old folks. But I take that back, cause they were the original hipsters! Lotsa seats in and out. 
27636 Amazing food, minestrone was a good start, followed by the blood orange salad and completed the meal with smoked mushroom ravs which were awesome! Andy was the best server ever. 
27637 i love roma. easily the gem of the hill, great coffee and it's cheap too! 
27638 I got Pho to go. #3 I think. It was great. The broth was flavorful and the meat was tender! I'll be back. 
27639 The food was ok, not bad, just not Good. I was however not disappointed. I'll go back :) I love burger joints. 
27640 My favorite chinese restaurant in Austin! Sometimes I catch myself eating here 2 times out of the week. I've been going here for years, excellent food, great service! 
27641 I would give this location a 5 but they really skimp you on the bowls. And it's not just the meat. They put barely any rice in my bowl..... like.. it's rice. At least cover the bottom. Otherwise good as usual. 
27642 I have tried most everything here and love it all! Great service, atmosphere, and food! 10/10 recommend 
27643 Delicious ice cream, generous portion, and a great price! I tried the pumpkin flavor and it was to die for. They have a large selection of flavors so there is something for everybody. The staff was very friendly as well and made great recommendations. Wish it was closer to Boston. 
27644 Cute little ice cream parlor on Main Street in MK. We got the Mickey ice cream sink sundae. Yum! It was so cute and a great souvenir. 
27645 The best causa I've ever had. The food is amazing and in a totally unassuming location. You must go here if you like real Peruvian food! 
27646 My favourite lunch place in the area. Big portions, good prices, and extremely friendly staff. This is where I was first introduced to Filipino food, and it made a good impression. The menu is huge, and a lot of the dishes are best shared so go with friends. 
27647 I paid full price to see a movie that was just a few weeks old yet it had vertical black lines running through the print the entire film. It honestly felt like a dollar-theater experience with slightly better seats. 
27648 Yes please! I will likely become a familiar face here. Love all the options, service and rich flavors. So happy to have an exclusively bubble tea spot! If only they had a rewards system.... 
27649 I liked it before they moved to cedar hills. Now you have to use a virtual teller. They don't give you an option unless you complain. Now I feel treated better when I go to my "big" bank. (Bank of America). 
27650 A consistent favorite! I have been a fan of Brasserie since they opened and my recent visit with out of town friends was fantastic. The Brique Poulet is amazing! 
27651 Amazing food, outstanding service, great decor. What a wonderful experience. Had burger and meatloaf. 
27652 Do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel - to Many good choices in this area -- to put up with rude and unprofessional staff !! 
27653 Walked in and walked right out ...this is a healthy Greek place with no LAMB GYROS,Spanikopia or even baklava ...GOOD LUCK AND OPA!!! 
27654 I had the almost Chicago hot dog. The bun tasted amazing, the dog was tender, and the flavor was great! Best hot dog I've had so far. 
27655 I love this place. Amazing food, drinks and customer service. Great ambiance and beautiful space too. I wish that parking was a bit easier to find at times, but it's totally worth it in the end. I've been here multiple times and have never been let down. Definitely a gem! 
27656 Excellent service and knowledge and at reasonable prices. Fix cracked screens, water damage on iPhones, iPads etc. These guys are courteous, professional, fair, and FAST! Really great. Don't go to Apple, go here! 
27657 Food was good. Had the chinese bbq pork spring rolls, lemongrass chicken, and the shaking beef. However, received the appetizer at the same time as the entrees. Still would be back. 
27658 Best.Chicken.Fried.Chicken. Hands down. Cute setup in the "it" neighborhood in Austin right now. Amazing food, a handful of vegetarian options, and lovely staff. I even got my boyfriend to try the avacado fries. He didn't regret it ;) 
27659 Everything from our cheese to our chocolate was awesome!! Katie our server was fantastic! Perfect date night 
27660 A true, family run business with great service. Sofia's a dear. 
27661 My daughter and I got our hair done today. I got Senegalese twists and she got box braids. We both love the fantastic work you ladies did! Thank you so much. 
27662 Extra fees at check-in, AC has auto shutoff so room was always hot and dirty pools that close too early every night (10pm) 
27663 Absolutely fantastic! The entire staff is great here and Dr. Aaron really takes the time to listen, educate you about your spine, and feel good about your care. 
27664 We used Tiny Tails for three back to back weekend events in georgetown and they were amazing! Super easy to work with and great with the kids (and adults)! Highly recommend! 
27665 Cool place unfortunately I had a very bad experience. I bought some very expensive glasses, then after the prescription was wrong I had to play extra to have another set of lenses for the glasses. Total rip off, too expensive and it took forever. 
27666 The food here is amazing... they have wicked fast carryout and if you order to pick up, the food is hot and fresh. 
27667 This place already has enough reviews, so I'll leave it at this: The Spike Lee, with half grits, half potato cakes.... Now! To. Die. For! 
27668 The service, very nice and welcoming. The food, not so much. Chile relleno was clearly either frozen or cooked, frozen, recooked. It was in a pastry and the breading was not appetizing. Rice, old. Overcooked Veggies, frozen. 
27669 Unfortunately this location has closed :( I'll sure miss having an EPL so close to me! 
27670 ÊÑüÊÅ©ËäÇÊúâÂõõÈÅìËèúÁöÑÁ≤æÈÄâËèúÂçïÔºå 19.95/child 39.95/adultÔºåÂçÅÂàÜÁªèÊµéÂÆûÊÉ†Ôºå‰ΩÜÊòØÂçÉ‰∏á‰∏çË¶ÅÂ∞èÁûßËøôÈáåÁöÑËèúÂºèÂïäÔºÅÁÅ´È∏°ÔºåÈæôËôæÊµìÊ±§ÈÉΩÈùûÂ∏∏ÂèØÂè£ÔºÅ 
27671 I really enjoyed the pork honey miso ramen I got here. While not up to the quality of the ramen I've had in Japan, it was very enjoyable and I would definitely go back here. The service was prompt and it had nice ambience. 
27672 We came to B&G almost every trip to Boston. This time we came for Saturday lunch. There weren't many people in the resturant. As always, the food was exceptional. Oyster is a must e regime for us. They are always very fresh and very good! 
27673 Food is pretty good and the owner is super friendly despite his limited English. Grilled chicken and beef iskander are great dishes. Turkish coffee was ok but the presentation is well worth it. Baklava was a disappointment. We will be back. 
27674 Amazing food and great service our waitress Omar was very polite and very friendly. All the food is amazing highly recommend!!!! 
27675 We had a pleasant meal full of fresh and tasty Korean dishes! It hit the spot! We had slightly difficult time with customer service as it lacked and was hard to ask for anything. The staff hardly checked on us, but even so the food was dynamite! 
27676 Traveled to Atlanta from Las Vegas for 4th of July weekend, and based on this restaurant's hours of operation we planned on having dinner there tonight (they close at 10pm). When we got there at 8:45pm they denied our entry. 
27677 Bam! Cherrystones were awesome....I love them raw!!!!!!! Oysters were fresh too. I had the salmon salad....it was cooked perfect....not too dried! Relax atmosphere....easy to get to (right outside of the Alewife T, also free parking lot too!( Good services! 
27678 I realize I wrote my last review just 3 weeks ago, but I've been here five more times since then This place remains fantastic! Krystal is another wonderful bartender. Knows the menu inside and out and can offer great recommendations! If you're at the upstairs bar, ask for her! 
27679 very authentic Cantonese food. I got curry fish balls and Chinese sausage and bacon clay pot and both were delicious. Please do not come here expecting stellar service; though. The waiter is efficient but will not make you feel special (not a complaint!). 
27680 Had the cioppino and it was alright. Nothing special or outstanding for the seafood that I've had in Vancouver, go fish is much better 
27681 Love this place! Cozy and welcoming. The food, service and wine selections are all really good. I have been there about 5 times and every time I am pleasantly impressed. I would recommend this place to all my friends. 
27682 Good food. Good service. Good prices. Always crammed with Asian Americans, which is a good sign!!!! 
27683 They have a good amount of options within the Mexican inspired menu, and the people who work here tend to be really nice. Fresh, quick, and clean. 
27684 Wonderful food! Always fresh and delicious. I always get chicken and my husband gets beef. We've had several dishes and they are always delicious. Wish they would deliver, but the drive to take out if definitely worth it. They are always so friendly! 
27685 I highly recommend this place. Lisa is super awesome and personable. Every time I get massage, I already feel 1000% better. Her pricing is affordable compare to most places out there. 
27686 Ken does an amazing job!!! He is always on time, I have been going to him for about 3 years and NEVER had to wait. He listens to me and does exactly what I want. The best part is he is reasonably priced. 
27687 Traveling back from California. And wanted a place for brunch so happy we stopped! Good so delicious and portions are big! Friendly service! 
27688 They were so kind and got me as soon as possible, my kitty has severe ringworm from some foster kittens and they set him up with a lime dip and oral meds and were very thorough in explaining how to do everything. Great experience thank you for helping my baby! 
27689 Very cool. Doesn't hurt than Centennial Olympic Park is right there, so you can hang out there until you wait for the night to come. 
27690 Took the wife here on a date to get couples pedicures. Had a blast. Nice clean place. Very friendly staff. Good prices. Definitely a repeat. 
27691 Popular spot on Boylston. Convenient because it is right across from the Prudential Center. Food and service were decent, nothing to write home about. 
27692 So grateful to have an alternative to BBJunction, which is terrible imho. These people know how to do burgers! Hope they stick around. 
27693 The food is OVER Priced and is not fresh and the portions are very small as the waiters are car salesman... the managers don't even care why your returning your food 
27694 The menu on the site does not match what they have Wasted my time ordering only to hear back much later that they are out of those items. Sucks! 
27695 Fantastic Facility... Great Staff that are both; Personable and Knowledgable. Doctors are Super Friendly. I highly recommend visiting here to anyone that want quality advice and information on repairing and injury, maintaining their physique, or improving their fitness levels. 
27696 Admittedly, some dishes here are hit or miss. The hits, WAY MORE than make up for the misses. The Khao Soi is the best I've ever had,and I've had supposedly the best while visiting Thailand! Very friendly and fast service in the this lovely little hole in the wall. 
27697 Very small location but size isn't everything. Stopped here a few times during lunch break, days off, and the like and have never experienced a significant wait time. The baristas are very professional, friendly, and prompt. 
27698 Best breakfast tacos in town...plus they're cheap and gigantic. Try a carne guisada and potato taco...it's such a great combo! All the ingredients are good though. Haven't found a combo I didn't like! 
27699 Just wanted to update review,,, nothing's been fixed and forgot to mention missing pool tiles that have been like this for over 2 months,,,,, just can't believe Hyatt would not maintain a property to higher standards 
27700 My favorite kombucha company, period. The ginger flavor is great. I was skeptical to try kombucha but I really do feel better when I drink it, placebo effect or not. Good hangover cure. 
27701 I actually had a great experience here yesterday. The store seemed to be better staffed, and the staff was very helpful and friendly. I'm glad, as it's a favorite destination of the kids. 
27702 Completely agree with Angie C. Food was mediocre at best. Don't even bother ordering most of the appetizers (we had a combo) or the hummus. Main course was pretty decent, i think we had the same one as Angie C but the dessert (baklava) was possibly the worst I've had. 
27703 My husband & I wanted to try wood fired pizza & boy did we go to the right place! We had the margherita pizza & it was fantastic! We enjoyed chatting with the owners brother while watching the pizza bubble & bake in the oven. Yummy!! 
27704 Top to bottom, the best dental practice I have been to in 30 years. And I've been to many. 
27705 Everything works in this place: scratch-made, TASTY whole food served quickly, friendly staff, reasonable prices. It's my new favorite! The only reason I don't give it five stars I'd it is really LOUD!. Not only is the whole place hard surfaces but they add to the cacophany with LOUD MUSIC. 
27706 I love this place. They have fantastic food. My only complaint is the valet parking. I, personally, dislike the concept unless it's absolutely necessary. I say, "make'em walk". Anyway, I'm not letting it effect these 5 stars. Luke's is high up on my top 10 best eats in O-town list. 
27707 The decor is very nice, but the food is average - prices are certainly above average. If they decrease costs by 30-40% it might be acceptable, but with current prices places like Rod Dee (all locations) are a better value. 
27708 I LOVE THIS PLACE! Sam, the manager is such a kind, sweet man. And such an artist!! My manicures always last upwards of two weeks and his nail art is so talented, I'm amazed every time! Do yourself a favor and GO HERE for your next nail appointment! 
27709 Awesome Food! My hubby and I shared the chicken sandwich and it was so good! This was our first time here and I would live to come back! 
27710 Cold, greasy over salty and overpriced( for what I get) food. Not to be a jerk here, but if an Asian food is being cooked by a Mexican person- well that's pretty much explains most of the concerns ,left out there 
27711 fast friendly service this burger is to die for! i came all the way from chicago for this! love it, the house burger with special sauce is awesome and the bun is perfectly toasted! 
27712 awesome place for a weekend, hungover brunch. the salmon eggs benny with avocado and served with hash browns is my absolute favorite. their sangria is really good too. perfect patio for a sunny brunch. reasonably priced, great atmosphere, and delicious food. 
27713 I have never been to another vet but I felt that my cat was treated well by the vet and the technicians. The office is easy to find and has free parking. I waited less than 10 minutes in a clean, cute waiting room. I will definitely be returning. 
27714 thier only a couple of words tell any customers ,who wants bad food over priced bad food and over rated services ,who are thier own time not your,so good luck 
27715 I really like the peanut butter, but everything else I have tried was just OK. Not worth the price in my opinion. Most of my friends love them. And the staff is very friendly. 
27716 AMAZING. Not much else to say but that you need to go here and order the fricasse. Do it! 
27717 This place is the great place to shop if you always wanted to get clothing, assesories, etc at a cheaper price. And I also love that the color featured for the week is 50% off, which beats the regular price. 
27718 Average coffee, creepy service, funky location. I'd say you gotta try it once just to say you did. Their Mexican mocha is pretty good.

27720 I had a very positive experience with Peace Frog getting my carpet and tile cleaned today! James was very polite and efficient! I would highly recommend this company! 
27721 Fantastic. Authentic Italian cuisine. You'll pay a little more but just go for it. 
27722 Stopped in to give it a try and bought 3 cupcakes. After the initial sticker shock of paying $3 for each cupcake my kids and I ate them. Verdict: I could have bought two dozen of them at any grocery store that tastes just as good for the same price. 
27723 We ordered a large chili cheese fry, Chicago dog, and chili cheese dog. The fries were over cooked and super hard. The chili cheese dog was kind of chewy. My wife enjoyed her Chicago dog. In all it wasn't anything spectacular and I wouldn't recommend it. 
27724 White spot has really gone downhill. The food quality is really bad and the service is slow. The waitress still brings the food even though it is not edible. I would not recommend this chain to anyone 
27725 Mal servicio no respetan el orden de llegada y mucho tiempo de espera para el servcio mas de 25 min de espera servian a gente que llego despues y hacen esperar. No recomendable 
27726 Worst service ever! We had a party of 15 and took over an hour to get our check and they screwed everything up charging us for meals we didn't even have! Food is mediocre. Bless their hearts never going again! 
27727 OK--not my cup of tea, but I'll give respect. Well, I dunno. Hipsters are OK. Stoners are OK. But these hipsters/stoners are very low-end. Herrell's attracts dirty, dumb, obnoxious people. 
27728 Meat heaven! Thats all I have to say. Service is excellent, meat cuts are off da' grill :) this place makes me sing and dance.... 
27729 Disappointed that my medium rare was well done, only was take out so I didn't realize it until I was gone. Kind of pricy. Bacon was perfect and burger not dry. 
27730 Helpful and friendly staff, the Brazilian BBQ was fantastic and the price can't be beat. The meat was perfectly done and seasoned. Left full and happy, and will definately go back. The place is not fancy, but who cares!' 
27731 First visit and it won't be my last. Lunch was excellent. We had the Mahi sandwich and the pastrami it was perfect. You get a choice of a side. We had the truffle Macaroni and soup. Amazing!!!! Prices Excellent!! Service also Excellent. Highly recommend it!! 
27732 good place to try some neat beers. flight holder is kinda weird. pizza is so so. nice staff 
27733 I was a tourist in town and we stumbled on this place and got a frozen caramel frappalanche or something like that...but it was delicious!! An the atmosphere is great 
27734 Great place for breakfast! Amazing crepes, pancakes, spinsch pie and omelettes. The hot chocolate was alright. But, the food was surprisingly delicious. We come here every week. Most value for money. Service is quick. Servers are so nice. 
27735 Loved it! Really good authentic tacos and I had a great brisket sandwich. It was very local and authentic and prices were on target. Will definitely go back regularly. 
27736 Love that this is close to my house, has outdoor seating, let's you eat Los Gorditos while drinking there, and infuses their own vodka. The vodka rocks! 
27737 Awesome food truck. I've been here several times, and tried 3 of their signature burritos. All 3 were incredible. My favorite is the chipotle calamari. Everyone I've come here with has loved. You should absolutely come here 
27738 Slick space. Great people. Can't wait for the yoga studio addition. 
27739 Do not order a salad! Order the squash blossoms, the ravioli entre and a nice bottle of vino. Service is professional and unpretentious. The stars are the kitchen staff who put out a terrific product that begs you take a picture or simply say "yum". 
27740 I had the pasta special which was a fettuccine in a brown butter sauce. It was beautiful. The service was wonderful, our waitress was very attentive and the drinks were fabulous. Romantic atmosphere, will definitely go back. 
27741 Three words: chicken Katsu sandwich. It's a fantastic flavor combination with the right textures and it's perfectly filling. I'd love to try their fried chicken, but that menu item is a bit $$$ for a workday lunch for me. Gotta admit: their cookies and ice cream desert is yummy. 
27742 Went here for lunch. I ordered the Ako salad, and it was delicious! Beautiful setting overlooking the water. Food was good but service was slow. I would eat here again, and I recommend it to others. 
27743 If zero stars was a review i would leave it. This place is awful and they know it and they do nothing about it. Literally go anywhere else. 
27744 It's a lovely shop with a decent variety of donuts. But it taste like all the donut are the same inside - same with a hint of orange skin flavor. Too bad I never had chance to get a Tiramisu donut. They have it sometimes. 
27745 The chacha chicken we had for lunch was great! Such a healthy yummy lunch place! My girlfriend had the spinach pizza, the crust and the taste were delicious! We will be back!! 
27746 Truly great service and really friendly and knowledgeable sales staff. They may not be the cheapest, but you get what you pay for. I'd give them 5 stars if only they carried more brands (Surly, Bianchi, etc.) 
27747 definitely the best authentic chinese food in columbus with the best price. my favorite dish on their menu is the spicy pork chop. don't forget to say thankyou thanks thanks! (you'll understand if you go) 
27748 This place makes delicious food. It is the best vegetarian cooking I have tried in Portland. I love that it is just a short walk from my house. My favorite item on the menu so far is the shepherd's pie. Great customer service also! 
27749 Food and deserts are good. The management is rather unfriendly but the most annoying thing is the announcement of your order number over the loudspeaker. Quite difficult to carry on a conversation with the incessant bellering over the loudspeaker! 
27750 Love their Puerto Rican wedding cake!! With sweetened brandy. The lady in the bakery was very nice and helped us. The place is clean. We didn't order food, but it looked good. 
27751 I had the Pad Kee Mao take-out and it was great. The place was very busy when I went and so it appears to be a popular place with the locals. 
27752 Cute brunch spot. Food is great; however you will definitely have to wait a while for it. It took an hour and some change to get breakfast sandwiches. If you have the time you will be pleased, otherwise skip it. 
27753 Love this place...I tend to order takeout just so I can say hello to the lovely woman who occasionally delivers. Been in the restaurant a number of times, great service, nice atmosphere, and great location. Highly recommend the Pad See Ew or any of the duck dishes. 
27754 Love Habitat for Humanity. I also appreciated having a place to donate some used home improvement stuff (I dropped off a couple light fixtures and ceiling fans). They were friendly, helped me unload my car, and gave me a donation receipt. What more could one ask for. 
27755 food is ok, but what happened to the portions? got takeout and there was hardly any chicken in the chix/broccoli. what a rip off. wont order from them again. 
27756 Get here early on a weekday! The waitstaff is extremely friendly. I would recommend getting the eggs benedict because it tastes unbelievably amazing! 
27757 Soft opening happening. Pizza and salad in the style of fast casual. Pizza dough is pre-rolled/smashed for your toppings of choice. What did I learn today? Lot is suits in there. 
27758 Great service in a small family run restaurant ! The beef Iskender was outstanding ! Definitely going to return for more !! 
27759 Thanks to Angela at the Metrotown location for the chat and connection. Good luck in your adjustment to Vancouver from Calgary. 
27760 The service was decent. BUT the pizza crust was over done and hard like cardboard. The cheese had completely evaporated. This was the worst pizza experience I've had at a restaurant. I don't recommend it. 
27761 Disgusting owner - he is a racist and rude and uneducated individual who hasn't learned a thing in his however long he has been in this country - the sweets are good but I would not be going back to spend another Penny with this guy 
27762 I really liked the guy who worked here, but I haven't seen him in a while. The young women who have been working here as of late have been very rude, which makes me not even want to leave my things here. I'm already in search of another place. 
27763 Excellent restaurant! The ambiance, decor, service, prices & food were fantastic!!!! The chips are incredible along with the salsa. The quacamole was as good as it gets. We had the taco salad & #6 combo which were delicious! Thank you! See you next time!!! 
27764 The steamed dumplings are great. You get a very large portion for $4.50. The place only has 6 tables and spartan. The food is inexpensive and good. 
27765 Really interesting variations of rolls that I have never seen, friendly staff and some good bartenders. 
27766 Happy hour is great! Service is very helpful and friendly. Atmosphere is good for any occasion. 
27767 I got tattooed by Darlene a year ago (I know, this is a really late review). She was great! She was very nice, did an amazing job and I left absolutely happy! I would love to go back very soon to get another one for my birthday. Wish me luck! 
27768 The macaroon and the liquid chocolate (with coconut) was too sweet. If you don't like sweet hot chocolate it may be better without the coconut. I also bought the tiramisu cake but didn't feel there was much cake. It tasted more like tiramisu mousse or tiramisu cream. 
27769 The dinner quality is below average. The noodle dish does not have enough vegetable or meat. The bean seedling is not very tender. The beef tendon is not tasty at all. This place is good for serving traditional Chinese lunch. But it is not a good place for dinner. 
27770 Made better cappuccino myself - really disappointing. It was a Saturday so maybe the normal staff wasn't in. 
27771 This is a good Vietnamese restaurant. Food is freshh and versatile. The service is regilar. Not bad but they are flat 
27772 Best haircut I've had in a long time. Mr. Kim is a attentive professional and works with you checking every step of the way. 
27773 Came here on a whim since it was impossible to find breakfast near downtown crossing. The coffee was SO scolding that the entire meal was finished before it was drinkable. However, the veggie omlette sandwich was pretty good, so that makes them even I guess! 
27774 After tasting everyone's meals at breakfast I would recommend the Bacon Bloody Mary (that comes with a piece of bacon floating in it) and the White Chocolate Hazelnut(?) Pancakes. With their powers combined it's like having dessert for breakfast. 
27775 We had a good dining experience here recently. Attentive and friend service and great concept for tasting various Indian foods. The dinner came in a round plate and included several dishes. It was fresh, fulfilling and vegetarian. Definitely will return to this location. 
27776 The best service and food in Cambridge. Our concierge recommended this gem and we stayed for a couple of hours. Great food! Great service! A must if you are in Cambridge. 
27777 Good pad thai. Servers made sure we always had our drinks filled. 
27778 We had their cold brew with sugar free vanilla syrup, & cream. The atmosphere was relaxed and their was a lot of different seating areas. The service was great. Sadly they didn't have a Nitro coffee. The decor is perfect and the music was perfect. 
27779 Wow. Stunning. Accommodating. Romantic. Modern. As close to perfect as you can get. No amateur review could do Juniper justice. Thank you! 
27780 Great service: polite, funny, positive. great desserts: Fresh, good selection - a lot of chocolate options and the desserts I got were perfectly made... I wouldn't say they have the "Best Chocolate Chip Cookies" but they were good, moist, and fresh. 
27781 I have had the pad Thai and the coconut lime veggies. So good. I didn't know just how good until I ordered from Mali Thai today. Awful. Couldn't eat it and wished I had just stuck with what I knew. 
27782 A pretty good diner, not the best in the world but good memories here and usually very good service, it's a nice place. 
27783 Surprisingly good bbq, the ribs and brisket were fabulous. Even our kids loved the music. Service was a little slow for a restaurant that was not packed. 
27784 Handmade pasta was delicious. The ambiance was warm and inviting. 
27785 I've been waiting for the past 10 minutes for water and my bill. The service couldn't be any worse. Food was ok. I ordered Boylston, which was a baked Haddock sandwich. It did come with really yummy home made cole slaw. They desperately need to improve their service. 
27786 Families with children beware!!! My wife and I were negated a table with my daughter as they claimed it was reserved..... very disappointed.... Hopefully the food and price make up for the poor service. 
27787 With Allen Plumbing, the customer is not always right. VERY expensive and no solution. They came to fix a problem and I ended up no better off. Yet they refused to come back without another $800 charge. 
27788 the hostesses and waitresses have some of the worst attitudes. at least pretend like you enjoy your job. 
27789 You can't beat the price of their breakfasts and the service is terrific. Everyone is friendly and attentive. I love this place for lunch, too. The food is good and cooked right. I travel from Apopka for this place and it's worth the drive. 
27790 If you haven't been here, I suggest you HURRY, i have literally been dreaming about what I had there the other night the servers were extremely knowledgable as well, amazing ambience! I highly recommend! 
27791 Excellent spicy sausage pizza. Chicken Parmesan sliders were a great appetizer. 
27792 My husband said the clam chowder was excellent. I had the meatloaf with mac n cheese. It was great, finished every bite and every crumb. 
27793 All the staff here are great! Always friendly, warm and although going to the dentist is never exciting they make you feel at home and comfortable. I'm glad I found them, would totally recommend them. :) 
27794 Cool space! Interested to see what developes here a few weeks down the road after their coolers fill up! 
27795 Don't miss out! FOOD. Amazing.SERVICE. Amazing. By far worth the wait if you get there during lunch hours. They are even festive. Had the new green burger and it blew my mind. And if you have a question about the area they are very knowledgable. 
27796 I got my Christmas Tree from Pike this year and the experience couldn't have been better. The tree is beautiful, reasonably priced, and the staff was knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. 
27797 Poor... go to Chili's up the street. Tried to feed me fake Jack Daniels! Weak..... 
27798 Great baked goods, cute furnishings and cool HVAC inside, all right downtown in Buda. Their Carmelita's are delicious. I heard the kolaches are amazing (with Hudson Sausage), but they had already run out by the time I got there (11am). Next time! 
27799 I've stopped by several times and the consistency is on point! The service rocks, the food is amazing and I always know what I am going to get....goodness far beyond my breakfast skill level!! 
27800 Wow... What an extraordinary experience! Tiana is both an incredibly intuitive and technically sound therapist, which is a truly winning combination. The space is open and comfortable. Tiana's energy is calm, professional and in tune. The massage itself was phenomenal. Tiana is definitely my new therapist. 
27801 Great food, prepared as ordered and quickly got us on our way. We go to the Bee Caves location, it tastes better than some of the other locations. 
27802 Always good food. Good beer. Margherita pizza and Mariano pizza are delish. Not badly priced either. 
27803 Lunch specials are good. Ample parking and the services was great. Looking for bento boxes and buttery Escobar this is your place. 
27804 Really like the light batter and seasoning that they use. Has a kick to it too. 
27805 Onion tangles appetizer came out with about an inch of oil in the bottom of the plate. Wings were overdone and really salty. Service was mediocre. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner but otherwise slow. Definitely worse than any other Hooters I've ever been at. 
27806 Love the quality of the food,very delicious, fresh and beautifully presented... Served by chef directly kitchen..However as a first timer I should said it was kind of unpleasant to hear "everything is good.can't go wrong" from waitress. Lack of info for their own product?Overall quality is quite satisfied though. 
27807 Stuffed lobster - amazing! Oysters are great. Lobster roll also very good. Lobster stew with dark rum very tasty. All in all very good! 
27808 Good sandwiches , unfortunately they take a real long time. To get the order to you , I can't take a lunch break here because of the wait 
27809 And it isn't even packed 
27810 Best brunch with exciting coffee/liquor options. Great for groups or just a pair. Community style dining. Always make a reservation. 
27811 Service was slow the day I went but the classic cheese burger is one of the best things I have ever eaten. Fries were super crispy as well. There is no need to go beyond the classic burger, I love classics that are done perfectly. 
27812 Been eating here since it opened. The thrill is now gone but the food is still good and very affordable. Like that I can hit Lee's and Com in one trip for a great selection of international treats. 
27813 Didn't want to cook for new years eve. The food was great and the delivery was fast! I have to say I am always happy when I get take out from this place. 
27814 Amazing food along with great service. Original food spin on traditional southern ingredients. Highly recommended! 
27815 Beautiful dinner! Perfect dining experience. Fresh bread with tasty butter, tasty cocktails and salads. We had the lamb pasta and it was AMAZING. The halibut dish was one of the best I have ever had, I can't wait to go back to this place - really nice restaurant vibe. 
27816 Great pesto burger with balsamic salad. Artichoke dip was the best I've had. Had my usual cider but tried "Dude's Rug" cider by B. Nestor, yummy! No prob finding a bar stool at 9 on a Friday night. Casual dress. 
27817 Over priced food and drinks , waited over 45 minutes for average Mexican food 
27818 When food arrived , hardly any meat in the tacos , was very disappointed 
27819 Kodiak roll is amazing. Fish is always fresh and the service is the best. Best sushi in Orlando by far. I have had sushi all around Orlando and this is by far the best all around. 
27820 Shared several dishes with my boss off the bar menu and they were great. Can't go wrong with their thin crust pizza! Good ambience and very nice server. The host needed a bit more training though. 
27821 Chili Queens came to our office. We have weekly food truck and this one was s treat. I had the El Paso and Fritos and it was delicious. They score 3 Fs Fast,friendly, and fun. 
27822 Best Cuban sandwich ever! Bread was perfect and the flavor of the meat tasted perfect with the melting cheese. Hoping the move to the north side of Atlanta so I can enjoy more! 
27823 Purchased a groupon voucher for this. If it was full price I would probably not have considered this place. 
27824 Excellent and very personable service. Couldn't ask for more in an emissions test! Thank you Dad's! 
27825 Besides a little difficulty with scheduling, the service was great. The experience is a lot of fun and the house definitely gets clean (at a very reasonable price). Highly recommended! 
27826 The service was exceptional and the food was great. Our server, Carlos, was welcoming and very attentive. The tomato and mozzarella salad was super fresh and the surf and turf was cooked perfectly. Look beyond the dated decor as I'd highly recommend the restaurant. 
27827 Best burrito I've ever had in a long time. And I've been to San Diego and Los Angeles. This is a must stop for great Mexican food 
27828 I dream of their fried eggplant! Magnifique! It's enough to say that it's the same owner as Fred's Meats...perfection!!! If you like Mediterranean food give this place a try. It's casual but very satisfying! 
27829 I had the chicken pot pie with cinnamon sticks and it was absolutely DELISH. I was greeted by the owner, and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely be back! 
27830 Great family dinner out! Pizza is innovative and delicious! Service is top notch. Thank you for opening up in Vancouver! We will be back! 
27831 i like their reubens... even if they're a bit overpriced... but this place is not soup-nazi good, so i tend to avoid it, even though it's within walking distance of home. ordering from the staff can put me in a terrible mood. they could use a good customer service seminar. 
27832 Small speciality market in the front. Nice open space on the first main street getting off the water taxi. Mushroom risotto was great, salads were creative and tasty. Flight of beers were all pretty good. Ha.burger looked fabulous. 
27833 Nobody is answering the phone. I'd like to know if they have the accessory I need before driving there. Not acceptable. 
27834 The freshness of the crab legs and lobster are bar none the best we've ever had. It's a wholesome place 
27835 The weight staff are super friendly and considerate. We would definitely visit again! 
27836 THE BEST RESTAURANT I SWEAR TO YALL! I was hesitant at first but they make the most delicious food And the service is beyond amazing they are so sweet and friendly so I suggest people go try this place out honestly !! 
27837 Be careful with this place. I stood there as one person after another had issues with their billing. They told me one price then tried to charge another. I saw 4 consecutive customers have the same issue. Watch them close. There is a pattern here 
27838 Adorable boutique with unique items. They have a really great jewelry and shoe selection. Their clothes are a little expensive, but not surprising given how cute this place is. 
27839 Happy hour is GREAT here! I recommend the artichoke and cream cheese crepe. Also, the bone marrow. If your scared to try bone marrow... don't be! It's amazing here. 
27840 This miller's is awesome. Y'all need to make you're way here! I will return often when in town... Service is awesome. Cheeseburger Flatbread is amazing! Trust and believe! 
27841 Fresh and delicious food. I love the sichuan noodle, dumplings and much more. The only thing stops me from giving them 5 star is a little bit long waiting time for noodle 
27842 I know it only says I checked in at this location 8 times, but I have probably been about twice more than that. It's always totally worth it here. Always clean and food is usually well stocked and fresh! Love it here. 
27843 I've been here for breakfast and it was delicious! I suggest you sit outside if weather permits. The wait staff was very friendly and the food was filling and yummy. I got a breakfast sandwich (can't remember what it was called) and it was great. I'll definitely be back! 
27844 I drive from Wesley Chapel, Fl to purchase their pickles and pickled Bologna. After hearing the Sanford Flea Market closed, I am very happy to see that there are other locations to purchase from!!! 
27845 I've been here a few times and always enjoy a meal here. I think it's a bit expensive, but I like the atmosphere. 
27846 Very delicious but pretty expensive for small portions. Sunomuno salad is good and the coconut shrimp skewer is good but expensive for what it is. The Ahi poke is good. 
27847 Smells a little liked cigarettes but greats tacos and drinks. I'd go back. Heard some live music in Sunday and open mic was pretty solid. 
27848 Excellent thin-crust pizza, the whole family loves it. We are take-out or delivery diners as opposed to dine-in and the staff is very accommodating. I always order a minestrone soup also and it is delicious. 
27849 Best sandwiches ever!!! We couldn't decide on a favorite after sharing a couple different ones. My husband isn't a huge sandwich fan but loved these! 
27850 Quick, friendly and efficient! They patched up my tire in a matter of 10 minutes, which surprised me being that they looked really busy that day. Cost: 7 bucks. You can't beat that! 
27851 Haley was an incredible server. She catered to every need. The queso fundindo was very good. The servings were huge, shared with my daughter and we were both full by the end of the meal! We come here every year as part of our volleyball experience. Love it! 
27852 To give less then 5 stars is a crime. The Pizza Bagels are awesome! My only critique would be the hours...they close at around three pm....but they are up at 3am to provide delicious goodies. 
27853 I needed a state inspection for my New York vehicle after a recent move to Austin. These guys served me immediately, explained the process, and had me out the door in 15 minutes. Thanks! 
27854 Came here for a conference and everyone was very nice and super accommodating! I just wish the parking situation was better but i'm happy overall. 
27855 Typical dive bar. The bartender's are nice. Free pool on Sundays. Typical dive bar. The bartender's are nice. Free pool on Sundays. Typical dive bar. The bartender's are nice. Free pool on Sundays. Typical dive bar. The bartender's are nice. Free pool on Sundays. 
27856 Arturo's is great! I especially love their breakfast tacos! I've also had their salads, nachos, tacos and smoothies and I have never been disappointed with the quality or quanitity. It is a great little place! 
27857 Went there the other day and........ THEY ARE OUT OF BUSSINESS. Bummersville. Nice pub for sale. 
27858 Came in town from Los Angeles for my amazing friend's birthday and Eclipse de Luna did not disappoint. Jorden recommended the Chuletas de Borrego..."Fcuk*n DELICIOUS," thank you Jorden #23 for the service and making this night a memorable one. 
27859 Reasonable beer selection and the waitress did a good job but the heat has been out since last week? Hello it's 17 outside! The open Easton area is warmer than this place. 
27860 Gail K has a great variety of fabric and the owner was so helpful and nice. We had a terrible experience with another fabric store close by in Atlanta and were so glad when we found what we were looking for! 
27861 Trivia on Tuesday, pitchers, buckets, great/cheap food - I love this place during the week. Staff is really friendly and a lot of them have accents which is fun. 
27862 ËøôÂÆ∂ÁÉ§‰∏≤ËøòÊå∫Â•ΩÂêÉ ÊØîËæÉÊ≠£ÂÆó Èáè‰πüÊØîËæÉË∂≥ Â∞§ÂÖ∂ÊòØÈ±øÈ±º ÊÑüËßâÈáèÁÆóË∂≥ÁöÑ ÊÑüËßâÊÄª‰Ωì‰ª∑Ê†ºÊØî‰∏ÄËà¨‰∏≠È§ê‰ºöË¥µ‰∏Ä‰∫õÂêß ÊØïÁ´üÁÉ§‰∏≤Âòõ Â¶ÇÊûúÂêÉÁöÑÂ§öÁöÑÈÇ£Áßç ÂìàÂìàÂìà ËøôÂÆ∂ËÄÅÊùø‰∫∫‰πüÂæàÂ•Ω Êù•Á¨¨‰∫åÂõû‰∫Ü ÊÑüËßâÁæäËÇâ‰∏≤ È±øÈ±º ÊùøÁ≠ã ÈÉΩÊòØÊé®ËçêÁöÑ ÁÉ§Ëæ£Ê§í ÂüπÊ†πÈáëÈíàËèá‰πüÂæàÂ•Ω ÁÉ§È¶íÂ§¥Áâá‰πüÂÄºÂæóÂ∞ù‰∏ÄÂ∞ù 
27863 Solid middle of the road chain, I had the fish tacos which were pretty good. The rice and beans as a side were better than expected. 
27864 Love this place - best paninis in town! I'm very sad to report... it's closed! Went there today for lunch, and there's a sign on the door saying 'Presto Panini is No More'... needless to say, I was heartbroken. Guess I need to find a new panini spot. 
27865 Some of the best food I've ever eaten! The freshest fish tacos, plantains fried to perfection & the best corn cake with chicken! Oh.. & the cilantro sauce... I pray they have it in heaven. 
27866 I love everything about this stellar local business. Great business model, friendly associates, fun donut choices. Thank you for being such a great local place! (Mmmmmmmmmm fritters too) 
27867 I'm not super pleased. The polish doesn't extend to the edge of the nail on some of my toes and my big toes look lopsided because the polish doesn't go all the way to the corner of one side. It was fine but I don't think I'll be returning. 
27868 Delicious lunch. Came with tasty bread! Turkish coffee also well prepared and beautifully served. 
27869 Dude these girls rock!!! They cleaned my home and it was hardly recognizable !!! The price was a little out of my range but totally worth the money. They were super sweet, and I have already scheduled bi monthly cleans! Definitely recommended! 
27870 We all loved our food. With my "check in" i received a pancake and it had to have been the most awesome pancake I've ever had. It literally melted in my mouth. yummy. They had many options to choose from. We went for brunch. would definitely go back. 
27871 Ordered the yellow curry and it was delicious. Was pleased to find it full of veggies and full of great flavor. 
27872 This place is awesome! Very creative food and very reasonable prices. Corned bef eggrolls are to die for. Fantastic friendly service. Very cozy atmosphere! 
27873 I was never a big fan of enchiladas before I came here but this place really made me like them. The sour cream enchiladas are my favorite. 
27874 Great experience with Enrique. Very friendly, polite and with reasonable pricing! Work was through and well done. 
27875 Thanks for getting my bike road ready for a great rate. It needed some TLC and the guys at southside were awesome. And they have cute dogs at the shop. Kudos for the fast service too. 
27876 I took my aunt and uncle here the other week and we all tried it for the first time. Now, we are all in love with this little gem of a restaurant. They have amazing tacos and their salsa is perfecto! 
27877 Best Dinner with an old friend! My waiter Billy was the best. Food is great and service was even better! I will be back very very soon 
27878 This is a great coffee shop with fresh and delicious food. They have good bagels and the veggie cream cheese is made in house. I recently enjoyed the salmon and capers with cream cheese on an everything bagel. 
27879 Friendly staff and good food. If you are looking for a quick bite, this is a good option. 
27880 soso chinese american food/diner. service is not goodÔºåmany sevants but never on time serving. Do not suggest to good if wanna try good Chinese food 
27881 Great atmosphere but the food is average. We had deep fried calamari, ravioli, the daily special--steak and sable fish. They all taste fine but just fine. I was expecting more with their Yelp rating. 
27882 Best Chinese buffet I've been to in Austin and I've been to a lot. Great selection. Fresh food. Clean. Great service. I will definitely be here OFTEN 
27883 Fantastic Meat Selection. They have a few different kinds of marinated steak tips, chicken tips, and the Best Made Hamburger on the Planet. They also have prepared foods, lots of italian stuff, very good. Highly recommended stop before a big Barbeque! 
27884 Homestyle noodles which reminds me of small noodle shops in NYC Chinatown. Leek pie is amazing. 
27885 good pricing, friendly staff, awesome chairs for pedicures! they did a great job and I have officially switched from my normal spot!! 
27886 This is my go-to when I didn't pack a lunch for the day. Great BBQ pork banh mi ($4.25), and I really like the lemongrass beef with rice noodles. I also enjoy their taro shakes, but its a bit rich for everyday! Cash only, mostly take-out 
27887 Food is so good! They are super quick and efficient with their service. The sweet and spicy chicken and ranch pizza is amazing! I highly recommend this place for your next pizza order! 
27888 This is a good place for a cheap round of golf. Lots of room to open it up and let it fly! Lots of woods and a few water hazards as well. Shot Em Straight & Long! 
27889 Loved the salmon burger and fries .. highly recommend. Big portion of salmon.. fries super fresh 
27890 I'd definitely get this again ...Good job Burger Fresh 
27891 Hip small venue, friendly warm bar- great margarita, satisfying sangria- tacos were filling and delicious. Had the bam bam shrimp which were lightly coated and delicious! Guacamole was on point too. Would definitely recommend~ not great for large groups or kids. Love it! 
27892 I love burgers, but I think their tuna burger is good here and the other burgers are ok. Always a line here so be prepared to wait. 
27893 Chicken was tender, and flavorful. Really enjoyed the smoky flavor paired with the amazing jerk sauce. Sitting outside with a plate of this wonderful food, accompanied by Caribbean music made for a wonderful lunch. 
27894 Had a great time on the 4th of July. Plenty of boats. We got there at 10am and there wasn't a line. Really clean and great service with a smile. Will be back again (: 
27895 Beer's good but think twice about getting more than one growler. Tried to bring one back for my $5 deposit and was told "state law" doesn't allow them to. Really - the two guys down the expressway give deposits back. 
27896 Outstanding Sushi spot in Orlando! Nice atmosphere with a great vibe. Some of the best sushi I've had anywhere, really clean and flavorful! Great service from our waitress Tanya. She was very friendly and knowledgeable and made it a good experience overall. Will definitely return next time I visit Orlando. 
27897 The $8.95 lunch buffet is the way to go. I never leave hungry, the selection of dishes available and the accompanying sauces just right. Just be sure to choose the Garlic Naan over the plain, you won't be disappointed. 
27898 We had a great experience here. First, it's the most affordable breakfast around. The restaurant is clean, the staff is obviously experienced, meaning fast and efficient. The breakfast itself was really yummy. I had a waffle, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns and it was all delicious-fresh and just what I expected. 
27899 A nice hotel with a nice comfy room. Very low water pressure in shower with a non-working adjustable shower head. A stain of dried and crusted fecal matter on the base of the toilet. Due the lateness of our check-in we didn't notice it until the morning. 
27900 Stopped for a quick appetizer and drink before boarding. Five crisp wonderful shrimp and an awesome martini served quickly. Very attentive friendly service 
27901 The.manager stopped by as well to inquire how I was doing. Very impressed. Makes it worth while to spend time in the airport. Sue P. 
27902 Great Mexican food. Nice ambience, low key and very welcoming. The food and service were excellent. Portions were very generous & well priced. 
27903 Good solid diner food delivered by a great staff. Not a fancy breakfast, but well cooked breakfast classics. The famous (I saw them in the High Museum!) wait staff are very friendly and helpful. Quick, delicious, nicely delivered breakfast. Consistently. 
27904 Everything was fine. Slightly spicy chicken just wasn't what I was looking for. Not worth the effort to get downtown and park if you're not already down there. 
27905 Wow, what a great concept! I love the waffle cart, my kids love the waffle cart. I am so glad it is in my neighborhood. 
27906 So good! Love the vibe and self service coffee while you wait. Try their housemade Secret Aardvark Hot Sauce. Shared the Bada Bing! It was so yummy and warm with gobs of cream cheese inside. 
27907 This place was great the food excellent the character were great. Pluto was begging for my food. Goofy was a ham with us. I!!!!!don't know why people complain about this place it was excellent !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! went there for dinner 
27908 Last night was no exception to all my visits to this lovely restaurant. Amazing service, and even better food. One of my favorite places to be. The sweet corn is to die for. 
27909 I LOVE FRIES!!! So saus is just the perfect place for me. I love this concept with all the different sauces, I had the poutine with truffled mushrooms - to die for! 
27910 Sucked sucked sucked. Waitstaff sucked. The girl didnt even bring enough plates for our app. My steak was over cooked and over salted. My husbands ribs were ehhh. NEVER. Will. Eat. here. again. EVER! 
27911 It's so amazing. The food, the staff, the decor. It's all wonderful. The wait staff is knowledgeable, give thoughtful advice, and keep up with you, without feeling overbearing. They are a thoroughly exceptional group that you should visit today. Sunday Brunch was fantastic as well, bottomless mimosa! 
27912 Just order the sausage and banana pepper pizza, have a beer and consider the night a great success. They consistently have the best pizza in the city by far, and it's all because of the crust. It's pizza perfection. 
27913 I've been several times now and I think Banzai is under rated. Their sushi is always looks fresh and I love their ramen noodle bowls. Its a little pricey but I think worth it. 
27914 Had the veggie chili and veggie wrap. It was quick, fresh and tasty! They have lots of fresh salads and sandwiches to please all palates. If you're looking for something that's not loaded in grease, this is your spot. 
27915 Such a welcoming place with incredibly great food. Simple but awesome. Staff was friendly and funny. Go get the best breakfast in town! 
27916 Stopped for a quick dinner ended with an awesome experience! Food was exceptional and service was awesome. 
27917 Good pizza. Even better wings! Pizza is better than average, and the wings... oh my goodness, the wings. They are HUGE! I sometimes work in the greater Columbus area and I always come back here to get my gluttony on. Thanks Taranto's for the few extra delicious pounds! 
27918 I ordered a steak bomb , most places cut up the steak very well until it's small this place cuts in strips , kinda hard to chew the steak, it was ok but not the greatest nothing to write home about 
27919 Fantastic steaks, excellent service, easy access and valet parking. 
27920 Came here for the first time last night...SOLD! Definitely my future go-to Greek restaurant! Server was personable but a bit slow. We waited about 15-20 mins for our food, but it was SO DELICIOUS! 
27921 My question to management: My family & I went 6/20/16, we noticed that the All you can eat Rock Shrimp was no longer on the menu. Very disappointing. Is this temporary or permanent? 
27922 Today is Thursday- Prime Rib night for only $15. We also had a couple beers and there world famous Cpt Jacks. Everything was great Including Kenn the bartender who took great care of us. Definitely coming back. 
27923 Defiantly a 5 stars for Airport food! Probably 4 or 4.5 outside of the airport. If your at the ATL airport do yourself a favor and head over to terminal E. 
27924 Food is aaaamazing. Wings are crispy and just amazing (I always get sweet chili sauce). Burger is bomb (the avenue) .. Sweet potato tots YES. Fish tacos are ehhh okay. Service.. ehhh. It's seat yourself so it can be pretty annoying but worth it for the food! 
27925 Great place, greater people! I would definitely recommend giving it a try. Many, many healthy items to choose from. 
27926 I found Rios painting online and contracted with them because of reviews they had received. My project was patching and painting 2 bathrooms. They always started on time and the quality was fine. Due to my first experience, I will be using them for a second 
27927 This place is a great time. It helps that Microsoft rented out the whole 3rd floor for our group. The food here is great and they have a pretty good selection of beers. The pool tables are plentiful and in really good condition. Overall, I recommend checking this place out. 
27928 My favorite bakery ever. Being dairy free, I am often deprived of yummy treats, but can indulge myself at Pattycake. Their sticky buns are possibly my most favorite food. I have ordered birthday cakes and cookies and never disappointed. 
27929 We love this place! Usually a pizza Delivery wouldnt also have Amazing Indian food but this place does! We always Order here over Dominos much better pizza, taste and value! There butter chicken is amazing! The man who runs the place is super friendly ! 
27930 For me - ehhh, just two stars. In a child's eyes, four stars. Almost no wait time or line (especially with Unlimited Express). The views are pretty cool. Good intro to get your kids warmed up for a kiddie roller coaster. 
27931 Decent for lunch. The chicken can be a bit inconsistent, and doesnt always seem of the highest grade, but what can you expect for a cheap lunch? 
27932 Had take out. Good service. I enjoyed looking at the art while waiting. Food was done well andd had good taste. My wife tried sesame chicken (all white meat request) I had.general tsau duo....chicken and shrimp. Add some chicken fried.rice.and.crab wontons. Enjoyed it and will be back. 
27933 Good tea. Lots of Mochi. They don't have mini boba. Drinks can be too sweet, if you don't like too sweet just ask for less sweet. Boba is also cooked very well. Some places don't do it long enough, this place is great. 
27934 Service was wonderful, sushi was good but I was not blown away, the portion of rice to fish was not great Atmosphere and decor was good as well 
27935 Great! We had 2 entrees, an appetizer, 2 margaritas and dessert for $50! The food was great and the margaritas were strong. Our waitress was very attentive and great! 10/10 will be returning! 
27936 Amazing food and good service! If you like spicy Bloody Mary's, I recommend the scorpion Bloody Mary. Bacon omlette is amazing too 
27937 3rd visit here & I can't say enough about this place. Great food every time. This is a must eat at place in Portland. 
27938 Actually taste really good! ÈÖíÈÖø‰∏∏Â≠ê is like AWESOME! The service and decorations were great as well. Pricey but great experience overall. 
27939 Frank is a great barber and a greater guy! He does a precision cut and makes it look easy while carrying on a good conversation. 
27940 Amazing chicken teriyaki bowl and crab rangoons. Called in for pickup and it was on time and delicious. All around great experience! Would recommend 10/10 
27941 Amazingly good pizzas, tasty house cabernet, and it's right next to The Fox. 
27942 Consistently great food, friendly and efficient servers, and an awesome atmosphere! Throw in a Texas Rita and I'm a happy guy! If you're looking for consistently great chain Mexican - you won't be disappointed! 
27943 The only way it coud be better is if it was bigger. On a busy night be prepared to brush beards with fellow beer fans. The beer list is always varied and there is something for everyone from porter folks to the hop heads. 
27944 the pizza is really good but the service there is horrible! i have gone there more than once where it took more than 20 minutes just to get a menu. if you actually do get served the pizza is pretty good though! try the spicy sauce ;) 
27945 Great server. (Mandi). Food was good, minimal vegan / vegetarian options for our out of town guests but overall we'd be back. Bloody Mary's were really good. 
27946 So great to see a place this nice move to the neighborhood! We were intoxicated just watching them make cocktails! 
27947 Great pizza! I'm a huge fan. The breadsticks are pretty good too. I would recommend this place to anyone who comes to this area! 
27948 Warm and crisp and tasty. Great local spot. 
27949 This place is outstanding! Great quality food and totally customizable to your taste without that extra charge! Their lemonade and teas are great as well! 
27950 Forgettable. Great name with less flavor. The pork grinds appetizer was hard to eat. I couldn't eat half of it. The burger was normal. Nothing crazy. For $17 the hangry bison burger seems like a burger with mustard and hot sauce but nothing special. Completely unsatisfied. 
27951 If you're looking for a great efficient workout, come here! Worth every penny. Trainers are great and the workout is always a killer! 
27952 A fun and yummy option for the kids. I enjoyed the tasty flavors myself too. Thanks for bringing such a cool concept to the neighborhood. 
27953 OMG. This place is awesome. Best cinnamon roles I have ever had- both regular and gluten free. Cheese grits are amazing too and the staff is very friendly. 
27954 The small places were good 
27955 Had a nice time there for my birthday. It was also nice to see a celeb "Richard Jenkins". 
27956 Lots of cool little things at this shop! Not much jewelry nor clothes but lots of home stuff including juicers and crock pots. The staff is nice and plus I got these little ladies for only $25 
27957 When I went they were busy the food wasn't as great as everyone who recommended it to me but was good the wait for a table wasn't bad about 25 minutes I've had better but I would eat there again 
27958 Very speedy and efficient service. Mike N. was a great technician ... professional, knowledgeable and friendly. Would definitely use Metro Overhead again and would recommend them. 
27959 Tasty Persian cuisine, reasonable prices, a super friendly staff and generous (like super sized) portions. We'll be back, but next time will share a plate... The portions are that big. 
27960 If I could give noting a one star would not even be on the list. The process of retrieving your car is crazy. They are beyond far from helping even when the insurance company is on the phone telling them specifically that they can't provide that information. 
27961 What an amazing little food truck! Love their falafel plate and the white sauce brings me straight back to nyc! Owners is also so nice. Stop by, have some hummus and enjoy! 
27962 I love this place. Much better than the overrated madam mam's in my opinion. Their coconut firepot soup is awesome and i heartily recommend the pineapple fried rice. The place is small and almost always packed so plan on a wait even at lunch. 
27963 Roll over is a lot of deliciously hearty potatoes, meat and gravy. Will keep anyone satisfied from morning until early (or late) evening. Goat boy was very good as well. Biscuit bread was a-mazing- if it does not come with your order, get a side. 
27964 Never had anything I didn't like. Love love love the carne asada! One time they had KONA coconut chocolate beer. Wish they always had that on tap! 
27965 Always friendly and always good food. I like to get the fish tacos and breakfast tacos when I get gas. 
27966 Great food and helpful servers. First time at hot pot restaurant and it was a great time. 
27967 Very unique place that is targeting zero waste. Wraps, smoothies and salads are real good. Easy to bike to as well. 
27968 Baja fish tacos were great, tortilla soup was not. Service lived down to the Chronic name.... really, I'm certain they were stoned 
27969 We walked into this Gus location with trepidation that it would not be as amazing as it's Memphis location. NO worries. Delicious! Everything. Great service, pleasant atmosphere, a perfect lunch spot if you want some of the best fried chicken in the country. 
27970 Great authentic Mexican food, great value for the money, great service too. Will come again when back in Orlando. Only thing missing were the Margaritas ;-) 
27971 I didn't have any issues mentioned by some other reviewers. The people I spoke to were great, and happy to help. Prices were cheap, and I have no complaints! If I ever need to make another costume, I'll definitely return. 
27972 Excellent spot for any quick service. I got in the same day for a color touch up shampoo blow dry flat iron and waxing reasonable prices. Left loving my hair and feeling beautiful 
27973 Very few places make Laksa let along a good Laksa. Perfectly balanced with a good kick of spice. Thrilled to have found this spot and will be back to try a few other items on the menu. 
27974 I bought my fianc√©es engagement ring here back in February and proposed in April. The amount of compliments she is still receiving on the ring is incredible. Kevin was extremely helpful, informative and courteous. I cannot say enough good things and am excited to go back for our wedding bands. 
27975 This is by far the greatest brewery tour in the country. Jenny gave an awesome tour this afternoon. 
27976 Not too bad for a tourist spot although very expensive! Their gyros are ok but at bit skimpy on the meat. They also use rice in their Greek lemon soup when orzo is the standard. 
27977 Perfect food. Impeccable service. Loved the banter at the sushi bar. Come early for social hour prices 
27978 Anthony David Salon is the full salon experience - the ambiance, the wine, the high-quality products they use. I have been seeing Brianna for a year and she's AWESOME! She's very nice and makes certain you leave loving your new doo. 
27979 Promove is the bomb! Richard was very informative and extremely nice. I would definitely use them again!!!!! 
27980 They have pie and great coffee what more would a person need. The employees are friendly too. Not pretentious at all. Great place to take kids. 
27981 What a great burrito! The staff were very professional, they took great pride in the preperation of the food, and the restaurant was very clean. We will be back again very soon for more burritos. 
27982 Delicious meal! We had the chicken sandwich and ordered a side of mac n cheese...yum! 
27983 They changed their name to FD. Nikki was my server-bartender 
27984 Great service and keeps her area clean. Would ask for her next time 
27985 Had the chicken tenders and grilled shrimp. The salad had nuts and a delicious dressing. Loaded bake potato. 
27986 Still a fan of this expensive specialty food store! We had more great plain croissants, carrot apple muffins, and raisin scones. The muffins and scones definitely have a lot of sugar in them! Not cheap, but fun to look around and try specialty food. 
27987 They did a good job but needed to come back and finish one final detail....have not heard back. I expected better. 
27988 Fun dive bar. It's a good spot to by when in the area for a few coronas or to pregame. 
27989 Incredible all around. Service, food, wait time. House pickles! And holeman + finch bun! Open now Thursday - Saturday evenings until 9:00 
27990 We tried two different steam pots and shared them. The food was delicious and the drinks were good. The only issue was the price. For a middle of the road restaurant it was very expensive, about 80 bucks for two people. 
27991 I go here because its near by but they way way overcharge for beer. $9 bucks for a six pack of Tsingtao or Peroni...come on! Their wine selection is decent though and the staff is very friendly. I heart them for being open on Sundays. 
27992 10.50 for a sandwich the size of the palm of my hand. No fucking thank you! Bunk sandwiches, get over yourself! 
27993 Been coming here for a while now even though Aric left, but I love Amber! When I say thank you she says "My Pleasure" she's so sweet! Hot lemon Yaki wings are literally the best! I really love the boneless wings too! 
27994 Authentic flavours and rate. Unique creativity with presentation. Generous amount for moderate ($$) pricing. Environment is cozy, not elaborate. 
27995 Very cozy and comfortable place to hang at. People are friendly and they fix the coffee like you want it. Great place for a quick cup of coffee. 
27996 Great fresh food! The inside was well kept and clean with authentic Greek music in the background! 
27997 This place is open until 2am!!! Food is always good and the place is always busy. The service is good almost all the time but can be slow on weekends. Our usual, pad thai, chicken curry with noodles, crab rangoon, thai wings, orange chicken and fried rice. Yum yum! 
27998 This is a great place! Run as fast as you can away from the Marriott Showcase across the street and come here. They have great friendly bartender's and better selection of drinks at lower prices.... Marriott Showcase is prensious and has poor service. 
27999 One of my favorite Thai places in the area! Dishes are delicious and portions are large. This is the best Pad Thai around, Yellow River Noodles was great, too. 
28000 Panda Express is great Asian food great proportions clean restaurant I like the orange chicken dish 
28001 Oink oink Snarffle lemon oink poppy seed is oink oink perfection Oink oink I could eat all of them nom nom oink 
28002 Love this place! The new location is great! I think the services provided are outstanding and recommend this to anyone looking for professional threading and/or waxing. 
28003 If only this place was cheaper, I would give it a better rating. It was actually pretty good for airport food. Crispy sausages, but the portions were too small. 
28004 Loud!!! Service is usually below par but I guess that's to be expected at a sports bar. Food is no surprise either... For a bar. 
28005 Good food and quick service.. Very cool, authentic atmosphere. 
28006 I loved the result of my massage. I went during my two last weeks of pregnancy seeking relaxation. A well deserved "treat" after 9 months of changes in my body, mind and spirit and before the final act: labor! 
28007 I grew up in Houston around really good Vietnamese & chinese food. These guys are always consistent. They're always busy too. 
28008 I have to explain firstly I Didn't use the service of the company. However I requested a quote on line and the owner wasted no time replying. I appreciate that type of attention and pointed response. 
28009 Absolutely an hour of heaven! The ambiance of the room and the comfiest chair with the hot tea & butter cookie all add to the experience. This was my first time having foot reflexology and it was SO RELAXING. This will definitely become a weekly event:-) 
28010 Holy cow. The most delicious breakfast I have ever had. Tried the special Harvest Hash: two eggs over easy covered in hollandaise on top of sweet potatoes, sausage, zucchini, mushrooms. Do your taste buds a favor and order this. Can you guys open a location in Philly? 
28011 They have always been wonderful with my slightly odd special needs dog. Very friendly and helpful. Prices seem fair. 
28012 The server literally asked us to leave after we paid because she said there's many people waiting in line. We still have some drinks left, I found the server to be extremely unprofessional. 
28013 You cannot go wrong with this place for your wedding. All of my flowers were absolutely beautiful and when I tell people how much I paid they literally can't believe that I got such a good price. 
28014 So glad I got a last minute reservation here. We did have a slight wait, but not too extreme. It was worth it. Wonderful staff, good drinks and yummy food. My seared Ahi tuna was slightly over-seasoned, but that's my only complaint. Another neat find in the Disney parks! 
28015 The "Soup Natzi" Lives. Except Ralf is a really nice guy. I love the MULLIGATAWNY! The Caribbean Sunshine is bound to spice up your life. 
28016 My friend and I stopped by JuJu after a wonderful yoga class, I had the Sex Panther Smoothie (minus the coffee) but it was wonderful as was my friends Pillow smoothie! 
28017 Great place has a very good happy hour, efficient and friendly staff food is very well presented and very tasteful wonderful ambience great view of the lake 
28018 Cute place, friendly staff and good food. We have only been once, but would go back again. Tuesday is half price on bottles of wine night ;). I like that 
28019 Hands down the worst gyro I've ever had. I took three bites which was two bites too many and threw the rest away. Get yourself a frozen gyro from the grocery store and you'll be much happier. 
28020 Disney Springs is certainly a massive improvement from its earlier form. Shopping, food, bars, food trucks and entertainment all in one place. 
28021 yes, it is really, as good as it gets. 
28022 This place needs an upgrade bad! No space and the employees are very slow. Took 45 minutes for the drive through with two cars in front of me. It's just ridiculous since this is the most convenient location but it's just a horrible one. 
28023 I'm giving this review 5 stars because the food was great. The service on the other hand not so much, but I would definitely go back and give it another go just because the food and the restaurant it self were right up my alley. 
28024 Awesome food and you can really see the authentic quality of the cooking. Not like other places run by Mexicans who know nothing about the subtle flavours involved with Vietnamese food. The staff is Vietnamese and know how to treat you right. 
28025 The reviews on this cafe are all over the place. I find it to be so-so and therefore I rarely go there. The staff are usually friendly and efficient. The food is reasonably good but the biscuits are disappointintg. 
28026 My employer put me up here for a month. Excellent property! Hotel staff is friendly and professional. Rooms are large and clean. A large fridge was provided due to my long stay. Hotel is away from the main highway. Nice and quiet! 
28027 Great little place and nice atmosphere. Calzone was very good and marinara sauce has great flavor. 
28028 + Lollipop chicken + Cute design of the cart + Super friendly owner/chef - I guess they run out of food so we didn't get a chance to try the garlic noodles - limited items on the menu but what's there is good 
28029 They don't have that many exciting brands but I do love how there is a Pinkberry! It's connected to other malls so it's more of a passing-by place for me most of the times. 
28030 Slow, slow,slow. Sometimes you get a fast crew. Sometimes you don't. This Sunday night we have the slow crew working. Hope the food is good as usual. 
28031 We tried out the happy hour. They had a decent variety of inexpensive plates. The pasta was tasty and the mussels were good. Drinks were tasty as well. Nothing blew my socks off but definitely worth it for a cheaper date. 
28032 Great brunch. Calming view of the lake. Plenty of free parking. Has a nice deck for outdoor eating / boozing. I would also recommend for business lunches and happy hour events. 
28033 Awesome food, beer, and the Haitian Rum Cider was the perfect top off! Great waitstaff! 
28034 I got the "publish your own" pizza which is such a great option! They have ample amounts of options for sauces, cheeses, meats, and veggies. The crust is very very crispy- so if you're a thin crust fan this is the place for you! 
28035 This place is just great! My wife and I ate here on Thursday night (4/11/2013) and then back Friday for lunch. Wonderful sandwiches and good friendly service. 
28036 I checked out Mike's Comics it was definitely a good recommendation by one of my other collector friends their prices are pretty fair and they have a large inventory of stuff I definitely rate it in my top 3 of local comic/toy places 
28037 Surprisingly this place is quite vegetarian-friendly. If you are one, don't hesitate to go here with your carnivore friends: you can get an awesome meal combine from sides: mac'n'cheese, potato salad, sweet corn salad and green beans. Friendly employees, family atmosphere. 
28038 Food is okay. Hit or miss. Lines are always long. Servers are quite stingy and unfriendly. 
28039 Very nice hotel. Staff was friendly, the bed was beyond comfy, and the breakfast wasn't too bad. The room was laid out a little weird. You open the door, and you can practically hit the bed with the door. Not sure if every room is like that. 
28040 The 3 o'clock tour guide today was great. Knowledgable. Loved tasting the ingredients. Super cool. Love, the gang from Houston 
28041 Great quick service despite the fact that every table was full, some with large groups. Huge portions, so be prepared to eat! Really good food, good coffee. Hash browns are really crispy on top, just the way I like them. 
28042 Love their cream cheese frosting. Cappuccino, yum. Great staff too! Had the luck of having the friendly girl with the half shaved look. 
28043 I love this place, food is always delicious and your in and out as fast as you need to be. Service is always very friendly. Just a great place to stop in and have a quick meal. 
28044 Worst apple fritter ever. The other donuts are alright, but the fritter is a complete failure. Only apple in it was skin. Not a hint of hard cider. 
28045 It's good when you dont want to go far for thai but not good compared to most thai food. the soups are quite bad actually. The pad thai is good. The pad see ew is so-so. The mango+sticky rice is pretty bland. 
28046 Fantastic food. Came here visiting from Sacramento and was not disappointed. Had Dal tadka, Mattar paneer, paneer kabab, and biryani. Awesome food, would love to come again! 
28047 My families go to for breakfast and Brunch. Best breakfast spot in Lynn! Fast service, excellent waiters, and huge (good) portions. Try the Andy's special omelette! 
28048 Great scenery. Liked the beer. The food is more like bar food, which was fine. I probably would give it 5 stars had the food been on point for us! 
28049 Great venue. Much like the House of Blues (used to be one). 
28050 This spot is truly the place go.... AWESOME and a must go.... Should be on triple D ( Dinners, Diners & Drive Ins) 
28051 My wife and I went in, were ignored by the staff and stared at by the 3 of a total 5 tables, noticed the donuts looked like they were 5 days old, and finally left without being spoken to. A strange experience. I do not recommend this place. 
28052 Delicious food and great atmosphere! This place is an absolute must for anyone visiting Portland. 
28053 the food is ok, hugh portion of food go to waste because we cannot finish it. i ordered calamari and it's good. i forgot what other's ppl orders it's for bf sis or bro b-day. anyway i am not impress at all. 
28054 The view is great. You must try the s'mores cheesecake - it's genius. Such a delicious brunch. 
28055 Kylie Greene is a phenomenal artist 
28056 The shop was comfortable , Couldn't recommend a better place to get a tattoo. 
28057 A truly excellent cleaner who takes great care with your clothes. Their staff is always helpful, and never failed to come through when I needed fast turn around. 
28058 Hana is a favorite lunch destination of my entire workplace! The sushi is very consistent and always fresh. It is a hidden gem! 
28059 I spent 20 minutes calling them so I could place an order. Nobody answered. Finally I gave up! Done with them 
28060 Slow shuttle to off site facility. Weak customer service once you get there. Will book with an on airport site major next time. 
28061 This is a great port to sail into and out of. There is easy access to public transit to the airport, and the location is near many great hotels and restaurants. It is a safe and clean port that we enjoy visiting. 
28062 Bought a laptop cart. By the time I assembled it together, I found out that a corner was chipped. Obviously, I would not want to return the product, since I spent an hour to put that together. It may not be the branch fault, of course. 
28063 Delicious fried fish tacos for CHEAP! Also, ridiculous variety of good salsas to choose from at the salsa bar. I've only ever taken the food to go, but there's plenty of seating in the restaurant. 
28064 A solid 4 stars. Pros: Happy hour menu was awesome and everything was good quality. (Contrary to the outside appearance, this isn't actually dive nor greasy spoon.) The special cocktails were awesome. Cons: Space is limited and so is parking during busy hours. Food could have been more flavorful. 
28065 It is new location in Richmond. I wanted to try since it open. My son asked me to dinner and asked where i would like to go. So i choose ginger indian restaurant and was not disappointed. The service is great and food is delicious. We will be back. 
28066 Really good Chinese restaurant. I can't speak for the Thai food, but the Chinese entrees I have had are all great. It's a bit pricier than your average Chinese joint but it's totally worth it. 
28067 Nice store decor and selection that are not so run-of-the-mill type. It's a great addition to the Coolidge Corner main street, other than banks and cafes. I'll go back again for more gifts. 
28068 This is a great bike shop. They know their stuff and no pretension. Thanks for the help Brad! 
28069 Very good food for a decent price. Although the portions are small. I would really recommend the spicy beef noodles! 
28070 Good macaroons, but it's a bit on the stale side. I don't think it was made fresh that day...maybe a day or two old. Variety was okay...about 10 flavors..... on the pricier side. It was good to try out since it's so raved about....but I don't think I'll be back. 
28071 Bloody incredible! Fresh noodles, hand pulled, a little firm to the bite - perfect. I had the beef which was very tender but still held its form. Great stuff. 
28072 Atmosphere of this place is part of what makes it great! The food was reasonable in price and tasty. I loved the pork belly taco and the grilled corn. Was not a fan of valet parking only unless you can find a spot on the street. 
28073 Tasty Rib Eye and New York Steaks, cooked to perfection. Great service! Plan on going there again. 
28074 Would I drive hours for this pizza? Probably not. But if you are in the area- get it. It is not earth shattering, but just a very good pizza. Good sauce, great cheese and a nice crust. That's it. A place that does one thing very very well. 
28075 Super fun place! Large covered and heated patio area. Staff was so nice and accommodating. 
28076 The Lobster Mac n Cheese is DELICIOUS!!! They give you an entire fried lobster tail with home made cheesy Mac n cheese!! the chicken n waffles is also a favorite of mine!! The food is the best on the block!! 
28077 Good. I orders the ghost burger with sweet potato fries. The burger is good, strong flavor and a little spicy. But it was a little bit salty for me. 
28078 Great experience with parking at the Fairfield Inn & Suites in Downtown Atlanta. Easy drop off, easy pick up and helpful staff. 
28079 Great atmosphere, good comfort food. Genuine old world ambiance. Delicious chowder yelp and lobster mac & cheese. Friendly stuff with a great buzz of happy diners. Phone neighborhood and definitely worth a visit. Historic building and great history. Buzzing bar too 
28080 I had high expectations of this place but maybe we just didn't try the right drink. We picked the ones that said popular on the drinks. But we felt like we were drinking flavored water. Maybe it'll get better in the future but for now, it sucks. 
28081 Very good food, service has been mixed depending on your waitress. I hope everyone in Salem give this restaurant your business, you won't leave unhappy. 
28082 THE BEST COFFEE IN TOWN!!! I love me some Barista!! It is very smooth, creamy & delicious. Customer service is always amazing. 
28083 Nice greasy burger with good fries...bring a jacket, they don't believe in heating the place but once you warm up, it's a great dive place to enjoy a fairly cheap but big burger... 
28084 Now, featuring Moroccan Nights every Thursday. You have a $39 Prix Fixe Moroccan Menu (appetizers, soup, main entree and dessert included) and also the everyday a la carte French menu. Also, Moroccan live music and a Belly dance entertainment. Everything was excellent! 
28085 Woohoo! As good as it gets! I can eat here everyday. Creative food, good prices, friendly staff, and fun atmosphere. Amazing poutine and they probably serve the best burgers on the North Shore. 
28086 If I could give zero stars, I would have. Only use TWC if you want to pay top dollar for frequent service outages and extremely poor customer service. 
28087 Garrett and Ari were amazing with all the children and adults at our event. For three full hours they engaged the children and answered questions about the animals. Thank you! 
28088 I drank the CorePower Kool-Aid! I absolutely love this place. Clean, consistently good teachers, great class schedule. I especially love Claudia's Friday 5:30 C2, but you will enjoy any class here. I will definitely keep coming back - it's worth it! 
28089 I love you, Belmont nails! Cheap, professional, fast. Their pedicures last 3 weeks! I love them! 
28090 I took my mom for her 89th Birthday the food was good the server Tale made my mom's Birthday and was very friendly and gave great service. That's the Red Lobster I remember. 
28091 Great beer selection and good food at a reasonable price. The "dirty fries" are where it's at! Fries with au jus, roast beef and all sorts of goodies on it. Yeah, that's the stuff! 
28092 Noah led a great tour, but i was a little disappointed to only get to sample three beers. 
28093 This is some of the best thai food I've had. I had the pad see ew with beef. We will definitely be back. 
28094 I went there last night with my wife. I like the decoration. But, the quality of wonton soup with noodle, terrible, it does not taste like chinese traditional wonton. Not sure that it is a Japanese style of wonton. The price is average, once is enough for me. 
28095 These bagels are delicious and filling! I went simple with a sesame seed bagel and smoked salmon cream cheese but it was still incredibly flavorful and satisfying. They have some big, crazy sandwiches with meat and egg that looks great as well. 
28096 Some of the best fried chicken I've had. The cold potatoes were really complementing the spiciness of the chicken but the greens left something to be desired. If ask for a sub but if you don't it's not the end of the world 
28097 Wide variety of food, relatively inexpensive, good portion size, and great service. 
28098 Same business name same products different location and different customer service from Saugus location 
28099 People at Burlington are really cool and helpful never seen any unpleasant act not like Saugus people 
28100 The people that run this business are great, very experienced and knowledgeable. The quoted a 2-3 day turn time for my blind repair and had it ready to go the next day! 
28101 The food was awesome! Had the turkey tips with rice pilaf and caesar salad. Everything was freshly made and our waitress Paula gave us exceptional service. Nice local place to grab drinks and a bite to eat after work. 
28102 The breakfast is good & so are the smoothies but I've been there twice at 8 am & he hasn't been open. Maybe he needs some help or should change his hours. 
28103 This by far the best car wash I have ever been to! My car is awesomely clean and I love the little air freshener they give you for the inside. Friendly and fun staff! Loved it so much last night that I brought a different car today! 
28104 Had a lovely, delicious special meal last pm here. Lovely wine, appe and entree selections and then came 2 great baked desserts! Lovely attentive service, beautiful environment, great location. 
28105 This place is incredible. We are from Dallas and needed a good place to eat. Found this place on Yelp. What a find! Save room for the Orange creme brulee. We have a new Orleans restaurant and it shows nit hold a candle to this place. Highly recommended. 
28106 Went to the bar last night. Extremely overpriced for the level of service you get. Had to wait 20 minutes at the bar for a drink. I expected better 
28107 This is basically a place to sit in the dark on the floor and chill with your friends. I would suggest going with a group. The drinks are very good, but don't drink too much or you'll fall asleep! 
28108 Justin showed up early to do 2 of my cars, they did a great job and I will us them from now on! Highly recommend them. 
28109 Not nearly as much of a dive as I anticipated! It's old, but clean. Not like any other place I have been in a while. 
28110 Cool environment right on the water and nice and open so get a good breeze. The food was solid but expensive. Seems a bit overpriced for the laid back feel of the place. But overall a solid eat if you don't mind spending a little more. 
28111 So much awesome in a single place! Great food, great drinks, and great games! Come a few, come plenty, but to all a good time will be had! 
28112 This is how a company is supposed to be run, pure and simple. Very professional. Also want to shout out to my main man Sal for making my tile brand new again. 
28113 This place is great. The burgers are fan-freaking-tastic. I've had a number of their burgers and have enjoyed them all. Likewise, the dinning space is great. The ordering area can get ridiculously hot though, so hope you don't get a table right there. 
28114 The ramen is great. Really enjoyed the homemade noodles. The rest of the menu, atmosphere and service was spot on. Definitely will be back! 
28115 Very helpful, friendly staff. I'm quite the beginner sewer, and they were patient and nice with me-- not at all intimidating! Nice selection of cotton prints, though not as big as what I remember at the Joanne's back at home. 
28116 Pretty authentic izakaya joint. My Japanese friends took me here so I had high expectations. Prices were reasonable and service was great. I recommend all of the yakitori dishes. 
28117 This has been the best pizza place in the area for years and will remain so for years to come, fresh toppings, delivery is ok, friendly staff , You can't go wrong! I love the chicken parm. 
28118 A small gem located near the intersection of Cambie and Broadway. My favourite Katsu-Don! 
28119 Excellent burgers! The service was so good! I will be a frequent visitor! Lunch with cheeseburger that taste homemade and fries 5.99! What a deal! 
28120 went here once - reminded me of bars from college in central PA. i'm over 21, thankfully i don't need to sit in loud, crowded places that reek of stale beer anymore. if that's your scene though, its not a bad place. 
28121 Exceptional service, fantastic food, comfortable interior, and a great value! We went on a weekday night for dinner with another couple and were very pleased with everything. Our favorites were the brisket empanadas, grilled octopus, and ceviche. Tapas style is definitely the way to go. 
28122 My father had a flood this morning in his home. They were out right away. They were very kind, helpful and respectful to us and all my dads belongings. My father was very upset and they were so helpful, Cant say thank you enough for all they did! Very impressed! 
28123 My happy place. 40 something beers rotating on draught. Best friend chicken in Boston - and what's more, these guys improved on Ranch dressing. Amazing! 
28124 Again this is my new go to place for entertainment! Watched Atomic Blonde! I can't get enough of the spicy tuna on crispy rice! No other movie theater gives me the bang for my buck like this place does! 
28125 Went for brunch. Be prepared to wait! I had a delicious omelet and everyone else in the party was very satisfied with their meals. Overall, I can see myself going again if I'm looking to go for a nice meal and spend a bit more on brunch. 
28126 I have ordered flowers online several times. They are delivered on-time and are beautiful. The prices are reasonable compared to the large flower conglomerates and I know who I am working with locally. That is everything I need - no need for me to go anywhere else! 
28127 I did not like my food and my waitress exchange it for something else she was very nice. The pancakes are always good here. The country fried steak was not good it was greasy, too much bread and cold. Stephani was a very nice waitress 
28128 You must try the Smoked Gouda Queso! All the small plates we ordered were amazing! House Margarita was spot on! 
28129 Anyone that gives this place a negative review is cray! Amazing burgers and fries, super affordable. I will warn you if you're a large family or group of people there is only a few seats against the wall. 
28130 The highlight for me is the sweet potato wrap - they grill it up with delicious sauce and it makes a great vegetarian lunch. Pastries are great too especially coconut cookie. Cant comment on coffee since im not a coffee drinker. 
28131 I ordered a little bit of everything and split it with my girlfriend and the got the Burlington loaded fries. Would do it again. 
28132 I paid 5$ for a cup of tea, and can't get more hot water without paying another 5$?? And no, I'm not spending the day here studying. I'm here on a Friday night drinking tea with a friend and looking at a book. IT'S WATER. 
28133 Their food was quiet good. I went there when it's almost last call. Nobody welcomed us when I came in and their service was bad. 
28134 Parking is difficult - but I love the General Tsoas Chicken here. Meaty, full of flavor, tangy, not 'chemically' large portion. I don't remember the types of sushi rolls we ordered, but it was all very tasty. I'd skip the spring rolls next time. 
28135 Gotta get those beef ribs. A bit pricey but worth the cash. Clear your schedule before eating here, because you will only want to sleep after eating. Nothing productive will get done. 
28136 One of the tastiest hotdogs ever had. The quality of their hotdog is outstanding plus some amazing toppings just make it incredible! I always love crazy hot dog combinations and they definitely lived up to it! Oh and it's a big thick hotdog so one was plenty for me! 
28137 Not too pricy but seafood was not fresh. Used a lot of spice to cover it. The shrimp for example, was soft and lost its bounciness. The crawfish waa not treated clean. Strongly not to recommend to others. 
28138 I have always been a fan of Zoe's Kitchen and this one definitely did not disappoint. Great and friendly staff. The food was excellent. 
28139 This place reminded me of a Cheesecake Factory with some margaritas. Wasn't digging it at all. Best Singles Scene is a total joke. Long wait time was not worth it. 
28140 Delicious steak tips.Recently renovated. The food was great.Goat salad was also amazing. Great service ,cheap eats and drinks. 
28141 Great sushi! My wife and I also got soup and edamame; everything exceeded expectations. 
28142 Yes, yes yes - everything here is great. It's a great breaks at spot to go with a friend and share two things since their menu is so delicious. Fantastic coffee. And if you're a pastry person - lots of options. 
28143 This is one of new favorite burger places in Atlanta! Burger was good as well as fries. Great service and atmosphere would recommend coming 
28144 Service sucks, but at 3am all I want to do is stuff a rice ball in my mouth. That's really all this place is good for, you'd be crazy to eat here over any other restaurant in the North End during normal hours. 
28145 Arty low-key brightly painted caf√© reminiscent of an artists' studio hidden away in West Newton. Somewhat uncomfortable glass top tables, decent selection of treats and lite lunch. 
28146 Amazing Fantastic Perfection Excellent Show Stopper Brilliance Original One Of A Kind Every experience I've had here has been positive and definitely worth the price this place has become part of my own UT tradition 
28147 I love this place. Everyone is friendly, and I've had nothing but excellent service. Lynn is an accurate perfectionist. Ann and the others have done my pedis, manis and gels. Thank you! 
28148 I'm Turkish, my grandfather is from North Cyprus and lived in ƒ∞stanbul. Very good Turkish food, just like in Turkey. T√ºrk'√ºm, dedem Kuzey Kƒ±brƒ±slƒ± ve ƒ∞stanbul'da ya≈üadƒ±. √áok iyi T√ºrk yemeƒüi, aynƒ± sadece T√ºrkiye'de olduƒüu gibi. 
28149 I tried the mocha and was disappointed that it had a sharp after taste. It reminded me of a tabasco aftertaste. My sister got the hot chocolate and she said that it was really good. 
28150 I emailed Beckie as she requested on 5/15 as she requested to try to resolve my bad experience and as of today August 4, she has not emailed me back. I will not ever visit this place again. 
28151 It's okay. $13 for Chinese food should get me more food than I got. The beef and broccoli isn't bad, but it could use some more flavor, and I usually expect more food for $13 for Chinese. 
28152 Love this place! It's just loud enough that if my five year is acting like a five year old, it doesn't effect anyone's dinner, but not so loud that it's unpleasant. EXCELLENT enchiladas, great beer selections, friendly staff. Our family loves this spot! 
28153 Beautiful location. Wait staff is sweet but lots and lots of mistakes. Worst Mondo Margarita ever! Mediocre food. Not impressed. 
28154 So good! The meats were so tender and flavorful. Will be coming back for sure. Service was good and fast. 
28155 Excellent food, quick service and friendly staff. They do not have your typical seafood menu, which is a nice change. Clam chowder has a delish twist! Will definitely come back and recommend to others 
28156 My food had bug, I send it back and the bug was removed and plate was brought back to me and was told it was burned rice. I am a Mexican, who has been cooking rice for over 30 years, I know what burn rice looks like..please don't BS me. 
28157 Couldn't have asked for a better breakfast!! The food was amazing and inexpensive! My new go to breakfast spot when I'm in Boston. Loved this place!!! 
28158 I typically dislike fajitas bit when I saw the picture on the help review I had to get them. And I was glad that I did best one/ only one I have ever had. This place is a hole in the wall that is worth stopping in for. 
28159 I had the fish tacos and they were ok the price was cheap. I went here after I read the reviews and I expected more but I'm give it another shot and try some other stuff one the menu. 
28160 Very cozy place, prices are decent, food is good quality. I was just visiting Portland for a few days, but this was a favorite place for a friend of mine, and I can see why! 
28161 Amazing fish and chips! Everything was done perfectly, I was very surprised with the crab cake! Can't wait to go back! 
28162 Very good food, the crispy almond chicken is amazing. They have farm to table local veggies. This location consistently makes really good dishes. I have to say I like this location better than the Guadeloupe store. 
28163 Brunch was amazing.. Seated right away.. My order came out less then 12mins. Friendly family atmosphere. 
28164 Great experience. Staff was extremely friendly and professional. Will use them exclusively for my dry cleaning needs. 
28165 We've ordered twice in about a month. Both times they got our orders wrong. Yesterday's order was not only wrong but it took 1 hr 5 min and we're less than 5 min away. Not ordering from there again. 
28166 This place is amazing! Pineapple upside pancakes! Friendly staff, very clean, casual. Busy on a Tuesday morning so I can't imagine a weekend! Mimosas worth any flavor juice yippy can imagine. Easy parking. 
28167 Had a wonderful time with a friend. Great food and great service. Had the grilled chicken kabobs, soup, and salad. Everything was fine. Try it. Sweet place. 
28168 Been to so many Great Clips locations, by far this is the worst of its kind. The staff have no courtesy to listen to what the customer actually wants. All they care about is rush through your session. Sorry to say but you have definitely lost 1 customer. 
28169 Went to this place on a cold rainy night for the first time. I absolutely love it! If you're a fan of strong coffee, I highly recommend a Cortado. Amazing!!! The atmosphere is very welcoming. 
28170 I usually come to BWW on Tuesday and Thursday for their cheap bone and boneless wing days. To double up, go after 9 to enjoy a nice happy our as well. TVs and food! 
28171 diagnosed colon/rectal cancer as hemmeroids!!!! I have had to have major surgery and now wear a bag....they need to pull her license to practice. 
28172 Maybe I'm just partial to a melt in your mouth crispy cream. The OG was good but we took one bite of the sugar donut and didn't finish it. Disappointing for the price. 
28173 Nice, cozy pub. Excellent drinks and a solid beer menu, including plenty of craft options. Didn't try the food, but the ambiance and service were great. It was a great spot to hit for some beverages after dinner at Ponce City Market across the street. 
28174 Wonderful - fresh and delicious produce and great value (love that they offer discounts for standing/weekly orders). So nice to know one is eating organic without breaking the bank. Wonderful customer service and environmentally-friendly packaging as well. 
28175 The donuts may be good and unique but they don't really care about giving you good service or think about how to make it easier for the costumer to order to make the line go faster. 
28176 Best Shoe Repair in town! They also sell great new and used shoes! 
28177 Good coffee. Relaxing atmosphere soft music plants lots of plants indoor seating w pleasant views outdoor seating as well 
28178 As a Cantonese, I have to say their food is very authentic. The staff were super nice. It was an experience full of love. 
28179 Really not worth the price. I was charged 300$ for my roots to get done. She suggested I do two tones. It turned out very brassy on top and and didn't match the rest of my hair. Way too much money for a color I didn't like at all. 
28180 Delicious tacos and friendly staff! They have a fun variety of choices, although it is a bit pricy per taco. There is a good amount of outdoor seating with umbrellas. Our kids enjoyed playing the table games while we waited. We will definitely be back! 
28181 I love this place, and my family and I eat here at least once a week. The refried beans are very good and are vegetarian. They don't mind if you special order, and the servers are all friendly and attentive. I think it's very good food and excellent service! 
28182 Oh good god. Oh my. Oh. Had the delicious special Lobster Benedict, and it was heaven. Awesome habanero bloody. Great service. Can't wait to return! 
28183 worth a try when in Vancover BC. neighborhood is not one to be in after dark. for lunch it was an ok walk. food very good and enjoyable 
28184 We were underwhelmed with both the food and the service. We both remember the food being much better at other locations in the past. My burger seemed to just be tossed together without much care, and the fries and onion rings were too greasy to finish. 
28185 Wouldn't recommend this place to anybody. The manager James is a very rude individual and doesn't seem to care about his customers. Maybe the same for his employees as well. 
28186 All the fuss is real people. This place rocks! The food is fresh, the choices are endless and the salads are pretty good. The concept is cool and I really like how fast the food comes out. Pro-tip: the smores cookies are IT! 
28187 Always friendly and they have the best home fries. Try their special. Their beef on weck reminds me of home. Their soup is always good. If you like pancakes they have an excellent recipe. The best part is that everyone treats you like family. 
28188 Summer shack always provides a stable quality bake and fresh. Definitely drop the tastes of oysters in this season but still well maintained. 
28189 The Tobias Harris is by far the most delicious smoothie I've ever had in my entire life. Cool artsy atmosphere and good music to match !!! 
28190 decent enchiladas, not too bright inside, music vibe is always hyper mellow. service is good but not great.. a good go to place for happy hour. 
28191 Snug is a fitting name, given that this place doesn't seat too many people, and it is quite cozy. The food here is excellent, and there are often good drink specials. There is also live music, at times, and the place gets very lively. Good service, too. 
28192 Great patio area for enjoying tacos and other Tex-Mex selections. Spicy shrimp taco was especially delicious. 
28193 It's surprising to me that there can be a Hunan Chinese restaurant that's so authentic! Special recommendation: steamed frog with chili pepper, while fish with chili miso sauce 
28194 Delicious burgers! I got the Voodoo mushroom burger on a wheat bun with a side salad. The burger was cooked perfectly and the Tabasco mayo was delish! The greens for the salad were also nice and fresh. Will definitely visit again! 
28195 Curra's is one of my fav hangover cures. Delicious migas, huevos rancheros, carne guisada in amazingly large portions. And the oaxacan coffee is an instant pick me up. Although I haven't had the greatest success service wise I will stand it all for Mexican goodness! 
28196 Been working with Otter Creative Studio for years. Great service, affordable, easy to work with, very effective SEO. Love the websites they built for my companies. 
28197 Great environment! From out of town my brother, cousin and I felt very at home... great vibe and Erica the host is exceptional! 
28198 Visited for the first time tonight and truly loved the food. Tried two different sliders and the loaded fries... Amazing! The staff was also both engaging and helpful. My family will definitely be back. 
28199 Good and smooth ice cream. Price is pretty good for what you get also. Was visiting the area and glad we made this a late night stop. 
28200 Dinners were fabulous. I had the ribs and the mahi mahi was excellent as well. Bartender could use some coaching on the margarita receipe and the portion was small as well. Will not only go back but will highly recommend to friends and family! 
28201 Never been to Vancouver before and this place just made my day. The food was great. The service was great and the view was amazing. Would recommend for sure. 
28202 Only If I can give it a 0 star. Worst delivery I've ever experience, my apartment was literally 10mins away from the store and it took them 50mins to deliver a single cold pizza. 
28203 Has a full Irish breakfast -- terrific. Excellent service, and great atmosphere. 
28204 Good breakfast burritos and fast service. The taste was good and I really enjoyed eggs with beef. 
28205 LOVE LOVE LOVE the atmosphere...really funky! They were out of the french onion soup, but I found a great substitute. Awesome drinks and really good poutine! 
28206 not only do they have amazing oysters and great cider but i left my phone here and thought it was at home for over 4 hours and these amazing people took care of it for me! 
28207 The fried fish was really good. Love the po boys. I went with a group of friends and it was nice to try a large selection of beer. I had some really unique beers that I would never want again, but it was still a fun experience. 
28208 This store is not too bad. The prices are rising as mentioned by others. The store is clean and well kept as Best as it could considering the amount of business. The staff were friendly and helped load up the purchased items. 
28209 The donuts were really stale. If they weren't I'd imagine it would be a lot better. I'll give it another chance or two but if they're stale again I'll probably just stick with dunkin or some other place where I know they're gonna taste fresh. 
28210 I was charged $65 in tolls after being told at checkin that tolls would be included in the rental price. Not breaking the bank, but misleading to customers. 
28211 I have been coming to Perfection Nails Now for almost 3 years. I absolutely love the customer service I receive. The staff is always so friendly Phil has been doing my nails is absolutely wonderful. 
28212 The service was good and so were the drinks! The food was ok 
28213 Not very much flavor but we ate everything. It's Tex mex so it's ok I guess but could have been better. 
28214 Friendly staff, flexible hours and great assistance. Especially grateful that Trevor followed my progress actively, went out of his way to come out on days he normally does not and also referred other alternatives to me. Thanks much for your help! 
28215 Just arrived with my family and decided to go to the.hibachi side this time let's see how this goes!! Well from start to finish the dinner was excellent the chef was entertaining and fun. A great family experience with good quality food highly recommended! 
28216 Vegetarian options were few......and tasted terrible. However our friends who are the chicken seemed satisfied. Nothing to write home about- very friendly service. 
28217 Great Fried chicken but service is poor and tables are too small. The side dishes are just okay. 
28218 Good for drinks at night, and for a quick business lunch during the day.Nothing's mind blowing here but their steak tips or salads usually do the trick. 
28219 Excellent Mexican food and great margaritas. I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. The restaurant has a large menu with both traditional and non traditional Mexican items. Prices are fairly reasonable with the average dish being $10-$14! 
28220 Only thing good about this place was that they got my food delivered fast. It wasn't correct. Also the Italian beef was not at all what you expect. Just a couple strips of beef and some under cooked peppers. Ill never go there again. 
28221 Food was excellent. Lovely combinations flavors and textures. Excellent mushroom tempura. Homemade tofu is excellent. What limits the stars is the service. Pretty terrible actually. Too bad as the food is amazing 
28222 Boloco was great, after a long night of hanging out in Boston we were all hungry. Boloco was open early in the morning and was yummy and filling. 
28223 Above average burritos that aren't overly greasy, fresh ingredients, fast service, reasonable prices, close to campus. Sums up a solid go-to spot don't you think? 
28224 Cool atmosphere, good music, great location, an Austin treasure. 
28225 Love their salad bar! Service is usually good and the food is very good. Love their salmon cakes 
28226 Jack was super helpful with getting my storage unit set up! He was very welcoming and made my storage purchase very enjoyable. 
28227 Very tasty and not expensive. I like this place. I A casual place. I. Would totally reccomend it if u wanna grab some quick food 
28228 Was going to make a reservation here, but read the health inspection reviews. Looks like things have taken a turn for the worse. 
28229 Stylish modern restaurant featuring shareable Spanish plates with Moroccan & Indian hints. Great atmosphere, very lively place. 
28230 Quality food, fresh ingredients. My husband and I had the roast beef and BLT, both excellent. I just wish I could leave the place without smelling like grease. They need to update their ventilation for the kitchen. 
28231 Solid spot for family meal in Boulder... whether breakfast, lunch, or... (haven't been for dinner yet). Everything was great. Tough to go wrong. They care about food here. 
28232 Second Hopoddy review (Yelp keeps asking for another one for some reason). I love this place. Source matters and they get that. Excellent menu. Drinks while you wait ( and you probably will given their popularity), friendly and competent staff, and lots of interesting specials. Love my Hopdoddy Burger Bar! 
28233 I am a bit of a Foodie and this place delivers. I am not the biggest fan of pizza, but Flippers has a great menu selection and my favorite is the Arugula. Best pizza I have had since I moved to Orlando. 
28234 The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the new pizza options now available!! This place is now on my favorites list. The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. We highly recommend it. 
28235 Wow, excellent food yes of course! But the service is astounding. Every time I go here, they are courteous and professional. Even though it's quite a drive for me, I'll be coming here many more times! 
28236 Awesome ambiance. Chicken and fish were great. Def a happening place in downtown Austin! 
28237 Loved the burgers and the soft drinks! Had to wait, but OK as the line moved fast. May be a little more expensive than it should be, but not too bad. 
28238 We catered Nothing Bundt Cakes for our wedding and they were a huge hit. We liked the selection of flavors and sizes. The bundtinis were beautiful and easy for guests to eat. They were very easy to work with, responsive, and the delivery was prompt and professional. 
28239 So we were forced into this Wendy's because every other (3) spot that we tried just wasn't working for whatever reason. The heat wasn't working when we visited, and that made this a terrible place to eat. Even the staff was in jackets with beanies. 
28240 We are a youth band from Haverhill, Black Diamonds, and we love the House of Blues! The Foundation Room is off the charts and The Music Forward Program is amazing! AJ, Henry, Nick and Wolfgang 
28241 Much worse sales experience than BMW dealers I have bought previous cars from in California and in Germany. I recommend never buying a car here. 
28242 Food was meh. Server was impersonal. Maybe it was just the burger but it was nothing special. A bit bland. The server did his job but didn't really try to connect with us in any way while ordering or paying. Overall, mediocre restaurant. 
28243 Great concept and packaging. Great interior inside. Doughnuts were good and they had some very unique flavors. (See pictures). We had never been to the shops in California so it was cool to visit. Prices were reasonable, but they only take CASH!! 
28244 This Jack is the best. They were on point! I just wanted five pc nuggets and they gave me two bbq sauce. What? That's right. Two! And I got napkins! For realz. This is the best Jack I've been to! 
28245 The woman working the driving thru started yelling at me when I pulled up to the speaker. "Hello!? Hello!? Hellooo...!!?? HELLO!!!???" WTF what kind of person speaks to people like that. Never going back to this place today was once a regular lunch spot for me. 
28246 Stumptown alongside other beans, vacuum heaters, and close to home. What's not to like? 
28247 Eat here usually 2-5 times a week. Amazing prices for the daily sub 6in Amazing quality veg and bread ! And also amazing quality service and time till completion on my sub ! I will constantly be coming back ! 
28248 This place was quiet but we really enjoyed the food and drinks. Well designed interior and great service too. 
28249 Sourdough Pancakes are the reason I came here. Sourdough Pancakes are most likely the reason I won't go back. Attractive yet alien feeling interior, friendly if not slightly overbearing service. 
28250 They saved my ex-husband from Pancreatic Cancer and that was ten years ago. I give them praise and Thank God for the Doctors who came up with the Whipple Procedure. Great Job! 
28251 This is my favourite pupuseria 
28252 The pupusas are big and delicious 
28253 The cheese pupusas are so good as the pupusas revueltas. I really love that they have a big selection of Salvadorian drinks and food. 
28254 I absolutely LOVE Bob's. I go there for everything - subs, platters, meats. A friend had a death in the family, so we sent food from Bob's. They were so professional and accommodating - the food was delivered in just two hours. Don't waste your time going anywhere else. 
28255 I thoroughly enjoyed this dinner! I went here for a celebratory dinner during Portland Dining Month. Delicious food and excellent service, great ambiance. 
28256 Amazing food, service, prices. 5 stars from this out of towner. Loved Gastro Mania, lamb shank was huge, and delicious. 
28257 Amazing coffee. Perfect, cozy atmosphere. Friendly staff. Just a wonderful little place. 
28258 LOVE Hair's Evelyn. After 10+ years of hopping from salon to salon, I finally found someone who consistently gives me a great cut. It's my first monogamous client-stylist relationship and I'm very happy! Michelle is a rockstahhh 
28259 Was there during lunch time. Poor service, no concept of drinks/appetizer/main meal courses. A complete mess. I ordered a kale salad with quagga. The kale leafs tasted like grass from the lawn. I suggest finding another place nearby for good meal. 
28260 Amazing service, food and prices!! Great job and keep it up. Excited that food looked just as it does on the menu. All seafood was seasoned perfectly. Looking forward to going back again! 
28261 Good downtown lunch spot. I've always been able to park in the lot. Never had to wait for a table. I keep getting the lunch quesadilla, which hasn't disappointed. 
28262 Good food, nice atmosphere, great for martini's and lobster ravioli YUM. I would definitly recommend eating here if you are visiting Salem anytime soon. 
28263 This place has the best legit Lebanese food around, great customer service, staff is very friendly restaurant is very clean food is very authentic! They have lots of gluten-free and vegetarian options. 
28264 Herrell's is famous, but I'm never overly-impressed. It's good ice cream, yes, but it's not "OHMYGODTHISISTHEGREATESTICECREAMEVER" good. Their toppings are rather decadent (as you'd expect) and service good. Worth stopping in, but don't think that this is going to be the greatest ice cream experience of your life. 
28265 I went to the Winter Park location with an dental emergency and they had me in and out in about 30 minutes. The staff was very nice. 
28266 Not what it used to be. The food us gone down hill. Bummer because this used to be my favorite place to eat. I went back three times to give it another chance and it did not measure up. *Their fries are still great (when they come out hot). 
28267 I love Dave's. They help me keep my 10 year old Honda running smoothly. They are great at explaining what needs to be repaired and why it needs to be done. Great customer service and super friendly people. I'm so glad I found these guys. 
28268 These guys are a staple for our fsmily's take out. Accurate orders everytime. 
28269 Best darn pizza in South Austin! 
28270 Well...what can I say, Polish Dog rocks!!!! Great location because I can walk from my office for my weekly Hot Dog fix. Oh yah...great pastrami sandwich too!! I haven't met a more friendly couple serving great food. 
28271 Normally I don't review fast food places. The people who work here were nice, but this has got to be the smallest portion I've ever had at any Panda Express. Really disappointing and not worth the money. 
28272 Coley is the king of pizza and high life's who blesses us with eye of the Tigers. The best waiter ever! #godinhumanform 
28273 Always the best! The doctors have taken care of the lovely lady of the house more than once and have actually saved her life once. Can't say enough kind things. The reception staff is fantastic! 
28274 Tasty, fresh and filling sandwiches. The bread is nice and thin with char marks from the grill. I tried the steak and chicken shawarma and they where both good. Service was quick and prompt. They serve hookah but this is definitely a food joint first 
28275 Really great authentic style Italian food. The location is rather strange and the interior isn't very sophisticated, but the service is great and the food was excellent. Pricey dinner, but your paying for quality. 
28276 Royalty gave me a GREAT experience. They were kind, gave me a free mimosa, and the nails looked GREAT. I did have one small chip after 9 days, but otherwise I was SUPER happy with them. I'll definitely be going back! 
28277 Holy cow! Best tasting burgers I've ever had!! No exaggeration!!! I suggest adding the aged cheddar as it is a great compliment to the beef though... 
28278 Great food, stellar vibes, and excellent service! Sarita took great care of us! Only four stars because it took the bar almost 30 mins to get out first round of drinks out, but after that it was quick. 
28279 The service was great and the food was excellent!! It's a bit pricey but totally worth it! 
28280 Squarerut Kava is a great place to chill out. The friendly staff, comfortable seating, boardgames and regular clientele make for great atmosphere. The Kava itself is very calming and relaxing, I recommend a visit here for any moment you need to take a deep breath. 
28281 Went to the braintree location with my sister who wanted henna. As you can see from the pictures I posted it was trash. & for $15? 
28282 Anyone who says this is bad Hawaiian food must not be from Hawaii. This is my favorite mac salad up in Oregon, and I love the lau lau! 
28283 Great selection, cool staff and the best bathroom this side of the Charles. Exactly the kind of bookstore you want to wander into, accidentally or not. 
28284 I love this place! It is like going to Grandma's house! The staff are always smiling and making sure you are enjoying everything. Amazing Happy Hour too! 
28285 Awesome sandwiches. Porchetta is the way to go. A little pricey for what it is. Lineups are crazy. Not enough seating area. I like this place, I just don't like standing around for 30 minutes before getting to order. 3.5 stars. 
28286 I ordered a few times from here 
28287 Though their pizza is expensive over all quality is very poor. I found another place. Good bye pizza Mia 
28288 Great service, friendly guys. Showed up a tad late but called well before-hand to communicate that. Alex was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. Saved me a big long-term expense and if/when I need these guys again, they're who I'm going to. 
28289 Plus they have a sign saying they're the number one choice of Trailblazers fans! Obviously trying to represent affiliation with the Blazers if you don't stop to think about it. And how would you know about the fans, have you figured out who they all are and polled them?! 
28290 They did a really good job on my home. I will definitely use them again in the future! 
28291 Chicken taste like shit. I wish I did not eat anything rather than ordering wing zone. The brownie bites taste as if they are cooked by the same oil that used for chicken 
28292 Just YuM! My Husband LOVES the Meatloaf, the mashed potatoes and gravy. We've tried the Chicken & Waffles and amazing, their syrup is awesome! Everything we have tried is great, no complaints! 
28293 Most awesome Safeway ever! I go here almost every night!! Kosher food delight!! I love the Italian cream rum cake! Just love this place!!! Stephan the night manager is awesome too!! 
28294 Came here yesterday with my bf. We had a 4 cheese platter, which was amazing! The siracha cheddar was our fav and the owner recommended the most amazing cider. The staff was sweet and friendly too. Hope I return to Portland soon to come here again! 
28295 Come for the drinks. The drinks are a 5, great choices and prices. The food, ehh, better after a drink.It's not bad but there are some kinks here and there. Tips: Just don't try the corn tortillas. 
28296 Wow. In coffee shop deprived Boston, this is a gem. Don't visit - I don't want you to take my spot at the table. 
28297 This was a very tasty adventure. We had a group of 6 and tried numerous small plates. The food was so full of flavor. Service was excellent and made great suggestions. It was a fun luncheon. 
28298 Been coming for the last 3 months, no problems. Good customer service, and fair prices. I have to come from Vancouver to get the products I need here. Closest place to LA, witch I come from. 
28299 Never had anything bad here. Their burgers are huge. They make their own balsamic vinaigrette that is out of this world. And the reubens? Perfect. Used to love riding my bike to the NeWorlDeli...I miss it now that I've moved south east. 
28300 Mike was such a great server and he really made the whole experience! We were celebrating a birthday and we had a lot of fun. The food was yummy and the wine was great. 
28301 Worst motel stay we've had. We had no ac and shower flooded out onto the floor. Then came bed bugs. So will not stay at another motel 6, jus sayin!! 
28302 They know their stuff and are always willing to help. And answer any completely dumb questions I ask. Also, they have make-it-at-home yoghurt, sour cream, kefir and sourdough there. I'm going to have to try that at some point. 
28303 Great little hole in the wall. Not well known except maybe for the locals. Great prices, service and large portions. Roast lamb is my favourite here. 
28304 Killer, juicy fried chicken. Loved it! Just the right amount of spice. I recommend finishing it off with the old-fashioned coconut pie. Perfect. 
28305 NO CALL NO SHOW Delivery two days in row. They love to take your money, but then no communication and no service after the sale. No idea if or when we will get our appliances. Good thing we used a credit card so we can cancel the sale! 
28306 Nice little stand in Steveson Richmond This place sells slush with soft serve ice cream called screamers The price is good and it is a nice refreshing drink on a hot day 
28307 Beautiful stuff; very high-end. If you can afford it, buy it because it looks like it's very good quality. I think they have some smaller items half off as of this posting. (05/27/11) 
28308 Pretty good Thai food place with decent price! The place isn't too big, but nicely decorated. Very nice and friendly service. Food was delicious! 
28309 I ordered from this restaurant with my roommates. I strongly recommend the coconut curry, the drunken noodles and the mango curry !!!! Amazing place for delivery. Sadly, it took 1 hour to get home. But if you are not in a rush.... it is amazing 
28310 I'm not the biggest donut freak but these are amazing!! A must try if you're in the area. Awesome staff, friendly, chill and upbeat vibe. Came in happy... left out on cloud 9 with a coffee. 
28311 We came for the lobster special but the said they are out. Called another Miller's and they said they sold out within 30 minutes 
28312 Not sure I want to be disappointed again, next time I'll try somewhere else and call ahead. 
28313 This is a beer lover paradise!!!!... So many choices of beer you can't go wrong. Great job on the add-on!!!.. It looks fabulous. My two favorite things where the barstools and all the tap handles on the wall. Great atmosphere I will be back!!! 
28314 Fun, 1920s speak easy kind of feel. Hidden in a funky basement. Upscale drink selection, but they had a couple of happy hour specials that kept the bill reasonable. Good, friendly staff. Very helpful bartender with the whiskey selection. Fun skee ball hidden around one of the corners. 
28315 Great place to visit on family vacation. Kids really loved it. Definitely will be back. 
28316 Top reasons I love this shop: 1) I can walk in one minute before closing and the staff is helpful and friendly 2) Great recommendations for beer, wine and port 3) Beer tastings 
28317 I LOVE Gucci. Great customer service and quality merchandise. Even though the space is limited they make the best of it. Can't go wrong with Gucci. 
28318 My husband and I stumbled here after walking through the government center winter village. He ordered a sausage and fries for me. Delicious fries, good sauces and a nice atmosphere - just wish there was more seating. Overall a good experience! 
28319 Their bulgogi is really good. People like their tofu soups. The place is small. You'll have to wait at least an hour to get a seat if you go during busy hours. 
28320 Upsettingly good. Great and unique flavor profiles, blended brilliantly. On the small side, but absolutely makes up for it with in-house syrups and milks, and friendly and quick service. I don't want to go back to CO 
28321 Just as good as their one in Lockhart! 
28322 Honestly this is the best omelette I've ever had. The service was fantastic and the ambiance is lovely. I will definitely be back! 
28323 I went here on a food tour with Tantalizing Tastes and Tours. We were very impressed with the fried shrimp, baked mac & cheese, and the CORN BREAD!! 
28324 This park is one of my favorite places to be. They have summer movies on Friday, its decorated with lights in the winter, and is a great, quiet place in Downtown. The streets are usually full of cars on Sundays in the summer. Great for picnics 
28325 A friend recommended this place and I'm so glad he did! I'll be back next time I'm in town! :) 
28326 Full scale mall, very nice feel and lots of stores including a Krispy Cream that I believe is open 24/7. Lot of people dressed nicely though and I hate feeling like I am under-dressed when I go to a MALL. 
28327 AWESOME food!! 10/10 would recommend. Unique and tasteful craft beers, along side fabulous fresh pizzas made in house in their brick oven. Get the Tarthfo, you won't regret it! 
28328 The food was good. I thought the service was very slow. It took two hours for us to get through all four course. 
28329 So delicious! Amazing food, quick and friendly service, good prices. Gluten free injera is available upon request. 
28330 The service and food were both A+ great place for a casual night out being able to keep your conversation going without constant disturbances 
28331 Wait what? The flavor of the tacos was almost entirely absent. Bland tomato sauce was pouring out of my chicken. Mexican street tacos do not have cheese or lettuce, they have cilantro and onions. Would not go here again. 
28332 This place is amazing. From the staff, to the food, and the decor. Went during lunch and the food options are amazing. The bakery goods look so delicious. Order the artichoke eggs Benedict. Every bite was worth it. The wait staff is great. Very helpful and friendly. Worth the stop. 
28333 Killer ice cream and candies in the most adorable location. Every time I go I grab a chocolate ice cream cone and sit by the fountain outside next to the lake. I make sure I go there every time I step foot in Celebration. 
28334 This museum is a must visit destination. Just look at the official website and go. http://www.gardnermuseum.org/ 
28335 The food was okay and the drinks were really terrible. I was pretty disappointed and it was overpriced to boot. Go elsewhere for your Mexican fix. The atmosphere was really nice, but service was slow and lacking on a non-crowded Sunday night. It's a no for me. 
28336 went here with the family (wife, two girls 17 & 12). we ordered three courses sampling four appetizers, pizza and three different tacos. we loved it all. 
28337 The kula pork was so salty it was almost inedible. It was $19 for the pork, rice and mac salad. All mediocre. I've had better Hawaiian food from a food cart. Service was sloppy. 
28338 First time here and it was delightful! I ordered the burger and it was amazing! Cooked perfectly to order and I will absolutely go back for another. The truffle fries were also very yummy and I the garlic aioli was great! 
28339 The food is good and it was rated A on the state inspection app whatthehealth. I wanted to leave a tip but they don't accept them. They say they want you to come back and their excellent service backs the statement. 
28340 This place was fantasic. The food was delicious, the service was wonderful. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a fun cute place to eat. 
28341 Got our first delivery and it was amazing! So fresh and so clean. Lovely customer service, also. Highly recommend. 
28342 Large menu including a large vegetarian selection. The Turkish standard dishes we tried were all excellent and the service was great. Fairly large wine list. Interior was nice, but a bit dark for ambiance. 
28343 Love their Friday special of chicken and dumpling and greens 
28344 The only things is that the greens have to much sugar put in them 
28345 Amazing fries. Best poutine in Boston. Be sure to get a frik and try some of the different sauces. We live a five minute walk away and will be back often. 
28346 Great fast and friendly service. Just needed a trim and that's exactly what I got! Ask for Cristina and you won't be disappointed! 
28347 My favorite donuts in town, always paired with a scoop of pistachio! I love this place. Sometimes it can be a bit of a romper room (too many kids for my taste) but being open late-ish makes up for it. Outside seating available too. 
28348 Service was good. Place is noisy because the bar area is not closed off from the dining area. My Maryland crab dish was good but a little too salty. My wife's veal and eggplant parmigiana was terrible. Overcooked, minimal cheese and tasteless sauce. 
28349 Met my friend here after work last night. We are regulars here and love their food. Disappointingly enough we found a red roach underneath the booth we were seated it. We immediately left. This might have lost them a regular Customer for good this time. 
28350 Great service, food and drinks come through and see Jason and Donald. They are awesome bartenders. 
28351 talk about fun place to go great energy love the many game options you can play and the servers are great and so is the food but it is so chill a must to experience lee vancouver bc 
28352 We have been coming here since this place opened. The ice cream is the best we've ever had. The hot fudge sundae is a must have. The service tonight. Horrific! Unfriendly. Almost on the verge of hostile. I may not come back. 
28353 Omg!! I drove all the way here from Lady Lake, FL (hour and a half drive and it was CLOSED!! There was a big sign on the door!!! I was too disappointed to get out, read the sign as to why it was closed. 
28354 Small space with the counter and kitchen behind it and a very small amount of places to sit. Ordered a Cuban Sandwich and it was awesome. One of the best we've had! Highly recommend this place! 
28355 Overpriced, pretencious Mexican food served by hipsters. First and last time for me. 
28356 Went here for a turkey sub, which was $10 and had one piece of turkey and layers of cheese in the sub. It was mostly lettuce and tomato. Don't recommend 
28357 Best Sunday morning Caesars ever! Bacon and all kinds of yummies speared over this delightful drink! 
28358 I love to order from cinnaman. He makes the best cheesecakes... and it's a local company. All around Win win. He has the best customer service and great prices for his delicious homemade cheesecakes. I have been ordering from him for about 2 years now. Cheesecake Factory who?! 
28359 SOOOO great, love their subs and fries and pizza, but their tuna salad is more like tuna soup. 
28360 Cheap for Boston, but so is the apartment atmosphere. The rooms were okay clean, but random hairs were found all over the bathroom. Also, they boast free wifi, but mine never connected my entire stay. 
28361 Friendly staff helped me order. However I got a pretty bad stomach ache after eating. I'm giving it 4 stars for service, 3 stars for for quality, and 2 stars for taste and a 2 Star overall. Could be much better 
28362 I have a Thai Chicken Salad addiction to this place. Sometimes they start working on it before I walk in. Literally. Get it. It is delicious. And the people that work here are great too. Eat here. 
28363 Great place, very disappointing watered down crappy "Perfect Manhattan". Go for the beer. Great appetizers. Not so good entrees. 
28364 Really exceptional coffee, fried chicken and waffles in a funky setting with wonderful art and design. A little pricey but worth it for high quality lunch and coffee! 
28365 Fantastic place to learn about history. Went there last year for a Halloween event with my two kids. It was crowded but they managed everything really great! The kids got to trick or treat and pick out a pumpkin all for free!! Hope they have this again! 
28366 Great tacos for a great price. And they have a gluten free menu - yay! The tacos you will want to eat again and again. 
28367 I came here me for the first time tried the pork burger (can't remember what number it was) it was so awesome I can't wait to come back again. Everyone who worked there was very nice and I was so appreciative of that. Parking was easy. 
28368 We typically really like Black Bear diners, been to several between Oregon, Washington, and California. This one seems different from the other ones we've been to, and smaller. Service was....okay. Not friendly, but was efficient. Food was like any other Black Bear Diner though! Lots of it and very tasty. 
28369 Foods pretty good but small portions for the price. the coffee tastes watered down and weak 
28370 Great neighborhood bar. Excellent mixed drinks and craft beer selections. Nice sustainably sourced menu options, many of them vegetarian. Large selection of healthy sides and bird/fish/seafood options. Great choices for carnivores as well. Mellow family atmosphere. Everybody welcome; don't get no better. 
28371 Great pizza love thier sausage and pep xtra chesse.best place for pizza on the west side 
28372 This place was pretty nice. I can't say it knocked my socks off but overall well kept and plenty to do and lots of pools and hot tubs. 
28373 $100/person tasting menu and went home starving. Literally the worst deal in Austin. Food is adequate but you will go home hungry. 
28374 Quick, efficient, and a very welcoming friendly staff. I was not a patient but, my sister was. They are very helpful and knowledgeable in their work. 
28375 Not happy with this place. I didn't enjoy my meal at all. Miss the old place that was here. Limited menu. My wife was super disappointed in the fish noodles. 
28376 Great to get good Ethiopian food and not have to drive all the way into the city. The customer service is very nice, only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because of the setting 
28377 I take back my last star. Came there with my girlfriend, and the bartender blatantly ignored me and hit on her (she's the one that pointed it out). Nope. 
28378 Excellent subs, great catering items. Consistent quality and a great value. I've been a customer for 35 years. You can't go wrong with Santoro's! I just wish they stayed open longer hours! 
28379 LOVE my new closets. Justin and CC were excellent to work with. I found them based on their yelp reviews and everything the others said were true. Great customer service, attention to detail and honest. 
28380 Seriously one of the best ramen I have had in town. So delicious! Definitely worth the drive! 
28381 Keep walking down Rainey Street and you will run into this little gem. Casual, cool atmosphere. Good drinks. Friendly staff. Inside and outside seating, though a little limited. Clean bathrooms (ladies, we know this is important!). 
28382 Great food great beer selection friendly barkeep- what more to say? Very inexpensive. 
28383 Love the place, Mac n cheese is to die for! Half and full servings, also a lot of craft beers on menu! 
28384 A really cool hipster atmosphere to enjoy really good burgers & fries with great customer service in Austin. They validate parking if you park in the garage behind them, so bring your ticket. The truffle fries & chile con queso fries were awesome! 
28385 We loved this place. Great find and sort of a hidden gem in a rather sketchy strip of stores. The inside is quaint, quiet, and very nice, the food is delicious, and the staff was great. The homemade churros are to die for! 
28386 Back to Kroger! Fage yogurt & organic half & half way overpriced as are my favorite bars! Long lines! Last time here for me! 
28387 Great breakfasts and awesome decor. The staff is super friendly and the food came out fast. Huge delicious portions and good breakfast spending range. Definitely recommended and will be going back for sure. 
28388 Love,Love,Love the Cobb Salad so good always great taste and of course the great customer service....Oh there frosted coffee so good... Teresa Ellis 
28389 In the area from California for a conference and it is always hard to find a real good Mexican food place anywhere, but this is best place I have eaten in Florida. A must if you are in the area! 
28390 Aimee is professional, friendly, and amazing at what she does! I can't believe I actually enjoyed my wax. It was painless and super clean. Plus she's easy to talk to and so personable. Overall I highly recommend it! You won't regret it. 
28391 I finally located what seems an official Edm venue, was Tech House on the night I went. Cool place, rave feel. Sometimes big artist play, Gabriel dresden, breathe Carolina, I heard darude and more. Starts 10 pm. 
28392 The big dark-haired bartender is Extremely rude. I cant believe she is allowed to work anywhere with such poor customer service and social skills... the other bartenders are fine but still do NOT reccomend this bar. 
28393 Excellent food. Tough to get a seat at lunch. I've become addicted to their clay pot dishes. My favorite is the chinese sausage and bacon. It's a very small space, but you can order take-out. They do not take credit. 
28394 Tip: Try the Calzones. They are excellent and perfect if you are on the run. Free refills, good salads and hand made sodas round out the menu. Hot Lips can get really busy during lunch hours. Come early to get a seat. 
28395 Came in here about six months ago, and have been raving to everyone about it. Stopped by with a friend for lunch today, and the doors were locked! Where have you gone Chen??? 
28396 Everything tastes amazing but do not eat here if you are allergic to soy. Everything fried, including those amazing chips, are deep fried in soy oil. I learned the hard way. Good bye, happy hour Texas sized nachos! 
28397 Awesome happy hour! Good selection of brews. Also, they have a Hawaiian melt that was to die for. Splurged a little and also got their truffle fries. Cleared the whole plate, and left 5 pounds heavier and happier :) 
28398 Nice! Good quality food, good quality service, in a casual, elegant room. Lucky students! Carrot Ginger soup and gluten free Salmon tacos for lunch. They were a bit 'fishy' for my taste buds, but pretty good. Coffee by Milano. I was impressed. 
28399 Pretty sure everything I ate came out of a can. I almost offered them some recipes as none of things I ordered are difficult to make well.... 
28400 Bar none, the worst paella I've had on four continents. A watered down mojito didn't help matters. A bad deal at any price. 
28401 Fried sticky rice here rawks! Better than Lucky Tao's as it is less salty. 
28402 Great chicken, not as good as Strouds in KC but close. Large portions, great desserts what more could you ask for!! 
28403 Authentic German restaurant. We tried original Rueben and sampler platter. The Rueben was the best I have ever had and the pumpernickel bread was great. Hubs had the sampler and loved it, even the applesauce 
28404 Also tried the pretzel bites yummy!! Great food worth the wait 
28405 It closed!!!!! What a shock. It's kind of hard to make money when the servers don't wait on customers. 
28406 I visited the Portland Clinic to diagnose and ultimately repair a problem with my ankle. The orthopedists were caring and responsive. 
28407 Loved the singer and the lobster risotto - avoid the spider roll. However, they have the best salted Carmel cr√®me br√ªl√©e have ever had! 
28408 Called the company to ask if they would service the oil burner in my apt.Though they do not do that ,the very pleasant gentleman who called back , gave me the number of a collegue who might be able to help. 
28409 Sorry to say this will be the last Mothers Day celebration here. Found out they will be closing in the 30th. We have had amazing meals here, including this one! We will have to find a new go-to for dim sum!!! 
28410 I ran the lagoon again this year, ten times around. Also did about 50 pullups per day while sipping a cocktail of choice by the hottub. #AWESOME !!! 
28411 Good food and you can taste the quality of the ingredients. Friendly staff. I will definitely return! 
28412 Ordered delivery and it took more than 2.5 hours to be delivered... Your food is so delicious but cold when it arrived... 
28413 Fantastic experience at Red Robin tonight! Our server Cory was awesome and the food was delicious. 
28414 My favorite place to go for ramen. Really great broth and noodles but gets packed really fast and it's s small place so seating can be limited. 
28415 Definitely try this place. Great server. She engaged us...really friendly. Good place to watch current sports events on TV. Great selection of beers. Excellent pizza. Vibrant atmosphere. Definitely try this place. 
28416 Great fare for a very fair price. beef, fish, salads, all great. The service doesn't get better than this. Along with friendliness. Amrheins is the new goto place. 
28417 Among the best meals I've ever had. I have not had a lot of fried chicken in my life, and most that I've had has been forgettable. Gus's and some truck in Boston that served very garlicky amazing chicken about 30 years ago are the exceptions. 
28418 Good spot for breakfast. Have not tried their lunch, but breakfast wash been pretty good. 
28419 Terrible customer service experience via Foodler. An hour and a half after placing my order, and after making two calls, I was informed that no one was coming, but that I would need to contact Foodler myself to get a refund. Avoid this place like the plague. 
28420 The best of the "dinner cruise" experiences in Boston! Live music, delicious food and attentive service from Scott and his crew. Their DJ is excellent as well! Our group felt well cared for, well fed and happy to have a night out on the harbor. 
28421 Super friendly & helpful staff - no ego's at all. Also great selection and fair prices. Best fly shop in town. 
28422 got my order wrong. sent it back. declined offer to remake. always makes me nervous. guess the tip didn't work. was really looking forward to a burger tonight. manager did come over to apologize, offered to remake, offered a comp coupon. maybe will try again later. going for Thai. 
28423 It honestly takes them forever to bring food after you've ordered it. It really doesn't even matter if they're busy or not nor does it matter what you order it will be a long time before they bring it. I must admit other than that it's a cool dive bar. 
28424 Love the food here.there amritsari kulcha is to die for.love the raj kachori and the badam milk.you are missing something if u haven't tried this place. 
28425 Hand down, the best Ramen I've ever had! I never mind waiting for a seat here. The chicken broth is something I dream about sometimes. 
28426 We loved the place Hate the Parking.. Food was Great portions were not filling.. 
28427 Who doesn't love Starbucks? I go so often that the baristas at several locations recognize me. My favourite is the Iced Americano. 
28428 The food is absolutely delectable and the service is fantastic! I absolutely love this place and its ambiance. This is one of the best spots in Atlanta. You have to get the charcuterie board and sangria! 
28429 This is a great chipotle! Tonight particularly, everything was amazing. Fast service, fresh tasting ingredients and the most friendly and awesome cashier. 
28430 I had the chicken sis kebap. The seasonings they use for the chicken make the whole meal come alive. Definitely worth checking out! 
28431 A little spendy, but worth it. Fantastic grub. I recommend the Kobe and shrimp. The Kobe is much better than the regular steak I promise. Fast friendly service too. 
28432 Solid shop, stellar staff, no bullshit. The kind of people who will advise you not to buy it if you really don't need it. Mad respect. 
28433 Deserts, salmon, gazpacho, and bone marrow were awesome. Snails weren't good. 
28434 Came here with my bro for lunch one day. Place is pretty small so there was a little wait so I would advise to go early or wait till the lunch rush is over. It was pretty good but the portions were a little small. 
28435 hands down the best pad thai ive ever had. always a must have for when im in portland. very reasonably priced and very good portions. love it. 
28436 This place just opened in my building so I checked it out last Saturday. Just wanted to write a review to point out whoever picked the playlist did a great job. Every song was great and set the mood for a good night! 
28437 whenever im in need of some fresh donuts i make it a priority to stop by. gotta love em.! 
28438 I called precision on Saturday evening and was very surprised to get an appointment for service the next day a SUNDAY who does that anymore THANKS 
28439 One of the best hamburger joints in SE Portland. Got the Sellwood full size burger with fries. The Beef patty, beechers cheese, onions, bacon and aioli was a perfect combination of flavors. Fries very flavorful and crisp. Grab lots of napkins! 
28440 I was able to get an appointment 30 minutes prior which was great. I had David as a nail tech, who was very friendly, and I got SNS. I love that he made my nails short. Very happy with the service they provided. 
28441 Really friendly baristas and nicely brewed coffees. I am a coffee lover and make it a point to visit third wave cafes in every city. This place stacks up nicely. Beautiful decor and free wifi. Place for people-watching, quiet reading, and impressive pastries and breads made on-site. 
28442 This place lives up to the hype it has such cool and different donuts but they are also really yummy 
28443 Saw a video where it shows a rat is running around, inside this shop. So disgusting, i hope they shut down and that video goes viral, so that everyone stays away from this dirty restaurant 
28444 Don't rule this place out! Besides the pizza which is quite good, they have nice hot sandwiches like Chicken Cutlet with fresh mozzarella and roasted reds. Large tv's at the bar and a decent beer and wine selection. We really like this place! 
28445 Best Dunkin Donuts and absloutely the best staff EVER! The staff that work here are so friendly and so fast- I'm talking lightning speed and my ice coffee is always perfect. I refuse to go anywhere else, they are that good. 
28446 Came with a coworker for coffee and was immediately blown away by the eclectic German/ Chinese decor. We had Klaus's signature breakfast and strudel. Was so good, I can't wait to come back! German food that took me back to my childhood! 
28447 Awesome food! Went with my girlfriend and we had raw oysters (thick and juicy) , She had the burger which was cooked perfect and loaded with flavor , and I had the Mahi sandwhich blackened! I will definitely be back. The staff was great, very friendly and great service 
28448 Great place, they did a good job trying to help with my foot issues. I will definetely be back! Thanks for your help. 
28449 Four words: double baked almond croissant! I haven't tried any of their other baked goods (which I'm sure they're also good)... I can't resist, thinking I'm likely going to regret it after I leave. Oh yes, really enjoy their lattes as well! 
28450 Super cute, great food. Mocha wasn't great. Also kind of slow to get our food, maybe because everything is cooked to order, but still not what we expected at a coffee shop. But in the flip side, really nice people and reasonably priced food cooked to order! 
28451 Killer dim sum! Glad to find one this side of the Fraser. This has become a favorite of my group of friends. Didn't get an item that we didn't love. We will be back for sure. 
28452 The worst service everÔºÅ The waitress have very bad attitudeÔºàthey are so impatientÔºâto us and asked us to give 15% tips minimum. And the crawfish is unfresh 
28453 Best Pizza in Town! I love that I can cook it at home when I am ready to eat. We have friends over often and it makes hosting a breeze. We can put a pizza in the oven as people get hungry and have fresh pizza through out the night. 
28454 Have been in a couple of times when in downtown Lake Mary. Above average sports bar that has a great hamburger and decent beer selection. 
28455 We had sushi rolls ( spicy tuna and dragon) and beef pappardelle noodles were the best we've had, served with a delicious black vinegar that added to the light beef broth with cilantro. Great service and nice atmosphere. 
28456 Pretty good lunch place. They have some interesting pizza flavors-- smoked salmon basil and pesto! 
28457 Their items are vegan friendly! The associate was very helpful and polite answering all of my questions. They even double checked on ingredients. I love their veggie pizza that comes without cheese and it's even better when made into a calzone. I recommend! 
28458 Tasty stuff, ability to substitute tofu for free. A little dependent on sauce/dressings though. I've probably gone for my last time they use 100% disposable plates, bowls, cups. Didn't see any composting either. 
28459 We always go there on Fridays for drinks after work. They have great drink specials and food specials! Please keep it up. Service at the bar is awesome too. The servers are always so nice at helping us split the bill. :)thanks! 
28460 We used Svetlana for the Williamson County Furball charity event. She did an amazing job for all of our guests. Her work was fantastic and I highly recommend her services. She helped make this year's event one of our best! 
28461 The catfish and grits with the kale salad on the side was a gift from the gods. I've never had pan seared catfish cooked to perfection in my life. The grits was so cheesy and well cooked and the KALE oh my god, saut√©ed but yet still had the crunch 
28462 Excellent food, all made from scratch each time (they were willing to sub any ingredient because they cook fresh). Friendly service. Not for a rush meal... You should sit and enjoy your meal. 
28463 They have a friendly staff and their vegan donuts are delicious. This place is great, especially when you can manage to avoid the line that invariably gathers there each day! They must be doing something right. 
28464 It's been a few years and Nick is still my go-to. If it's a job I can handle (like knocking out a tiled wall) he'll shoot straight instead of accepting and charging me. 
28465 Great fish and chips! I love the people and the design of the place. This place is hopping on St. Patty's day! I couldn't even get in the door. 
28466 A spicy experience that deserve few visits. A hidden gem in Atlanta. A culinary must for food lovers that worth the drive. Great for kids and nice portions. Try the Sambusa as appetizer. 
28467 Song La offers the best Taiwanese food in town. I love everything Yang cooks up: pork belly buns, chicken bites, braised pork, and bento box. The flavors are great and the portion, generous. The young couple who run the food truck are very friendly. Give it try. 
28468 This place is horrible! The honey chicken tasted like deep fried nuggets with honey poured over it. No flavor what so ever. The rice was mushy and terrible. Don't waste your money at this Disney place. 
28469 Not bad. Oysters were good and food was solid. Service was very good 
28470 If I'm ever in this side of town I wld come back. Cook came out and asked if I enjoyed the meal- nice to see that. 
28471 Good burgers and fries, but a bizarre and overpriced menu. The "greens" had an inordinate amount of salt. Service was decent. If you're a hipster, you'll like this place. Don't fall for the movie ticket trickery! 
28472 The service was great and friendly, atmosphere was romantic for our date, and from the pulpo a la gallega, to the other tapas we had, to the dessert, it was all delicious and flavorful. We definitely recommend this place. 
28473 It was just OK. Nothing to complain about, except that for $25 that was the thinnest piece of swordfish I've ever seen, but nothing to rave about either. My son said the lobster roll was good. 
28474 Worst pizza buffet ever. Only has a dessert pizza, a sauceless cheese, a cheese, a pepperoni and a supreme. No variety. Not worth $8.59. Not even worth $.85. Salad bar wasn't bad, but don't eat here. 
28475 I just had Blue Planet service my place of business and couldn't have had a better experience. The gentleman who came out was very nice, honest and reasonable. I will definitely call them if I ever need pest control in the future. 
28476 Burritos were a great value and delicious....honestly worth going in for! 
28477 Live right down the street from this place and let me tell you the food is so amazing 
28478 I'm not a vegan but the food is so damn tasty we keep coming back !! Well done 
28479 Good meal, pretty good service, food was a little on the heavy side with salt, but my steak made up for it. My baked sweet potato that I ordered plain was excellent. 
28480 This has to be one of the worst franchises in the chain. Nine out of ten times they mess up the order like today, charging me for an item that never made it into the bag. Surprise! 
28481 Not only was the food top notch, Mia and Duncan provided superb service. Must try if you love hot pot. -Texas Girl 
28482 Highly recommend trying this place! Very clean, offering all the latest nail trends, very classy place and really nice workers! Will be coming back! 
28483 Very Nice Restaurant. The staff was nice and attentive. The food came out in good timing and it was good. I recommend this place for a nice intimate dinner for couples or grown adults. 
28484 Waited for over 20 minutes for them to fry some chicken. Was reasured that it was coming, turned out that it was just sitting there and they just forgot! 
28485 Another one of those places where you are paying for the environment. Food was pretty good, ordered the burger and it was cooked well and fairly juicy. Food wasn't overwhelmingly good but the environment was (nbc tv during the olympics always is) electric. Will likely be back. 
28486 Brought in some pants to have them altered. Very happy with the work and a lot cheaper than other tailors in the area. 
28487 Not a bad place if u are on business and staying here at the hotel. I wouldn't go out my way to come here. Too many better choices. 
28488 Just want to say that Michele continually amazes me. Her creativity and quality are unmatched. Thank you Michele for helping me feel beautiful! 
28489 I had delivery from here. Was the most disgusting, lowest quality meal I've ever eaten. Watery sauce, rubbery meat. Would rather eat jail food. 
28490 Check in started off pretty rough without our room being ready but they did fix it after some wait time. They are overall friendly, clean & helpful. 
28491 I just wrapped up a catering event at my office and it went over great. Tom is super personable and super easy to work with. My team was thrilled with the ice cream and all the toppings. We definitely look forward to doing it again in the future. 
28492 Best Authentic NY Pizza in Boulder by far. Unfortunately, Colore does not know how to market itself; thus, they continue to get crushed by mill the much lesser Cosmo's Pizza. The first step would be to offer delivery just as late (3am). Much Love. 
28493 The front desk staff are awesome - extremely helpful and friendly; however, the rooms suck. Noisy, air freshener smelly, uncomfortable beds, lousy wifi, and public bathrooms. Cheap yes.... but cheap. 
28494 The carne asada is so good that I can't remember what else I ate. I will add another star if it's the same quality when I return... soon. 
28495 The people of Bikram Titusville are so friendly and welcoming! It's hard to believe that Titusville has a Bikram Yoga studio, but it's alive and thriving! 
28496 The Prudential mall is good for one reason. Fresh Krispy Kreme. You can watch the sugary filled goo covering that little round fried bread which melts in your mouth on contact. But other than that it's ok. 
28497 Really good tacos that remind me of what I used to eat in Texas. Also super friendly service and nice atmosphere. Great neighborhood spot! 
28498 Jessika kicks ass. Every single time I leave with a big smile on my face. Thank you so much Jessika. 
28499 Easy 10/10 for El Primo. The food was outstanding. So delicious. We tried the migas tacos and a chicken torta. Our new go-to place for tacos. Genuinely nice people, great service, and delicious food. 
28500 We stop by Le's every so often. It's a solid restaurant, food hasn't changed much. They have expanded the menu to incorporate other Asian dishes besides strictly Vietnamese. They're usually pretty good. Service can be a hit or a miss depending on how busy it gets. 
28501 A nice, old fashiuned, candy and ice cream store. The ice cream is quite good. The homemade fudge and candy is quite good also. They originated in 1947 and it a bit like stepping back in time. 
28502 This is a damn good burger at a fair price. I got the booth next to the griddle where bacon was continually cooking. My patty tasted of salty pork. I was in heaven. 
28503 This place is a must for anyone visiting Portland. Voodoo donuts usually gets all the hype, but these donuts are amazing. The passion fruit is my current favorite. 
28504 Had their OG donut which was excellent! Just the right amount of sweetness and a hint of cinnamon. We even managed to beat the line up that formed shortly after us! 
28505 I was disappointed given the good reviews. The food was good but small and pricy. The waitress was not very good. The menu is limited and confusing. 
28506 Love the food and the atmosphere. Perfect location and the service is terrific to say the least. 
28507 Service was perfect, front staff were well mannered. Food was out in a timely manner. The taste and presentation of food was off the charts. Overall would recommend for everyone with a love for a wide range of foods. 
28508 This is a super cute, friendly shop that sells yummy gelato (and donuts too). The bright interior always puts a smile on my face and I love, absolutely love, the painting on their wall. 
28509 Incredible gym run and frequented by good folks. This is the sort of place we need more of in the lifting world. Stopped in on vacation in Portland to get in a quick session and wished I could make this my home gym. Thanks for welcoming us in! 
28510 A great big shout out to Jose and his crew for being honest. They call to say when they will be late, they will be respectful, and won't try to sell you a bill of goods. Thank you for being a company I can trust. 
28511 Unexpected pleasure and decadence in the E terminal of the Atlanta airport. "O" Toro, expert cocktails, and excellent service made my 3 hour layover seems far too short. Special thanks to Gicente (sic) for taking great care of me. 
28512 Had some pretty good experiences here so far. Been four times in the past two months. My girlfriend appreciates the gluten free options. 
28513 Good food and extremely busy. Hostess and server were rude and I had to keep flagging people down for my drink refill. 
28514 Open late, drink prices are okay, and the patio is great an a warm Summer night. Decent little neighborhood bar. 
28515 This place is just OK. I think this place can accommodate several different palate types- so that's good. They sell burgers. It's a burger place and that's that. 
28516 We bought a Coconut cake here for a holiday dinner. Everyone who tried it agreed, it was probably the most delicious cake we have ever had. Sister Honey delivers in a big way. I can't wait to try some of her other choices. 
28517 i'm wondering if i could get a longboard and some kind of introduction, since i don't know much about skateboard, but want to get into it.! 
28518 Great place to grab a quick pizza on the way home. Fast and friendly service. The Monday and Tuesday pizza special is hard to pass up! I have not dined in but I am willing to give it a try. 
28519 Bypartisan is fab- been going there for several years now and currently live right down the street. Friendly staff, always busy. Expect a line as everyone loves their pastries and foodstuffs. Would definitely bring friends, family and out-of-towners here for an authentic Portland coffee experience. 
28520 With stylish collections of local designers and vintage clothing, Moxie can add some serious Moxie to your wardrobe. Offering more than just clothing, Moxie is also the perfect boutique for unique jewelry and accessories. 
28521 I go here for the British aisles. Not just because I like puns, but they're a good place for mince pies and Cadbury's chocolate. They also have a nice line in wedding shirts and storage containers. 
28522 Saturday request was done quickly and efficiently. Dave was friendly, worked quickly and left the work area clean. 
28523 I went to Rice box couple times and the food is really Americanized chinese food. Not impressive at all. I think it is closed now and it's going to be a Taiwanese restaurant soon. Growing up in Taiwan, I'm really looking forward to the opening! 
28524 I had the chicken lo-mein and tried the lobster cakes. Food was good however a little pricey. There also wasn't much to choose from when it comes to cooked entrees. However I really enjoyed the decor and drinks! 
28525 Good pricing, good service, happy outcome. 
28526 Got my watch battery replaced here last week, quick and friendly service. 
28527 I love the food, especially the quesadillos. The prices are reasonable too and the service is fast. The only thing I don't like is that it takes forever to get refills on the drinks during a meal. 
28528 The staff here is wonderful. Our waitress was Desti, who was charming, patient, and helpful. The food was great and I would definitely return. We also had the Ethiopian wine and beer, it was really good. 
28529 Very nice hotel near the Town Center. Nice, modern rooms with nice amenities. I also attended an event in their meeting space and was very impressed with the service there as well. 
28530 Free! There is nothing else to say. The tour guide (Haley) was very witty and kept us laughing with quality puns throughout the tour. You get to keep your sampling glass and try some great beers. Well worth the hour. 
28531 Breakfast was delicious. Had the pulled pork and sister had the hash. Large servings. Delicious bloody Mary's. Prepare for a long wait to get seated, but well worth the wait. 
28532 This place was delicious!! A bit of a wait but the food was outstanding especially the pork soup dumplings. Crab soup dumplings were weird (not as good). The pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings were hella good tho. If you're in the area try it out! 
28533 Our puppy Coal absolutely loves it there ! they do half days which are affordable and great to get his puppy energy out ! the pictures and videos they post online make us so happy and know he is safe and in good hands !! 
28534 I have been here a couple of times and would rate it a solid three. Food is average; happy hour is definitely cost effective. Staff are pleasant most times. They have a relatively good selection of dishes and drinks. Will definitely return at some point during happy hour. 
28535 Wasn't impressed. The idea is cool but it's all a little much. I think I would have liked it better if the hamburger "buns" were sweet and glazed. I was disappointed when our server said they weren't. But the service is good and the atmosphere is cool. 
28536 Really good cajun-style food. Great converted house location adds a funky feel. 
28537 Great shaoxiangcao, it is the hot one that I ordered. The place is cozy and warm, a nice place for couple to spend the romantic night. 
28538 Hands-down, one of Boston's best ice cream shops. My favorite thing about this place? The hot praline sauce you can ladle over a very simple, yet delicious cup of vanilla ice cream. A really delicious treat. 
28539 Best part of the meal was dessert -- Taza chocolate cremeux. Service is ok, food is hit and miss, but the dessert is where it's at. I can see why this was mentioned in Food and Wine magazine. 
28540 Always a fantastic haircut when i come out, and i've been a couple of times. 
28541 After looking for a year and being very dissatisfied I have finally found Lidias Alterations.. they are great ... Abby is "sew" friendly and helpful .., I'm finally able to have alterations done with confidence... 
28542 A proper East Coast pizza, the only one we've found in 25 years in the Midwest. 
28543 Great pizza, great service...maybe a bit on the old fashioned-side, but I think that is part of the charm. Overall a solid neighborhood cafe. 
28544 My mother has complained about every flower arrangement I have ever sent her. She loved the two I sent from Salvy's. I am now a loyal customer for all mother-related occasions. 
28545 savory pastries are generally quite good. as for sweets, I've only had the brigadeiro, caramelish ball with chocolate jimmies. burgers, sandwiches and fries are all very good. as is the case with all bakeries, to know when something was cooked is good measure of freshness. prices are affordable 
28546 The. Big. Cheez. Mozzarella filled donut. Do I need to say more!? We ordered 2 orders for a table of 3 (so 4 filled donuts and dipping sauces). Didn't eat anything else, so my review is solely on the delicious melty cheese. 
28547 This is gonna be one of my favorite ramen restaurant. Because they have my local cuisines/Nagasaki champon and Nagasaki Saraudon!!! And I had tonkotsu ramen. The soup was delicious and lots of noodles but no Kikurage (black mushroom) 
28548 So super delish. Flavor explosion in my mouth. Nice staff. Loved the decor. Able to accommodate our group size too. 
28549 Probably the best burgers we ever had. Very quick but not fast food. The service was excellent and the atmosphere casual and fun. We are from Boston and wish that we could get these burgers at home. And if you come order the truffle fries OMG! 
28550 First time in Vancouver and came here base on yelp reviews, excellent decision! We had an assortment from kimchi bowl to sushi, dragon rolls and udon. Everything is fresh and good quantity and delicious. Can tell that the chef cares about the food! Yum!! 
28551 Have only bought pastries for take out but those have been delicious. As always, parking can be a bit of a problem, so we don't stop as often as we might. Have never had anything that wasn't wonderful. Good service. 
28552 Can't say I'll come back here again knowing what $12 is going to get me. Just seems overpriced, even for a food cart. 
28553 Good service, good food, location is awesome, and you can get here by boat. This place can be busy so plan ahead. 
28554 Went to trivia night here and had a blast! Good food, good drinks, and a super friendly staff. 
28555 Loved the atmosphere of Wasabi House! Food was great no complaints!! Try the strawberry Nigori Sake! 
28556 One of the best joints -- period. This place is for food junkies, not sensitive nancies. Old fashioned Italian gem. Peppers, lamb, Pizza, Bread. Done. Better than Regina, probably better than mom's. 
28557 Went for a Friday night date night. Had a bottle of red wine (can't remember which kind), beef tartare for an appetizer, the chef's salad, and the duck for an entree. it was delicious! for dessert we had the macarons. Highly recommend. 
28558 Great improvement in customer service: at c/s desk the gal was cordial. Outside teams: drive up oil change crew and carwash crew were effective and moved my vehicle along. Hand wax crew ...much improvement in preformance. Hugh thank you. It makes me want to come back. 
28559 Watch out for the Okura - it tastes like phlegm. This stand pales in comparison to the one up the street which is high energy and always bustling. When I went, there was only one server and she did not look to happy to be working there. 
28560 A must visit when we come to town. Never disappoints. We celebrated moms 65th birthday and their portions were huge! 
28561 The baked goods are really good. The coffee was just ok for me. The decor is very pretty though, and the feeling of the neighborhood is unique. Worth the trip. 
28562 Tasty place for breakfast! Their grits are the best around. We had the best server, I wish I remembered her name. Coffee is a little weak but other than that, delicious! And they have alcohol. 
28563 Best onion rings with amazing sauce, amazing mac n cheese. Plenty of beer selection, very generous portion for everything. Our servers, including Emily and Hanna, were fantastic servers. I would come back again to try other things in the menu. 
28564 Excellent food! Friendly service, nice prices. The sushi was great, the calamari was a bit salty. Overall wonderful!!!! 
28565 Other than the occasional screw up on a take out order, I have nothing but wonderful things to say about CE. Good food, very reasonably priced. I recently had one of their burgers and I must say I was not disappointed. The best buffalo wings around! 
28566 Love the donuts...only thing is that it's in a very awkward location. Donuts are great though. I'm a glazed type of guy but the buttermilk is a score. 
28567 Lovely decor, great ambiance and friendly staff. Food is affordable and delicious. Too bad you can't smoke hookah inside. Otherwise one of the best places I've visited in Cambridge. Visited mainly because of the stunning inviting photos I had seen on their Facebook page: www.facebook.com/andalacafe - wasn't disappointed! 
28568 These donuts are amazing. I always want one for a cheat meal. Ate 5 of them in one day once but they're that good 
28569 Always disappointed. The workers are very rude and huff and puff like they hate their job. I won't be going back. Their dryers suck and their attitudes are worse. 
28570 Excellent Customer Service! Very Inviting Atmosphere. Thank you for the excellent experience! 
28571 A quick glance at their fancy menu led me right to their favorite du jour a large pizza with Mozzarella, Fresh Garlic, Tomatoes, Romano Cheese, Fresh Basil and Olive Oil. It took ten minutes of joy for the large pizza to disappear int my belly for ever. 
28572 This place smells foul. Everything I touched was greasy. The place is filthy. Wonder what condition the kitchen is in behind that curtain? I could care less how the food tastes. 
28573 The Arms is whatever you make of it. It holds a great local experience. The atmosphere is one of the best in Poco. The crowds on the younger side but people seem to mingle well here. 
28574 Wonderfful Honda Accord Shopping experience. Ask for Kelvin, a very nice, knowledgeable and helpful salesman 
28575 I am so happy I bought the car with him! 
28576 It's a nice afternoon walk around the neighborhood. It's easy to access and sprawling with restaurants. 
28577 Love the happy hour. Staff are always very helpful. Food is always delicious! Crab and artichoke dip is delicious! We have enjoyed most everything we have ever got here! 
28578 Best food ive ever had. Everything was perfect. First tine ive had real Italian food. Meatballs were amazing the slice of pizza I had was amazing and everuone was really nice. 
28579 If you're from lake Mary this is the place to go. My first visit here and I am officially never going anywhere else. Too many great things about this little spot to list. Just check it out. 
28580 Very very fresh and good!! This place is Awesme. Attention to the food is great- a chef who cares!!! Thank you! 
28581 Horrible service overall. Slow. Unprofessional. Rude. I expected better from management and they're just as bad as the servers. Won't be returning to this place. 
28582 The food is great! Drink selection is nice. Definitely a nice spot for after work. I went there a couple months ago and it took almost 30 to get my drink. To be fair, I've been there since and haven't had an issue. The food is worth it. 
28583 This place was a must try! The only complaint I have is that the paella was a little under seasoned, but everything else was great. The chicken and garlic was delicious and the lobster croquette were awesome too. 
28584 life-changing sushi spot try the proper roll. its not on the menu, but its a special hidden gem. the miso cod is better than drugs. i cannot stress strongly enough how awesome this place is. 
28585 Finally this place got an upgrade!!! The service is way better too!! Angelo took care of us 
28586 We had an excellent dinner here. I love the open kitchen and the spacious well-lighted interior. They have a good menu and terrific service. This is a comfortable place to have a good meal and a glass of wine. 
28587 Great customer service, great food and good social environment for brunch or Sunday Funday!! 
28588 Always a good experience with front desk and care givers, friendly, professional, knowledgeable service. Easy check in and check out process. They listen and discuss all concerns. 
28589 Red River Market is super convenient based on where I live. The owners are very friendly and are always bringing in new items for us. 
28590 The haircut was fine but my stylist (Oyuky) was incredibly rude. I don't plan on going back to this location. 
28591 It's close, it's not quick, but it's easy to get to and have lots of lunch and dinner options. Breakfast on the other hand had pretty limited options. It's a quick service food court. You really can't expect much. 
28592 I heard horrible things about their service a few years ago, so I have avoided it. My experience could not have been more pleasant, unless they would have massaged my feet while I waited. Two thumbs up 
28593 The pizza was mediocre and the service was awful. Our drinks were never refilled and we were waiting a solid 15 minutes for the check and another 10 to cash out. Thanks but no thanks. 
28594 This is our 2nd trip to Disney that included this awesome restaurant. We live Yak and Yeti today I had the Korean Beef and it was amazing! The service is always on point and the food never disappoints! Will visit every time we are at Disney! 
28595 Great sports bar if you don't spending the $$. You can easily watch sport and lose track of how much youre spending. The burgers are great. The fries are amazing. The wings are fantastic. I really like this place. 
28596 Would have been an amazing time, with the exception of the Massive crowd. Have fun!! It is something to do with the family that's pretty interesting. 
28597 super fast and friendly service! They helped me out with my tire situation and bent my rim back in place. I will be a returning customer next time I need any work done! 
28598 Pho Dac Biet: 5.5/10. As a SF native, I can't say I'm amazed by the food here. - Broth was not very flavorful - Decent amount of toppings Che Oregon: 7/10. - Nutty - This is a dessert! Not a drink. Remember that 
28599 To be clear, they just moved, they're not closed. They are now located on SE Belmont. 
28600 Did a great job-very thorough. Would call again. The carpet looks great and the price was reasonable as well. Very nice gentleman-didn't try to sell me anything extra. No hidden costs, etc. 
28601 This place is not open!!!!! I walked all over looking for it and it does not exist!!! What a troll 
28602 We landed in Orlando looking for a good place to eat and are happy with the choice we made Service, food, and prices were great. Atmosphere was causal and we sat right by the water. Wonderful first night in Florida. 
28603 Poor rating because I walkd up to one of my fave lunch spots in Tanasbourne and it was closed for business. Must've happened this week, since I swear I was just there last week... Sad....another one bites the dust. 
28604 This is basically my favorite sushi place. EVER. I've never gotten any of the cooked entrees here but the sushi is always fresh and delicious. I've gotten some cooked appetizers which were also good. The prices are great, they have brown rice sushi, and service is always quick and friendly. 
28605 Excellent food. Homemade, hot fries. The eggplant is cooked to perfection! The falafel is fresh, soft and spicy. The cucumber salad comes with tahini hummus. The iraqi style chicken is incredibly delicious! The guy preparing the food is super nice and hopefully ok after the 100F heat today. 
28606 Swing and a miss 3 times. strike out. sorry, Bisto 20. american, big portions... Service, food quality and timing was poor-to-average. I had high hopes for this place when they came in. I feel like they let the local dining community down. 
28607 Sooo, it is very hard to find someone to beat my vegan chili but she was serving up the best here. On top of Fritos (no other way)! 
28608 I came in after work and was the only person there. I ordered the lauded Salmon Eggs Benedict and was a bit disappointed. The flavor was flat, the fish dry and the patio was roaring with morning rush hour traffic. Too many awesome places in town to come back here. 
28609 Ron at MIlwaukie tire is the man. I just got four tires installed on my car with double the mileage "warranty" for the same price as less miles at Les Schwab. Ron provides the same services as Les Schwab only locally but still a great value for the money. 
28610 Great inexpensive, clean....first run movies for under $6 before six...saw "Black Panther" as first run movie....inexpensive snacks as well. Will be back. 
28611 This review was purely about observations of Caliga with dogs, she demonstrates great passion, her approach is simply different. 
28612 Been here a few times and it's great. Super reasonable prices for an hour of bliss. There's a Mexican restaurant and tons of Chinese restaurants nearby too if you want to do dinner first (or after) coming here, too. 
28613 Great eats straight out of the sixties. Buns toasted to perfection. Foot long super sausage done right with Roake sauce onions and mustard. Perfection on a roll. Bring cash they don't take plastic. 
28614 I live three blocks from here and have gained 9 lbs since moving here 3 months ago. Coincidence? I think not. The staff is also very friendly. Honestly the best meatballs within 25 miles (that I have tasted and I have tasted many) 
28615 The store has the best service department in Austin. Great customer service and reasonable prices and done quickly and with a smile. 
28616 I have taken my valentines, jimmy choos and other Desighner shoes to him. His work is amazing. He works fast and clean. 
28617 Food,service,ambiance is great as always Highly recommended if your looking for the off the SXSW path to enjoy authentic Aloha flavors. 
28618 Great restaurant with great service. We were waited on by Matt from philadelphia. The food was outstanding and well worth the 20 minute wait to get in. The house special fried rice and ribs were tasty and savory. I will visit this place again 
28619 Came in here for an emergency issue with my bill and Alexander and Israel where extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I got my bill handled and dealt with! 
28620 I needed to fix my nails and I'm on vacation. Thankfully I was able to find a great place to get my nails done. Tommy did a fantastic job on my hands and feet! Too bad he doesn't live in California because I would go to him religiously!! 
28621 I really liked this place. Four stars because the service was slow, despite telling the server we had a movie to get to. Otherwise, the server was lovely and the sandwiches were top notch. I can't wait to go ahead. 
28622 I love this place. I go there often and leave satisfied. I appreciate how the owner is hands on. Highly recommended! 
28623 Love love love!!! They have a surprisingly good brunch and my dad visits from Tampa just to have their Bloody Marys. Also great for lunch and dinner. Not super fancy so it's good for when you don't want fast food but don't feel like dressing up 
28624 Wonderfully attentive & friendly bartenders. Really tasty bar food (love the black Mac) & good selection of beer, wine, & of course cocktails. 
28625 This place is amazing. The pizza is off the charts and tastes like real Italian pizza (and was extremely well-priced). Also the staff was friendly and service was quick. 
28626 One of my favorite places. Happy hour is the best, staff is so friendly and I love the atmosphere. Been here for brunch, lunch and dinner. Never had a bad meal. Never disappoints. Highly recommend it. 
28627 Oysters are amazing. Our waitress was filled with knowledge and had great advice. Yum! Great atmosphere and really not long wait at all!! They will text you when your table is ready. Hillary was our waitress and she provided such great tips! 
28628 I absolutely love McGrath Cosmetic and refuse to go anywhere else for cosmetic procedures. Dr. McGrath performs my botox injections and Tina takes care of my chemabrasions. The staff is always nice and friendly and the prices are great! 
28629 Very friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere. I was told what I needed to have done but didn't receive the high pressure sales pitch like other offices. I would recommend them to all my friends and family. 
28630 Buffet: not the best I've ever had, but cheap and has a wide section, along with a yummy milky chai tea jug. Service was very attentive, and I would return for for the 7-day lunch buffet for 8,95 any time. 
28631 Black Bear Diner is officially our new breakfast place. The staff is friendly, the portions are HUGE, and the food is extremely tasty! 
28632 Randomly selected to go here...and it got lucky...food, atmosphere and service was 5 stars... We opted for mussels and beet salad ... Wish could have eaten more... But portions are quite big... Can't wait to come back 
28633 Really unfortunate to sit and wait for 11minutes with absolutely no acknowledgment that a customer is waiting. The least you could do is acknowledge that someone is waiting. Not even that...Sorry bad experience. We left. 
28634 Loved the service here at Gordoughs. Emma is the sweetest server, she was always asking how we were doing and how the food was; she genuinely cared! The food was delicious as well--overall a superb experience! 
28635 Great food, great atmosphere, and great service!!! The absolute BEST pizza I've ever had...fig & prosciutto...amazing!!! The barbecue chicken pizza is fabulous too! 
28636 Things got way better here. Get the original fried chicken, with no sauces (get it on the side if you want). Totally stuffed and happy. Chicken and beer, no better combo! Gonna come to try the budaejjigae next! 
28637 I have driven by this place so many times and now regret not stopping in sooner. Easy to park, damn good espresso and steamed milk. I will be back! 
28638 I recommend the aragula salad with shiitake mushrooms and a spoon of butternut squash puree. The kobe burger ranks among the top 5 burgers I have ever eaten and comes with french fries flavored with spices. I will definitely come back to this restaurant and try some other dishes. 
28639 Went here twice in 1 weekend! I liked their strawberry roasted coconut flavor better than the flavors at Salt and Straw. 
28640 Good little Saturday happy hour. Great service. Recommendation? Expand your bar, it's one of the only classy yet fairly casual (i.e., nice bar w/ o that tavern feel) places on this section of fremont. looking forward to coming back and trying the food (we had dinner plans already) 
28641 My eyebrows came out just okay. I did ask her not to thread in certain areas (the middle of my eyebrow) and she did anyway, which was a bit disappointing since I've been trying to grow that area back in. Overall, okay experience. 
28642 Stopped in to sample some beer and ended up getting a pizza - the Pig and Fig. Both were excellent. Service was outstanding. Have a great selection of beers other than Oskar Blues, especially from Cigar City. 
28643 Love the vibe here. Huge windows make overcast winter days feel bright. Music and variety of seating also make it a perfect study spot. Interesting food too -- perfect when you want something different than a normal cafe pastry selection! Feta herb scone + hot mulled cider is perfect. 
28644 Went here for Sunday brunch with my family. I loved the atmosphere. The service was excellent! I had the Honey Dipped Fried Chicken. Savory and filling. Judging from my family's reaction of their dishes, you really can't go wrong with any selection on the menu. 
28645 Tamara Greer has been cutting my hair for almost 10 years. She is the ABSOLUTE best. I won't let anyone else touch my hair, even though I now live in San Antonio. I drive to get her fabulous work. 
28646 Again this place has it all. The guys were looking for that happening happy hour. This was it. We got great drinks, cheap, and the boneless wins and Mac and cheese are good. Music was good and the place had a hookah lounge 
28647 this place is sick but they no longer have hush puppies on the menu and it makes me sad. please bring those foods back so i am no longer sad. 
28648 The food was authentic and the staff was friendly. We ordered veggie fried rice, string beans, and basil tofu - all veganized. They were accommodating and quick. My two kids loved it. 
28649 Great service! The most honest and trustworthy mechanics in town. I would highly recommend this garage to anyone. They are always busy (because they are great at what they do). But they work hard and provide reasonable estimates of when the work will be done. 
28650 Been going here for years and always had great food and service especially at the Bar with Hayley. Rumors they are adding more TV's for Football but changing the Bones Card Rules which might suck??? 
28651 The best ramen I've been to in Vancouver. The only thing I don't like about the place is that it requires a minimum order. I just wanted to share the most expensive ramen cause I was full already. But other than that it was a good experience. 
28652 Lunch was absolutely incredible! Had the butter chicken, which must have been the best I have ever had! The naan is fresh and delicious. Everything was fantastic - the service, the food, and the atmosphere. I will definitely be back here again soon. 
28653 The burgers are top-notch. You may not like every burger on the menu but they have a good selection. It's a popular place so expect to be in line for 30-45 min. They will serve drinks while you're waiting. 
28654 Classic, old school men's barber shop with black and white checkerboard floor and Sinatra on the radio. I got a solid, conservative cut for $16. The barbers know their customers and give nice, thorough service. 
28655 In town for a long weekend with the kids. Looking for a sit down local pizza shop. Found this place on Yelp. Best decision we made all weekend. Pizza was excellent,wings were supper, but the Stromboli was out of this world. Our waiter Dave was great,very informative and entertaining. 
28656 The Butter Paneer Curry is amazing!!! The staff is also super friendly and willing to help. The food is also very authentic and is the best in Hillsboro! 
28657 Nail chipped the day after I got a gel acrylic set..... So disappointed :( also got my eyebrows waxed and they came out awful 
28658 I sometimes like to drive into the old neighborhood for Sunday brunch. Good service and food. Nothing special, just what I expect. Decent solid food and service. Really good Bloody Mary's. I like both locations 
28659 Amazing food, perfect ambiance! The seafood tower a must, as well as the steak and lobster tartare. Remarkable, memorable, lovely. 
28660 Wawa came to stay! Love the practicality and the subs at any time, coffee is excellent with a great variety and breakfast has nothing to envy to McDonald or dunkin. 
28661 Best doughnuts ever! Amazing service. My friend and I couldn't decide between one doughnut to split. After we paid, she gave us the other doughnut we were looking at just because. This place is way better than Voodoo doughnuts! 
28662 Love the noodles here!! And it is clean. I didn't see any spider web or any suspicious dirty things. It is a tiny place but it is authentic Chinese noodles. I am even willing to drive from South to get noodles from them since they sell the south one. 
28663 One of the best sandwiches in the city. Hummus is outstanding! Great bar next door too. 
28664 The fro yo is cheap and yummy. Its like 2.50 for a full cup. The restaurant kind of smells funny though...like a dirty mop. Not yummy. 
28665 I love seeing everything that Verna creates. There is literally no event that can't create something for. I've seen her do weddings, birthdays, all holidays imaginable, sporting events, corporate events, etc. She did my Aunt's wedding and the arrangements were breathtaking. 
28666 Use to go all the time. The cilantro sauce calls my nameee! So good and delicious reminds me of some places i use to eat in miami. So good soooo good :)) 
28667 I wait outside for one hour but the food is just okay and the hashbrown sucks.When I take a bit I can't fell potato I feel like I'm drinking oil. 
28668 Until this past Saturday, we thought we had finally found the best Italian sub around. These subs were lousy; very skimpy on everything. Very little meat, they didn't give us the hot peppers we wanted on either sub, and there was hardly any pickles, etc. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! Won't be back. 
28669 Located in a Heritage House, this cafe has a genuine European feel. The coffee is outstanding and worthy of return visits. The food is freshly made and yummy. Child friendly and relaxed, in a great location. Nice unique addition to the neighborhood of chain stores 
28670 a quaint little diner with better food than other reviews led me to expect. the wait staff was pleasant, service was quick and the bacon was great! 
28671 Wooden, sticky, loud, crowded, beer-spilling, loud obnoxious Irish music-playing place. Beware. You must be extraordinarily drunk to enjoy. 
28672 Worst service ever of the 5 years I lived in ATX, and food wasn't even that great... there are better places for cajun food in Austin... 
28673 Till now best thai in Austin. Spicy as hell!! Jungle Curry is so flavor full but damn spicy, Vietnamese coffee and vegetarian options are great too. 
28674 Chain restaurants always disappoint. Service was S L O W. App salad greens appeared to have been through a war. Not sure what kind of chef would serve this. Grilled shrimp OK but low value at $16.99. 
28675 Every single person who works there is super sweet and really kind. I go here 1-2x a week for quick lunch instead of fast food and its always the same. I like consistency. Its fresh, HUGE portions, and the price is extremely fair. 
28676 Moldy samosa manager returned my $ and apologized. Just be aware of what you eat, I unfortunately ate half of it :( 
28677 Whaaaaat?!?! I've lived up north now for eight months and *just now* found out there's a Chisholm Trail up here? I was led to believe there was only one in Lockhart. It's mighty delicious barbecue, folks. Run, not walk, there and get yourself some ribs! 
28678 Advertises all you can drink Wednesday nights for $10 starting at 10pm. Except that's doesn't include beer. And the main room / DJ doesn't start until 11pm. Oh, and parking is $5. Number of other people here? 0. Likelihood I'll be coming back? 0. 
28679 Disappointing food after I'd read so many positive reviews. There were four of us each ordering a different lunch, but not one of us thought the food lived up to the hype. Service was very slow despite the paucity of patrons. Perhaps we just hit this on a bad day? 
28680 Loved it!!!! Had the Cajun Queen Pizza. Really good. Great service and FABULOUS PIZZA! !! 
28681 they got very nice stuff there. dont mind to shop there again. 
28682 Went with a large group from work and literally told the waiter to choose the food for us. It was absolutely wonderful what they brought us to eat and the correct amount. The staff was attentive, and friendly. We had a wonderful time. Highly recommended. 
28683 AMAZING atmosphere! I walked around for 5 minutes looking at everything before even ordering. Most unique take on chicken and waffles I've ever had. Hands down best night time hangout in North Austin. P.S.... their Matcha Latte is to die for! 
28684 Scorpion Bowls. Do not order anything else here. You will make friends fast if you order one. This is a total meat market, so if that's what you are looking for, go here. Fun is had by all. Nasty bathrooms though. 
28685 This place is 3rd world. The wifi doesn't work at all. The rooms aren't clean after servicing, there's somebody's hair in my towel, it's disgusting here! 
28686 We held a post Baptism party at Granite Grill. Joseph and team were excellent and were on top of everything. The food (steak tips, mashed, mixed vegetables and chicken marsala) was tremendous as well. Thank you Joseph and team for having us! 
28687 These are the best donuts. The old fashioned buttermilk is crispy outside and fluffy and light inside. The best! 
28688 Meh, I've had better, like Ameer's grill. Had the lunch combo for around $9. Salad, rice, & meat were just ok. 
28689 They have moved. They are now on Manchaca. Terrible ending to 2 mile walk. 
28690 Food is plain, but very tasty and original...Lamb is to die for! Pizza is the best, no wonder they are Zagat rated.. Could use a little face lift. 
28691 Made Sunday brunch reservations. Took my grandson. The location is nice, because it's not right on the mall. Pretty restaurant. Good service. Not amazing food, but not anything to complain about. No hesitation going back. 
28692 Poor service.salad brought out after the fact.no water refill and overpriced.please keep driving to ther places. 
28693 I really liked this place, very friendly employees, I would go back just for the great service. I got a chicken parm sub and it was delicious, can't wait to try the pizza which I heard was great! 
28694 This is our go-to restaurant every time we are in the north end. We never have a problem finding a table and the food is always great. You can tell the sauces are made fresh in house. 
28695 Awesome experience...great food , great service and a friendly staff this restaurant is a must try you will not be sorry! 
28696 WOW! Hands down one of my Favorite dining experiences I've ever had! I loved everything about my experience. Food was unreal. Drinks were great. Staff was amazing. 
28697 Super pricey for a hotpot restaurant. Nearly $150 for 3 ppl. The portions were insanely small. The hotpot was tasty, to be fair, but will not come back again. 
28698 From the undercooked beans to the Rice-a-Roni filling, I can't imagine a worse burrito. 
28699 Great Vietnamese food at a place that doesn't break the piggy bank. They have some healthy savory dishes that keeps you coming back Pho more! It is not the cleanest restaurant so give those chopsticks a little second look! 
28700 100 times better than Platos Closet, I would compare this store to a used Urban Outfitters! Buyback is way better of a rate than Platos Closet. 
28701 Not worth the price, ordered the chicken wings off the lunch menu and only got 4 wings what the heck. 
28702 I went many times to figure out what was wrong with my car. They were very patient every time, made to sure explain everything to me and, best of all, didn't try to oversell me unnecessary services. They are extremely knowledgeable and honest. 
28703 The spa itself is nice, friendly staff. I've had massages from California to New York to Thailand and no joke, Sam gave me hands down the best one I've ever had. Literally. Thank you!!!! 
28704 Have you tried their steak tips dinner. OMG it is so delicious! on top of that, salads are always fresh, and meat is always soft and juicy 
28705 They do not season their food. The food wasn't bad it just didn't taste like anything. I noticed everyone in the restaurant were a lot older btw. 
28706 Went here after work with a big group of friends for dinner & drinks. Delicious appetizers and great margaritas! Definately will be coming back again! 
28707 I love this little Southwest American diner. No frills. Just damn good breakfast and the servers are friendly. 
28708 This is a wonderful spot for happy hour. The prices are amazing and the food is always delicious. We have never had a bad experience here. Wait staff gets a gold star! 
28709 Extremely rude waiting staff. There was one seat that was available that was clean but wobbly and broken and I asked the waitress if we could sit somewhere else once she cleaned and she rudely insisted that we stay put. Definitely lost my business 
28710 Renovation is a must. U can't believe the sound of the A/C, and the shower is ridiculous. If u wanna punish yourself u have to stay in that hotel we have moved to another one ! 
28711 I used to eat here all the time and LOVED it...then I ordered something with shrimp and got the WORST food poisoning imaginable. I don't wish that pain upon anyone. 
28712 Seriously great pizza. Very fresh. Crispy crust. Very nice place, friendly with seating and take out. They have a 2-slice special that is perfect. 
28713 Churches chicken is great. OK sometimes you have to wait but it's really great chicken. The manager is super talent and the crazy customers that come in. I get a great deal. The coleslaw sI really outstanding and chicken is just great 
28714 Very spacious, two floors with lots of seating on the second floor. Barista on both floors. Accessible with elevator that goes from basement (bathroom) to second floor. However, you will need a receipt to get to the bathroom so keep your receipt! 
28715 Their Lemon Curd doughnut was fantastic! I cant wait to go back! They had super good food and super good service! I cant wait for next week so i can pick some more doughnuts up to share with my office! 
28716 perhaps it was the rain today... but true grounds reminded me of cafe petra in the mission. true grounds will be my new home away from home. 
28717 AMAZING! The gyro and onion rings are worth the 25 miles drive from Kissimmee. This is now my favorite go to place! 
28718 Theo's was extremely hospitable when we came near closing and realized we didn't have cash. The food was a perfect cozy brunch time meal and waffles are amazing. They are cash only and actually close at 2:30 FYI. 
28719 Really enjoyed the tour, I thought it was a little pricey only to find a $3 coupon here on yelp after the fact (disappointing), but our tour guide was energetic and engaging. 
28720 Great burger place! They have every topping you need for a burger! Atmosphere is relaxing during lunch hour. No line when I came, someone also came over and asked if I needed anything even though this is a seat yourself place! 
28721 Best chocolate chip pancakes in Columbus. This is the place to come for great diner classics. 
28722 My favorite bubble tea in all of Portland! Vanilla, with strawberry bursting bubbles. 
28723 Really good food for the price. And the serving amount is huge compared to other places. I love having a place to go eat at when craving Japanese food that isn't crazy expensive and the food is still made fresh in front of you. 
28724 Asmara is a pretty good place to go for vegetarians. Go with a few of your friends and order the vegetarian combo. Deliciously spiced peas and lentils, vegetables, etc all served with that strange bread called Injera. Nice atmosphere too. 
28725 Order the Margarita for take out. Similar to Quattro, but much much better. The only reason why I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is that got take out, so I have a hard time with the "woohoo! as good as it gets!" 
28726 real Irish pub very good food they invent new menu all the time great servers lots of beer to chose from worth the trip i would take anyone there for lunch dinner or just to have one 
28727 Great place! Great hairdressers! Very professional. You can get a Groupon on line most of the time for a good deal! 
28728 Excellent! Went here today for breakfast with a good friend and were treated like royalty. The people were so accommodating and friendly. The food was delicious! Love the decor and the ambiance. Will definitely be back. 
28729 This place is very unique. Hidden away in the cobblestone streets of German village, you will find Schmidt's. Historic and fun, reminded me of being at October fest in Munich. Their applesauce is insanely good, as well as their pretzel bites. 
28730 Very good ! Perfect for a sweet snack after hot pot !! Got the passion fruit green tea boba and Dulce de leche cream puff ! I recommend !! 
28731 This Autozone rules. I walked in the door, got my battery tested and a new one installed by a friendly employee in less than 15 minutes. Autozone, you made my day suck so much less. Thanks for fixing my car. Well done! 
28732 Average tacos built by a stoner who can't keep an order straight to save his life. Make sure you yell your order loudly over his the blaring music, and you may luck out and get something similar to what you wanted. 
28733 Good prompt service for lunch. Sushi was fresh and very tasty. Great atmosphere. Would recommend giving it a try. 
28734 Have you heard the Italo's rules? My friends explained them to me. "Once you go past Italo's, you cannot return from whence you came without stopping at Italo's for a beer......and maybe some pepperoni rolls." Abide by the rules people. They exist for a reason. 
28735 For the price, I thought it was pretty good. I had a taco that was just like the Dirty Sanchez from Torchy's 
28736 Service was a little slow, but nothing horrendous. 
28737 Years since I've been because I received raw quiche. When I told the watress she replied, "that's how we serve it here." ok... Tried it a few times since then and the food was just meh and the seating was uncomfortable. 
28738 Great new spot in Summerport. Excellent selection of gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches (they tasted amazing!) and an equally gratifying selection of craft beer on tap. Definitely recommended for anyone in the neighborhood to stop by! 
28739 Oh oh... watch out Kafka... I love the coffee here. Great space in a great block is just icing on the cake. 
28740 Oh yea nice and simple home cooking. This place is always packed so that should tell you something.No matter which Cracker Barrel I got down here in Florida or up north in CT they always are consistent. 
28741 Been here twice, have had basically all appetizers and ceviches (Tiraditos are the best!) and both times have gotten the Churrasco steak. Unfortunately have not made it to desserts so far but the cocktails are great too! Service great so far - highly recommend 
28742 Great time! Staff was awesome and menu items were intriguingly different. We loved our time here. Speak to Jocelyn for all beverage request! Drinks are made to perfection! 
28743 My local - was sad to see the weird old bodega go but how could I be angry about that when this is what replaced it. The standard to judge all others by. 
28744 My happy hour go to spot. Tina is always there ready to take my crews order with a smile and the food is amazing. The location is also very convenient and the atmosphere is exactly what you would expect from the area. 
28745 Decent sandwich shop with good chicken parm. Their pizza slices are giant (1/4 of a pie), cheap and delicious. 
28746 Waited no less then 10 minds at drive thru with 1 car in front of me, no one inside. Manager experienced explained they were short staffed. Offered complimentary food, but, oh sorry we're out of that! Ugh, drove 4 miles to next one, served in mins. 
28747 Very informational, interactive and fun. The actors were good. What's better than throwing tea into the harbor? You'll get the true Boston experience here. 
28748 I prefer my home turf hollywood location but this one is large i just am not familiar with where everything is. The hollywood spot seems to have a larger wine/beer selection also. You cant go wrong though. Grocery outlet is bomb either way. Bargains for days! 
28749 This place is really great if you like to dance and have some drinks. This place is perfect for night life because it has a DJ playing cool music. This is totally for the party animal crowd. I do recommend. Stay thirsty my friends. 
28750 Love this place! Great low carb low sugar place for a treat!! They are super nice, highly recommend!! 
28751 Dinner here is otherworldly. The combination of flavors is so unique and nuanced. Every bite was a delight! Hard to get in, so make a rez well in advance. 
28752 Burgers very good and made using grass fed beef. Nice choice of daily specials...I ordered the sweet potato hushpuppies with caramel sauce as a side. They were as amazing as they sounded. Beer selection pairs perfectly with the food menu. 
28753 Glen of Mr. Inspector is wonderful! He is so easy to talk to and throughly explains all of his "findings". He made the whole inspection process so much easier than I thought it would be! I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a professional and personable Inspector :) 
28754 Best taco Tuesday in Seminole County!! good quality street tacos for one dollar. the horchata is very tasty as well! Thursday is half of chimichangas...one of the tastiest i've ever had! Worth a try if you like authentic Mexican.. 
28755 What a pleasant surprise in a neighbourhood full of chains! This little independent is bright, modern, and has killer coffee. Perfect place to do some work - it's not crowded, it's quiet, and has fast internet. 
28756 Great BBQ! We're in town visiting from LA & knew we needed some of this famous Texas BBQ. Well, Terry Blacks did not disappoint! The brisket was so tender I cut it with a fork! 
28757 Stopped in for dinner for a well known breakfast place, did not let down. Tacos were on point, great beer selection and staff is always awesome. 
28758 The burger was good, but not outstanding. Honestly I can make better burger at home. I feel it is a bit pricy since the price does not include fries. (I guess they use decent quality of meat ..and thats why it is expensive?) 
28759 I came on vacation from FL and honestly we just stopped here because is was the only place that was open late for food, Rory made our night, he was the best server I ever had!!! Food was good too!!! 
28760 Swung by on the way home. Matt gave some great personal service in taking my order. Great menu & fun kitchen to gaze into. I got the lamb kebobs and salmon kebobs. The three different sauces were amazing. New go-to place. 
28761 Ummm where is all the beer???? Wow this has gone downhill. I don't come to The Beer and Wine Festival to buy toys, dog leashes and time shares. When I move to Sonoma I won't be flying back here for this one. Beyond Disappointed 
28762 Hands down best southern Italian cuisine in Boston (only Santarpios makes the best pizza). Their house red wine is steady and full, and the "calamari veneziana" is to die for. Highly recommended, friendly service. 
28763 Nice ppl clean and oh wow and the food looks and taste great! I love it! Taste like a deli in New York! This is my new spot! The best! I give it 5 stars yummy.... 
28764 Such great chicken kabob subs. The women who work here are so nice and the men in the kitchen are friendly also! Gets busy everyday around lunch time but definitely worth the wait! 
28765 Mediocre Chinese buffet that also has some sushi rolls. Should not be called a sushi buffet .. the teppanyaki grill food was over cooked and tough. 
28766 Best chocolate in the city, beautiful cakes. My absolute favorite is the almond croissant. 
28767 Food was ok. Mashed potatoes came out cold but the full rack of BBQ ribs had a great flavor to them. Service was slow especially for a Wednesday night at 8:00 pm. 
28768 Went for happy hour. The bartenders are very friendly and the blue cheese chips are delicious. 
28769 Authentic Cuban Cusine! Ive visited cafe pinata a few times and haven't been disappointed. They have great Cuban and steak sandwiches. Great Cuban coffee and awesome lunch specials. Friendly service. If your inThe area try them out. 
28770 The service is awful and the help is arrogant and the food is over priced this is only in the Clermont location 
28771 fun place and voodoo donuts are just around the corner. 
28772 This place has gone down significantly. Food came out cold. Servers were very rude. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who enjoys authentic Chinese food. 
28773 They are open after bar time and have breakfast tacos! This is my new late night snack spot. Try the gangsta queso and ACP. 
28774 I've taken both my cars there and gotten free tail light replacements 
28775 They are quick & friendly. 
28776 Very overpriced for the quality and quantity of food that you receive. We ordered take out based off of their online menu, and when we arrived, the prices were all higher than what was listed online. Will not be returning. 
28777 i got the foot reflexology massage by a guy and it was AMAZING. he was so great i told him i loved him 3 times. i've done a lot of foot reflexology before and this was really really great. place was okay but the guy was great. 
28778 OMG. The food is amazing. Breakfast and lunch have not had a chance to try the dinners. The cafe con leche is my ultimate favorite from miles around. Great job Zaza and please don't change at all. 
28779 Superb food with generous portions and great price. The service is also great and the staff are very helpful. 
28780 Donuts are good, but super super sweet. You definitely need a black coffee to enjoy them properly. 
28781 A great dental office! Friendly, imminently capable and always explains every step. They are the best 
28782 Definitely NOT for health conscience people. We ordered Mulan Fish and Egg Plant with Basil and they were drenched in oil! 
28783 Excellent and AUTHENTIC tapas restaurant. People are very friendly here, food is excellent and the atmosphere cozy. We had a sampling of what seemed like everything! Homemade bread, Jamon Iberico (amazing) and plenty of patats bravas with all the trimmings! 2nd time here and will return. This restaurant NEVER disappoints! 
28784 Great People and very competitive prices. This is a national chain but the guys are very friendly and helpful. I bought two road bike and one for my daughter and I am a happy customer! I can recomment them for sure. 
28785 Sublime airport sushi. Extensive wine and cocktail list. The nigiri was exceptional. Get to the airport early and indulge. 
28786 Always consistently delicious food. Brunch is quite good. I have never had anything I would not order again. Everyone I have taken here is always impressed. 
28787 Best groomer I've been to. Everyone is super nice and they always give my dog a great wash and cut. 
28788 Great atmosphere, one of the best waitresses "Steph" I've ever had. Will definitely come back again. Good craft beer choices. 
28789 the epitome of love and hate. i hate your dumb trampy club wear and crappy shoes. i love my new "planet earth inspired" organic cotton t shirt. don't do me like that, forever 21. 
28790 My partner was recently in an accident and ended up at this auto body shop. I admit I was skeptical but it was his car so be it. Well he was very happy with the service. John was very courteous and did a great job. 
28791 Babica Hen is the old European roadside inn I never knew I needed until I arrived there by chance. Each time I eat there I feel as satisfied as a hobbit tucking in for elevenses. 
28792 Stopped in for a glass of wine and an appetizer. Sat at bar and had fried calamari. Tender and delicious. Service was great. 
28793 the waitress is in a bad mood who doesnt even separate the check for me and forces us to pay in one bill. 
28794 Whenever I'm on International Dr this is the place that I lovvveee to eat at. why, you say????.... Because of the delicious skillet cornbread and the awesome juicy burgers. Its kind of a fancy dancy /dim light place but I really have enjoyed dining in every single time. 
28795 The best cafe ever 
28796 fresh food and super clean place 
28797 fresh fruit smoothies and fresh baked pastries everyday with a fantastic coffee 
28798 Food was very good. I had the fried pork with onions, very good. I also loved the empanadas. Place is a little loud for my taste, but I'll come back. 
28799 Had a birthday party here tonight (first time visit) for 16 people. Food was excellent and service was excellent. Sampled the Pad Thai, Dragon Boat (Sig dish), fish & chips which were all great. Chocolate Brownie with ice cream fantastic. 
28800 This is by far the best ice cream place around. Super creamy and always made just perfect. Generous amount of mix ins too! 
28801 First... Have an updated GPS Second... Find a parking place (not easy) Third... Enjoy a great pizza Want a side salad... NO Want dessert...NO Want an appetizer...NO Just great Pizza!! 
28802 Our basement looks amazing! Definitely recommend these guys for a future project for anyone. 
28803 Small portions and at best Olive Garden quality and taste. Belay that, Go to OG and have a better meal. Four of us ate at Bar Americano and only one gave a Passing grade of C-. 
28804 Came here for the wine tasting. Had to become a member. Had to wait a while but it was worth the wait. Staff was very helpful. Definitely a great place for wining and dining. Prices were great as well. 
28805 Wow this makes Starbucks taste like burnt broccoli. --Filthy Chai w/ 2+ espresso shots -- Moonraker w/ 4 shots of espresso that are smooth & delicious, w/ moon milk, chilled + served without ice. MMMMMM! 
28806 Very good! The brisket was perfectly cooked and the sides were good too! Wide variety of beers to choose from and you will definitely leave satisfied and full! 
28807 Your typical industrialized operation, chepo design, linoleum floors, poor temperature control and ventilation, overcrowded. Teachers are overworked and give you no attention. 
28808 Thank you for being here Ava! Thanks Julia for excellent customer service and for making me smile. That puts a whole new spin on my day! Keep on roasting! 
28809 Yummy spring rolls!! I've gone here quite a few times and the food is usually pretty good. The won-ton is well made as all their soup broths are delicious. Just somewhat strange how they only bring thing out of the kitchen at a time. 
28810 I go there a lot on my lunch break. They're super sweet and the salads are HUGE. The dressing is house made and BOMB af. Also, the a√ßa√≠ bowls are decadent. I love having them with the chocolate protein for a thicker consistency. 
28811 Still not impressed after about six trips at different times. Think they just can't figure out their niche or demographic, food has been inconsistent and service has been iffy. Since I'm local, I keep hoping they'll turn it around to draw me and friends back again and again. 
28812 I tried this place on GrubHub & got addicted. I'm obsessed with their coconut ice cream. They deliver to my house in like 20 mins. I've been ordering once a week. 
28813 Delicious cannoli. My friend got a cookie which he gobbled straight down. Definitely worth visiting even though it's on aback street, and no queues! 
28814 This is my favorite place to get my nails done at! As a former football players, we have to take care of our hands and feet. I drive from Buckhead to see Tracy, Bim, Bella and the Sisters!! Steve W. S F 49ers 
28815 It' s my favorite restaurant for eat hot chicken wings. The waitress are very nice. 
28816 This is my first time there and I would return. I like building my own salad with a nice variety of toppings. They kept the salad bar clean and had the vegetables that I enjoy to choose from. 
28817 This is mine and my dads favorite comfort food spot when he comes in town from Houston. Always great service and the food is delicious. I recommend the Country Clucker, but fair warning you will want to take a nap afterwards. 
28818 Everyone here was so polite and respectful. Gentleman even opened the car door for me. Great experience :) 
28819 Cobbler Bill wanted $84 for half soles and heel caps on a pair of Bass Weejuns in good shape, and said it would take two to three weeks. Shoe Repair did a very nice job of half soles and full heels for $50 in one week. Enough said. 
28820 Pretty decent Korean and Japanese place. Bulgolgi and fried ice cream are good here. This place used to be better. Nice decor but nothing too spectacular. 
28821 We recently moved to the SW area from downtown. For the past 6 months, we have been searching for our new go-to Thai restaurant and we have finally found it. The food is absolutely delicious! Not to mention, you can order takeout straight from the yelp out. 
28822 Delicious cappuccino and ham/cheese croissants. The ambiance is cozy and welcoming. A much needed addition to DTX. 
28823 The lemon poppyseed donut is delicious. Good selection of regular and unique flavors. Also a good split between cake and normal donuts. Way better and nicer than Voodoo donuts. 
28824 They accommodated our work group of 12 on a Wednesday. The server was a little inexperienced, but did a great job. The food (many different breakfast and lunch dishes) was loved by everyone. 
28825 I've bought 7 cars from this dealership in the last 10 years. That's not including all the vehicles my relatives and friends have bought as well. Never had a major issue and always been treated like I was their only client. They have my business for life. 
28826 I've travelled a lot and am used to getting shortchanged by quick fingered cashiered, but in Canada, not what I expected. Pretended I didn't know the Canadian silver, and shortchanged me.... 
28827 Look at the photo of the room we stayed in. Whats there to complain about. Definitely a recommend but the only thing is breakfast is what you pay what you get so OK in that area. Otherwise 4 stars all around. 
28828 The OG chipo - really doesn't need many words - gotta love a good burrito bowl time to time - just don't forget my dressing with my salad orders please!!! Shouldn't have to ask for it 
28829 I've never felt more comfortable and appreciated while also having hair pulled out of my body. Five red stars for these ladies. 
28830 My office has been using Merry Maids for a few months now. Can't say enough about the professionalism of Sarah and her team. Quality dependable service. Thanks Merry Maids! 
28831 The good thing about this Shoppers is that there is free parking. Yes free parking but you have to remember to register your vehicle. So came here to grab chocolate and go. Not bad. Looks and feel like all other Shoppers Drug Mart. 
28832 Decent food for the price, especially if you have coupon. The service is great! It can be a bit difficult to find. 
28833 The best food at an affordable price. It is worth the trip to come out to this spot. Octopus salad and Porchetta sandwich are a must try!!! 
28834 Very impressed with this place. Doctor was so informative and patient with our Igby (cat). Definitely coming back for customer service but overall because of how low the prices are. Truly affordable!!! 
28835 In town for training and stumbled upon this salon. I only got a pedi but it was fantastic. Great massage and hot stones. Everyone was also very friendly. I wish this place was in my home town. 
28836 I came here to get some shiny fabric for a sewing. Very friendly customer service and a variety of different shades. I needed metallic red thin and light material for a super girl costume I was making. 
28837 Terrible service, none of the bartenders greeted us or offered drinks, we ended up just walking out. Place reeked of cigarette smoke and puke... And maybe a dead rat. 
28838 Amazing Brazilian food. Everything great. For sure I'll be back in my next trip to Orlando. 
28839 Hair in my eggs....no need to say nothing more...but Yelp says my review is short... I should have known not to eat here when I saw the food score was an 87...I will not return never 
28840 Fun place to go. House music thumping and lots of people. Tons of good food on the menu. Waitress up sold us margaritas - which worked out fine. I'd go back the next time I'm in Boston. 
28841 Best coffee in the area! A tasty menu and friendly staff. Always nice to see the ever-changing art on the walls. And, the bookstore next door is worth a visit. 
28842 Excellent breakfast place never had lunch but I'm sure it's good. Very reasonable prices and friendly staff food comes quick and is on point. 
28843 This is a lovely spot, we had the Sashimi Lunch, Philly Roll, and Cherry Blossom Maki. There are several tables with horigotatsu seating and we were very excited to have our lunch at one of them! Great staff, service, and ambience :) 
28844 We loved our salad with apples, mango, onions, tomato, cilantro, and lime juice. The main dishes were pretty good, too, but it was a while ago and now I'm blanking on what they were. We'd definitely go back, maybe try the buffet some time. 
28845 Great place for drinks and appetizers late night. Good bar menu and friendly bar tender. The spicy pork nachos were awesome. Only odd thing is the smell when you come in. Not sure if it cleaning product or something else.... Yikes! Will be back hopefully after they clean/switch cleaners. 
28846 best. donuts. ever. and i say that having only tried a few flavors at various farmer's markets (i took my husband to the cambridge winter market specifically for the donuts). i can only imagine how much more dangerous it would be to go to the store. :) 
28847 Really, I'd go 3.5. Yummy guac and tacos. Steak rice bowl was over seasoned, portabello taco was under seasoned. Comically small tables for a tapas restaurant with so many plates and table accessories. 
28848 Way to go Cooper's Hawk. Love the attentive wait staff and the presentation. Our vendor reception was well taken care of, the special wines were served at perfect temperatures. We love the menu items at happy hour. Pretzel bread, loaded flat bread wedges and.....the Asian Slaw. 
28849 One of our favorite spots, food staff and atmosphere are great. Sweet potato fries are amazing. Have never been disappointed at Burton's. It's in our weekly rotation 
28850 Went there on a Friday night, oct 14. Workers were apathetic and slow. Haven't tried the pizza yet. If it's good I'll re-rate 
28851 If u r asking me to call customer support for every single problem then why the hell u r even running the store. I'm switching to some other carrier asap. 
28852 I have always loved this place, its is so weird and fun. Very Portland. The service is always quirky, pleasant and genuine. The desserts are fantastic and the space is a riot. Good times. 
28853 i'm so thrilled that I can get thai food delivered! great service! I've ordered now 3 times, super timely - orders are exactly what you ask for. Food is yummy. The pad thai doesn't travel as well as the other dishes - so recommend you stick w/stuff that travels well. 
28854 **Since I'm back in action, might as well post a few reviews that were in the pipeline.** Ever had a mango German Pancake? It'll change your whole perspective on hot breaded fruit. 
28855 Amazing! The design and ambiance are absolutely beautiful and the menu and plating was superb. I always get lamb when available and theirs is some of the very best. We sat at the counter and really enjoyed watching the chefs do their magic with smiles through the meal. Great restaurant! 
28856 Good food for good price! This place is ideal if you have a big family and don't want to break the wallet. We are regulars! 
28857 The Footlight Club is run entirely by volunteers. We welcome anyone who would like to get involved, whether that means you sing and dance, know your way around or lighting board, or are just really good at telling people where to sit. 
28858 My boyfriend and I enjoy going there for their Mala Spicy Pot. The food is very good and authentic. The service is also very good, always friendly and fast. FYI, they no longer serve sushi. They now have hot pot instead. 
28859 Walked into this store after a Walmart run... The staff is friendly and they have a good selection of flavors. The Madagascar vanilla was very different than any other vanilla you may have tasted. Garnish it with some fresh fruit for a good and refreshing dessert to beat the summer. 
28860 YES! MEAT!!! Very good quality and lots of choices. Frequent service! Come here hungry!!! 
28861 I enjoy their food, large portion sizes and it's tasty, good prices, friendly crew, visit regularly. 
28862 This is a family run business on the North Shore. They are extremely honest and reliable and truly transformed my apartment. I highly recommend them. Also available via text! I can't say enough good things, they are so nice too!! 
28863 This probably one of best burger places ever or at least in Texas. Look for something different try out hopdoddy burger. 
28864 Staff is great. Prices are fair and the food is good. Large variety of beers on draft. Peanut shells on the floor.....awesome. 
28865 Be warned! Extra shrimp on the Spicy Basil Pad Thai means only 2 more shrimp! It costs $3 extra. Not worth it...Overall, taste and quality is decent though. 
28866 Really friendly place, and obviously a local favorite. Good variety of inexpensive food; excellent queso. Not a lot of interior seating, but nice outdoor patio. 
28867 The place was clean, the service was great with Edel, and the food was tasty. I was here once before about a year and a half ago and it was completely different. Glad this place improved! Good job! 
28868 Buying experience (from RON CHIRRICK) was awesome! Since I've had some negative experiences at another dealership service lately, I thought I would write how great Beaverton Toyota Service Dept is - on time, honors the warranties/extended warranty, prompt, helpful. 
28869 Amazing buffalo burger on a gluten free bun!!! I will definitely be back!!! Even the cole slaw was phenomenal!!! 
28870 Have eaten here a number of times and it is good enough that we don't care that it is vegetarian. The thali is loads of food and filling as all heck. Service is a bit relaxed but hey, maybe that's so we can better digest the lentils. 
28871 Best haircut in town, hands down!! Alex and Syrus, these guys are simply professionals, they make you feel more than welcome, always in a good mood. They know what they're doing and they're spot on with what you want. VERY highly recommended, you wont be sorry, PROMISE!! 
28872 I always enjoy spending time wandering around and finding something I have not read before, also hunting the Buddah LOL You never know where he will be 
28873 Have been here 4 or 5 times and was happy each time. Service was great the employees there are enthusiastic and friendly. Portions are good, prices are good, and one if the more tastier places downtown. Will definitely be coming back. 
28874 Tomahawk Pork Chop was fantastic! Great environment for group meetings and networking dinners. 
28875 **BAR ONLY: Great atmosphere. Lost a star to small pores, but made up for it because the Bloody came with a beer back. You never see that. 
28876 Everyone working here is outgoing and helpful, they didn't have lemonade and they made it, just for my drinks! Food is amazing, service is quick and friendly, drinks are great 
28877 Came here for the first time and the store had a huge selection. The vibe was really weird and I felt like I was being watched and rushed. Not like most smoke shops were people are chill and helpful. 
28878 Street level!! Doors open by very helpful staff!! Great chair section!! Wide open ! Accessible bathroom for the disable only!not a bad place to catch a show! Take public transit ! 
28879 Come for the great, reasonably priced haircuts, stay for the even better banter. Best haircuts I've gotten in the state. 
28880 N√£o e o Amor aos peda√ßos do Brasil. √â uma padoca ao estilo de SP, com bons pre√ßos e boa comida. Faltou limpeza e algu√©m para ajudar no sal√£o para as 5 estrelas. Se n√£o fosse pelo nome jamais ir√≠amos conhecer o lugar.... 
28881 Less than a week open and a full dinning room Tri Tip is the best I have had.(besides mine) cooked perfect, generous serving 
28882 Family of 5 and a huge hit. Will be back. And Staff Wonderful! Thank you for the good time. Rip City! 
28883 Oh wow... such a strong chai latte I love it! Been a long time since I had one too. Would come again but I have my spot I use to go to which is now so far away. 
28884 I LOVE Batting A Thousand! Connie the owner is great and they're dedicated to keeping a batting cage on the eastside for Oregonians. And it's indoor! 
28885 This place was solid. Not to mention I was really impressed that they offered to still bring us delivery although it was pretty late. I'd recommend the green pea patties appetizer - it was delicious! 
28886 Needs improvement on the wine list, one of the best servies that I had in the past year, staff saved the the evening. 3 and 1/2 stars for the food, 2 stars for the wines, 4 stars for the staff, will visit again!! 
28887 Most of these negative reviews are about the delivery driver. The edamame and crab Rangoons are really good, I'd re-order. This order was late night. 
28888 They were very quick and responsive. I was already frustrated with my search before I found them, so I was relieved to say the least. 
28889 Can't believe I just paid 12 dollars for this curry chicken rice......I wish I can compare what they give me with cafe mami ..... 
28890 Awesome place for espresso drinks and fresh made salads and sammies. They also have a grab and go deli case if you need something quick. A personal favorite is the breakfast burrito - order veggie and add bacon for the best of both worlds. 
28891 This is a great dive bar- and it's been in Portland so long that it's been grandfathered in so that you can bring dogs inside! BEST THING EVAR! They always have a great selection of beers, and there are three pool tables. :) I recommend the vegan gumbo. 
28892 I never liked going to the dentist, and would dread every visit. Not anymore! The staff is so freaking welcoming and kind! Dr. Adams is personable and awesome. There's never a long wait, and it's a great atmosphere. 
28893 This was one of the few physical therapy places in the Boston area recommended to me by Massachusetts General Hospital for help with a broken wrist. It was great in all aspects, and I would also highly recommend. 
28894 Pie=Crust+Filling You can make delicious fillings with local ingredients but if you put them into shoe leather like crust it's at best a three star product, with a heaping scoop of attitude ala mode from the staff it drops to two stars Random Attitude Pie Bar. 
28895 i wish they had a Kens Tacos in south austin! I would even consider working there part time.....awesome food...Think about it Ken 
28896 These guys are charging more. I bought a Groupon coupon for a 3000sq feet home. My home is only 2700 sq feet. But the person came to clean the house is asking $20 more extra for cleaning the stairs. 
28897 Good food and good service at a reasonable price. Don't let the area sway your decision. 
28898 I love this place. I ordered the Lamb Saag and I never had garlic naan before but it is a must try! It was so delicious and the garlic was not overpowering. The lamb was moist and seasoned well. I would definitely recommend this place to pick up lunch. 
28899 I have to agree with Karen F. - best risotto ever! The only downfall was when my husband ordered a bourbon and coke. Our very Italian waiter brought him a coke and a bourbon - in separate glasses. 
28900 Lunchtime is the best time to go, good value specials, tasty black bean chicken and ginger beef, the free hot and sour soup is even tasty. Quick efficient service. One of the best places for lunch in the area. 
28901 Jade's food quality and quantity is not worth the money they charge. Not enough good ingredients. 
28902 We did the tour today and it was fantastic! Mike was our tour guide and he was full of information! .... very funny too! He is currently a student there. Strongly recommend it. 
28903 I was initially attracted to Austin Cleaners because of the Greener Dry Cleaner mantra. My clothes smell...fresh, not like a dry cleaner. Adam (Owner) greeted me every time I walked in the door. The price is right, the location is close to the freeway. No complaints here. 
28904 What a great experience I recently had! Dr Ortiz and her team are very thorough, they listened to all of my needs and wants (which is rare in a dental/dr office these days). The office is nice and the team is super friendly. Would recommend to all! :) 
28905 In New Orleans you got to go to Mothers. In Austin you've got to have Gus Fried Chicken! It is tastier, spicier and has the bolder Texan flavor than NOL's Mother's Fried Chicken. Service is friendly and fast. It was well worth the trip. 
28906 Jason, aka Madeline, brought me too much bacon... and I loved it! The food here is exceptional! Be sure to try the deviled eggs. 
28907 Awesome lunch. Awesome service. Stuffed shrimp was fantastic! Thank you for the kick ass hospitality. 
28908 We are literally sitting here waiting for some ramen for over an hour now. Every Japanese place I've ate at always serves them quick because it's just broth and noodles. How long does it take to make this? 
28909 Best restaurant in Milwaukie. Breakfast or Lunch both amazing. American Breakfast as 'Sully's Cafe' and Argentinian cuisine for lunch. I wish they were open for dinner. Everything authentic and homemade. Perfectly prepared. 
28910 Good ramen. Not over the top. But good. Tried to order a combo with my friend but they refused to give it to us at combo price since we were sharing. Petty disagreement that was not backed by evidence. 
28911 Had dinner and breakfast here and it was awesome! Food was top notch. Breakfast buffet was amazing and every employee was smiling and helpful. Great place! 
28912 Great Midtown Restaurant! If you love Italian this is for you. They have an extensive menu, my favorite being Spaghetti Agli olio. However, the bar is the spot to relax and enjoy the friendly staff and locals who gather there. 
28913 Food was average at best. Ordered pulled pork, ribs, mac and cheese and baked beans. Everything was underseasoned. Cornbread muffins weren't sweet. Texas toast burnt on the underside. Nice restaurant in kind of the up-and-coming area of downtown Decatur, but I won't be back. 
28914 The sashimi Is good For the Price. It's a hit and miss with the mixed drinks and the quail shooters are awesome ! 
28915 Cute, trendy place. The menu was a little confusing, but I'm a very suburban mom type. The margarita and charcuterie platter were quite tasty, and the staff was friendly. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a neat place to get a drink and an appetizer. 
28916 Ummm YUM! I had the "You're my Boy Blue" and added bacon, and the sweet potato waffle fries. 100% spot on. I will be coming back! 
28917 Food is great as always, fast service as always. Huge salad bar. If it were more affordable Id be there 5X more and give it 5 stars 
28918 Ask for Renea. The food is terrific and the service is outstanding. We are from Fort Worth and travel to Austin frequently. We will be back often. 
28919 Luv! This place. This is a regular place for me to treat myself. The shreaded meat is so yum. 
28920 Sal did a great job of cleaning the carpet after several dog accidents. Now the bedroom smells wonderful again 
28921 If you are looking for a reasonably priced and delicious late night meal, this is a very good option! 
28922 The new Cactus Club at Richmond Centre is A+. Their Feenie Burger was the best burger I've had all year. And their cocktail list is to die for. So tasty! And the ambiance is good too. We went here for my sister's birthday. I highly recommend it. 
28923 This cafe sucks butt.... Really bad customer service will never drink from there again. 
28924 Extremely affordable! Dr. Greg was an exceptional veterinarian! Pugsly had a chronic skin issue and had been loosing his hair due to itching constantly! Dr Greg diagnosed and treated him with a steroid shot- problem solved! It's the biggest relief for our family as well as Pugsly! 
28925 I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the prime rib which was excellent and my husband enjoyed the signature plate chicken and ribs. The server was very attentive. 
28926 Had gone for a birthday dinner. Restaurant has nice decor but the food including appetizers were not only bland and tasteless but also such limited portions. For almost ridiculous prices! Would never eat here again and the prices are simply outrageous! 
28927 They play Menomena, The Innocence Mission, Loney, Dear, and Emiliana Torrini. 'Nuff said. 
28928 I stopped by here to buy Indian curry packages, which are great for camping. Usually Indian stores have many kinds of them. I was disappointed this store didn't have any. 
28929 What can I say? it's Starbucks! It's like the New York Yankees of coffee. It's absolutely amazing, the lifeblood that fuels champions. I don't think anyone on yelp needs a review from me to know Starbucks is awesome. 
28930 Just wanted to grab an order of sweet potato fries before heading back to Downtown. I still can't get over how nice everyone is?! Anyway, one order became two orders which became my Friday nite dinner. Wonderful! 
28931 Life changing. You think you've had a burger? Come here and you'll realize what you've been missing. They will even cook your burger rare without judging you. Nothing but praise here. 
28932 Wonderful dinner on a Friday night with my wife. Had been here for lunch and enjoyed it, but dinner blew it away. The food was delicious and the service was stellar! This place should be busier. Keep up the great work. 
28933 New hotel close to Disney. We enjoyed the breakfast options each day. Nice place especially for the price. Also we're very impressed by the bar, Flamingos. Dinner was great! 
28934 The service at Ankaras is really slow. How slow is it? True story: I used to live 2 doors down. I once ordered a sandwich, went back home, got laid, returned to Ankaras, and still had to wait a minute or two for my sandwich. Food's not particularly exciting either. 
28935 One of the best Hilton Hotel Restaurant/Bar options I have had the pleasure to use, great staff and food was awesome! 
28936 80 Thoreau and Sarma are the only two restaurants in the Boston area that get 5 stars from me. It's all about the food, which is consistently superb. Flavorful, fresh, and beautifully plated without pretense. 
28937 I've eaten here several times now and I love the lunch box short ribs. You get do much n the ribs are so flavorful. Service is great and fast. The meal is right under $10. I always find myself wanting to come here for lunch all the time. 
28938 OMG the cupcakes are excellent! The dulce de leche cupcake is simply amazing, its my favorite! If your in the Highlands stop by and grab one. It will be worth every bite! 
28939 Lightning fast, affordable, courteous, *and* local. Bam. Everything I could want in an oil change. 
28940 A second location in Lynn for this establishment. Same high quality caribbean fare, inexpensive prices. A great lunch spot for take out on the go. 
28941 Always a wonderful dining experience. Phenomenal service as well. Keep up the good work! 
28942 Loved the Cajun jumbalaya and garlic fries! Also highly recommend the pretzel bread and the Ruby Slipper cocktail. :) Not to mention a pleasant atmosphere with very friendly staff! 
28943 This place is awful. I just threw out my meal after one bite. The strange thing that is they were better 4 months ago. When I say better I mean C+. That as good as you can get with Chinese food in Ohio. But now it is insufferably bad. 
28944 Total dump that survived off the back of a crap promotions group for years. The fat door guy is a rude asshole. I get that working the door on dirty is a shitty job but you don't have to take it out on others. 
28945 A little too pricey for fast food. Not as delicious as Chick Fil A, but points for being in my hood! 
28946 Great food and service. Had the lobster and wife had the scallops. Both were very delicious. The dessert was the banana foster which was outstanding. Our sides were spinach and broccoli which was ok. Hard to give 5 stars but really great. 
28947 The best Greek in the area. Fast and always fresh. Don't be detered by the line because they move it fast. 
28948 Food is good, but portions are tiny tiny and pretty expensive. Go to the other Fuji's in Quincy where portions are just right and it's pretty much by far the best I've ever had! The interior here is nice though and drinks are good. 
28949 I booked on Priceline which rated the hotel with 4 stars. Issues: Sunken worn out mattress Hair in shower / tub Outdated & Damaged Furniture Substandard workmanship Dirty Floors The staff was polite although they offered nothing but an apology. Priceline value system may be over rated. 
28950 We have been taking our dog here for a while but I had always been displeased with the manager/owner (?? - the only male who usually answers the phone). He is rude, abrupt and is the reason we won't be returning. 
28951 Food was fantastic. Had the couples thing where you choose a variety of different dishes, all were amazing. We got rice along with the bread but it wasn't even needed. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Portland. 
28952 Yummy, large, crispy wings! Super clean to! This gem is tucked away in a little shopping center, if you can find it they deliver within 10 miles 
28953 I guess I just don't get it. Chicken fingers, soggy fries, bad cole slaw. Whatever the sauce they give you also isn't tasty. To each his own. 
28954 I usually love chili's but this location is the worst place ever. Went in around 2 pm, there were plenty of empty tables but we were told to wait 10 minutes. We waited 10 minutes and still no table. We walked out!!! Won't go back there ever!!! 
28955 Came in on Thursday night for my daughters birthday dinner, service was great our server(Hannah) was sweet and wanted to make sure our experience was fun. I had the pork chop and it was cooked perfect. We will be back. 
28956 Love this place! Great meat selection. Everything you can think of. Fast service, even took my meat out to the car! We go here all the time. 
28957 Amazing service department! The technicians are great, I wouldn't take it anywhere else in the area. Also everyone that is complaining about prices should probably remember that they bought a Mercedes..... hello! 
28958 Really unique flavours! Definitely more than I expected! It was so good! Wish they had a bigger location though! 
28959 Always on the search for good wings in greater PDX and this place doesn't disappoint. Only had the secret sesame and BBQ but the sauce is great and it's perfectly crispy. In my opinion, better than fire on the mountain. 
28960 There was no soap in the ladies' room when I went to wash my hands before my meal, which I reported to a female employee. There was still no soap when I went after my meal! Gross. 
28961 It is so easy to use The Parking Spot. The shuttle service is always fast and on time. I have been parking here for years. 
28962 This is my favorite sushi restaurant. But I wish my server would stop touching her nostrils. 
28963 I was really excited for my Pad Ke Mao .... until I found the hair in it. I take that back TWO hairs in my noodles! 
28964 Really good place to eat i would suggest the potato skin pizza it is really good!!!!!!! 
28965 Fun vibe. It's a great spot to come with a group of friends or coworkers. The staff is friendly and recommended what to get since I'm a vegetarian. Been back a couple of times and ordered the same dish cus it was that good! 
28966 What I love about My Brother's Place is that they use kalamata olives on the pizza-- not those boring regular black olives. 
28967 Worst meal I have ever had out. Ever. Meatloaf was crispy, tuna was not fresh, chicken was dry, and they screwed up a portobello mushroom sandwich. How is that possible? 
28968 Food was delicious and the "adult" frappe was great too! Best onion rings I've had and the sweet potato tots take you back to your childhood. 
28969 Really good Itilian food and definitley competes with some of the more popular reasturants in the North End. Atmosphere caters towards couples (dim lighting, candles on the table etc.) but they do have a good small bar area. I'll definitely be back. 
28970 Great ambience: dark and cozy. A large selection of spirits and liqueurs. You can just get a taste of something new to you for a just few bucks. Some really tasty mixed drinks here! They have some nosh, nothing heavy, always interesting. 
28971 AMM Collision is a standout company. After my third visit I have nothing but good things to say 
28972 I would highly recommend this business to anyone. 
28973 Great experience for my first visit. I ordered the Ron Burgundy and the Hot Mezz, and love the combination. Now I see why people love this place so much!! 
28974 Came here two years ago and remembered it being a nice little hang out spot. This time it was slow service so we didn't rush back to it on this visit. Nice spot features to the bar area though. 
28975 Best consistent Chinese that I've found nearby where I live. Yummy hot and sour soup and kung pao chicken which is what I usually get. 
28976 Had a plugged kitchen sink. On thanksgiving night. Called. They took my information and said they would call right back. Guess what. They NEVER Called back. Beware. 
28977 Hibachi sucks. Food has no flavor and is way overpriced. They have nothing on other places like Kobe's or mizu. 
28978 Michael is a sweet guy. He diagnosed the problem with our oven (faulty igniter switch) and got if fixed quickly. Oven works fine again. 
28979 This is a good Smokey Bones. I like their rib combo just fine, but recently discovered the burger and man it's my new favorite. Who cares that this is a chain?? They have real charcoal and that goes a long way. 
28980 My husband and I went here for the first time tonight. We loved it. The meat loaf is fantastic and the fried chicken is right there with it. The outdoor dining is wonderful for these Florida autumn nights. Highly recommend this restaurant when you need your southern food fixin! 
28981 These ladies definitely take pride in their work. I've been to the salon a few times and have always been pleased with the outcome. 
28982 I love Tiffany's! My mother and I have been coming here for many years, and the service is always consistent, careful, and super lovely! All of the women who work here are very kind and very talented! The prices are very good too 
28983 Do this: find a Chinese seafood market, make sure the crab is fresh and buy it. you'll save a LOT of money..or you can do the same at costco. this place is overpriced. it's too corporate. and not fresh. 
28984 Ran into these guys by the Harvard Science Center. Great vegetarian wraps and fantastic chipotle tacos! Best food truck in Cambridge. 
28985 This was one of the first places we went too. Absolutely the best. Happy hour was 1.00 oysters and the bartender Paul I do believe was his name was the best. What a warm and friendly place. Keep up the great job!!!! 
28986 The best! I wish he did general dentistry. He is very gentle and concerned about your pain level. 
28987 The food was great. Friendly atmosphere. Recommend the lobster and shrimp. Got the mild sauce. Will go back again 
28988 Maybe I'm missing something here, but this place did absolutely nothing for me. I've been to at least a dozen sushi restaurants in Austin, and this has to be my least favorite. Everything about Banzai was bland and forgettable. Sorry. 
28989 Delightful, quirky, great food! Quick and efficient service for lunch time. Sandwiches are very good. 
28990 Amazing. This place is so delish I cant even put into words. My girlfriends and I let the waiter take the reigns, and she ordered for us! If you like new food experiences and arent scared to try something new, I suggest doing just that! The duck was SO good! 
28991 I bought a Groupon there and wish I hadn't. The dentist was examining my teeth and knocked off a crown. Then he charged me $107 to put it back on. I will never go back there. 
28992 Solid choice of creative grill cheese sandwiches Was glad to see they gluten free bread. 
28993 This place is always clean, no foul odors in the bathroom,food is good. The lowest inspection grade i have ever seen at this spot is a 97. Staff is very friendly. 
28994 good sandwiches, great gourmet food selection, always so helpful and great wine/beer/spirit selections and the wine tasting machine is so awesome! 
28995 Educational, Fun - What's not to love?? Clean, friendly, a wide variety of acts and exhibits. Staff is tops in Orlando and the shows are beyond hands on. A little disappointed in "Dine with Shamu" but still 5 stars all around. 
28996 Best Pint of Guinness I've ever had in the USA. Poured properly and well worth the wait. 
28997 OMG! My husband and I ate here once, and we intend to return very soon. The food ad the service was fantastic!!! The server was hilarious, that's what we like, personable and funny. 
28998 Came by for lunch 
28999 Our server, Gabriel was very patient (I came with a finicky guest). The food was delicious and came to our table quickly. Gabriel was attentive and friendly. Best service I've had in a while. I'll definitely come back. 
29000 Comfort food and almost close to homemade food. Please come here it's so delicious. Worth every single penny. I almost wish I paid more because I genuinely would not mind. Yummy!! We got the taco dinner plate and fajita burrito wrap. 
29001 Why anyone would wait for these donoughts are wasting there time, like I did. This place is really grimy and lacks a competent staff. Donuts are average and work more as decorative parade floats then food 
29002 Pretty good southern meals and nice atmosphere. Love the biscuits and fried apples! Service is nice most of the time but there has been rookies that need more training. I love the store and they always have new holiday stuff which make great gifts! I visit often. 
29003 Awesome costumer service! Great food! Went for the first time to try something new- waitress was extremely helpful (we had no idea what to do). Made us sauce and gave us complimentary shaved ice! Definitely going back. Yummmm! Super cheap too. 
29004 Great food would've been 5 stars easily but poor service, checked on us once and once we were done we sat for 20 minutes and never got our check, we actually had to walk to the bar to cash out. Sucks to end service that way 
29005 Terrible service today. I waited fifty minutes before my ride arrived! The dispatcher sent my cab elsewhere and did not get me a backup. Never using this service again! 
29006 The WIFI sucks so bad here. I never have wifi problems anywhere else, but I usually have to reboot my computer to get online here, and I consistently lose connection. Good coffee though. 
29007 Solid neighborhood spot. Good food, cocktails and service. 
29008 Do yourself a favor and spend your hard earned money elsewhere. Just bad customer service in every aspect of dinning experience. Went once, will not return. One star is for our server's repeated apology. 
29009 A very friendly staff. No wait time when I went. The food was given to us in a timely manner with no long wait time between appetizers and entrees. The food was very good. 
29010 Consistently the worst food and service I've had in Atlanta. My order has never come out correct. The kitchen is beyond slow. Food tastes bad. 
29011 I;m literally here almost every Saturday afternoon like clockwork. Nothing beats their Pink Star off the secret menu. The boyfriend always orders a a Banana Berry and loves it! 
29012 So disappointed in customer service. Was excited to meet Jamie and called and text to her following cut and color and no reply or call back. Paid full price for cut and had to find a new stylist at another salon to shorten the length a little. 
29013 Was surprised at the quality of the sandwich here! Stopped in for a quick snack and the sandwich (turkey club maybe?) blew us away. The ambiance was beautiful, too- classic romantic coffee shop out of the movies. And the service behind the counter was just lovely. Ideal! 
29014 I had the grilled breakfast egg panini and it was so delicious 
29015 The pesto mayo and peppers were a delicious new take on the same old breakfast sandwich. Try it out! 
29016 Very, very good hole in the wall Mexican food. Guacamole was great, chicken cooked to perfection, beans very flavorful, great service. Prices are very reasonable. Would visit again!! 
29017 The cubano was fantastic (took a bite of my spouse's sandwich) they could just sell that alone and do a great business. I had the roast beef which was totally awesome, perfect in every way, just like RB back east. Great place! 
29018 Great food though pricey for value, good cocktails, and beautiful setting. Brunch is solid. Waiters have been great but we've gotten several rude hostesses, that have just thrown off the whole experience. 
29019 Avoid. Nevermind the food. Everytime the door opens one of those super annoying chimes goes on for 30 seconds. MAXIMUM VOLUME Wanted to blow my head off in 3 minutes. 
29020 Yak and Yeti is one of the best tasting restaurants in Disney World. The portions are large and the ambience fits the theme. I definitely recommend this place as a must go go for Animal Kingdom. 
29021 Cute cafe with homemade looking sweets. Bagel breakfast sandwiches. Juices and coffee 
29022 The food isn't bad, but the old redneck fellow working the front lacks home training. Probably once of the top ten jerks in town. 
29023 I am addicted to the chicken wonton soup.. soooo good!! Really like the curries too. Never disappointed with an order and the staff is always friendly. Mango sticky rice is yummy too. 
29024 New to the area and I found this place online. I was really impressed with the whole staff every single employee I encountered was very helpful and friendly they had no problem answering any of my questions. Food was tasty drinks were great I will definitely be back! 
29025 Better than average Chinese food and *much* bigger than average portions at a lower than average price. Also, very fast service! I got two meals while they were quite busy in under five minutes. 
29026 Showed up on time and did a great job. A bird, thinking there wasn't any glass, literally flew into the window the same day. (He was okay) Also, their prices were better than everyone else's. Highly recommend Clean Bee for their window cleaning services! 
29027 AMAZING burgers. Basically the east-coast equivalent of In-N-Out burger (if you've ever been there, then you know what heaven tastes like). I love getting take-out from here and then chilling in Boston Commons with my food!! 
29028 Amazing food, amazing servers, lively environment. I had the eggplant, the tortellini with pesto sauce and my friend ordered the seafood linguini and devoured it :) A definitely must go in Boston :)!! 
29029 Terrible pizza and an even more terrible counter girl. She honestly tried to instigate a fight between me and my friends. Crazy. 
29030 Every time I go to Boston I have to stop at this place! The food is awesome! It's nothing fancy or over the top. You go because it taste great! Get the fisherman's platter! 
29031 I can't express enough how awesome this place is. The staff is incredibly nice and helpful. I absolutely love coming here. 
29032 You simply must try this place at least once in your life. Get a bottle of wine and get a 4 top table (so you can have 2 cooking options at once). Melting pot is the best there is for fondue! An oldie-but-goodie! 
29033 Only gave two stars because the bartender Michelle was very good. The food however was horrible. So disappointing. I got takeout and threw it away. 
29034 One of those places I'd never try without help from Yelp;-) Tucked in small strip mall near Dunkin Donuts. Chinese/Japanese with small sushi bar. Very fresh, very nice presentation. Small place with attentive staff. Portions are small for lunch pricing, but that's happening in many places. 
29035 Was a great place and ambiance. Good food and well priced. Def worth a repeat. 
29036 BEST donuts ever! Delicious and unique flavor combinations. Moist and full of flavor. My go-to donut place! 
29037 Staff is very friendly. Katie was very nice. She performed the cleaning on my teeth. Dr. Slater was easy to understand and very polite. Joyce explained options available to me. Overall it was a great experience and I would highly recommend this location. Charles Perez 
29038 The food was amazing!! The salmon was splendid and the gumbo too. And we also got dessert to go. But the service was not great. 
29039 Pork Tacos & truffle fries are my Fave. The staff is amazing and welcoming!!! Erica is my fave. Each night is different from happy hour to evenings. 
29040 Tamales are huge and delicious. lamb empanadas con salsa are to die for, well at least the lamb did. Flautas are great too. Well worth a try for old Austin types and newcomers alike. Parking on site is somewhat constrained. Drinks are good. 
29041 Fav place to come and relax! my acrylics always stay on, and my pedi's are always perfect! 
29042 Portions were very generous, lot's of fish in the maki, prices are decent or more than reasonable for what you get and the service was excellent. They even opened on a snowstorm when everything was closed. 
29043 Best humus in Boston! We regularly get a tub or two for takeout. Nothing you buy in the supermarket comes close. The babaganouj is also outstanding, and the falafel/humus and falafel/babaganouj sandwiches are super-tasty and filling. I haven't had their shawarma. Takeout is recommended: they have only 5-6 tables. 
29044 Excellent! We had the chicken confit rice box and the turmeric fish rice box. Wonderful, flavorful food. Everything was well seasoned and nicely presented. Highly recommend! High quality customer service was also a major plus. Will definitely eat here again. Eager to see their menu expand. 
29045 Bridges is one of the top brunch spots in Portland. If you're looking for a shorter line and just as good of food as a place like Besaw's or Screen Door, check out Bridges. The staff is friendly and the food items are reasonably priced. 
29046 Solid drinks, checked out the Green Eyes as my first cocktail and it was awesome! Solid selection of beers and tons of awesome local art to check out while you hang with friends! 
29047 A new favorite in Austin! My steak was a little over cooked, but it was still good. A little warm inside. Our waitress was awesome and very sweet. Empanadas are a must have, too! 
29048 Came to this location to try this place out. I had the strawberry lemon green tea. It was the perfect drink to cool me off from the heat today. This place will be regular stop for me. 
29049 Always get great service and never been disappointed with the food I've ordered. 
29050 Only clay pot restaurant in the whole of Massachusetts! Tasty but wish the place was bigger to accommodate more guests. There's always people waiting even as early as 11:30 when they open. 
29051 Nice place but during busy hours can get hectic. They have a wide variety of menus and open till late, perfect for those midnight cravings. 
29052 No complaints but wasn't mind blowing. Staff was very polite and helpful. Would do 3.5 if I could 
29053 I loooooved the vegetarian plate! They have really good guacamole and very flavorful salsa. The rooftop patio is nice for drinks and the valet makes parking in the tight parking lot stress free. Alexis was an excellent server. I will definitely be back! 
29054 The cakes here are either a hit or miss. Last week, I had the pleasure of trying two birthday cakes from Henri's: the Black Forest cake and the (family size) fruit tart. Both were excellent, moist, and fresh. I'm a fan of those two. 
29055 Sushi was ok. Nothing special. Turn off was the guy coughing in the kitchen... disgusting. Waitress also asked me to pay my check before I finished my dinner because they were turning off their register. ??? 
29056 The beef ribs were fall off the bone incredible! You would think the rib bone was just there for looks. I'm convinced their beef ribs would covert any pork rib lover. 
29057 Love the grinder and seems like new manager at Lenox. 
29058 It was amazing!!! The food was great so was the appetizer and the dessert. Will definitely go back there. 
29059 Amazingly good food. Service is excellent. Outdoor seating is beautiful. 
29060 The meals were expensive especially considering the poor quality. The chips and the batter was mushy. I will continue going to the better F&C just a few minutes farther from where I live. 
29061 This place does it right... if you have the opportunity, do not miss this restaurant!! 
29062 Great haircuts and friendly service. You won't have to sit through crap music while some hipster puts the hurt on your hair. Josh does great shave designs and anyone else that's working there will hook you up nice. Now go get your shave and cut yelpers! 
29063 Outstanding experience, cozy facility and very friendly staff. They offer many different color options. I went with the dark shade and it looks so great. Thank you!!!! 
29064 So great this is in Portland! I hope they stick around - go there you won't be disappointed. Great people, delicious food, wonderful experience. 
29065 It wasn't the worst seafood restaurant, but it cannot compare to The Boil. The sauce was pretty bland, the shrimp were a tad bit mushy, and I left with my stomach a little uneasy. Their Sangria was on point though... I will not be going back! 
29066 had takeout yesterday order was wrong and the food was just ok I was expecting so much better from other reviews 
29067 It'll do in a pinch, but there are much better options close by. The food is just not that good. For instance, the buffalo chicken wrap uses cold cuts, not actual chicken (I've never seen that before and never want to again). Rising Roll is way better. 
29068 Loved the place, nice decor! Our waiter was very friendly and also a pro. Whatever he recommended was delicious, his wine pick was perfect. Fabulous restaurant, perfect for a special night. 
29069 If your interested in a no nonsense type gym and just focused on getting your workout in then this is the place to go!! It's nothing fancy. It has plenty of weights and good equipment. 
29070 Real Chinese food. Please don't come if you expect take out chinese. I'm sitting here on a Monday during lunch and it's packed and everyone is Chinese. Finally a place in Austin serving the real thing. 
29071 Love new world! the sandwhiches are off the chain, the service is super friendly, but the soup needs work:( 
29072 Awful. Got delivery. General Gau's wasn't the least bit crispy or spicy, absolute worst I've had. Scallion pancakes were mushy on the inside. Not sure how the rest of the menu is but I certainly won't be finding out. 
29073 This place is close to my work, so I decided to try it out 
29074 The sesame tofu is AMAZING!! Never had better, ever. Even if you dont like tofu you will like this, you must try it. 
29075 Tamarind House is good Thai that's flavorful without being overpoweringly spicy. The staff is really attentive, and I absolutely love their Pad Kee-moo and Pad Thai. Great stuff and good for dates! 
29076 This is probably one of my fav Taiwanese place in burnaby. Food was pretty authentic and servers were friendly. They open till pretty late at night so it's always my mid-night munch to go. My favorite dish would be pineapple with deep fried shrimp and bubble tea(: 
29077 Awesome dumplings. Try the spicy hot sauce with chicken and pork dumplings with pork bao. 
29078 Some of my favorite chicken wings in town! Beer is cheap and atmosphere is laid back. Come with time as service is a bit slow. Great patio! 
29079 Ordered a carry out meal of our favorite "Topper" pizza from Joseppi's on Sullivant Ave. again (and my Anchovie pizza.) Ready when Brian, the owner and person taking my order promised. Piping hot and delicious. Gotta try that "Topper" if you haven't had it. Check it out! Awesome! 
29080 The chocolate croissant was absolutely delicious, the coffee was good and the service was outstanding! 
29081 Food is great. Our server, Jennifer is awesome. The wait time to get our food was short and fast. 10/10 would come back. 
29082 By far the best ramen in portland....the tonkotsu red is an amazing broth and the pork belley is off the hook...the staff is super friendly especially liz and shawn...pricing is good and i recommend this place to anyone who likes ramen! 
29083 Overall a good experience - service 4 stars and technical competency i would give them 4 stars + I will be using them again for my car repairs 
29084 Service was great. Beef brisket & broccoli was good as were the vegetarian egg rolls. Would definitely go back again. I definitely want to try the ice cream next time! 
29085 Got horrible food poisoning from the Nines not once, but twice. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Haven't been back since. 
29086 The food is great. Our server is excellent(ask for Beebee). If you are in the mood for Mediterranean come here! 
29087 Their customer service is awful, rude ppl who THROW your pretzel on the counter that is dirty with money and germs and then get mad when you tell them to give you a new clean one. Definitely not going back 
29088 Didn't like it at all. The place is nice, but the food is not that great, the drinks are way too strong and I don't mind salsa music, but since I can't salsa felt like a fish out of water. 
29089 Nice open area in the back, great location on N Alberta street. Came here to grab a couple beers and some black bean nachos - very satisfactory way to end the night. 
29090 This place is the real deal. All organic and vegan and delicious. Paige, Genesis, Claudia and gang are fun, friendly, and genuinely cool people. Great spot to do work and feel good. 
29091 Definitely recommend this restaurant for tex mex lovers! We got the salsa platter and our waiter named all the salsas and explained each flavor. I ended up ordering the veggie enchiladas with verde salsa. Overall good food and service. 
29092 I went here after SXSW today and was very dissatisfied. The food took almost an hour to cook and it was overall underwhelming. There was also no women's restroom, so when I had to use the restroom I had to wait for the single seater. 
29093 Their coconut lime gimlet drink is hands down most Delish thing ever! I have been here about 10 times and can attest that the food, staff and drinks are all top notch. 
29094 One of the best Dental visits I had in the last 32 years. Very informative and honest, clean establishment and great employees. You won't be disappointed! (Thumbs up) 
29095 Went for exterior wash and paid an extra $4 for "tire shine". After the tunnel wash I assumed someone would apply tire shine. Wrong. Eventually I asked a staff member about the tires and was told the tire shine is "sprayed on during the tunnel wash" - what a joke. 
29096 Totally smashed my big bacon cheeseburger w Smash fries & Oreo milkshake. Very delicious! The milkshake was incredibly good! Overall a wonderful meal. Burger was slightly salty vs well seasoned but still smashed all of it! 2 burgers with fries n 1 milkshake = $23 
29097 I have always loved First Watch. Portions are tiny, but it is flavorful with lots of healthy options. 
29098 Great food! Fresh sashimi, love their sesame ice cream dessert! Awesome service, highly recommend! 
29099 This restaurant is a new discovery for me. We have been several times now and have highly enjoyed every meal. Very comfortable atmosphere and have music on Wednesday nights. Love it and highly recommend! 
29100 Wonderful customer service, wonderful food and a great beer and wine selection. You won't find me any where else for my Thai food!!! 
29101 Hands down the best kept secret in the greater Boston area. This place is amazing. Everything Carmine makes is delicious. I go almost every Monday and get food here. I love the pasta and meatballs and the chicken pot pie. This two man team is all this place needs. 
29102 Food was good. Outdoor patio was nice. Outdoor TV was a nice touch. They were friendly with my 2 year old. Service was prompt. No objects, but nothing stands out. 
29103 Stopped by here to grab a dink while waiting for our reservations at Le Pigeon. It was very spacious inside with a few TVs. They have a really nice porch that overlooks their parking lot. Great beer and cocktail selection. 
29104 The place smells bad and is out of date looking, but that doesn't really matter because the vet is so wonderful. Very patient and the services are reasonably priced. 
29105 Always easy to book and always quick & easy. Today I had to pick up my wife's car and DIANA drove me to the spot in a golf cart. Now that's what I cal service. Thanks Parking Spot! Keeping on doing whatcha you do so well! 
29106 Good food an average priced for Yaletown. Really nice interior. Good service. Pleasantly surprised by this place. 
29107 Went in on Saturday morning and was out of there in just over an hour. The medical assistant and Dr. were fantastic! There's an option to request an appointment online so that you're already in the queue before you get there. Clean facility and competent staff with excellent bedside manner. 
29108 Quick, friendly service. Good portions for the price. It's my go-to for Seafood Udon - YUM!! 
29109 This place is SO BAD for me. But SO GOOD. Worth the money. It's your classic "melt-in-your-mouth" freshly baked cookies. Even better than my roommate's homemade cookies (but don't tell her I said that). 
29110 Great Experience also staff was super friendly and honest and lets not forget the people from service I can't ask for a better service thank you. 
29111 Great spot, really intimate. Great atmosphere. DJ starts playing around 9pm on Saturdays. Great food and service. We had the fried green tomatoes and catfish fingers, definitely recommend those. Drink specials before 9pm on all drinks! 
29112 Gorgeous gorgeous place. Gives such a Boston feel. Amazing food !! People who work here must be given all the credit 
29113 Great hospitality 
29114 Such a cute little homey store! Really like the food, but it's small portion. I also think the staff are great and nice. 
29115 this place, so many different options for and great service. Food is and the kitchen staff takes in doing a job. Come one and you will be hooked. Be sure to join the "club" 
29116 Very cool atmosphere and decent food in a beautiful area. Our waitress didn't provide the best service but all in all not a bad experience. Pictured is the Warren Burger and the Bacon Cheese Burger. 
29117 Been here a couple times, prices are decent and the house brand had some great mangos! Service was good with an ergonomic display setup. Nice atmosphere and some great recommendations! 
29118 Good selection of spicy food--some small dishes for the table to share, much like Spanish tapas, and a nice menu of entrees. Service was fast, and the staff friendly and helpful. 
29119 This was among the best sports bars I've been too in a long time. My server, Alli, was fantastic. She provided great recommendations and was very attentive. Thank you for your service. I intend to be back soon. 
29120 Amazing. Best migas. Amazing fish tacos. You must go here if you're in austin. Warning go before 9 am to avoid lines. 
29121 AHHHH! I love this place so much. Consistently awesome burgers. 
29122 This is my favorite nail salon in the neighborhood. They give a complimentary shoulder rub with solar (possibly other types too. I just get solar). 
29123 Delicious dinner!! Great food, great service, nice price. My server, Rachel, made great recommendations for drinks and food and was attentive and pleasant. The mango-ginger-pepper martini was really unique and tasty, the chicken samosas were light and flavorful, and my main entree was perfectly spiced. 
29124 I have been going there for last few years, good products, nice staff. I took some of my American friends too. The only issue they faced was that some of the frozen products had no price tags. 
29125 Stay here. That's all the review you need to know. In case you're still reading, nice large suites with well equipped kitchens (2 burner range, dishwasher, cookware, etc). Great modern style without being pretentious or cold. Second best free hotel breakfast I've had. Great location. Nuff said. 
29126 Simply amazing Italian food. Everything made fresh from scratch, and they truly care about what they're crafting. We'll be going back for sure. 
29127 The Huevos Benedicto was tasty, great flavor in the hollandaise. The bacon skillet for two... AMAZING!!! The crispy top, thick pieces of bacon and the creaminess and flavor inside...wow. Worth the wait. 
29128 Nice people, good kayaking tips, sweet spot and good equipment! 
29129 Decent but not life changing. Good bar and good tap. Ordered the "Belfast" sandwich. It has Irish sausage, cheddar and curry sauce on rye. The curry overpowers. 
29130 Must try the butter chicken poutine!!!! Great breakfast Great coffee Great service with super friendly family staff An amazing gem in little India! 
29131 Words cannot describe how amazing our experience was. Food was yummy. Our waiter knew the menu and made great recommendations. Everyone had something different and everyone enjoyed. From gator bites to clam strips to poboys and salmon everything arrived hit and fresh and tasty. We will be back 
29132 First time here, and it won't be my last! The detailing service was fairly fast and it took no time at all to get through the wash. Thank you Roland and Randy for being courteous and accommodating! 
29133 Always always always gooooooood. Best burgers, SHAKES, and fries. Mmm. The wait is always out the door here, which is great for them, but not so great for me. It's always an outting to eat here. 
29134 Took my car here and had an amazing experience. Not only is there work great, they give even better service. The owner, Brandon, does his job with excellence. Ghost also assisted and I was very pleased. Worth the prices. I highly recommend! Shoutout to West Orlando and the 330! 
29135 Don't be fooled by the location or the facade, the food is amazing!! The Lentil soup to start was comforting and delicious, both entrees were flavorful and complex and the Peshwari Naan was superb! We will definitely revisit this restaurant!!! 
29136 This coffee shop is perfectly located if you're living in SE. Its a cozy little hiding place. They have a delicious assortment of tea and a great study section in the back. And they're open late! It's as good as it gets. 
29137 My bowl took 25 minutes to make for some reason, the restaurant was not crowded. Fifteen bucks for a curry bowl with shrimp- Five small shrimp! The curry sauce was tasty but I feel like it was over priced for what it was. 
29138 For a fried chicken dive, this place is 5 stars sure. Very tasty and juicy with a hint of heat. Cole slaw and collard greens are to die for. Service is great and staff is very friendly. They know what they do well and stick to it. 
29139 Mojo crepes aka when it was "blue sky" back in the day. Solid place to boba and crepes and to hang out with friends. I like their original milk tea, however their tapioca balls are usually never cooked right only downfall. Sometimes undercooked and sometimes overcooked. 
29140 BIG, Nice relatively new IKEA store - what's not to like! PS MAKE SURE you bring your own bags!! 
29141 The ambiance of the restaurant is very New England harbor town, but the food is way overpriced for what you get. The seafood "rolls" are just deep fried seafood in bread. We were hoping for a fresh New England seafood experience and were disappointed. 
29142 Excellent option for lunch in downtown Austin! Superb sandwich and salad menu. Try the veggie burger and and ruben! Also, they have very friendly and efficient staff. I totally recommend this place! 
29143 Salad was wilted and pita was stale on the edges. I picked out some of the bad lettuce so you could see. 
29144 Good not great. I've been here several times and it's fine. I'm never excited to go there but my food is always fine. It is one of the better places on Newbury Street. 
29145 My friends and I stopped yay for Happy Hour on Saturday. Jessica was an amazing server. I had the gyoza and lychee Martini. Both were great. My friends had the Hawaiian roll and avocado rolls. They said everything was amazing. 
29146 It's ok, pizza sauce lacks flavor and salads are just ok. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is nice. I would pick Jason's deli over this restaurant. 
29147 I had an appointment to have my fireplace looked at after discussing the issue over the phone. Not only did they not show up but I called twice on the morning of my appointment and left a text message and did not receive any call back. 
29148 Amazing food - best Thai place in Austin - very crowded and hard to get in - but worth the wait ! 
29149 this place is open 24/7 cheap doughnuts laidback staff great tasting goodness 5 stars across the board 
29150 This place is close to home, quick, and always has special pricing, 10 items for 25.99, where can you beat that, tell me and I'll be there. 
29151 I like their appetizer and the Chen's original noodles. If you are new to this place, definitely get a try on their noodles. But be careful choose the stir fry stuff, might not match your tastes. 
29152 Amazing food, and great service. Was a little busy but that is their fault for having such delicious meals. 
29153 The food was pretty okay. The service was such a dissapointment, the waitress was rude and they demanded more tip. I just met the worst waitress of all time. 
29154 The whole restaurant has food on the floor that has clearly been sitting there for days. 
29155 They are very friendly and very nice , they never have problem there , & already prepared their foods when they go to the drive in area 
29156 Their boss ( manger ) should give all the employee A A+ 100 for doing a excellent jobs. 
29157 One of my all time favorite restaurants ever! Beautiful location, great decor and amazing food. Baja Fish Tacos and the Lobster Roll are the best items on the menu. If you're in or around Salem go to Sea Level! 
29158 The sweet and spicy chicken melt is probably the best sandwich I have ever had. The chocolate cake was also delicious. Highly recommend. 
29159 Als Fan von Ruth viel dieses Restaurant leider etwas ab. Wir sprechen aber immer noch von Spitzenniveau! Super Service. 
29160 One of the best brunch joints in the city! Amazing food, service and atmosphere. Go early to avoid a line up though. 
29161 Always fresh, always busy, always amazing. Get there early and expect a wait. A gem of kits! 
29162 Tea is super duper sweet Could not drink it. No credit cards. Cash only Not good for me. 
29163 Delicious! I think we tried everything on the menu but we couldn't decide which was our favorite. Mushroom brioche, polenta, duck confit, and the must have Mac and cheese. You won't be disappointed. 
29164 First time MB buyer. My rep was Paulo Castro who knew the product extremely well and didn't apply any pressure to 'close the deal'. He answered all my questions and spent the time to discuss/show me all the services offered by the dealership. I highly recommend Paulo and the dealership. 
29165 Everything was so salty. Lots of interesting ideas/creative Asian fusion dishes on the menu. However, I felt like most dishes we ordered sort of failed in execution. Overhyped. 
29166 Cute neighborhood ice scream shoppe! The Coconut almond candy bar (I think that is the correct name) is to die for!! I'll be back soon to "Crush the Crusher!) 
29167 They have THE best steak and cheese sub! Unreal! A little pricey though. 
29168 Simple yet great food. Misto salad is always tasty and a good selection of wines. Service is efficient and pleasant 
29169 Waited over 45 mins for my food it was over cooked dry. The sad thing is this is rate to be the best in main st. I do not think so. 
29170 Best sandwich in town! And red bean shake is my favorite! 
29171 Service, Sat with 2 friends at the bar. Craig was great. Knowledgeable, friendly and funny. Food, Calamari and Brescetta to start....both great. Entrees; Veal Marsala, Salmon, Veal spinach ALL GREAT. Can't say enough. 
29172 We have always used this location to board our dog when we go out of town. Very friendly and trusting staff! 
29173 Neat market with a nice laid back atmosphere. Was disappointed to learn that they do not prepare any of the food - so it's not truly a restaurant. 
29174 Love this place! Been coming here for years- the best prices in the Boston area, always quiet and fast service. They only take cash but are open almost everyday, even New Year's Day! Mochi is great too. 
29175 Easily one of my favorite spots in Austin. Great drinks and really good food. The Javelina burger is one the best in the city. 
29176 It's voted the number 1 buffet in austin for the last 8 years (or something like that) for a reason! The food is great and tasty, and the service is good. Although I don't like the spring rolls and sushi.. I would still highly recommend! 
29177 As far as Lighting goes.. this store is far better than Lamps Plus. Compared to Lamps Plus: Globe Lighting store is well organized, more selections, MUCH better selections, friendlier staff, smarter staff, more efficient & seem to have better prices. 
29178 This is now one of my favorite places in Columbus now. Fantastic! Food was delicious. Cost was reasonable, had drinks, tapas, entrees and dessert for about $50. 
29179 Awesome service! Austin was prompt, courteous and had my new kitchen exhaust fan installed quickly and with virtually no mess. These guys will be our go-to electrician from now on. Highly recommend! 
29180 Never been on this ride before and loved it! I loved how you could feel like you are there. 5/5 nice ride. P.s Donald at the end was clever. 
29181 Great spot ..... Love the service love the food... I would recommend the spot.... Great ambiance... 
29182 Another nice dinner at Stella for Valentine's Day. Food was blazing hot and the ambiance was lovely. Can't recommend this place enough. 
29183 Love, love, love this place. The staff is friendly, the place is very clean and the food is great. We usually hit this on Sunday morning after church and it's usually not too busy. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 
29184 Delicious food, fun atmosphere, beautiful desserts. If you like Ethiopian food or want to try it, go here. :) 
29185 If extended warranties are important to you, don't buy from Lowe's. 
29186 Great divey brunch place in what looks like an old trailer. The food is good and greasy, and the prices are really reasonable. 
29187 Chips salsa and guac are all great. Pitchers of margaritas to order: (tres gen, triple sec, lime juice for me) food was good and sometimes (Thursdays?) There is a live miriachi band and they are great. 
29188 Great old school pizza! Every time I'm in town I always make a stop here! Their pizza has no crust which I love, perfect crispy pizza in town 
29189 Had lunch there last week. The service was excellent, pleasant atmosphere, very good food with healthy choices. The view is lovely near the water but not on the water. We were told the sunsets are beautiful and fun times are had at the patio bar with music and dancing! 
29190 holy wow! These cookies are great! Our office just got these as a holiday gift. I'm pretty sure they were gone in 60 seconds. Ha! 
29191 Favorite place to eat in Atlanta! I always get the fish tibs with cabbage as well as the vegetarian platter for an appetizer. Eat here and you'll keep coming back 
29192 What sets this location apart is the service. Atticus went out of his way to make sure our family was amazingly well cared for. 
29193 This is my go-to spot on the weekends. pineapple curry rice bangin! Appreciate the salad/soup bar and mostly because there are mini spring rolls with peanut sauce, delicious! 
29194 I had the chicken broccoli with lemon pesto at this location recently. It was good, but not as good as its pizza. It tasted more like oil than lemon, but atleast there is good herbs and spices in the dish. $14 dollars for a large $8 for a small dish. 
29195 This Figs combines the AMAZING food that they have at the Beacon Hill location with extra elbow-room and incredibly friendly service. I am a huge fan. YUM! 
29196 This place is just ok, very expensive and sushi mediocre, long waits, slow slow food. Second try here, just don't get it. Looked at guy sitting next to me his dessert, lame cookie and brownie? Oh how original.... 
29197 Awesome service. Technician showed up at exactly the scheduled time and was in and out in about 15 minutes. Would definitely recommend! 
29198 Best steak experience in Boston. Colleen at the Bar was sweet and the conversation was great. Mile was great. 5 out o 5 and I have eaten at a lot of steak houses... 
29199 Really good place if you have a small group. The place is small, intimate and still hip. The food ranges in price so everyone can get exactly what they want. This place probably have one of the best Manhattan's I have ever had. 
29200 The burgers and trimming are very good. Convenient parking next door. If you are looking for something beyond an ordinary burger..this is your place. 
29201 My friends and I came across this restaurant when in the area, and decided to come here after reading the reviews. SOOOOO glad we ate here for dinner! The food is excellent, decor is beautiful, and it's very clean too! Will definitely be back when we're in the area again. 
29202 This is a great places to chill with friends one on one or mid sized groups. Good drinks and a bevy of different games to play. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. The only draw back is the place gets busy quickly so arrive early or rely on luck. 
29203 Nice venue for a big party. I was only a guest so have no idea about the booking, operation etc. Food was edible and bar was basic. Parking was easy. No complaints. No raves. 
29204 Amazing fresh salsa, guacamole, spinach dip, tortilla chips and so much more -- all topped with the friendliest service! 
29205 Food was great, music for the belly dancer was deafening. 
29206 The food was absolutely incredible. 
29207 Unassuming little place near the HEB on east 7th. Delicious bean and cheese pupusas and very tasty yuca fritas. The husband had chicken fajitas that were perfectly seasoned. We loved it and will be back! 
29208 A-mazing food and cocktails. Really friendly service as well. The whole family found something delicious. Jerk chicken pasta and the coconut shrimp app were the favorites. Try Cala out, you won't be disappointed and it will help keep a great restaurant in the area. 
29209 Party of 11 with no reservations, seated us in a few minutes and had the dinner of our lives. Everything was delicious, cleaned every plate we had. Service was exceptional and catered to our every need, the atmosphere was great after a day in Universal. 
29210 Doctor was good, but didn't seem to want to answer questions as thoroughly as my wife wanted. She's good, but a little more patience will go a long way. 
29211 As nice as they get. Good service, and lots of window seating. 
29212 Very clean, relatively new location. It's in an incredibly popular location so sometimes parking is tough and the store is busy but the baristas make the drinks as fast as lightening and always get my order right. 
29213 Absolutely worst customer service and company ever. Literally the worst. Do not do business with them ever. 
29214 I had the pork, white,red beans and the sweet plaitains. Overall, the food was very delicious. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is pleasant, and the location is great if you're visiting nearby attractions. 
29215 I can't imagine a worse place to eat. The click ahead service is as useless as the waitress(who will do her best to ignore you). Overpriced humdrum food. If you want steak in sanford, the McDonald's down the street is a better choice. 
29216 Oops they moved - no more bargain back room! However, their selection of nifty stuff just got better! 
29217 YUMMY! I had chocolate chip cookies and coconut cookies and they were delicious! The new location is located on NW 24th. Highly recommend this place! 
29218 Second time here and both times we had great food. I really like their home made Cole slaw and fried shrimp. Great little place with great and friendly personnel. 
29219 Tried this place for the first time yesterday and I have to say it's one of my favorite spots now! 
29220 Lovely boutique on Park Ave with trendy but affordable prices. Inside it kinda looks like Anthro and Francesca's combined. They have a ton of cute pieces - from clothing, accessories and even home decor. The girls here are very friendly as well. It's one of my favorite boutiques in WP. 
29221 Great food. The menu is set up like cafertia style. Pick your sides and choose your variety of meat. Great friendly start. Love the outdoor seating area. 
29222 Fun interaction between the actors and audiences. This make learning about the history very entertaining. The museum itself is nice. However the price of admission is kind of pricey. 
29223 The portion sizes were huge, service was amazing and the macaroni and cheese was phenomenal. It was so nice to find some comfort food that didn't sit heavy. The same person who opened Cornbread Cafe in Eugene also started this establishment. 
29224 Nothing special. The food was alright. The shoyu ramen lacked flavor and it was a bit overpriced, in my opinion. I don't think that we'll be coming back with the plethora of restaurants to choose from in Portland. 
29225 These hoes smack.... It did take a little for them to come out but our server was so sweet and gave us a discount. DON'T SLEEP ON THEM! 
29226 I got 5 trees tattooed by Toby! He is amazing and i will love this tattoo forever and how it symbolizes my family, he has fantastic ideas, and i will defiantly go back again! 
29227 I've been in a couple of times and each time I leave with a sack of books. I like this shop. It's clean, well organized, the staff is helpful, and they have a nice selection new comics, statues, and back issues. 
29228 Our tour guide name was justin, and he was great. He made the tour very fun and even sang for us! This man has a voice! He explained everything about the history of Harvard very well. I would ask for justin again if we were to come back. 
29229 Great burger place limitless fries great big burgers great sweet tea nice decorations 
29230 Dunwoody Station you rock !!! Free parking if its less than 24 hours. Very easy to find and bountiful parking spots. Alewife learn from them !! 
29231 Gelato and ice cream is fantastic and it is consistently under staffed so there is always a long wait. It often has 1 person preparing all orders and working register. Sometimes there are 2 staff members however it's still a long wait. They need at least 3 staff members 
29232 Awesome, great pizza, great selection of beers and finally better TV's! 
29233 I was in Atlanta for work and came in to grab a quick bite. Jordan was friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. She made great recommendations. The fries were so yummy! I'd come back for sure! 
29234 This is a great place for cheap, cold beer. Also great, heaping portions on the tator tots. This would be five stars if they could offer vegan corndog options. 
29235 What a joke two lanes open in the drive through 25 minute wait the people that work there seem ok but the big wigs at the top always cutting back make this location a pain. Don't join find a better bank or credit union 
29236 House drink menu offered some delicious choices. I enjoyed the fish tacos. Instead of crusty crunchy croutons, they put fried grit squares on my Caesar side salad. Yum! 
29237 Good food and service. But I have to say the two $$ was a little misleading. A couple of cocktails and a steak and I'm in for almost a hundred with tip. 
29238 The food was mediocre at best, the best thing about this place was probably the beer list and even that wasn't anything special. I didn't think you could make a basic grilled chicken breast taste bad, I guess I was wrong. 
29239 I really enjoyed the Caesar salad with grilled chicken. The portion was pretty big and the grilled chicken was delicious, nice quality. My friend enjoyed her salad and the daily soup. The service was decent. Our waitress was attentive, but not in our faces. We'll be back. 
29240 WAAAAY before food carts hit Portland by storm, Shelly's Garden was going strong. There's no holding back on the portions and it's always fun to go to Pioneer Square for lunch. It's a downtown institution and it's always great to see Shelly. Cheers! 
29241 I went there last night...we were outside on the patio, good view and ambiance, good food but so many Rats running around .. after a woman started to scream, I left !! It is not at all acceptable having rats in a dining area! 
29242 I made an a appointment on May 9 at the last minute because they had a last minute speaker. They can't reschedule me at another time that is convenience to me. I really like the place but I am disappoint because they cancel at the last minute. 
29243 Once one gets over the "oh, the furniture is 'flipped,' how interesting..." eye-roll and the inflated burger prices, the place immediately grows on you. The burgers (particularly the tuna) were delicious, the drinks were splendid, and the service was tops. 
29244 Dennys is the same ol' same ol' but a new updated look. The food is something I have to use the restroom for all day, but one of those evils you cant live without. Right now they have bacon everything including shakes and cheese. 
29245 The atmosphere in the dining area is cozy. I ordered pasta with chicken meatballs. It was very good 
29246 I took my golden retriever to be bathed and have nails trimmed. When I picked up my dog the nails were not trimmed and mats under her ears and all down her back leg were still there...oh my gosh..I will not be back. 
29247 Great sandwiches - I loved the fish sandwich! and the BEST salad dressing. also love the Okra dish. refreshing change of pace, it isn't packed all the time like most Austin places, and it has a very cool vibe. Very charming. 
29248 I've been to this place years ago and I have been to others in Boston, but this is definitely the best one. The guac is made to order table side and the margaritas are done right! 
29249 Excellent, portions are good, food is delicious and service is quick and good. I really recomend this place. 
29250 Don't share your drink with Shadi. His upper lip wafts the essence of old dribbling meat curtains. MONTUCKY! 
29251 The atmosphere is great, and the girl at the register was super nice and helpful to everyone that came in the door. I gave it two stars though because the burger wasn't any good. AND you more than likely have to pay for parking. The fries are good though. 
29252 Lori did the arrangements for my wedding and everything was beautiful and reasonably priced. She is very attentive and I didn't have to worry about a thing on the day of the wedding. This is a smaller shop so I suggest looking into her well in advance...good luck! 
29253 I'm a little biased being personally invested in the facility, but we couldn't be more proud of how it turned out. The restaurant is beautiful, the staff is doing great, and we can't wait to see it fully up and running soon. Canal Winchester gained a real gem with BrewDog! 
29254 ordered the side salad and fried seafood appetizer. they served me in a timely manner. The season food was good and tasted fresh. The portions were pentiful. came with large group and it took forever to get their food. I couldn't finish all my food during everyone complaining. 
29255 Simple menu. Great food! Fried chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection. Really crispy and tender. 
29256 Amazing! Fresh! Tasty! Great prices for great, homemade and delicious food! Fun atmosphere. 
29257 super dry cupcakes! and i'm surprised that they say they use such quality ingredients like callebraut chocolate, because you sure can't taste it. i don't know if there are Sprinkles cupcakes on the east-coast, but they are night and day better. 
29258 Really good standard fare. The sauce bar has some good options, nothing too fancy. Quick service. The prices are fair due to the large quantity of food you get with your order. I had the chimichanga and would definitely recommend. 
29259 We ordered a chicken and lamb dum biryani, it was delicious authentic hyderabadi biryani taste. Would definitely recommend!! Being a student they offered me a 15% student discount.. 
29260 Broken English made to order more expensive. Poor quality upon payment, and lack of salsa for the amount of chips for carry out. They swindle a buck for people that don't fully explain a side vs a meal. 
29261 I love Dr. Schultz & Dr. Soma. They are so great. They always answer my questions and have an amazing bed side manner. They make my kids feel secure and comfortable. I won't go anywhere else. 
29262 The shopping center where this place is located is a bit shabby, but it is clean and reasonably nice inside. Good lunch crowd, good Mole enchiladas, good beans and rice. We'll be back 
29263 best chicken soup. and best cheese dip in atl! i order the chicken soup (with the avocado on side bc it will get mushy) to go 3x a week! its especially good when you are sick. comes with chips ans salsa. best $5 spent !! 
29264 This place is awesome. Best salad or sandwich and totally cool vibe. Classic Somerville hip place with nice staff and great food. Defo recommend. Wifi free after 3pm (I think). 
29265 I would give this place 6 stars if I could! Great drinks, delicious apps, and incredible tacos. Stop what you're doing, and get yourself here! Thank you Louisa, fast & friendly service 
29266 Got lunch today and I was thoroughly impressed! The salad, dumplings and pork buns were made to order and the ambience is spectacular! Will definitely be back soon. 
29267 BEST CHINESE DELIVERY EVER. spring rolls and crab Rangoon were phenomenal. Quick service, quality not quantity and reasonably priced. 
29268 Food and ambiance were good... one of the better places to eat out near the 4 Points area. Casual with modern/hip decor. 
29269 Very nice and fancy Italian restaurant. Food was GREAT, we ordered the Garganelli Bolognese and Raviolis Quattro Formaggi with Black Truffle and WOW was so good. Pasta cooked perfectly, and the best of all the shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano they put on top of your plate. 
29270 Qing Mu's noodles are too heavy, Inauthentic, pricey, salty; Gu's at Krog Street's not much better; 'tlanta's now two bowls my debtor. 
29271 Super cute retro-chic sewing shop! It has a small but compelling selection of patterns, fabric and notions. Shopkeeper was nice and laid back, offered us hot tea. I wish I lived in the South End so I could take sewing classes here! 
29272 Really inexpensive, the staff was friendly and polite, good hours, and I was really impressed with the quality of their service. I will definitely be returning! 
29273 Small, cozy little pub w/limited seating but I've been here a few times for both happy hour and dinner and it was always worth any wait. Great whiskey/scotch list. Highly highly recommend the 'Bleu Burger'. 
29274 A great little spot for beers any time of day. Tiana (Taco Stef) is an awesome bartender, and made the experience a lot better. Stop in any time and you won't be disappointed. Try the pizza, it's great. 
29275 Not overpriced, fried chicken and mac n cheese were mediocre, service is not fast. Not horrible overall but would pick another place instead 
29276 Love the professionalism here! Very knowledgeable students who work here. Had my eyebrows tinted & she did an amazing job! Today I had my hair colored and I am going to be very happy with it, no doubt! I was right!! My hair came out wonderfully pretty! 
29277 Great food, great service. Not cheap but at least we got a meal worth the price. Scallops melt in your mouth. My wife got the filet and was tender. Nice selection of wines. Would go back. 
29278 They are located near Coquitlam Center. Their cupcakes are made by natural ingredients. They are delicious, and not too sweet. Even though I am not a big fan for sweets, I can eat 3 of those mini ones at a time! Definitely worth trying! 
29279 25 minute wait for four burgers. And they screwed up the drinks. Staff seemed raw / undertrained. 
29280 Happy. Hour. Enough. Said. HH Oyster!!! $1 each for any type! All so good! Everyday between 4-6pm They had such a cute patio but it was too cold to sit outside. Service was good. No wait. Location is inside the Loews Hotel. 
29281 The bathroom was a bit icky and there were flies inside noone was caring to get but their icecream shake was delicioussss and it was a decent meeting spot 
29282 Thought I'd give it a try .... Man am I glad I did! Great food that's different with great melding of flavors. 
29283 Found this on yelps hot & new and it definitely lived up to its expectations! Such a quaint coffee shop in the corner that happens to serve great food. Only managed to try the shakshuka, which was amazing. The challah bread was perfectly warm, crispy, toasted and ready for dunking. 
29284 This place is great! Good food, juicy meat and delicious rice! Plus less then 6$ for a 20oz margarita?! He'll yeah definitely recommend. Had the enchilada taco and tamale combo all amazing. 
29285 A nice place with excellent burgers, good drinks (or shakes), and very accommodating service. It's easy for some to put this place down for its famous ownership, but let's face it...they do a good job, in a fun location. 
29286 came in on a Thursday and they didnt have any kafka. fail! ending up getting a gyro and chicken shwarma sandwich. they were decent. strangely the lettuce in the sandwich was bitter so that made it taste a little... different. 
29287 Two words: Absolutely beautiful. Great for hiking, bike riding, running/jogging, sightseeing, SUP, kayaking, canoeing, picnicking, and much more! 
29288 Great service. Huge portions. Pizza and pasta is yummy. The wings, garlic knots and mozzarella sticks are excellent. Great place for lunch for the family. Look forward to coming back. 
29289 Conin is a delicious Queretero style Mexican restaurant. The food is delicious and fresh. The chile rellenos were authentic tasting and delicious all-around. The gorditas were fluffy and my son ate all three by himself. We highly recommend this restaurant to those who enjoy authentic, traditional, Mexican food. 
29290 Overpriced to start. Saw a cockroach. Most importantly, my acrylics are horrible. They hurt my skin when filing, the acrylics are crooked on 3 nails and too wide on my entire right hand, and the polish is bumpy. It looks like a child did them. 
29291 The desserts here are hands down amazing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because some of the items can be a little pricy. I totally recommend this place though! 
29292 Cool place to drink beers from Quebec, throw some darts, and scare all the hipsters by playing some Slayer iTunes. The food is pretty good too. 
29293 miss the train station location. this is McStarbucks at its worst. i've become a big Peet's fan. 
29294 The sangria was delicious! Sat at the bar and had some empanadas and croquettes which were yummy as well. 
29295 So excited that I went here. Hated to leave my previous optometrist but needed to find something closer to work. This was perfect! I am sooo amazed and pleased with the results! Thanks for making my visit enjoyable even in this monsoon we are having. 
29296 Fried chicken and waffles are amazing! Best fried chicken I've found in Portland. Service was excellent as well. 
29297 I was skeptical about this place, but my wife said it was highly recommended. It lived up to the hype. Great tastes and service. Fun to try different dishes and share with a group. 
29298 I wish I could give it more stars but the pizza went downhill in the last few months! I gave it a lot of chances but hasn't done it for me. Have to find another pizza place :( 
29299 Overpriced for what you get. Pretty poor table service. Pot pie was more like a hearty soup with a biscuit sitting on top...surprise! Ceasar salad dressing has a lot to be desired. I will not return. 
29300 love their food. My experience has been good food, good service. Delicious combo plates 
29301 Midtown Nail is the best nail salon I've been to in years. I get SNS on my nails and a signature pedicure every time I go, and they last 2-3 weeks. They do your nails and toes at the same time which a great factor. 
29302 Really good xlb. First time here. Thanks Yelpers for helping me find this place. Yummy. 
29303 Very small restaurant but great vibe! The food comes out very fast and the servers show you how to crack open everything. Very friendly staff always checking up on you. Great bar and sweet tea. Very impressed. 
29304 Octane has the best coffee in the city. Hands down!! Just the yummy jolt I need to get my day flowing. 
29305 Last night was my first time there, I LOVED it. Honestly the portions are perfect. Full of flavor, kudos to the chef! Everything was a complete flavor burst in your mouth. I will def be returning. The owner was super nice as well. 
29306 My friends know that I love soul food and this place hit the spot. Fried chicken and collard greens. How can you go wrong? And this place is oozing with history from the community. Love it. In my short stay in Atlanta, this definitely made it worth it. 
29307 Great tasting sandwiches appealing to a downtown office crowd, by the time I get there - the Porchetta is almost always sold out. But after all - its just a sandwich place for lunch. Not sure that all the hype is warranted 
29308 Chelsey is the best! She was incredibly flexible with scheduling and I showed her two pictures of what I wanted and she combined them perfectly. I'm always scared of haircuts (I get them once or twice a year) and she was so sweet and understanding. 
29309 friendly staff, great food! the chicken katsu curry was quite delicious and hot. ramen combo was also great. was greeted warmly when entering restaraunt and great service- drinks were always refilled frequently. 
29310 Horrible wi-if. It's a joke here, don't waste your time to come here because you will not get anything done. 
29311 We were happily surprised at how delicious this place was. Our group of 4 tried the family special so we got to taste about 6 or 7 dishes. Yummy. Moderately spicy. Very friendly owners. Great prices. 
29312 Just mediocre. Once again. Got served spoiled jalape√±os with the table side guacamole ( otherwise very good) but my burger looked very small The bun was tiny. Bartender was good. 2 stars vs. 3 because of rotten Jalape√±os. 
29313 They have a good burger. My patty was juice and tasted good. The others at our table enjoyed their meals, as well. But again, just another burger place. 
29314 Loved it! Excellent food & service. Husband got the rosemary chicken pita & I got the philly gyro. So good! The baklava was fabulous! The Turkish coffee was fun to try. My husband really enjoyed it. 
29315 Sure would be nice if they would help me spend my money in their shop... just want a time to get in there and have some shirts made, and maybe a suit. Not open at convenient times. Suffer from the "we are open while our customers are at work disease". 
29316 Amazing food for everyone. Every diet can find a yummy meal that is healthy. We'll be back again soon! 
29317 This place has great wings and subs for being in the mall. I would not go out of my way to eat there but I would definitely stop by if I was in the mall. 
29318 Whats not to like? Cheap beers, good wings. The sauces are really good. Thats about it. 
29319 Basic nightclub top 40 music. Average cover 20. Really packed. Good vibe. Seems like a younger 21+ crowd. 
29320 Robert did a great job cleaning my boyfriend's construction truck. He rid it of all the dust and debris that had built up from being on job sites for years. He was on time, and extremely professional. I would totally recommend him! 
29321 Great, attentive service, authentic and intimate ambiance, and portions were plentiful and tasty - would recommend for a change-of-pace date night or small-group dinner, especially on a weeknight! 
29322 We arrived at 8:30 only to be seated at 9:45 PM. It's now 10:26 PM and we still don't have drinks or food. Do not spend your money here, do not even bother. It's not worth it 
29323 This little gem surprised me! A bit over priced in my opinion, but the food is always solid, albeit it a bit on the greasy side. Calamari is excellent! Great patio. 
29324 I ordered a grill chicken meal and as soon as I tasted it, felt old and dry. The chicken is supposed to be fresh and juicy therefore the manager should supervise what's going on in the kitchen. Be careful people when you order the food! 
29325 Some one made a racist comment against Puertoricans. Planning not to go back. So sad... good food in sm 
29326 Have gone their for wings and pizza and it is great. Had subs of 2 different kinds and got a stomach ache. I dont think they sell many subs and probably the meat is old and has gone bad. 
29327 Good job on the full set but it only lasted 2 days. She didn't put enough powder.. The girls in there are very nice though. 
29328 This place is ridiculous! Awesome service, super fresh and delicious! Had the Eggs New Orleans and hope I can find a place to KC that can compare!! Will definitely return! 
29329 This place is just amazing! We came around noontime and they said they were sold out. The owner was kind enough to get more ingredients to make five pho bowls just for us!! We had chicken pho and the noodle and broth was delicious and very fresh! 
29330 I had a grilled chicken salad, with feta and greek dressing. It was good. Nothing amazing, but solid. 
29331 Jewel of a restaurant! Excellent food, service and nice ambiance. We live in the neighborhood and eat here at least once a week. 
29332 Though the pasta was good, I couldn't believe the proportions I got for the price (hence the 3 star review). 
29333 Went there today. Pretty good seafood. My husband was impressed. Reasonably priced, wait is not too long and well seasoned. We will be going back again. 
29334 I had the banana bread pudding last night and it was so decedent and delicious!! It was made fresh upon my order, nice warm banana pieces with a nice cream sauce drizzled on top, served in a small cass iron skillet! Perfection! 
29335 Nice rack. Definitely more tolerable than most TJ Maxx's or Marshalls, fellas... Great selection of sneakers, watches, and they have extra long ties, which I need since I'm tall. 4 stars! 
29336 Obsessed with this place!! The Pamloma margarita was amazing and I am not a big tequila drinker but it was so good!! Hider served us and he was as nice as can be. We came with a group of 45, sat outside, and had the best time!! 
29337 Super friendly service no matter what time of day. Pastries are fresh and locally sourced. Coffee is deep roasted and not for the faint of heart. When I'm in a tea mood nothing is better than that Assam Golden Tip. 
29338 Service is terrible, they took a long time to bring drinks and food and had no olives for a martini. 
29339 We came for a late morning, pre-lunch snack and drink, and everything was perfect. Cool champagne, attentive waiter and fast and professional service. 
29340 Shannon Mcclenny is a wonderful stylist. She gave me the best haircut ever! I could never get curls to stay before. However, with the haircut she gave me, they are lasting all day!!!! It's amazing! Thank you so much Shannon! You are the best and will always cut my hair! 
29341 Just picked up corsage and boutinerre for Prom for my daughter. Paid $56 for the 2 of them and I am shocked at how small they are and the lack of detail and flowers are even wilting already and it's only noon! Very disappointed! Never again! 
29342 I got the vegetarian croissant sandwich and it was absolutely amazing. Everything was cooked perfectly and all the flavors of red peppers and marinated artichoke hearts was delicious. I was so satisfied me and my boyfriend (who loves meat) came back the next morning for another before leaving Portland. 
29343 Great food, great atmosphere...an overall good experience however, don"t be in a hurry. 
29344 The salmon collar... You MUST eat it! Crispy salmon skin salad is also very good 
29345 #2 is new to this area but I've eaten there twice in the last 10 days and enjoyed everything! 
29346 Hot dog with Japanese inspired ingredients = yes please. I am now addicted to salted seaweed on my hot dogs. Awesome prices and the staff are always happy. 
29347 By far, my favorite restaurant. Love the small town feel and great food. I go there all the time. Highly recommend. 
29348 This is was my first and last time here. I ordered takeout and had to put the pizza back in the oven at home bc it was undercooked. I asked for light onions and it was covered in them. Definitely not worth $42. 
29349 Based on so many good reviews, I decided to have dinner here during my layover. This is probably one of the nicest upscale airport restaurant. Ordered pork belly sliders and kamikaze roll. Food tasted fresh, and service was great. 
29350 Horrible - the worst dosa I ever ate was at the Dosa Factory. The Dosa (crepe), masala(potatoes cooked in spices and onions) and the sambhar were all horribly poor in taste, flavor and quality. 
29351 worst noodle EVER had, no real bowl, the miso soup base is okay. However the noodle is worse than worse. The worst experience I have ever had. Even instant noodle is better than this! 
29352 Great food! Visiting from out of town and looked up best restaurant in the area. Barcelona didn't disappoint. The Valencia crispy rice was out of this world! 
29353 I'm a huge fan of egg harbor! My kids' favorite is the "rainbow pancakes". I seem to gravitate to their "San Antonio Skillet" most times, but they always have intriguing specials. I just noticed the jalape√±o bacon for the first time this trip.... Wow, very spicey and delicious! 
29354 I visit this restaurant for breakfast. I didn't have reservation but the stuff service was really good. I could have wonderful time at here. The foods also delicious. When I'll come to Boston again,I wanna visit here ! 
29355 Great espresso. Great macarons. Friendly service. Clean bathroom! Beautiful aesthetics. 
29356 Best vegan/vegetarian burritos in town. Make sure you use a lot of hot sauce to add flavour. 
29357 Gooood review Hot fries Good gravy AND cheese curds Small seats a little squishy Free water! 
29358 This is my fave spot to sweat in this city. Been to their downtown flow classes and nothing beats the low key vibe here. Try the morning 7am classes to set the day right. 
29359 This place is so cute! Lots of wonderful and tasty treats. We LOVED the curry doughnuts!! We can not wait to come back!! 
29360 Thought I would try the special for administration assistants day Inattentive waiter, cold food and snow crab instead of Alaska king crab. I am not sure I will return, nice view is not worth it. 
29361 Pat is excellent! This sprint store is one of the best! Come in and see Pat for a limited time you can get HTC one buy one and get one free! 
29362 They've only gotten better with time, and we get delivery. The pad ke mao has a wonderful flavor and they aren't afraid to make it spicy. I generally stick with their curry, they aren't fantastic but I feel like they have a number of other delicious options. 
29363 Sabrina Smith went above and beyond, The best of the night staff. Nicole was an awesome bartender, friendly, relatable. I won't soon forget my stay because of these two. Thank you Crowne Plaza, you made my stay an unforgetable experience. 
29364 The salmon po-boy was good, and the battered fish was ok. The fries that came with both were so over cooked and hard we couldn't eat them. 
29365 Fantastic pizza tied for first place in Boston's best pizza with Regina's. Old school Eastie atmosphere. Located near the airport so it's a great stop to or from the airport. 
29366 I like to tasty wok good salt paper ribs & GT shrimp n seafood panda five noodles everything so good 
29367 Average. Pricey... there is so much competition that I can't seem to grasp why this place is viewed so highly? Must be the interior design... Or the name! Very cool name. 
29368 I love love love this place! It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall place, nothing fancy, but the staff is very friendly and the food is delicious! The green onion pancakes are a must-try, and I love the steamed dumplings. Yum yum yum! 
29369 Awful service. Wouldn't recommend this place unless you like being ignored. We left. 
29370 You get a 5 just because you ARE Sam Adams. Great experience and tour. Had a wonderful time with friends and took a great tour offered by some great people. It is a must to go and check out the brewery. 
29371 Forget the beautiful animals, every show has a person with an impeccable narrating voice that puts Morgan Freeman to shame. Worth every penny (rounded up while you're in Canada) 
29372 Love the food! Had chicken tibs and the veggie platter. Service was good. The only issue i saw was the restrooms were dirty. For the quality of food, would like to see the place a little more cleaner, holding back one star for that. 
29373 Pretty much just 'meh' all around. Service was meh, food was meh, atmosphere was meh, nothing really stood out about this place at all. For the same money I can get way better service and food at a number of places like screen door or tin shed. 
29374 First time I've been here since it reopened. The inside looks nice and the menu is good. 
29375 Their pancakes are to die for! They are so big and so tasty. It's always a busy place but service is always top notch. 
29376 Wonderful! Amazing lobster rolls and fries. Hillary is a fabulous waitress, she's friendly & knowledgable. 
29377 Marisol is amazing!!! She goes above and beyond to make sure you get outstanding care....Thank you:) 
29378 By far the worst pizza I have ever had. I came here because it's by my mechanic and I ate while my car was repaired. Never again. Yuck! 
29379 They were awesome! Really helpful with everything, offered routine checks for other fluids while I was getting an oil change and did it all very discounted! And got to take some dog treats home to the pup. I will always come back to groovy! 
29380 The Pearson sandwich is fantastic. It comes on rosemary garlic bread which just might be the best bread I've ever had. Their pesto is perfect. A little oily but worth the messiness! 
29381 Soo in luv with this place! I'm so glad it's right by apartment. I don't know about you but they always treat me great! I tried something a little different this time which was the "what the hell" roll and it was Amazeballs!! 
29382 Been to Howling Wolf a handful of times, absolutely amazing each and every time. A huge selection of foods to choose from and always comes out delicious. Staff was always friendly and was more than helpful to answer any questions I had about the food items. Definitely a great spot! 
29383 The Turkey Avocado Toast is my new obsession!! Sometimes you go places and it taste different every time, not here! It's the same every time!! Everyone's super friendly and really helpful! Love the upstairs patio!! Bottomless Bloody Mary's are great at brunch!! 
29384 I've been eating here since 1994. In my humble opinion, it's the one of the best Vietnamese restaurant in town! 
29385 Best burger I've had in awhile! Quality ingredients! Onion rings are a must!! Great beer selection and friendly staff and they are Doggie friendly so bring your fur baby!! 
29386 Excellent customer service and the deals are phenomenal. If you tell them what you want, they will get it for you and at a surprisingly budget-friendly price. 
29387 My first dosa. I wish the menu had pictures next to each item listed as I don't know what most things are. I liked what I had but don't remember what it's called. I'll be back. 
29388 OMG! I Love this place! I'm glad i don't live close by otherwise I would be here 3x per week. This is one of the best Buritto's (not called that) you will eat. And it's healthier. Can't wait to go back. Big enough for two people. 
29389 Called to make an appointment. The receptionist (guy) was polite enough. Definitely sounds like he's capable of being a douche bag but he was informative. I can't wait to go get my tat on Saturday. I will update my review after I get my tat. 
29390 If you're into high stakes betting on Spanish Jai-alai at 3pm on a Monday this is the place for you. 
29391 Friendly service good location excellent for people watching 
29392 This place excels in just about everything...burgers, beer, milkshakes, service, and selection. Worth the wait. 
29393 This hotel is practically new, very nice and comfortable. The room is huge for a standard room. There is a living room area with a couch and tv. Super convenient location, near UCF. 
29394 Good prices. staff was so friendly. The selection was about average I couldn't find my first choice so I grabbed my back up but Candace looked it up and found it for me, even though I was willing to settle. A friendly and clean neighborhood liquor store 
29395 We've been coming here since it opened, and have enjoyed seeing it grow. We tried brunch for the first time today....these women can cook!!! Delicious authentic Irish breakfast. Plentiful beer selection...Great music too...we'll be back and will suggest it to friends. 
29396 This is some of the best bbq I've ever had. I had the brisket, potato salad, creamed corn, and mac and cheese (banana pudding for dessert). Everything about it was perfect. 
29397 Late weeknight dinner...actually appetizer meal. The Butternut Squash Quesadilla was fantastic. It killed me to have to share! 
29398 Bomb! The food is really good and fresh. Portions are big enough for two. Real nice servers too :) I'm a happy camper. 
29399 I really enjoyed my time at this coffee shop. It was my first time and the service and coffee was good. They also had Valkyrie donuts which are vegan donuts that I had been dying to try and I finally did! Will definitely be coming back more!! 
29400 Loved the momos, it is similar to Indian Chinese. Their hot sauce is better than fire in the hole! Chow mein is very good as well. 
29401 Very good food, time after time. Service has been fine, without exception. We enjoy both the Hingham & Braintree locations depending on who we're 'meeting half-way.' A good bet! 
29402 sucked, owner didn't understand the concept of organization nor customer service 
29403 The best Colombian Food in the area. Keep coming back every month. My favorite place ever. 
29404 The only place I eat out on GSU's campus. Very healthy options and everything is great. My favorite is the Chicken Bibimbop (probably spelled it wrong) with 12 grain rice. If you are getting 2 sides, get the dumplings and sweet potatoes! 
29405 This place is here for the right reasons-scenic, beachy-themed and yum seafood. Sticky place tho-menus, floor, table top, condiments etc since they turn and burn their tables. 
29406 Bueno. Good tacos, chips, drinks. Interesting menu. Good service. Dining al fresco is the way to go. 
29407 This place is great! Prices are very reasonable and the guys there are knowlegable and curious. They got the work done pretty fast and they even gave me a ride to my work when I dropped my truck off. I will definitely go here for cuter tire stuff. 
29408 This little store has all you could possibly need when it comes to Indian spices or food. Reasonably priced and very friendly and helpful owners. 
29409 Delicious food, good service, accommodated our large group with giving separate checks. Would recommend. 
29410 Some good ass bbq!!! Ribs ,brisket, and ribs were so flavorful and delicious. If you are in the area you must try!!!! 
29411 Go to see the manager; a human being working at peak capacity. I got lectured for one of his employees putting my order in the wrong bowl. Hurry before he realizes that he's not cracked up for retail. 
29412 Great food! Wings are cooked to perfection. The best loaded potato wedges and Philly cheesesteak! They've messed up my order the past 2 times I visited but all in all the food was great! 
29413 Great food. Good beer. Solid vibes. Bartender is there 7 days a week and is a solid dude. Plus 25 cent wings. Can't say I know what a South Carolina low county kitchen is but if this is what they're all like I'm sold. Keep up the good work frogmore. 
29414 This is a great spot for Lunch. Decent sized portions. I had the Beef brisket Malaysian curry which was really well done. 7.95 for the lunch specials is a good deal in my book. Not sure what the other poster is talking about this place being expensive. 
29415 Good price for a downtown location. I got the chicken shawrwa plate and it was delicious and good portion. 5 stars will come back again. 
29416 Great gluten free sub rolls! Had a corned beef Reuben sub on gluten free bread that was amazing. So difficult to find gluten free subs in Orlando. I definitely recommend this restaurant and will be back soon!! 
29417 Good food at a reasonable price, customer service below average, a heavy set Hispanic girl is always eating and wiping her nose which is disgusting, Happy she didn't help me. The owner helped me cause she was on the phone half the time. Try the fried chicken with frys excellent 
29418 Loved it. Woulda been 5 stars but was a bit pricey. I have no complaints. Sustenance was great. Libation was even better. 
29419 We had a wonderful evening at Metrovino. They have an extensive wine list and allow tasting wine flights, which is great for discovering new favorites. The food was superb, innovative and attractively presented. We'll be back! 
29420 My foodie husband and I declared this to be our favorite South End restaurant after moving to the South End. The food, drinks and service are consistently excellent. And, as far as we're concerned, they've got an unbeatable cheese plate - the best around! 
29421 The food was fresh and delicious. Our server, Lisa was wonderful. No request too difficult; though some were kinda crazy. Thank you Lisa! 
29422 This place is rad! Bacon horseradish bloody Mary was off the chain!!! Jered was our waitress and he was delightful!! Everything he recommended was bomb! Love this place! 
29423 Amazing food and the staff was very friendly. I'd like to come back and check more dishes but the lamb and dumplings were A +!! 
29424 Love everything about this place! The burgers sometimes are bit rare and very, VERY juicy (so much so the bun is made soggy,) but even so, I'm craving the Goodnight Burger just thinking about it. 
29425 Delicious, quick vegetarian food with large portions! Perfect place to go for a quick pickup lunch. 
29426 Amazing breakfast for our last morning in Portland. Pear, Nutella and Carmel seasonal waffle for me and my husband got the jalape√±o cheese enchiladas ty bacon waffle. Delicious and very filling even in the classic size! We will definitely return if we stay again in charming little Alberta! 
29427 Bad sushi. Bad salmon. Sushiman doesn't care enough or doesn't know how to properly filet a salmon for sushi. I complained and the younger sushiman laughed. Do NOT come here if you like sushi. Poor wine list. They bring the wine bottle already opened to your table. 
29428 Good beer, beautiful patio , big sandwiches!!! Paesano is a good sandwich. Split it if you're not starving. 
29429 The tour was funny and interesting. Our guide, David, was very good even if he is australian (lol). They are fairly pricey but they also have very high quality for it. Good for young children and only an hour long. Definitely worth it while you're on I-drive. 
29430 Stopped by the place for a quick Sunday brunch and tried the bloody mary and butternut squash soup. The bloody mary had just the right amount of kick and the soup was on point. Full rich flavor and perfectly seasoned. Too bad they only offer this in the fall. 
29431 If there is someone better in Austin to sling you drinks and suggest the perfect dish than Tati...I haven't met them. Great vibe, great staff, it doesn't get better! 
29432 Food is amazing at Select Oyster Bar! Great ceviche and large choice of oysters, everything is refined and so fresh. 
29433 Love their unique food presentation--a delight to the eye and the tongue. Enjoy bringing my [grown] daughter here. 
29434 This place is really good and the cheap price makes it's even better. The bun mam is delicious. I plan on trying everything on the menu! 
29435 Drove all the way to cocoa village to give them a try. Posted hours on yelp were 11pm and on their door were midnight. The doors were locked at 10pm w customers still dining inside. I guess theyre just open when they feel like it. Wont be trying them again. 
29436 The food is awesome. If I feel like eating some Hawaii food this is the first place I think of. Also the poke is good too. 
29437 Great place for a bunch of board lovers to hangout with a pint or so. The food is not the greatest , but then who cares when you're busy playing. 
29438 Wow! Only wish we had found this place before our last day. So hard to choose what to have. Amazing food, wonderful service and a Very very cool vibe. And they have almond milk! 
29439 Delicious brunch selections. We had the tomato and duck tartines. Fun and modern atmosphere. 
29440 I love this place!!! Pineapple Upside Down Martini is amazing... & the coconut shrimp is to die for!!! 
29441 Jen is the only person who I've let touch my hair in 8 years, true story. Shes pleasant, professional, and will make you look better than ya already did. 
29442 Love RF - always dependable, always reliable. Great bar, extensive, but reasonably priced wine list. Had one of my faves - pork carnitas. Pull off chunks of nest, wrap them in melt in our mouth pillows of flour tortillas, and there isn't much better. 
29443 Yum!! Love this food! Great Japanese curry and ramen! Great service and nice people! 
29444 Brenda helped us choose a custom sectional sofa. She was incredibly patient and helpful even though she knew we were going to place the order in Colorado. Fabulous customer service. I highly recommend this store! 
29445 One of my Portland favorites. Excellent coffee. Their lemon seed poppy cake is AMAZING!! This location is almost always busy so seating inside can be difficult to come by. Sit outside if the weather allows. The people watching is superb. 
29446 This bar always has great food, great service, and a lively atmosphere! On Friday and Saturday nights there is live music some of the greatest entertainment and it is FREE! Come on down and enjoy 
29447 Always a winner with our teens! Food is delicious, they have a really good veggie burger and you can choose a lettuce bun instead of bread! 
29448 Fresh lobster, not much taste. Lots of flies. Service was good. Just very bland food. Yes everything was fresh... fresh usually coincides with tasty, just not so much here 
29449 Towed my roommates car out of HIS OWN PARKING SPOT. His car is on the list of residents cars and had the Northwestern sticker displayed. They were highly aggressive and unprofessional. Called them and the dispatching people told us totally different rules than the drivers. 
29450 Delicious cupcakes and a wonderful price, can't go wrong! I seriously recommend every single cupcake, they're all fantastic! 
29451 Great place and great collection of pastries and coffee! It would be helpful if they have the fork and spoons in a separate place. 
29452 Chicken Caesar is pretty good. I usually get this and it is consistent every time. Delicious. They also have good breakfast on the morning. But that goes pretty quick. 
29453 Love the food. The view is great. The service is okay. A bit too many blank stares when I ask questions. A sort of exclusionary additude. I definitely felt that being a new customer was not a good thing. 
29454 Cool brunch spot, I had the Sort Rib Hash by recommendation of my waitress. It was everything she promised it to be. Washed it down with a Bloody Mary, after all, they have one of the best Bloody Mary's in America! 
29455 My favorite Starbucks location. They know me by name now so I can tell you the staff is super friendly and nice. Love sitting here while I'm working on my school work. 
29456 Good buffalo burger. The burger was actually cooked just right! Mucho toppings but some need more flavor. Good fries and excellent onion rings! I keep going back 
29457 Very Local Pizza, Wings, Beer & Shots establishment. Multiple trivia sessions a week - Regular and Cartoon on Monday nights at 8 and 9:30. Large Slices of Pizza for $5. Service was right: enough without being annoying. Extremely 'Old 4th Ward' Atlanta, Fairly Adult. 
29458 Tea Chai Te is so great! Everything from their real teas to their fake bubble teas! Always satisfies the tea fix with VERY above average tea. Had the a pot of the darjeeling last time I was there. Excited AND relaxed me! 
29459 Worst service!! Same manager each time. The girls aren't given any direction and they just chat with each other. The manager a female is standing right up front looking clueless!!!!! 
29460 Chris has been helping us with IT for years. He has helped with viruses, hardware problems, and sysem design and installation. He is reliable and straightforward and puts in a lot of work for the money. 
29461 Grill chicken salad is my togo meal. Chocolate cake is very good. I never try other stuff.. I am not sure they made this cake in house..I need to ask them next time I go back. 
29462 Their Spicy Beef Poutine was one of the best Poutine/frites I have ever tried. It's bursting with flavors in your mouth and it's a definite buy whenever you go there! The owner is also a very welcoming person and the restaurant has an awesome environment! Love this place! 
29463 best pizza and roast sausage and lamb in all new england. Period. 
29464 The salsa tastes canned, the bartender that night soooo slow, the waitress was pleasant, and this place is really busy. Can't say it's worth the wait. 
29465 Stopped in to upgrade this morning and was surprised with the excellent customer service. Everyone I talked to was really friendly and Evan who helped me was very knowledgable and helpful. I will certainly be going back to this location in the future! 
29466 New hotel that is perfect for either a quick stay or a long one! Kitchen suite was perfect and the beds comfy! Price was also right! Highly recommend this hotel! 
29467 love the flatbread 
29468 Amicable service, outdoor seating, "Ceasar's" on the happy hour menu, made all 4 of us chuckle, specially when the wait staff asks "are you from the States?" 
29469 SO DELICIOUS. Amazing appetizers, salsas, tacos and cocktails! So excited to have this place within walking distance of my house. Will be my go-to tacos from now on. 
29470 Cathy is a rare find. Impeccable integrity, caring, and strategic. She is on your side and will fight for you and your kids. You won't find a better lawyer. 
29471 High five for five fix ice cream & Taiyaki!!! Me and my love try this place for the first time and we love it!!! 
29472 It's pretty good stuff. Decently priced. A little too hip for it's own good as you can sometimes get the pierced hipster in the ironic stadium rock shirt rolling their eyes at you, but hey-- this is Allston, right? Good coffee too. 
29473 The drinks here are cheap and strong. That alone should be enough for 5 stars! It has a "Cheers" feel to it. The bartenders are really nice and attentive 
29474 Best Thai food I've had in awhile! I would definitely come back if I'm in the ATX area again! 
29475 Good food, but horrible, rude service. Spend your money somewhere better! 
29476 Punjab Palace is the best Indian food at an unbeatable price. The spice and heat levels are perfect which can be quite difficult to master as everyone's taste buds are different. They make and amazing tikka masala but nothing beats their chicken korma. 
29477 I work super early in the area & stop here since they're open 24 hours. Yay for that! I've only had one person serve me some sort of young guy. Super friendly & efficient! I appreciate it! 
29478 DELICIOUS! Yummy food and a super reasonable price. My favorite go-to spot before/after going to the theater. Lots of veggies that come with the meat selections, and every broth I've tried is great. Can't wait to go back! 
29479 Yesss!! Just ate here the other day and love it. So glad this place extended from the west coast! Food and drinks are super yumm. 
29480 Went here recently for the first time and was really impressed with the quality of the bento box lunches. Very affordable and great food. 
29481 I like the boutique shop. Great things at great prices. 
29482 Food was A+ and wine recommendations were paired perfectly. They also served the best dirty martini I have ever had. I recommend the Flat iron Steak and Sweet Potato Ravioli. Yum! 
29483 Stopped in last week. It wasn't busy so I got seated right away. I got the signature pedicure. The foot mask, hot stones, and paraffin hit the spot. Clean salon. Good service. I'll be back when i am in the area. 
29484 Friendly staff, awesome beer selection, tasty food (especially the poutine), and Barbara Roberts is a regular. This place is everything I love about Sellwood. 
29485 Always a stop for us when we are vacationing in the area. Food was delicious and service was great! The toppings bar is always a favorite of our family. Our family of 6 left with full bellies and big smiles. 
29486 The service was genuinely friendly and quick. Good value overall. Loved the cole slaw, baked beans and roast turkey. Come in with low expectations and a few dollars in your pocket, you'll walk out happy and full. 
29487 Very reasonable and a good selection of food, but the place generally at least in the afternoon could use a good cleaning. I found the general sense of cleanliness off putting. 
29488 They did an amazing job on my labradoodle. He's still a puppy so was a bit worried how he would react to the table/clippers etc., but he was very comfortable with everyone there and the cut is so great! Pampered pets will be his grooming place moving forward. 
29489 Used to love this place. Service is so bad now that I give it 1 star. Ego tripping low life assholes working the place. Don't come here. 
29490 Medium wings had no flavor and made me sick. The only reason they get 2 stars is for their good beer selection. Once it gets later in the day they apparently start charging pint prices for lousy plastic cups that aren't a pint. 
29491 Awesome place. Fancy and can be pricy. Their steak salad is really good and they have good wine selections. Outside is super cool with the nice tiki touches being lit in the warmer months. 
29492 The food here was amazing!!! From the tacos to the desserts. The drinks were out there but really good as well. Kid friendly. The waiters are all attentive. Definitely coming back for sure! 
29493 This place has some of the best sushi my husband and I have ever had. We have been to Japan so you could say we are "sushi snobs" and are very picky about sushi. The sushi (nigiri) was awesome!!!! 
29494 Overrated. That said, good hipster vibe here. Order the pork belly. Best thing on the menu. Good bartender. Loud! Overall, I wouldn't pick it as a go-to. But if you're in the area looking for a decent affordable dinner.. this will do. 
29495 Although pizza is pretty good. Customer service wise needs a huge improvement. That's why is getting only 3/5 stars 
29496 This one is so nice! They keep everything super clean and organized. It's definitely an awesome place for people of all ages. The cards are super convenient too! 
29497 Amazing ice-cream. Fresh and clean tasting is the best description I can think of...if that makes sense. Staff was wonderful. Yes 11$ a jar is a little excessive but once in awhile totally worth it! Gotta check it out. Enjoy! 
29498 I highly recommend these folks. I have been there twice and nothing but true honest work. John and Carlos are extremely friendly and good at what they do. 
29499 Good entertainment out back. Peaceful setting and good food. Would return for sure and do it again 
29500 Really wasn't looking forward to making the visit but I'm glad I did. Pat was great. I went in to get a new phone and he helped me update my bill. Super patient, informative, and helpful. Go see Pat! 
29501 Their all you can eat menu is awesome! It's a good choice because of their cheap price(22/person). The quality is not bad for this price! Especially recommend their sashimi, special rolls and their ice cream. Don't order their ramen, no good. Leave yourself some space for other good stuff. 
29502 Not your normal food court food. It is awesome food and great choices!! 
29503 Great place! They have great Thai food here! But they're spice level is definitely more spicier than most Thai restaurants. 
29504 Great food, lots of food, great price! Had the beef and lamb shawarma plate, half of that was more than enough for me. 
29505 I eat here every time they come to Emory Midtown hospital. You get a lot for the $$ which is great compared to many other food trucks. 
29506 Came on a fundraising night for the disabled community. Had a buzzed heckler and they dealt with him quickly and in a undistruptive manner. The talent was decent, and the nachos were surprisingly amazing. 
29507 Check out The Ellis Room for a classic or creative hand-crafted cocktail. Waits for a drink can get a little long during busiest hours, but it's worth it! They serve one of my favorite Old-Fashioneds in town. A hidden gem in Brookline Village. 
29508 Fantastic food and friendly service. Loved the deviled eggs and the options. You could really go crazy! 
29509 Great breakfast tacos (get the Breakfast Taco Bueno) and good iced coffee at a reasonable price. The staff are friendly and there is free reliable Wi-Fi! Older atmosphere but a good place if you want to read or get some work done. Added bonus of a post office next door. 
29510 My friends and I love this spot! It's great for post-games after events at The Garden. Spacious, multiple bar areas, and tons of TVs... pretty cool that they have live music on the weekends too! Will definitely be back. P.s. the pickleback hot dog is amazing. 
29511 A great setting for a great restaurant! The wait staff and hostess make you feel like family and are always personable. The menu is very tasty and the adult beverages quench the hardiest thirst! 
29512 I love this place, food made with real ingredients, and pet friendly, it was a delight. Had Tummy Warmer with a side of bacon for a couple breakfasts, and last evening had the Mac-o-the Day dinner, enjoyed all of it. I go there every time I am in Portland. 
29513 Rude manager! Rude waitress! Wouldn't recommend the place for a friend! Beside that they asked us to pay a minimum $50/person but then they closed early instead of closing 2 am (last minute decision as what they explained). Hint: most of the time I go there, their waitresses are horrible! 
29514 The food was not great as people said. Tuna and salmon had some fishy smell that I don't like. The cherry radish was bitterÔºånot recommend with sparking water. The steak was really nice. 
29515 Besides the waitress knowing very little English the food and atmosphere was amazing. The food was cooked very well and the lemonade was to die for. I would totally recommend this place for anyone craving authentic Mexican food. It looks sketchy on the outside but, it's worth the try. 
29516 Such great food and at great prices! Red curried chicken is amazing. 
29517 I gave Amy's a 4 star and I'm giving this a 5 star because I like the flavors A LOT better. Man they have some great flavors and there are more of them. They also have shaved ice, too! 
29518 Love Windy Hill Dental! We have been going for years and everyone is so nice. You never have to wait. Shannon cleans teeth fast and efficient. Love it there! 
29519 Tried this restaurant based on other reviews and it was a total win. The food is delicious and the staff are so friendly. Got the Appa's Udon Spicy. It was very spicy and so delicious. Highly recommend! 
29520 Excellent food and drinks and a great ambience for an already beautiful location...Vancouver Ca 
29521 I love Mt. Bonnell. Everything about Mt. B is beautiful, including the drive up there. During the night, the overlook is lit up from all of the lights from houses and other building. Scenery is key here. Nice place to just relax. 
29522 I hate getting my hair cut. Anxiety attacks, the works. But these guys made it a joy. And the old fashioned shave was amazing. New monthly destination! 
29523 Nice place to go in the summer time with the outdoor back patio. Good food and drink! 
29524 This is my favorite bagel spot. You can't got wrong with anything you get here! I personally recommend the everything bagel with tomato herb cream cheese and toast it. 
29525 The food here was excellent. I had the bife grelhado (grilled steak) and the portion size was more than enough. I also had a caipirinha which was delicious. Needless to say, I will definitely be returning! 
29526 Expensive and the wait is forever. Very good food and drinks though. 
29527 I am a huge fan of Pizza Patron Doraville, GA. The pizza is excellent and Ramiro Garcia is always providing excellent service. I highly recommend this place for a delicious, inexpensive and great pizza. 
29528 Holy cra##ola; strong cocktails! My marg knocked my socks off! Early dinner menu 5-6. Zzzzzzzzz OMg. Ask me later. I've typed the wrong the nf 7 times!!!! I get ve up! 
29529 I called them to schedule an appointment to turn on the system and do the regular maintenance for the spring. They gave me a date to come 3 weeks ago. Yesterday someone was suppose to be there, no show no call! Would you consider this a professional service! Unreliable ! 
29530 This place gives me a different price every time I come..... I found out that if they think you Mexican you'll get a different price from the "Americans". That's probably why they are never busy. Try "Los Broncos" they're across the street. 
29531 This is a dive bar. Make no mistake. It is also everything you ever wanted in a dive bar. Also, our server John is the best. My drunk crapshow friends commandeered part of the patio today, and he took excellent care of us. Patience of a saint. 
29532 I came here for a flower arrangement for my cousin, and the woman working here was able to whip something up real cute, real quick. Great service! 
29533 Love this spot... Reasonable prices for quality wings & other American favs... Best Turkey Burger I've had in a long time! 
29534 Very happy we made the drive over here. Great food and service. We are looking forward to coming back. 
29535 Huge store, lots of things, horrible dvd selection....but who buys them anymore? Staff were kind of demeaning when I asked a question. 
29536 Bill got me all taken care of today for my wedding next month. He's very knowledgeable and listened to my wants and concerns. I left very happy with my purchase! He suggested some bolder colors than I'm used to but they turned out great! See Bill for an excellent experience. 
29537 can be an expensive meal but its worth it alot of good food to choose from and they have some of the best bread ever. The fish is always excellent and has a great taste to it so if u love seafood this is the place to go. 
29538 I love this place! Of the many decadent options the lemon poppyseed donut is my very favorite donut. The NW 23rd location is perfect for a family walk to get a treat on a weekend morning. 
29539 Amazing brisket. Hands down the best bbq in town! Hope you get a peak at their pits! It's freaking amazing! 
29540 Absolutely delicious food. Smoked mushroom lo mein was surprisingly the highlight of my meal. I expected it to just be a filler course but it was by far my favorite dish. 
29541 just came from there. got some great plants that are tough or smell so hopefully the deer will leave them alone. found their prices in line with big box store but better selection (better looking selection). staff was very knowledgeable. i'll be back!! 
29542 Horrible place. Will not serve men. Stupid. Horrible place! Save your time for another place. Zero stars Unfortunately i have to select a star to post. DO NOT GO 
29543 The fish tacos are the best I've had in Boston! The only problem is, sometimes they don't have fish 
29544 I am not even his customer but the advice that I got from Paul regarding go about my purchase was super helpful. This is what I consider going above and beyond. Needless to say, this is where I will be going for any of my future repair needs. 
29545 Fantastic quick, family friendly buffet. Indoor and outdoor dining. Service was great as well. Typical spread you'll find in any Starwood. 
29546 I popped in here for a beer and some small bites before going off to a wedding. The food is typical pub/seafood fare. We had the Buffalo calmari which was AMAZING. I defintely go back here. Great location too, on the water. If its nice, sit outside. 
29547 Loved the beer selection and foods. Loved the recliners and atmospheric but the prices are a bit ridiculous. 
29548 Great place to hangout with friends. All you can eat for $18. We had lots of mussels and calamari. Service was excellente. 
29549 I've visited this place several times. It's not bad. It's just a cool place to go have drinks with friends. The bartender was not very attentive at first but as the night progressed she was and had a friendly demeanor. The crowd varies from college aged to working professional. 
29550 Jose took great care of me and my hair! He knew exactly what I needed, and gave me a beautiful style. The salon is beautiful, and the staff is friendly. Go see Jose today!! 
29551 Poor Poor service; did not even get to the pretzel part the water was $2.45 and it was $1.99 two weeks ago. I do not like getting ripped off in my own city twice by auntie Annes! Will tell all my train friends and Facebook not to go there. 
29552 I went today. Service and food is on par with other Bonchon. However, I ordered hot water to drink and they gave me hot water from the tap. 
29553 So nice to come into this small eatery and be treated like family. The proprietor was helpful in advising us of what was in each of the dishes, as well as how to properly pronounce things. Great spot we will be back for! 
29554 Stopped in to have my state inspection done... fast, efficient, and friendly service. What more can one ask? 
29555 Killer breakfast tacos and lunch tacos. I've had the migas, watermelon agua fresca, carne asada and al pastor tacos. The meat was tender, juicy, and incredibly flavored. Top taco truck in Austin. It's cheap and does not disappoint. 
29556 Well known for it's burger. But try the fish sandwich or the crispy chicken , you won't regret it! Also you can substitute the fires with salad. Kids menu is very good. Average service. 
29557 Went for happy hour. Nothing special. Price reasonable though didn't really feel like a deal. Specialities drinks not great. Would skip next time. 
29558 lovely neighborhood juice spot.. great staff! provided us with a bunch of delicious samples. decided on G2. heart throb and kale superfood bowl! definitely will be back again and again! 
29559 ALL around great burger meal! Best onion rings (Vodka batter) hands down! Best dressings/sauces...I mean SMOKED MAYO ... come on! Very delish! You wont regret it. It it there though! Not a good reheat. Enjoy :-) 
29560 Best burger joint I went to Texas. The Thunderbird burger with farm egg was out of the world good. If you like burgers, you have to come here and don't forget their garlic fries. :) 
29561 A safe bet- good pork burrito the toppings seemed dreams nice-and the chips with the queso and guacamole were very good- The store and the kitchen line appeared clean and organized But nothing wow'd me here. 
29562 No coleslaw yet they sell fried clams & scollops Seams un American to me. when you say the worlds best you better be good. There just all right 
29563 Love the vibe of this mini downtown area. The decor colorful and fresh, service kind. I loved the fried sushi with cream cheese, and app's. A lovely place to hang and have a beer. Excellent, trendy, tasty! 
29564 This is the best and only Persian restaurant that you should go to while in the Boston/Ma area. I went there on thanks giving night and their service was amazing and very attentive. The must try dish here is Kabab Koobide ( ) 
29565 Cool spot. Hop hop and away was delish. No food. Have to order for pick up or delivery 
29566 Excellent bar Lexi rules!! Great service and an incredible environment remembered it and had to come back over a year later thanks keep doing what you do! 
29567 He was doing his Cart years before it was COOL. Best fast in town. Great chili dogs, the best ever ..... 
29568 Well, I am not sure if it is a fraud or just a mistake, but they managed to charge me $2000 on my card when I got two coffees and a danish. Escalated this issue with my bank, but would avoid this place due to the strange charging practices 
29569 Great boutique hotel! I will definitely stay here again. Staff was awesome with suggestions/directions and customer service. Can't go wrong with a welcome glass of wine upon arrival. The decor was perfect!! The beds and pillows felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. Can't wait for my next return. 
29570 We ordered 1 lb of pasta here and took it home. It was delicious!! We live in the North End and have bought pasta from different shops there as well but Nella's pasta was our favorite by far. Can't beat the quality or price! 
29571 Great ice cream but at $5 for a single, I won't make this my go-to spot for a frozen dessert fix. The pints, $11 each, are a much better deal and worth the splurge. 
29572 Excellent service, professional, courteous, reasonable prices. She offers Rush Service for a modicum fee and she's downright meticulous to detail. She handles all of my families tailoring and seamstress needs. 
29573 Im a huge fan. I get their meatloaf and potatoes and beans dinner. Awesome. Prices and deserts are really decent- service is on point- local charm... love it! 
29574 Bad service coupled with bland, creamy, 110% Americanized Indian food is what you get at Clay Pit. I'd stay away from this one! 
29575 Food, drinks, server, atmosphere were all great. Some of the dishes had a long lag time coming out, but we didn't mind. We will definitely be back soon! 
29576 This is a really nice place to come and relax on a Saturday morning either on your own or with the entire family. Very relaxing spot. The drinks and pastries are amazing. I had the chocolate croissant and it was really good I will definately be back. 
29577 Don't go to the "owners updates" or anything that seems like a sales talk. Avoid stress during a vacation. Otherwise, as a long-term owner, I recommend this resort property. 
29578 Better than Salt Lick, albeit without the atmosphere The Dinosaur Beef Rib is worth the money and a gift from God 
29579 Had a fantastic family dinner here with my wife and 3.5 yr old. Service was on-point, as was their king salmon and fatty tuna sashimi. Get the pork belly here too, it's amazing! 
29580 great food. friendly service. makes you feel good about eating a burger. 
29581 I love the hot chicken plate and slaw! It's been amazing every time I've been (which is a lot), and the service is always fast and friendly. Be sure to get the kool-aid flavored soft serve! 
29582 Drinks are expensive, not worth the free ticket for the country concert my gf and I went to. I also left my fitbit there, called their messaging service two different times and never received a call back as I was told I would receive. very poor customer service. 
29583 Lively, crowded location in the Hong Kong style. I am primarily a pescaterian so choices were limited. 
29584 I stopped into Ramano's for a buritto once. It was the worst buritto I've ever eaten. The meat was dry and the rice undercooked. Perhaps their pizza is better. 
29585 Tap room is awesome. 20 beers that they brew on tap. Awesome beers. Friendly staff and friendly atmosphere. 
29586 Wow.. this is the most jam packed Dry Bar I have ever been to. Even though they were extremely busy, I only had to wait about 10 minutes after my appointment time to get ready. The staff was very attentive, and my blow dry came out gorgeous! 
29587 I don't understand the reviews that have less than 5 stars!! This place was awesome! We will be going back over and over 
29588 Midtown needs a good Mexican restaurant and sadly there are none. This place is just awful. It's that typical "American" style Mexican food that so many unrefined palates think is so amazing. 
29589 candy castle is a cute candy store and it has a wide variety of yummy treats! you should definitely stop by if you have a craving for sweets - you wont be disappointed! it is not too expensive either. however it is a little hard to spot... 
29590 I thought this place was just so-so. The food wasn't that memorable, and they ran out of cider on tap! Bummer. Also, my friend found a bug in her salad... it looked exactly like a leaf! 
29591 Not sure why I continue to go here? Maybe the $6 undercooked pizzas? Every pizza we have gotten from here is undercooked and cooked uneven. I just ordered a sandwich on a braided roll with extra pickles. Got it on a regular roll with no pickles. Really? 
29592 The carnitas were delish! Ask for the hot sauce, guacamole & red chile sauce complimented the rice & beans! 
29593 Came here on a whim, so glad we did. Happy hour specials are awesome. Great whiskey sour for 3.50, and 3 dollar beers all day mondays! Didn't catch our server's name, but he handled so many tables effortlessly. Seriously great service. Can't wait to come back! 
29594 Lots of parking here and drive through has been upgraded recently to take more orders at once. Sitting area isn't always clean but I see staff come through from time to time to clean it. Staff are just average in customer service 
29595 Love it! awesome concept. great tacos. Cheap prices. Awesome patio. GO! 
29596 Been my favorite restaurant in the Atlanta area for years. Everything on the menu is delicious, but I recommend the blackened chicken burger and the strawberry jalape√±o drink, or the chicken fingers. 
29597 Love this theater. Friendly service, clean screening rooms and bathrooms. I've been going here for at least 8 years and I finally got around to reviewing this establishment. 
29598 I usually dread going to the dentist and I was kind of worried b/c I had a really awesome dentist in San Diego whom I loved and trusted. I just started seeing Dr.Pezeshki though based on other yelp reviews and I LOVE him. No....seriously. He's amazing. Thatisall. 
29599 Loved this little place. Great character in a place you wouldn't expect. 
29600 ... damn good. Had the "Cuban"--and the roast pork was awesome. Plus, there was enough of it to make two meals. And they had coffee cubano to go--how cool is that? 
29601 Beautiful ambiance. Mediocre iced latte. Wouldn't be opposed to coming back and trying another drink but the latte tasted incredibly watered down. 
29602 As several reviews have noted the guacolomy is prepared at your table and is excellent. The margaritas are excellent but a tad pricey. Have eaten there at least ten times and have never had a bad meal. 
29603 This place is SO good. The portion sizes were huge, the costs were relatively inexpensive, the staff was incredibly friendly and the outdoor area is dog friendly. I have found my favorite breakfast cafe in Atlanta. 
29604 Great place that's centrally located in Avondale. I'm From Miami and really miss Latin food and flavor and this place has some delicious choices. 
29605 This is a great game shop. Folks are really helpful and knowledgeable across the spectrum of minis, board games, and RPGs. Lots of gaming tables, great conversations, and friend atmosphere. Truly it's an awesome place to spend an evening. 
29606 Flat bread pizza? Waffledog? sounds like great ideas! and they taste awesome! This little truck is a perfect combination of late night snacks that are relatively light and simple and guilty pleasure that satisfies your craving for something delicious and rich. I'm definitely going back for more! 
29607 Great atmosphere both inside and outside and often have fun and talented live, local musicians. Good food and alcohol choices, great smoothies and very friendly staff. I think that this place is very well run and if you sit outside, it's dog friendly and even has water bowls for them. 
29608 Husband took me here for a birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. The food, atmosphere and service was amazing! I can't wait to visit again with our friends for some wine tasting and a few of the yummy desserts that I was too full to have this time around. 
29609 Great fresh food. Being originally from Florida is has been hard to find a decent Cuban restaurant in Texas. This pace has good Cuban food and a good variety on the menu. I strongly suggest trying the Habanitini, it's delicious. 
29610 Can't get enough of this place. The food is always great (taste and portion). Tucked away in a strip mall on the east side of Orlando, this place was a hidden gem. Try the summer rolls with peanut sauce and C9! 
29611 Super-stylist Timothy Hay is now doing one day a week at the Midtown location. If you are convenient to this area and need a haircut, run don't walk...he's easily the best scissor-wielder in Atlanta. Seriously can't say enough good things about Timothy's haircuts. 
29612 Had a very nice experience. Private party of 50 people. Everyone raved about the food and service. The meals all came out hot and cooked to order. Would recommend without a doubt. 
29613 Dark and hard to read menus in evening. My drink was good but that was one out of four. We just shared food and snacked on things which was perfect. I wonder what it is like in the day. 
29614 Prices have increased a lot in the last few months. Prices use to be comparable to Red Cat but find that prices are a bit more now. Not sure I would want to purchase unless it's during their sale in July or December. 
29615 Absolutely delicious food. The house-made chorizo double-decker sandwich and potatoes were a total win. The boozy coffee drink (called Canadian, I believe) was also outstanding. Can't wait to go back! And wonderful atmosphere to boot! 
29616 I really like Gus's- never been here without a wait so go when you have time. The chicken always comes out hot and fresh. Simple menu but all done pretty well. Sides are straightforward nothing fancy but it is really about the chicken!!! 
29617 I really like the food here. My only complaint would be smelling like BBQ when you leave the restaurant. I would eat outside or get the food to go. Very clean. Great service. 
29618 The Mac n brisket was popping!! I didn't finish it and had to take it Togo.. The place was quiet I think they were about to close but nonetheless it was fantastic. Good SOUTHERN FOOD 
29619 I tried them again because I'm good like Mario but the food is dry and hard very disappointed 
29620 I cannot believe the food, the service, the place. I will definitely learn how to make teff bread. What a fantastic experience. I got more of quality food of what I paid for. I would go back again to this fantastic place. Service is superb 
29621 Delivery took 1.5 hrs (was told 35 -45 minutes). When it was finally delivered pizza was cold and tasted terrible. Never again. 
29622 This was fantastic! The flavor of the steak was rich and the refried beans added unique texture. There was great verity in the salsa bar and the staff was friendly and helpful. 
29623 Great place. Very friendly staff. I was there only for happy hour and just had pizza and Aperol Spritz. But I was very happy about the quality. I will definitely go back. 
29624 this is the best place in boston for Sushi. My husband and I have been there at least 6 or more times and every time the service is great and the food is amazing 
29625 Love this place! Awesome live bands, great young crowd and Teresa is the nicest bartender there! 
29626 Good atmosphere- food is ok- service was great- burger to me wasn't outstanding though. 
29627 This is my favorite hotel in the world! And not because they remember us by name even months and months after we have visited! They simply strive to be perfect here and it shows! We love staying here period! 
29628 Amazing store, I found everything I needed and the prices were great. That lady Linda really knows her stuff, very helpful. Now I know where to go for my boat stuff, no more ordering and waiting like at West Marine. 
29629 I was really looking forward to dine at this pub, but was greeted by a cold waitress who passed my guest an I three times without sitting us. It seems like all the staff there was rude and didn't place importance in good service to the clients. 
29630 Love it here. Best steak tips around! Food service wine cocktails atmosphere... New fav place to go! 
29631 Loved this place. Kayla helped me and she was fabulous. She fit me well and we found the perfect bra for my body. Well endowed ladies should all thank their lucky stars this place exists- I sure am! I will definitely be back. 
29632 Easy review, don't go. Most importantly, the food was average at best, definitely not worth the price. Worse, the service/attitude was BAD. One time, customer-specific incident? I guess anything is possible--but the food was just not good. 
29633 $1 dollar tacos that are succulent, flavorful, and filling. You really can't go wrong here. We are even considering having them cater our wedding. Delicious! 
29634 Best secret in portland! Came here for a 3 day trip and ate here on our last day...honestly we shouldve eaten here everyday we were there. Great food, great value...to me you can't ask for much more. 
29635 Very nice place. They have wine tastings, fair prices, great selection and allow dogs if you are on a walk! Too cool 
29636 Amazing museum well worth your time. Many of the things he stood for and fought for are still issues we are fighting today. His comments then are just as poignant and important as they are today. The museum is well done with memorabilia across the decades. 
29637 Hands down, my favorite Asian restaurant in existence. The service can be slow at times, but you will never leave unsatisfied. My personal recommendation would be the crispy pad thai, or the sesame chicken. Also, their fried rice is delicious. Period. 
29638 I had my prom dress hemmed and the price was awesome. Lili was such a sweet and honest person. I'm going to my prom again this year, and truth be told, I'd only trust her when it came to alterations. 
29639 Shared a scorpion bowl and several different rolls. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. 
29640 Delicious! Went with kids. Loved the Empanadas! I had spicy Chicken yum! My son said the Meatball Empanada was the bomb! My daughter loved the pineapple chicken. A perfect mixture of sweet and spicy. 
29641 Food is good. However, the most unwelcoming staff ever. Rude is the word for them. They stopped kids gumbo and I stopped going to this place. 
29642 Came here to see the hype about the fries. And yes they're amazing!! Had the chicken fried steak as my meal and that thing is excellent and some! Also had the hotdog and that was excellent as well. 
29643 I had a party of 16 and everyone was amazed with the atmosphere, the appetizers, entrees, and dessert! Not to mention the beautiful belly dancer. The service and owners are great people who want to ensure everyone gets the best quality experience. A top notch establishment. 
29644 Can't believe they charged me $10 for the "juice" they made me. Service was bad. I highly recommend not going here. 
29645 Excellent dinner choice! All the dishes we ordered were fresh, flavorful, and delicious! The ambiance and waitress were great. The mussels, , local salad, gnocchi and kid's burger were on point. 
29646 I had the famous ' House special #1 Bun Bo Hue' and a spring roll. the service was pretty quick. Good broth, fresh pork blood but didn't like the noodle too much. the spring roll had weird old oil smell... Prob not going to order the spring rolls next time. 
29647 Why did I think I could drive over and get a key made on Sunday. Nobody could even tell me how much it cost to get a key made. But several people want to sell me a car and tell me about how great the service is here. 
29648 Wonderful caf√© with amazing food and service! The staff is amazing and you are always taken care of! We love this place:) 
29649 Authentic Tonkotsu Ramen that almost rivals sister restaurant Umaido. Customizable level of spiciness from 1-100! Definitely recommend to Ramen lovers! Try the rich broth and I assure you won't have any regrets. Ties with Umaido for best Ramen in Georgia! Next is Wagaya 
29650 super packed when you first walk in to order and waiting to pick up your order. there isn't AC in this area so its super hot!!!!! but their classic hot chocolate was good and their white chocolate mocha was decent. 
29651 Food is great, service is fast and the people are nice! 
29652 Don't appreciate being skipped by 4 people while waitng on my boy and waiting for my haircut, first time here. Will not be back. 
29653 BEST TACOS EVER MADE!!! Moved near by about 2 years ago. Went there one morning, been there at least once a week ever since. 
29654 My visit from Vancouver, BC, was definitely worth the trip!! Can't wait to drive back and try out the new gym when it opens across the river. 
29655 Awesome awesome awesome! Their flavours are amazing! And they use local produce to make the ice cream so that's a plus :) 
29656 I don't eat much Indian food, but I've eaten here a few times now, nothing fancy about the place, but the food is very tasty. Very well labeled with a good selection to choose from on their buffet. 
29657 The iced coffee was excellent! A nice change to get good non-chain coffee and fresh baked goods! This is s good place to bring your laptop or a book and hang out upstairs! 
29658 Anyone who has Rogue Dead Guy on tap has my vote. Good food, craploads of on tap beers. Definitely part of the "must attend" of central Florida. 
29659 The garlic/black truffle soup is unique and perfect. Short Rib Gnocchi and Sweet Potato Ravioli were excellent. Beware, food is very heavy and rich. 
29660 Sorry to hear they went out, but no surprise after I found they don't pay their employees their just compensation. If you ever get together with Cole Reese stay away. Biggest lier ever. 
29661 Previous reviews had me frightened, but they were, unfortunately, correct. Thirty minutes had not gone by and we were already disappointed by the service. The shuttles to the theme parks are pathetic. 
29662 Short, boring layout with no character. Subpar condition. A course where golfers go to die. Sorry, not anything good I can say about this place. 
29663 Food and drinks wete great, but the floors need to be redone. The floors are very slippery. Forget wearing heels in the place, unless you want to bust your behind. It's so bad, I heard staff joking about a patron falling, which was unprofessional. 
29664 Expect a long wait If you wanna order uber or any other from this place. My food was sitting there and my driver have to spend 20 extra minutes for them just to pass the bag. This kinda food taste like s**t after a little while. 
29665 Now this is a donut. I know there are several donut shops in Portland, just pass them all by and go straight to Blue Star, these people know what they're doing. 
29666 Lechon did not disappoint! Beautiful display of each dish and flavors came together very well! Service was professional and relaxed. The outdoor seating option just added to the experience. Definitely recommend! 
29667 I love this place. Very good food but the atmosphere is great. The band is incredible. The service is very good. A great place to dance like a fool with the tourists or just chill and people watch. 
29668 I moved back into Boston from the South Shore last year. What do I miss most? Union Brew House. Love the bartenders (what's up Dave Mac), the vibe during a Sox game, the outdoor patio, the pineapple and garlic pizza, the huge selection of beer ... sigh. 
29669 Eh the food is ok but it's all about the cinnamon roll. The ooey gooey-ness of cinnamon in every bite is incredible. So alas, not much to report of my meal since it wasn't anything spectacular, just eh. Perhaps I'll just come for the rolls in the future. 
29670 I had the Buffalo Bill and it was just barely 4-star experience. While enjoyable, there is nothing so magical about their burgers that merits such a lengthy wait. Additionally, for $10 I expected to get some fries with the burger, they are sold separately. 
29671 I love this place! The staff is so friendly and the food is delicious! I have not yet done the hibachi but they have really great sushi. 
29672 Paper finery including a nice selection of letterpress cards. The press is on one side in the back. In the other back room you may be lucky enough to witness someone making paper by hand. This place is a treat! 
29673 Fabulous service, music is just loud enough, and damn fine coffee. Definitely going back. 
29674 Singapore rice noodles, mandarin egg tofu (veggie style), scallion pancakes, and general tso chicken! 
29675 Food wasn't very good. Beer was ok. Expected a better atmosphere for a local brewery. Service was average. Much better brewery options around Columbus. 
29676 breakfast tacos aaaaaaaaall the way! there's more i could say but do i need to? nope. 
29677 Super great service. I used them 3 times while in Boston and the service was top notch, all the cars were clean and they were prompt and on time. Highly reccommend! 
29678 Great atmosphere, food. Went for the multi-course Valentine's day meal once, quite expensive, but everything was great. The Raenwater beverage is very tasty! I saw one of the local weathermen there once. 
29679 This place is awesome. They have great beer and as many have said, it's FREE...ahuge room with games. BYOF and have a blast. I don't understand how this could have any negative reviews. 
29680 Great food, great service. Pricier than $$, but worth it. Could use better ventilation, as the whole place smelled like other folks meals. Almost went back the next night. 
29681 Dont even think twice!! A MUST TRY!!.. Fun & amazing sercice. Great food and fresh drinks!! 
29682 Calvin showed up within 30 mintues in Austin to help my son and I. Very professional and truely a great guy. Thank you again for talking care of us! If we ever need help again, Ill be calling them! 
29683 Best burger we've had in Atlanta so far and at a reasonable price. Cooked to order where medium is actually medium! Fried pickles had a different batter than usual. Definitely order the truffle fries. 
29684 I know there are so many good things on the menu but I can't help but always have the oysters and grilled chicken almost everytime I go in. Both are "must haves" along with a nice glass of wine! 
29685 What a great place. The owner is super nice, helpful, and the store has a great selection of trendy frames for young(er) people. Didn't get my eye exam here, but wish I had! Also, they accept VSP insurance so I got a great deal on my new specs! 
29686 No Backstreet Boys here. Cool music and VARIETY. They also sponsor free concerts in Copley during the the summer and a huge festival on the Esplanade. 
29687 La fitness was great! Thank you Nate for showing me around the gym! I'll definitely be coming frequently. 
29688 Had a lovely birthday dinner here last night. The pizza (capo) & complimentary birthday desert were delicious. Our server, Kiersten, was very helpful with recommendations...& very friendly & attentive. Overall, a great experience. I'll be back! 
29689 I am religious about Dr Radspiner and the team, they are the best. They consider the root of the issue before making an adjustment. Go here! 
29690 UG! They stopped the Tuesday special today....but the chicken is still good, you just get to go back to paying 3 times what you would on a special.....oh well! 
29691 Great selection of classes, including several good aerobics classes and instructors. The indoor pool could use more frequent cleaning. It gets really bad before they drain and clean. Considering the number of classes and number of people using the pool, it should be cleaned a lot more often. 
29692 This is my go to place for grooming my Standards Poodles. Depending upon the time of year, the cut may be longer or shorter. Korri and Wendy are both experienced, treat the dogs well, and customize the grooming to my specific requests 
29693 Here's my recommendation. Pay for the 3 attractions; Orlando Eye, Wax Museum and Sea Aquarium. You'll spend a good amount of time there, have a good time and get your money's worth. Very fun experience with lots of cool things to see and learn! 
29694 We are so lucky to live 3 blocks from here. Amazing food, great staff and an awesome vibe. The shakshuka will turn you into a vegetarian. 
29695 The best wings around, and Cayla is AWESOME (give her a raise). My favorite is their Lemon Pepper wings (wet). 
29696 Had the Gonzo with chicken, blue cheese, and hot sauce...like macaroni and cheese hot wings. Delicious, but I agree with other posters...maybe a tad expensive for macaroni and cheese. 
29697 I agree with Jason. Where did you go? Can't find anything comparable in north Vancouver or on commercial drive 
29698 The village addiction is the best sandwich in the 614. Everyone should go here just for that. Order that, with a bottled Coke, and your afternoon will be made. I love this place! 
29699 The pan seared lobster is as good as lobster gets. You'll end needing more than a few towelettes and it's not cheap, but a rare treat that never disappoints. 
29700 This place is ahhhhmazing! Fantastic craft margaritas, the guac was outrageous, and the service was exceptional! You can tell there is a great amount pride that goes into the quality of food, drink, and service here. We will definitely be back. 
29701 Horrible experience. Ribeye ordered medium...burnt. Broccoli and asparagus...raw. Crab cake was nasty. Server disappeared. Never coming back. 
29702 Frankie Mejia is an awesome artist from LA I got a huge tattoo and was scared to get it when I first thought of it but he worked faster than other people would have Thank you! And I barely felt most of it thankfully 
29703 They can put less salt in their BBQ asado buns. If I were to eat it once every day, I surely would get high blood pressure. 
29704 Walked in and was welcomed with open arms. I had an image of a piece I wanted and The artist was able to replicate it exactly how I wanted it. Mark was my artist and he did an amazing job for me. Very professional, clean, and friendly artists. 
29705 Favourite bubble tea house ever. So many selections and fast service. 5 stars for sure!! 
29706 Fantastic food and great ambiance. Had the Mushroom Bruschetta, Braised Octopus to start and the Lumache Bolognese and Wagyu Bavette as mains. Highlights were the Mushroom Bruschetta and Wagyu beef, but everything was really good. The Crostata dessert was delicious as well. 
29707 This was the best "accidental" find in Orlando! The food is EXCELLENT and plentiful. The people are very nice. I can't even begin to describe the goodness here! Go out of your way to visit. So worth it! 
29708 I love the salads they offer here. I get a different one each time I go in. They always have a new seasonal salad option and it's always interesting. I sometimes add on a pastry to my order for just a dollar and I am never disappointed. 
29709 This place sure doesn't look like much from the outside so I needed to get a recommendation from a friend before venturing in. Thumbs up from the friend and thumbs up from me. BIG servings and a wide variety of combos. Very kitchy decor, friendly staff. 
29710 We had amazing service. Everything we ordered was delicious and original. We loved the mules, dishes, glassware, yellowtail shots, and matcha creme brule. 
29711 Much nicer than the little Italy in New York. 
29712 I had a carry out order of general tso chicken.It was really good.Sweet and hot.Like evevyone else said,Fresh and no mystery meat. I will have it again.The lunch size is a lot of food. 
29713 I've been to this place so many times and it's always excellent. The garlic sauce is so delicious. Big fan. 
29714 Un sitio muy bueno para relajarse y comer postres en un d√≠a compras en Florida mall, lugar perfecto, una variedad de postres y caf√© 
29715 They put on a great Thanksgiving dinner here. Number One, they are open, not many places are. You can get a Turkey dinner, or most of the menu items. Everything was top notch, and they give you leftovers to take home. Just an outstanding experience. 
29716 I had the berry hibiscus tea which was a great refresher. Nice place to sit, wifi and enjoy the ambiance. 
29717 HORRIBLE customer service. They don't carry what other stores have. Stay away! 
29718 Being from NY I pride myself on a tight cut. That's exactly what you get from hwre. Both Mike and Rob are on point with their skills. You can't go wrong!! 
29719 Great quality shirts at an affordable price, and done ahead of schedule - what more could you ask for? Great customer service, that's what you can ask for... And Impress Ink delivers! Friendly, responsive, professional staff including Emily who fielded my web order - thanks for everything! 
29720 What a terrible and confusing resort! Never again! The room was clean which is why I gave them 1 star but this hotel is too confusing to find your way around. I was delayed at least 40 minutes a day. 
29721 Larisa's classes are amazing! Go and you'll never look back !!! They are fun, challenging, relaxing and the environment is playful and caring. Your body will thank you and your mind will thank you even more. 
29722 They got me to my destination from the airport but doggone it, I might be stranded without the ride back I reserved. Can't get their office to answer their phone, their email isn't emailing. Not a way to stay in business in such a competitive market. 
29723 Excellent food truck. Had the garlic noodles, pork over rice and chicken dumplings. The noodles are stir fried with just a bit of crunch. Everything was delicious and they really went out of their way to make us feel at home. Highly highly recommended. 
29724 I came here Saturday (its been 3 days) and my mani/pedi looks amazing. Everyone gave me compliments on my nails. I got gel mani and a regular pedi, which totaled up to be $48. Definitely coming back, they are so precise and careful. 
29725 Favorite sushi in Quincy. Try the Hot Tamale Roll and the spicy edamame (not on the menu, just ask for it). Sushi is always so fresh and never disappoints. Great service, especially Vicky! 
29726 Used them on Christmas Eve because our garbage disposal was leaking. Service was great and they installed a new one at a reasonable price considering the Saturday and holiday hours the employee was out. I would recommend. 
29727 Decor was nice. Food was ok. Prices were suspect. People were satisfied/ok with their food. 
29728 Not a fan of their service. The young tattooed girl at check out was not friendly at all! May go back but not to her register for sure! 
29729 The place was half full and they told us there was a 30 minute wait. Manager told us their kitchen was too busy. This place has gone downhill. 
29730 We stopped here our last trip thru Atlanta and it was so good we had to stop again. Chicken fried steak eggs and biscuits are out of this world. You can't go wrong with their pies !!! Enjoy 
29731 It was ok, nothing wow about. The only think I liked was the stone massage. Would have been nice to get a better scrub on the feet. Just came for a pedi. If you are looking for something quick, this is the place. 
29732 If you are vegetarian do not eat here! I recently ordered a Paneer Tikka Masala with Favor delivery, only to get a piece of chicken in my curry. Ended the night puking instead of having dinner. Never returning here! The food is mediocre anyway! 
29733 Good sushi! I live near by and although it's not the highest quality in town, it's priced well and I always leave satisfied. Excellent service and happy hour too! 
29734 Seating is cool. Aqua Fresca is YUM. Tacos are decent. Tacos gotta be damn good for another star and I wasn't blown away by the flavors. $3-3.50 for a little taco. Gotta order 3 to be full... 
29735 I love the owners - Super nice couple. I love walking here to get a lotto ticket and an ice cream. 
29736 I like this place...haven't been in a while but we usually go for their lunch specials, $5.50 any dish which is a nice sized lunch meal. I always get the yellow curry with chicken and bell peppers. It's awsome! 
29737 Tender and flavorful beef brisket and ribs. Brisket is so tender it falls apart (smoked for 14 hours). So flavorful sauce is not needed. 
29738 Great place to get inexpensive peppers, tomatillos, etc. Will be back to try their marinated meats ready for grilling. 
29739 So great after a night of drinking. Owned by the same guys as Six Acres. My favourites are the Yes Ma'am (mac 'n cheese inside a grilled cheese? what a concept!) and the Melter Skelter. Ask to add some Sriracha in it, your drunken self will not regret it. 
29740 This is the kind of Chinese food I've gotten in ny & nj. Expect to be welcomed by the owners. Great sit down Chinese restaurant. Not fancy just good solid consistent Chinese food. Don't expect any greasy takeout here. Food is fantastic. 
29741 Suggestions include the pork chop, burgers, and lobster Mac and cheese. Happy Hour is 4-7 every day. Nice updated restaurant with wrap around bar. Good food comes out quick. Order the large 42 Oz souvenir cups they are well worth it!!! 
29742 Tessa is the only reason you need to go to Orlando. She is sweet, attentive and has a fabulous personality. The ribeye I had was delicious and the foosball table capped the experience for my lady and I. 13/10 would go every day all day. 
29743 good coffee, unpretentious service. the fellow at the counter has taken the time to remember me, which counts for a lot. 
29744 Great and fast service! Food was delicious and those free pretzel bites for checking in are amazing, the sauces are addicting! Definitely a good place for a nice meal and a superb brunch! 
29745 Expensive for the type of establishment it is. Food was boring. It's been a while since I was there and this is all I can remember. That can't be a good thing.... 
29746 Awesome food. You cannot go wrong with the lamb! Two negatives though: 1.) Not much in terms of parking spaces. 2.) Not wheelchair accessible. :( 
29747 For how small this place is they sure have a lot! In the back of the store you can even make your own fresh peanut or almond butter! Why doesn't every place do this?? Beast me. Great selection of chia and kombucha drinks 
29748 I really like this place...food is consistently good and the people are friendly. I've only grabbed take out...so I can't speak to the dine in experience. 
29749 Simple - serve great beer, bartenders are nice to look at and have a bunch of TVs. Plus a Golden Tee. Didn't try the food but it has to be good. I can't imagine the carnage over the years on the steps down to the restrooms. Classic 
29750 I've been here many times. I just love their ice cream so much. I've probably tried most of flavours. My favourites are London fog and salted caramel. I normally get one scoop but do get two scoops when I'm super hungry. 
29751 Went for brunch anf it was pretty dissapointing. The food took forever (even the coffee), and of all we triee, nothing was particularly good. 
29752 Love Love Love this place! I have had my fair share of airbrush tans, but they never quite turned out the right shade. The ladies at Hush Hush Tan are on point EVERY time! The color is flawless!!! No more ORANGE 
29753 Great atmosphere as always; the quality of the food has gone up exponentially since the change of ownership. The menu has changed only slightly and for the best. Great snacks. 
29754 Always look forward to getting my teeth cleaned, Jerri is a hoot!!!!!! the dental office is really starting to shape up. everyone is so pleasant to talk to. Dr. Daby you have something special going on at your practice! 
29755 9 tables in the entire restaurant at 4pm, and tbe hostess wants to take my name? I ask " excuse me? There is a wait?" They seat us 10 minutes later, with attitude. Just annoying... too many other places to go to justify... 
29756 All organic, delicious ingredients. Amazing service and really yummy food. Everything I've gotten has been amazing! Fabrizio is great and he always goes above and beyond. He knows our pallets and always recommends new dishes he knows we'll love 
29757 Ordered Paneer Chili, rice and onion parata. Very good food. Tasted fresh and the service was very good. 
29758 Usually takes a long time to wait for dinner, but it's worth it. Amazing chips and salsa, burritos, and original flavors (the al pastor is amazing!)They also have great drinks and nice service. I can't wait to go back 
29759 We have been waiting for this for so long...seems it took forever to open. Somehow the flow seemed rushed and the place does not feel that new. So overall not as great as other locations but it's still Blaze and 4 stars. 
29760 Worst pizza I've had in a long time! Pizza is bland and the chicken wings taste like they're boiled. There's much better places to order from In the Orlando area. Try anything else 
29761 The xiao long bao were good, one of the best I have eaten here. The noodles were only average. Would only recommend folks to come here for the dumplings. 
29762 I like this bar you can watch your favorite sport and enjoy a good beer, the servers are professional and very nice, also I like that nobody smoking inside or outside, so if you want to relax after long day ,I recommend this place! 
29763 Bacon, egg, and cheese croissant is delicious. I also come here often for the nitro brew on tap. Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. 
29764 Marlon Thomas was such a great waiter!!!! The level of service he provides was nice. We had a party of 10. The food was just ok. However, the drinks were nice!!! 
29765 Really, really, really oily. Complimentary bread was as hard as a rock. I would probably give Mandola's a 2.5 if possible. Gelato was yummy and the atmosphere was great. Loved the playground and kids sized tables, but that's about all I loved. Definitely room for improvement 
29766 Incredible breakfast! Had their migas taco and peace taco and they were outstanding. Flavorful and satisfying. Will be back next time I visit Austin. 
29767 We we're looking for a nice brunch in NE, saw Lucca was open, reviews were good. My wife had the pork hash and I the sausage ragu. The kitchen just nailed it! Terrific experience and awesome meals. 
29768 Great looking church. Nice and inviting front entrance with the water feature and benches. I hear the bells through out my day at home ending at 9:00pm. 
29769 Oh my! You're in for a treat!!! Hot FREE coffee while you wait for a table, excellent Bloody Marys, unbelievable pancakes, delicious Benedicts of all kinds. And the potatoes. Whoa! Great service, cool retro decor. Go here. 
29770 Nice outdoor atmosphere with kid play area. French dip was piping hot and flavorful. The live entertainment made for pleasant dining experience. 
29771 Sonya has been doing my hair for a few months now, and she does a great job!! The salon is always clean and everyone there is super friendly! Love it! 
29772 More upscale, but slower to get food. Make sure you have enough layover time. 
29773 We have not been to a dinner movie theatre since we got married 18 years ago. We didn't order dinner however I enjoyed some wings. The Austin locals know and understand how this place works and would certainly go back for an evening. Next time we will bring the kids. 
29774 Good food I ordered the Grouper Burger which was a large sandwich with not much broccoli and coleslaw but the sandwich will fill you up. For desert we had the red velvet ice cream sandwich really good. 
29775 I split the good wolf burrito with my sister. It was delicious and was enough for us both. And the bartender john was a delightful and informative conversationalist. Ask him about beer! 
29776 The original pork gyro is glorious. The Hungarian mushroom, and lentil soups are also very tasty. 
29777 Cheap glass without being a pain in the ass... Great service!!!! Hope I don't need another windshield any time soon- but if I did I would go right back to these guys! 
29778 Gentleman working the counter was extremely friendly and warm. I ordered the blackened tilapia tacos and was surprised with how much fish was in each taco. Also, the sauce that accompanied it was very tasty (almost like a sweet mayo wasabi sauce). 
29779 We came for our anniversary and our server and the hostess were so polite and really made our night! Food was beautifully plated and we had a wonderful experience. 
29780 If the line is long it's not worth the wait. But if you can get in within 15 minutes I would recommend it. They have a good variety of burgers and french fries are fresh. The milkshakes are amazing but to have the calories that match 
29781 Not Sanitary and has a poor ambiance. The nail technician dropped a tool on the ground, picked it up, and then proceeded to do my nails with the contaminated tool. The length and shape were average but nothing special. 
29782 We liked this place. The broth / soup is great, mixed with both chicken broth and pork bone broth. The pork belly is really tender and flavorful. I loved the hand-made noodle. 
29783 Ridiculously delicious Cuban sandwiches packed full of meat. Also, the whole fishes are scrumptious. Definitely a good choice if you're dining in Jamaica Plain! 
29784 I'm an "Oliver" girl married to a "Bronx Bomber" guy. A pricey slicey for sure, but worth it for a special treat. The key for me is the t-sauce, I love it acidy and with a good bite. Happy every time. 
29785 After several other doctors told us we didn't have much chance of conceiving naturally, Dr. Singh suggested some other approaches based on some recent research. We now have two children and we are very grateful to Dr. Singh. I would highly recommend Dr. Singh for any male infertility issues. 
29786 If I could give -5 I would customer service does not exist here they have a huge customer annoyance team Ready to piss you off 
29787 From check in to checking out, I had a great experiences. i saw Dr. Glenn Robinson, his PA and medical assistant. Very thorough, thoughtful and considerate of my concerns. I would recommend this place and Dr. Robinson and his team. 
29788 probably on my top 5 fave pizzas in vancouver. they lose stars for this time we ordered a large pizza, brought it home to see they filled half of it w old pizza slices they didn't sell at their by the slice window. that was lame. 
29789 Just average. I ordered for delivery. Odd style of gyros in pita wrap. More like a burrito. The hummus platter was ok. Very bland hummus. Not much garlic. 
29790 The interior at night is a bit dark, but the food is unusual and outstanding. This is not the normal Mexican fare, and each dish has its own unique seasoning and flavor. The service is good too. 
29791 I love their fresh juice! Especially, when feeling ill. The tonics will hit the spot and make one feel less down trodden. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. 
29792 Blah!!! Nothing exciting about it and it's hella expensive. The fried rice is by far the worse I've ever had. Find another Chinese food. option 
29793 Great place for happy hour! It's an Awesome place for some drinks and apps. I am obsessed with their steak salad. It is amazing! 
29794 Love this place, too bad it's so far west. Their wild salmon is hands down the best I've tasted. Their OMG roll is delicious but really rich, so share it with a friend. 
29795 Came here on a group date with a bunch of people I met off bumble! The mimosas were the perfect ratio and their cold brew coffee was delish! Can't wait to come back 
29796 Delicious Dan Dan and wonderfully spicy Mal Special pot. Kids fought over the chicken heart barbecue skewers. 
29797 Great coffee house/cafe in downtown Austin. Cool, hip, comfortable. I enjoyed a gluten free almond danish and a triple latte after my morning run. My stomach feels great and my taste buds are very happy. 
29798 Good techs, caring staff and an easy place to get your dental needs. 
29799 This is a great local place! The turkey burger is super flavorful and delish. My kids and husband love the burgers. Friendly service, food comes quickly and good selection of beer. Go and enjoy! 
29800 Our dinner was superb. The veal scollopini was the best I've ever had. We loved the atmosphere and the service. Look forward to returning. 
29801 Had a group party here, served complimentary appetizers, the food was excellent and the prices are even better! 
29802 I had a great experience with ADT serviceman Max today. He arrived during the time requested, was polite, and respected my property. Max completed the work and the system is working, he confirmed everything before leaving. Thanks MAX for being so easy to work with. 
29803 Their 10 course meal consists of odd small dishes which I felt were more to showcase the chef's ability to create them than to please customers. Worth half what they charge, or less. Good service. 
29804 Cheap mexican food. The food here isn't very good, as you can probably tell because this place is always empty. The waiter sat us at a smelly table, coupled with a smelly menu. Disgusting. Only thing going for this place is the cheap price. 
29805 Great place to watch the game! Several TVs so you won't miss a second of the game. Food is awesome! My husband had their hamburger and I had their quesadillas. Both were very yummy! Kids loved the pizza and queso! Staff is friendly and attentive! 
29806 Loved this place, the food and beer were great! Debra was awesome and walked us through the menu and what would go well together! Reasonably priced and all homemade, even the condiments! Thank for a nice afternoon. 
29807 I had a fairly good experience here. The staff was there for my every request. Im not really into Indian cuisine so I cant really judge the food but I ate everything on the plate..Nice atmosphere! 
29808 Really good thin-crust pizzas, either one of a busload of well-thought-out options, or make-your-own from the ingredients on the menu, which limits you to more or less classic Italian fare (no pineapple, if you were feeling a bit cheezy). A-OK food, a little noisy, but otherwise very cozy atmosphere. 
29809 A great restaurant and with a great atmosphere. Food was excellent. Clam Chowder was amazing 
29810 Had French Toast, eggs & bacon. Good food & bacon hit the spot. My uncle and buddies also come here. And...coffee is good. 
29811 This place has the best Menudo my mom and I have ever had! The flavor and quality was top notch and we really liked it. To bad they are not open for dinner. 
29812 Place is filthy. I stopped in the other day to pick up a sandwich. I was so grossed out by the amount of trash on the floor behind the counter. People handle food with bare hands and handle money. I will never go back there. Gross. 
29813 Great food and super friendly staff. What a difference to go to a restaurant where it is not about the bells and whistles, but the food. Sure to become a regular. 
29814 Went here for a snack and my boyfriend and I tried the Kofta Saj, which is a ground beef, lettuce and tomato wrap with tatziki sauce. So good! Highly recommend. Service was great as well. 
29815 They did nice work on a plumbing problem that we were having. My husband does his best to fix what he can but this problem was bigger than he could manage. So, we called Joe. He was efficient, good value for the money, friendly, and professional. 
29816 I ordered the crab rangoons and honey chicken, the food was ok. I've had better Chinese food in a malls food court before, but on the positive side the prices were low. I wouldn't recommend this place due to better choices in this food court. 
29817 Amazing food. A must go to stop for these out of towners. Delicious food. Great service. Ask for tots to play Tic Tac Tot with your kid. ;) 
29818 Brittany was the bartender and she was speedy! Very nice! I had a el Diablo sandwich and it was amazing! I'm defiantly coming back :) 
29819 We waited an hour an a half for the delivery. Call 3 times. Nobody seems to care. We end up canceling the order. The pizza never showed up, even when they said they were at the hotel already 
29820 $4.50 for a bagel with cream cheese? I work at Quincy Market and tell everyone to avoid this tourist trap. 
29821 Cool venue, located in downtown area next to Centenial Park. Perfect for theater or a concert. Next to the sky wheel. 
29822 Great seafood though the seating was not the most comfortable and the wine list was bare bones. And there are no reservations. There is a 20% automatic tip that can be waived; i was happy to pay it. 
29823 Fun place for drinks in Austin! Chill vibe, very different from 6th street. Creative and unique bars. Lots of craft drinks and live music 
29824 Love this place, the tacos are always on point. Plus with how busy they are, they always manage to Fer your food out quickly. The salsas are nice also. The staff is very friendly and laid back, great joint to go to if you want some good tacos. 
29825 Loved it, one of the few places in Boulder where they got all the things I ordered right (and I don't have complicated orders), the food was great, and also unique in Boulder, it wasn't overpriced. Definitely will be going back. 
29826 I love this place! So warm & friendly. Love the staff. Ask for Grace the owner & the hookahs are great. Supporting my business neighbors. 
29827 James Beardsley already has 50+ reviews and five stars, so there's not much more for me to add. He was prompt, friendly, gave good advice and presented a reasonable bill. Can't ask for much more than that! 
29828 We went there for dinner. Food took very long and waitress was a bit impolite. The service is slow! The couscous and tagine were a bit different from other good Moroccan restaurants. I love Moroccan food but I will never go back to this place. 
29829 On a Friday afternoon around 2pm, had to wait approximately 15 minutes for a table. This cafe is busy from opening to closing, but it is worth the hype. Medina is the cutest, most hipster Cafe located in a great part of Vancouver. Great atmosphere along with light, fresh food. 
29830 Good spot to do some beer tasting. The only issue I encounter here is that, due to popularity, they run out of some beers on tap. Price of having great beer I guess :) 
29831 I have tried both the beef tacos and shredded chicken tacos in the crispy shell and both were excellent. The cilantro lime rice and Latin potatoes were also good. The staff was friendly and the food was prepared quickly. 
29832 Cool building exterior and interior, but average fast food quality menu. Tried this today and the best summation is "Chick-Fil-A" for east side Austin hipsters. Small, rather sad grilled chicken sandwich, uninspired French fries, for premium price. Seemed promising, just didn't deliver for me. 
29833 Beautiful outside of building ... where my friend goes to college. I dropped her off the other day and was highly impressed. Easy to find location and central. Close to Clarksville 
29834 The music was ok and had it not been breezy the cigars and cigarettes would have been off putting but the service was awesome (5 star) and the food was so flavorful and delicious that I would certainly come back again and again. 
29835 One of the few sports bars in the area. Tony Cs down the street has a better set up. 
29836 I am so impressed with this new boutique hotel downtown Portland! I love the style, design, huge rooms, and impeccablly stellar service from all the staff. I'll definitely be staying here during my next trip! 
29837 The GOOD! 1. Amazing Gelato and flavors! Really really good. 2. The price was great! I got 1 way too much and 2 not so much and a doughnut. A little over $10. 3. The atmosphere was very comfortable. We stayed for about an hour. The BAD! None. 
29838 They are the best. Always fresh always tasty. After trying all the sushi restaurants in Boston, I only eat sushi at this place. And I'm so lucky to live the next street to this amazing restaurant. 
29839 Great class! Visiting from Cali! Steven was young, fun and a great instructor. Great voice- should use it professionally! Will be back here! Clean and wonderful studio. 
29840 Delicious. The lasagna was flavorful and rich, the fettuccine had a lovely bite. Light meatballs....and all delivery. 
29841 Best pizza in the city = Agamemnon with bacon. NOM NOM NOM! 
29842 SLOWEST Starbucks EVER! Expect at least a 20-25 min wait time in the mornings. Management needs to hire more ppl, this is ridiculous and people need to get to work instead of wait so long for coffee. 
29843 Great food, good music nice atmosphere. Not a fancy place. Clam chowder was great and so was the naked lobster roll. 
29844 Kick Ass Happy Hour specials at the Bar, 7 Days A Week - Half Price Apps and great Beer and Drink Specials. Adrian is a really good and nice bartender also !!! 
29845 Our building is very poorly maintained. Anything that requires any sort of regular maintenance is usually a problem. Doors are always broken, keypad rarely works, both of our elevators are currently broken. Staff is friendly but usually not very truthful. 
29846 Best Bloody Mary ever, bison burger never disappoints and atmosphere is like your neighborhood Cheers. Doesn't get much better 
29847 C'mon this place is weak. If you are looking for a place to drink in Lex, it's ok but the food is just " bar food " quality. 
29848 We visited this place for lunch and absolutely loved it. Everything ordered was very tasty but the soup dumpling was the best I have had. Will definately visit again. 
29849 It's not the same anymore. Service and food no longer up to par. It's now an overpriced franchise. Go to fogo de Chao. 
29850 My favorite Austin BBQ, so far. Beef ribs are phenomenal! 
29851 If you're a genuine donut lover/connoisseur, you will fully appreciate everything this place has to offer. Over a dozen of their best sellers are available everyday, with extra flavors featured daily. If none of the available options suit your taste, YOU CAN CRAFT YOUR OWN DONUT! 
29852 Awesome menu. Best cup of coffee I have had in a while. The paella breakfast skillet was great! 
29853 The pho broth had a thick layer of oil on top and the serving size of a large was more like a small. Service was mediocre and food lacked flavouring. 
29854 I've never had such strong, natural looking shellac. It's usually a "you get one or the other" kinda thing. This spa is so nice inside and outside. The staff were all wonderful and efficient. I am willing to drive an hour to get shellac here- it's worth it no doubt 
29855 Excellent Pad Thai and Curries. The staff is knowledgeable, but you might have to flag someone down to get seated-- don't stand by the door waiting! Atmosphere is a plus. 
29856 It is very close to PSU. They have best coffee around that area. They also have some pastries like danish, muffims and scones. 
29857 Excellent food, great atmosphere, extremely friendly service. Very fun night out. I'll put it this way, my dining experience was so good, it was enough to motivate my lazy self into creating a yelp account just to review them. 
29858 Great place and location, good drinks and a great bar to hit Thursday and Friday nights! Will deff go back. 
29859 Anyone know why Emerald's is gutted as of today??????? 
29860 Really like the atmosphere here. All staff are friendly and attentive. Their lobster guacamole is to live for. So so soooooo soooo good!!! Pricy but worth it!! 
29861 Heyooo hipster peoples. Stiff drinks, okay prices. Outdoor seating, YES! Good location for crawling to a couple bars throughout the evening. Not my favorite place in Portland, but I don't see why I wouldn't hang there from time-to-time. 
29862 Fantastic breakfast and atmosphere. The service was phenomenal! Catherine was great! 
29863 Love it here! The people are always so nice and always willing to help in any way possible.They are always serving you with a smile and make it a point to learn your name. The show genuine appreciation for all guests!!! 
29864 Definitely, the best north indian cuisine in Austin. Their weekend lunch buffet is a treat - lots of indian delicacies. I usually visit during weekdays - and order off the menu. This place is ridonculous busy on weekends...get there early if you do decide to go on a weekend. 
29865 The food is tasty and the environment is awesome- the perfect combination! The owner was very helpful and friendly, this is overall a great place to stop by and eat in Orlando. 
29866 Can't go wrong with Jamba! Great for breakfast on the go or refreshing pick me up any time of the day. Say Ahola Pineapple or hello to the ColdBuster. Only complaint is I wish they had a DRIVE THRU! 
29867 Great location and beautiful hotel. Check in was a breeze and everyone was super nice. My room was beautiful and it overlooked the Boston Common. It was very serene. Thank you! 
29868 Wahoo's is one of my favorite lunch spots in Boulder. Inexpensive, tasty, punch cards. All the ingredients. I typically eat the banzai bowl with blackened chicken or the banzai burrito smothered with red sauce. 
29869 Food is good, but service is really bad! Or should I say no service at all. Waitress are constantly ignore you, pretend didn't see you. And when you ask they seem annoying. I won't coming here again! 
29870 One of the best Old Fashioned Buttermilk doughnuts in the game. Get it. Blueberry is good too, but don't skip out on the Old Fashioned Buttermilk. Don't you dare. 
29871 New favorite pizza place!! A friend recommended it and it did not disappoint. The pizza was delicious, service was wonderful and they were easily accommodating about hanging a topping. The owner is incredibly friendly and I'd recommend this place to everyone!! I love discovering authentic hole-in-the locations in Columbus! 
29872 best biscotti you will ever find good pizza during lunch break 
29873 Excellent mothers day brunch. Staff went above and beyond. Food was excellent, prime rib, pasta bar, omelet bar and a wonderful selection of desserts. We'll do this one again. 
29874 This is by far the worst hibachi I've ever been to. They completely doused all the food in this heavy garlic sauce. It literally made me sick to my stomach. Save your money and go to Kobe. Definitely won't be back 
29875 A very well done theme park restaurant, like always the price is high but atleast the meal is filling an tastes good, although the menu is limited but their good at what they do. Also the decoration feels authentic, until you look out the window or upfront to the lines. 
29876 Who doesn't love Wendy's! This one however is in a prime location which means parking sucks! I would hate to come during the lunch rush. Still, the staff is nice and they have never gotten my order wrong. 
29877 Wonderful relaxing serene. Sherry is amazing and professional, a super cool caring person. Enjoyed my visit here so much. I felt very relaxed and happy afterwards, and I know the salt spa treatment contributed to this 
29878 Fast service, but overall sloppy job... They're very nice and the location is convenient for my school- did the trick for now as I needed my nails done for tonight, but otherwise would not come back. 
29879 Cool hole in the wall joint. Really good, spicy! Lots of different tacos and burritos, not exactly Mexican. 
29880 Best service everrrrr!! Fast! Excellent service! Quick, easy, online service , the pizza is always fresh, delicious, and out of this world ! Delivery is excellent , fast and accurate , i recommend it! Great job!! First time on Line ordering and I'm satisfied with the results!! 
29881 Stopped in for a quick bite. Had a slice of vegetale (red). Wow! Perfection! Tasty toppings on a wonderful thick crust. 
29882 Yes, it is pretty good sandwich shop. Not amazing but it is delicious enough for me to go back for lunch. Their meats are juicy and tasty and bread is good. I would definitely go back for another lunch. 
29883 Wow its such fast service that was AWESOME and my burger is cooked wellldone too! I tried the Our Burger-no onions delicious! I think I could've ate two! Might try the BBQ Bacon Burger next cuz of the avocado. The lemonade isnt that great tho. 
29884 I like this Starbucks location. I genuinely really do. Not only is it across the street from work, but they are super friendly here. Friends of mine have said that this location is a little slow, but I don't mind it as much. Keep it up!! :) 
29885 They did my oil change, tried to charge me for a synthetic when I didn't ask for it, which was double the price of a regular oil change. I hate it when car places do stuff like this. 
29886 Visited again with my boyfriend since he has never tried it. He really like how unique everything was. It was a little pricey but we would be back if we wanted to treat ourselves. Parking was free Saturday morning before a certain time we got lucky. 
29887 Great price excellent service Had custom ring made. Was very pleased with the end result 
29888 Ugh...terribly understaffed, way short on customer service, and an example of why bowling alleys and the like are fading from America and becoming a metaphor for sad sad place. Run down, crap. 
29889 You should know exactly what you are going to get from this place. Fast, hot, typical American Chinese food. It is what it is people. 
29890 I've never had an issue with them. They messed my prescription up once and They immediately fixed it. Every time I have called with a question or concern they get right back. Chris is the best! 
29891 All I have to say is,"hell yes." Basic hole in the wall kinda location, cash only...no frills. And the food is stellar and cheap. Highly recommended for good cheap flavorful food. 
29892 Very solid Mexican food Good pork enchiladas, great quesadillas. The chicken taquitos were OK. Beautiful decor! Great views of the ocean. A bit on the plain side. 
29893 This salon is clean, relaxing and very inviting. The women that work here are professional and very sweet! They have transformed my nails and hands from cracking and peeling to the healthiest they have been! I recommend this salon to anyone looking for a relaxed, laid back experience! 
29894 I'm so sad that Arepa Mia moved to Avondale Estates! They're sandwiches are absolutely delicious and provide wonderful gluten free fare that still tasted indulgent and rich. 
29895 Great food - with healthy choices for adults & kids - and at decent resort prices. Only a short walk to the Magic Kingdom, and an option if you don't mind leaving the park instead of eating the fast food available there. 
29896 Save your hard earned money and keep Yelping for the NEXT Mexican food restaurant! Bland, overpriced with clean bathrooms. There isn't any Spanish music either. We were sorely disappointed and won't be back! 
29897 Comfortable and spacious setting, reasonable distance with other tables. The service from beginning to end was attentive. Clean and cozy. Szechuan food is always my favorite, stinky tofu, pork belly with garlic, spicy cold noodle, taste so good there. Definately going back! 
29898 We are from Texas so we are Mexican food experts. We ordered beef and chicken fajitas and I was very impressed. Large portion lots of grilled onions and green peppers. Good quality meat. Overall I am impressed for a Mexican restaurant in Florida. 
29899 Is a good ambiance and nice restaurant. The good is ok nothing amazing. It has the potential to be a great date place but food lacks taste. The service was good and the wine was great. 
29900 Haha, I got my wisdom teeth removed at this office about 5 years ago. They're so good that I didn't even know the procedure was finished when they wheeled me out. I was drugged out of consciousness pretty damned well. 
29901 These cakes are so darn good! I can't really say enough good about them. They are so good that we have to visit only on special occasions because our whole family would be 300lbs if we didn't. 
29902 Best Pho spot in Brighton! Great customer service and everything comes out fast. 
29903 Beautiful new location with still the same outstanding service. The owners are friendly and accommodating. My hairdresser Patricia is the best. Been coming here for several years now and I absolutely love it. 
29904 Great spinach salad, and perfect location. Plus the servers were attentive, and the atmosphere is very nice. 
29905 Our family has used this florist several times. Every time we had beautiful arrangements. On this very special day, the flowers were not to our satisfaction. They were not the flowers we expected to receive. Very disappointed. 
29906 The people were super nice, but they sold me a nasty old bagel. I try to avoid Starbucks, but it was the only coffee available in the hotel. 
29907 Eggs were good enough, but potatoes had an artificial flavour. Sub them with something else. 
29908 Super bomb customer service and a vegetarian burrito bowl that warms my beany heart! Finally, I can get yummy taco options alongside my brisket-loving partner. Thanks, #ArtofTacos 
29909 Their pizza is different from other pizza places around. Cheesy, generous amount of sauce and the dough is delicious. The sauce is a bit sweeter than your average pizza place. I love it. My boss always orders us pizza from petrones while at work and we all love it!!! 
29910 Overall, a really nice lunch. I was there on a Saturday, and the only one in the place! I had the chicken/avacado panini. Really good chicken and tomato sauce. 
29911 A great gym with all your needs. Could be bigger, but that' s a personal preference. 
29912 DONT GET THE FLATBREAD SANDWICH HERE The pork flatbread was dry and flavorless HOWEVER, the hand rolled noodles were spicy and delicious and the lamb skewer was amazing. Definitely going to visit again 
29913 This place has a resonable selection (no offal or interesting bits) and the meat is normally pretty hgih quality. There can be quit a bit of a wait if you hit the store at the wrong time of day. Overall a decent place to hit. 
29914 Vintage has a warmth to it even on the dampest days. Interesting cocktails, but what's really great about it is the level of skill and knowledge of the bartenders. It's a pleasure watching them work. 
29915 I really like this place. Great staff, good food, and overhearing to Adam Reposa talk about stupid bloody mary bars behind me was the funniest thing I've heard in a long time. The to go food is really phenomenal as well. 
29916 I'm in ATL every 1-2 weeks so I've eaten a lot of places. My wife and I ate here passing through and it's probably the best restaurant in the airport if you're looking for taste. Will Definitely be back when I have a longer layover. 
29917 Chicken wings had so much amazing flavor it almost destroyed my vegetarian aspirations. Motown music playlist and rooftop breeze compliment the delicious food. Can't wait to come back and try more food! Astro turf is perfect for kids and doggies. 
29918 Nice quiet place. Even has a tiny over priced grocery room if you don't wannaorder out or go out to eat. Nice rooms, spacey. Only complain is our room had ants. Got into our bags and even after room service cleaned came right back by the time we returned. 
29919 SPICY DEEP FRIED CHICKEN WINGS! They are the reason for the season. All dishes are easily made MSG free upon request. They don't open until 5pm on Saturdays, which can be a bummer. This place is a hidden gem, definitely give it a try. *cough* SPICY DEEP FRIED CHICKEN WINGS!! 
29920 They have the best mac and cheese and great service! It wouldn't be my first choice of restaurants but given the chance I would go back! 
29921 I have been going here for some time now since I have moved to Austin. They never fail in delivering a quality meal with some really awesome service. So I just keep going back. I absolutely love their iron skillet catfish with cornbread and black eye peas. 
29922 This is the best wine store in my area. Their range of wines and prices is unmatched. Whenever I'm not sure about what wines I need for a meal the staff are always ready to offer reliable advice without pushing the more expensive wines (of which they have many) 
29923 Carlton is amazing. Working out with him the time flies and I have fun. He puts workouts together that engage my whole body and he's always there to inspire and make sure my form is correct. I'm already stronger and feeling better after two months. Strongly recommend! 
29924 Wonderful experience. 1st off service was top notch. Friendly, personable, knowledgeable and had great understanding of the menu. Apps and salads were delish. Meals were spot on. Tastie, filling, original and as described. Full bar, simple wine list, greast deserts. I would highly recommend. Date nite w/friends. 
29925 One of my FAVS! Both women I have met are helpful and encouraging. The patterns and fabric are cute and modern, and the location is great! Plus I have found great deals on the sale rack!! 
29926 It is really good. After a long tripÔºåWe found this fabulous restaurant. The shrimp is good and fresh. and they all tasted good. ÂõΩ‰∫∫ÈÉΩÊù•ËØïËØï.ÁúüÁöÑÂæàÂ•ΩÂêÉ 
29927 I love origins! Lots of delicious smelling scrubs, soaps, lotions, and general personal care products. I am a stickler for non-synthetic non-artificial scents. Everything here smells natural and delicious. The gum? The best I've ever had. Get one of those big ass gum balls from the machine, and LOVE IT. 
29928 Coffee here was just ok. Took about 15 minutes to cool down. Almost served boiling. The turkey sandwich was so so. I would not go back here. 
29929 Overall good sushi but somewhat overpriced. I would go back but will search out alternatives before doing so. Toro was so so (kinda resembled raw hamburger meat and tasted mildly better) Salmon was fresh and rolls were yummy. 
29930 This place is amazing 
29931 I had the fish and vegetables with garlic sauce with white rice. BEST white rice I've ever had 
29932 I'd recommend this place to everyone I know! 
29933 The best I've been eating here for years. Peter is nice guy unlike other Chinese food restaurants when you call and order there rude. the foods always A1. 
29934 Very good! Food was good, drinks were good, and service was good. They don't have he traditional Yum Yum sauce that I've had at other Hibachis in the past but their house sauce is fantastic. We'll be going back again! 
29935 Grotto's strengths are a creative menu and very tasty food. Their drawbacks were slightly awkward seating, and *wow* salty food. The onion soup was almost off the scale salty. Nevertheless, the food overall was very good, and with some more careful choices easily could be 4*. 
29936 Loved it! had the Dewey and was so delicious. Next time will try the Ricky. Also staff was super friendly. 
29937 Just got an egg biscuit. I was so pleased!! It was hot fresh plenty of egg. Perfect on this rainy day. 
29938 Not the most useful mall for everyday shopping. If you want normal everyday clothes like Gap, Abercrombie, Banana, etc. you should check out the Cambridgeside Galleria. This place is super convenient to get to though. The T stop is right in the basement of the mall. 
29939 I was unsure of this place at first, but I am starting to like it more than Blaze. It uses fresh ingredients and has a pretty large selection of tap beers that seem to change every so often. I like to stop and grab a pizza before driving home. 
29940 Good stuff, have had better at cheaper places but not too bad 
29941 This jewelry store reminds me of Martha's Vineyard. All the jewelry exhibits real craftsy quality and very organic shapes. My mom alwyas shops here. GOOD FOR: Earrings- delicate dangly ones and beautiful black pearl studs. yum. 
29942 Great lunch in setting for any adult occasion. Sandwiches, salads and service are top notch. Feel like walking into a friendly part of Europe or NYC when you dine here. Would like to come back in the evening for drinks and music as am told the scene is quite nice. 
29943 Delish!!! everything was very good except the duck crab gumbo. the latte was very good and the drinks. 
29944 This was my first experience with Ethiopian cuisine. I must say I loved it and definitely will be back! The veggie plate was amazing. I can't wait to try more of their vegan options. 
29945 Don't let the strip mall location fool you -- this place is quality goods. Great food, good service, well-priced. We will return. 
29946 We ordered food togo. Fried rice is not good at all, there is no flavor in it and Orange Chicken came with thick sauce, very yellow colour and very strong orange flavour. Disappointed. Soup was OK though. 
29947 We stopped by here after seeing it on diners, drive-ins and dives. Parking kinda sucks but we luckily got right across the street! :) service was fast and friendly and the cubano was soooooo delicious! One of the best sandwiches ever! 
29948 Ordered a turkey rueben and a frozen hot choc.. Both very tasty! Friendly and prompt service. Well worth a visit! 
29949 Service here only seems to get worse.. there wasn't a bartender in sight for the first 6 minutes I sat down,... And even then she was more concerned with flirting with the FedEx employees... More customer service and training is needed for that one. 
29950 Fun find while visiting in Metrotown 
29951 Walking distance from the hotel we were staying at. Movie theater was nice , comfortable seats and nice big screens with clear surround sound. The only downside is that the concession is pretty pricy 
29952 Decided on this.place randomly. It was a great decision! We were there.for.lunch and ordered their cuban sandwich. Although not an authentic cuban I enjoyed their spin on it. It was fresh and tasty. I ordered it with chips.and it came with Mexican chicharrones. Good overall! 
29953 Great wine, salads, pizza, service and ambiance. One of my favorite local bars. They have an excellent wine list and the staff is very attentive. Great location in downtown Lynn... 
29954 Nice atmosphere, good food and reasonably priced. They have nice Bento meals too. 
29955 Best food ever just remember if you are a vegetarian like me this may not be the best place to go. I had the.vegetarian quesadilla that's all the vegetarian they had 
29956 Great selection! Expertly curated. Some beer snob elitist snark...but nothing that shouldn't be expected from an establishment of this type. The crew has a knowledge base commensurate with PAC NW beer standards. Great vibe, and a nice sandwich cart out back. 
29957 I love this theater. Great plush seats, waiters at your service to take orders for drinks and food and the lobby is great, pool tables full bar gray lounging area. Definitely recommend this place 
29958 The Brewers Benedict was amazing. Great atmosphere and phenomenal service. Our bartender, Robin, was great. Very friendly and accommodating. I dumped way too much hot sauce on my potatoes and she had the kitchen make more. If I'm ever in Columbus again CBC will definitely be one of my stops. 
29959 Good weekday lunch option. The food quantity was not bad. They do lack consistency though 
29960 We love this place! We go almost every time we're in mount Dora. The wait staff is excellent and the good, atmosphere and (sometimes) live music make for a great, AND quaint mount Dora experience! 
29961 I'm on the fence about this one. On one hand the crowd is good most of the time and the prices are fair. On the other hand sometimes its too crowded or you just end up with a bad crowd. I like it though. 
29962 Excellent food and stylish place. We tried Hunan kung pao, Tuna Poke, and mocktails. All were excellent. Definitely coming back here 
29963 Excellent pao de queijo and assorted breads. Try the one in Union Square Somerville on Bow St too- its great. They have great juices, appetizers, and all the baked goods are delicious. 
29964 Salem Saves Animals supports this animal shelter that has helped so many animals .I adopted my little Dolly and my dear friend Carol brings a huge amount of cats to them 
29965 If I ever open a shelter I would ask for there advise and be as kind as them. 
29966 Best burger in Austin! I get the the Continental Club EVERY time and it's so great! Their Parmesan truffle fries are the BOMB! 
29967 I used this company in Sept 2016 and again in January 2017. Both moves were extremely smooth, nice, friendly crew, showed up on time, worked hard and did a great job. I would highly recommend them. 
29968 Best gluten free pizza I've ever had. For the food allergy prone like myself, the vegan cheese pairs really well with their sauce and gf crust. Throw some peperoni on top for those that are gf/dairy free but still enjoy the meats and you'll fall in love. 
29969 It's my favorite! My coworker and I go there for lunch at least once a week, if not more! We split the tri tip platter. Soooo much food! The potatoes, carrots, and garlic bread are a great addition to the meat! Do yourself a favor and go right now! 
29970 I ordered peanut butter chip and peanut butter cookies and didn't like either. All I tasted was butter and the bottom of the cookies were over cooked. I will never order from them again, will stick to Insomnia Cookies. 
29971 Excellent pasta. The pizza looked really delicious as well. Tasty appetizers and some of the best service I've ever received in my life. They were able to make my requested modifications to the dish I wanted. It was great. 
29972 I cannot speak highly enough about the service, quality and freshness of food, value and atmosphere! One of my all time favorite places to dine and the best Bento boxes in Boston! 
29973 I love dining here. The food is to die for! We usually end up here when we visit winter park, I know there's so many other restaurants to check out but this place is too good to pass. Service is great 
29974 The Black Bear Diner is like Denny's but with character and great food. The menu is big, the portions are bigger, they serve breakfast all day and everyone in my family of 4 were happy with their meals. 
29975 Don't overlook this gem! Great staff, food, rooms, and safety. The motorcycle convention was going on so that was a lot of fun looking at all the bikes. The beds and pillows put us in dreamland! Shout out to manager Lexi for taking such great care of us. 
29976 Nice seats... Same like I have at HOME! Don't waste the time or the money anymore Gold Class was ten times better service and drinks. 
29977 Good deal on a massage. You usually get a different student each time unless you request a particular one. I have always been happy with the massages I received here. They also have monthly specials. 
29978 it will do. Rooms are clean and comfortable. out of the way for downtown. The kicker, I was sitting by the pool enjoying a cigar and ask to stop smoking. Even though I was outside and no no smoking posted? First time this has ever happend anywhere. 
29979 Oh, this place is so good. I am addicted to their homemade corn tortillas, the bistek, and barbacoa. Seriously the best you will find on the north side. Try them! You're welcome. 
29980 Great service , my car never been this clean before , they also removed some scratches from the paint 
29981 would definitely recommend this place to friends. 
29982 Shelly made my home buying process so easy. Communication was great. She kept me in the loop anytime she spoke to my builder and received an update. I would highly recommend her to anyone in need of a Lender. 
29983 I could go on and on about this place but aint nobody got time for that. The sushi is awesome, the drinks are awesome and the service is exceptional. Best happy hour in Vancouver. 
29984 Pretty good Chinese. Though I'd probably go for Great Chow in Quincy over this if possible. Really good lunch deals for really cheap. 
29985 This place was amazing! The Fried Green Tomatoes & French Quarter Salmon were delicious and their bread pudding is fantastic! We will definitely be back. 
29986 food is ok. this place always seems to facilitate great conversation. good option for happy hour and has cheap beer options. good music 
29987 We are always seated quickly, the staff is friendly and attentive without being obnoxious. The food is great. Great breakfast/brunch options. 
29988 I ordered the rich miso ramen and it was delicious! The broth was flavorful and the noodles were the perfect texture. Our server was Luong and he was the best! Very polite and attentive. I would definitely recommend. 
29989 Well they wrote back to me here on the Yelp page, but when I reached out to them twice as they requested I do I received zero response yet again. Clearly they are more interested in presenting the appearance of decent customer service than actually following through. 
29990 Great burgers and vibes. The staff is always friendly and ready to assist however they can. The food is the real star of this place. I've thoroughly enjoyed the Lamb burger and the ribs so if you'd like some great flavor start there. 
29991 I love to go to Curras with people that have never been before. The avocado margarita is a must for out of towners. I love the ceviche. The service is hit or miss. The vegetarian enchiladas are good. 
29992 Really long wait, but we spent time checking out stores and hanging out so its was ok. Waited 1.5 hours so keep that in mind. Wife had a customized omelette that was amazing. Venison sausage made it. I had migas which was ok, not amazing hence 4 stars. 
29993 I try to rate the food and ambience not by location so here is my take. I live only a few blocks away and was a fan of this place before the neighborhood blew up and started to attract the hipster dipshits. Try the mushroom ravioli. 
29994 We used them on our way to and from the airport and it was so easy. There was 6 of us and lots of luggage. Texted him our details he promptly confirmed and was there each time ahead of schedule. Will definitely use them again. Highly recommend. 
29995 It's so great to have a place like this in Lake Oswego! They had an awesome selection of taps and bottles. Great service and atmosphere!! 
29996 Was looking a place to grab a quick bite and expected an ordinary Burger joint. I was pleasantly surprised with Grub Burger Bar. Food was great and the service was very friendly. Would definitely recommend trying this place. 
29997 I spent a week at this hotel for work. My experience was very good. Very clean room and common areas. Friendly staff, specially Mafet at the front desk! She was very nice and helpful! I will definitely stay here again! 
29998 Pretty good latte. We tried the Summermoon latte, and the Chai Soy Latte. Both were good, but a bit too sweet. Their parking situation is bananas. Not many spots and a mountain to climb when you exit. 
29999 Fresh, delicious food prepared at the time of your order. My salmon kabobs and vegetables arrived at my table hot, well-cooked and deliciously seasoned. Upbeat decor, pleasant, helpful staff. I'll be back. 
30000 Burgers are pretty tasty. fairly expensive, but you can get just the burger and skip the usual fries which is kind of a bonus. The vibe is the red and black, cactus club decor. Good spot for a casual burger. 
30001 Me & my boyfriend treated our Korean friend here for his farewell dinner. It definitely was an awesome place to eat & unwind. The food was absolutely flavorful & cooked to perfection!! The place is clean & modernly sleek. I will be definitely be coming back! 
30002 We have given this place more than several opportunities but it's the same story each time. Dinner time people! Why is there always a 10 to 12 minute wait for chicken every time (5 times straight).??? Never again. Close this location or change to KFC. 
30003 Do not waste your money. It is a totally inconsistent service. I've had several no shows and been charged for services I never received. The cleaners that have come have been pretty terrible. 
30004 Very good German restaurant and wonderful Buffett! Deserts galore. Would recommend if in the area. 
30005 yes, believe it or not but hey, it is new, bright and compact, compared to Marpole. now they have the Christmas section on the right side corner. just bought cheap greeting cards, why not, gets recycled anyways lol. lots street parking. credit cards OK. stock trading $68, bonus star lol 
30006 Best breakfast tacos I've ever had! Fresh-tasting, well-seasoned fillings; even the little sauces that were included were so flavorful. Great value, and I'll definitely be back regularly. 
30007 The best thing about this place is the free tour! Come early on a Saturday so that you avoid the crowd. You get a bunch of free samples of different beers to try, and the portions are very generous! 
30008 Good portion sizes and slightly cheaper than other pho restaurants around the area. I had the pho, which was excellent. Would definitely go again 
30009 I love this place, they have their selection of soups for the day and so far I've tried the Boston clam chowder and the seafood chowder both amazing. They have fair prices for the size they offer 
30010 Great breakfast. Oatmeal with brown sugar was not too sweet and just enough crunch. Lemon blueberry scone moist and not too sweet. Fun location in an old bank branch vault seating available. Serving up friendly service. 
30011 Friendly service. Very fast. Nice food choices. We had soup and salad. No meat. The salads were good and plentiful, but very salty. The tomato soup was fantastic. From this first experience, this place has potential to make me a fan, but not yet. 
30012 Really nice patio n bar! Great place to grab a quick drink n snack. Don't think you're coming here for dinner though, you will need to eat before or after lol Overall, for what it is, it's awesome! 
30013 Larry is AMAZING. So friendly, so full of advise and so great with my hair. He told me what to change as I'm trying to thicken and grow out my hair and didn't pressure me with any products. My hair felt silky leaving the salon and already feels healthier. 
30014 Had a wonderful dinner there today. I enjoyed the Jala Burger and my wife the popcorn chicken salad. There was a total of seven people in our party and not one of them was disappointed. Service was both good and friendly. Look forward to an opportunity to return. 
30015 Amazing atmosphere and customer service. The food was the icing on the cake. Best Turkish food I've had!!! Loved everything! 
30016 Pizza was very good, and came out in a reasonable time for how many were ordered. The staff was accommodating for our large group of 11 people. Would dine at again. 
30017 Awesome Benedict, great cocktails, friendly service and lovely music. Sunday Jazz brunch = 10 out of 10. 
30018 Look out, dennys, waffle house, and etc. this local favorite has all you can eat for meat lovers for lunch and dinner, as well as Breakfast. The smart owner is kin on maximizing the operational profits. 
30019 Everything was super original and delicious, especially that kale dish. Extra points for not rushing us out of there. Good laid back service. The cocktails were simple yet interesting, especially the rum cocktail with tamarind. 
30020 I could easily recommend the Jinya #3. The Brussels sprouts were outstanding. We ordered two $1 sides of them. The (free) side of hand-pressed garlic was also a novel feature. We'll definitely be back. In fact, this place could easily become our new go-to place for Ramen! 
30021 We had the Texas Fajitas 
30022 There was enough food for at least three people maybe even four. The taste of the food was excellent and the temperature was piping HOT. Our waiter was Erick and he was very attentive!! This restaurant is one of the best!! 
30023 Oh dear. I could cry a small tear at how good the sashimi was here. sniff sniff. Awesome staff and in a great, diverse part of town. Highly recommend! 
30024 This has been my personal and business branch for over 5 years. They have excellent customer service and virtually no lines. 
30025 they stopped serving milkshakes so they really offer nothing more than mediocre burgers and teryaki. I spent less than i would spend at burgerville but no milkshakes anymore. 
30026 Very friendly staff, great location, nicely decorated and kelly (hairdresser) is awesome. Upstairs is the spa with a relaxing mani/pedi room and jessica (esthetician) is very knowledgeable. 
30027 Love coming here and do so at least twice a week. The wait can be long but it's worth it. The staff is friendly and the dog porch is great. Don't hesitate to try this joint...My favorite breakfast place in town! 
30028 Beyond solid. Sometimes perfect even. Doesn't have Sizzle Pie's super cool bells and whistles, vegan options and fine tuned branding, but just might one up them on the product itself. 
30029 We love this store. Everyone is friendly and easy to talk to. They make everyone feel welcome. They also have excellent assortment in several categories. The extra % discounts are also a major plus. 
30030 Have never sold property with them, but we used Jim McGue as our buyer's agent and he was everything you could possibly ask for: honest, friendly, knowledgeable... and he drove a tough bargain on our behalf to boot! 
30031 So after some staff miscommunication and leaving frustrated, it was great to hear back from their office manager to try to remedy that situation. I've had great experiences in the past so I'm looking forward to another! 
30032 It's divey goodtimes. Go for the karaoke, stay for the yah-d00ds. 
30033 Great food and a good neighborhood feel. Brunch on Sunday's is always a hit. Best bloody in Atlanta. Big fan of sausage and eggs and the burger. 
30034 So awesome. Want to see a budget movie and sit on a comfy couch and then drink some well priced beers and good food?! How about soaking in a hot tub after for only a few bucks more? I love this place. 
30035 Cool atmosphere. Great waitress. Did not like the clam chowder at all. Was expecting way better taste and texture for a Barbara Lynch seafood restaurant. Liked the tartare and oysters. 
30036 Amazing. One of the best meals I have had in Portland. Top notch service, experience and the food was a dream. 
30037 Cute outdoor patio...has vegetarian options. Very friendly, good food and fast service. 
30038 Hey its a Pizza Uno. What do you expect. Service was good. Food was OK. 
30039 food is always on point. definitely a spot that college students frequent. nice location in downtown salem.. yum yum get in my tum! 
30040 the mad chicken sandwich and the greek fries are to die for..... only thing i could possibly complain about is that it gives me the burps....but then i get to taste it all over again! 
30041 Fried chicken was amazing. My wife had the trout, which was light but rich. Excited about what this restaurant and the Avondale corner has in store for the area. Only recommendation would be to have bigger, bolder wines. 
30042 Love this place!!!! If ur in the mood for great Caribbean food that's packed with flavor come here. I stopped eating meat a couple months ago and I am in love with their veggie plate. Before it was the jerk chicken plate. 
30043 My husband and I eat here at least once a week. Highly recommend! Noodle dishes and appetizers are yummy. Service is polite and quick. Prices are good too! 
30044 The coffee was great, I like the fact that when the coffee is served, that it is not scolding hot when u try to drink it. Service was excellent. The pastry was tasty also. 
30045 I confess that I ordered a second bowl of the truffle fries after devouring the first one. They are that good...The lines are long but they move quickly...so get your burger on! 
30046 Can not say enough about Deb and all the Studio 9 staff. They are always welcoming and treat each client with dignity and respect. 
30047 This place is great- good atmosphere, good vibe, cheerful staff. Fairly small menu, but everything on it looks great. The biscuits are masterfully done. If I lived nearby I'd easily gain ten pounds in mushroom gravy. 
30048 terrible...the seafood is over cooked and tasteless, while the potatoes are underdone and dry. The manager chided us for not joining in the dancing...we won't be back 
30049 "Yay! I'm a fan." ...of their awesome salty-soaking pool. 
30050 Great atmosphere and great food. Love the salt and pepper calamari! Sushi Mondays are awesome and have never left the restaurant hungry. Have been a happy repeat customer. 
30051 If you like electo-mechanical games, like pinball (AND I DO) this is a tiny slice of heaven located in a sketchy sketcy block of Protland. The machines are clean and functional and fun. The service quick. A nice additona ot Portlandia. 
30052 Very cool place...very relaxed environment. Their food is simple, but tastes great. You HAVE to try their avacado margarita...I don't care how that sounds, but it is out of this world (could be dangerous some nights). 
30053 Cheap food and always super fast. I've never had a problem at this location. They also have coupons often. 
30054 So delicious I could cry. Loved the magic mushroom burger. Ahhh. This place is great! 
30055 Great hotel, Great room smells and looks clean A bit on the Higher end and the defiantly charge for everything possible. ]but all in all we were satisfied 
30056 One of my absolute favorite places downtown. Amazing, creative menu and wonderful service. 
30057 This place has affordable and tasty dim sum. The service is fast. Definitely no frills but if you are looking for something quick and convienent this is it. 
30058 Got a delivery. The Oreo milkshake was PERFECT! Unfortunately it's the only good thing I can say. The regular turkey sandwich was some kind of nasty lunch meat and very bland. Maybe the Paninis are better.. Stay away from the cold sandwiches. Order the milkshakes 
30059 Stupidly loud. Sit outside to save your ears. It has a nice patio but unfortunately it was full. I guess everyone has the same idea about protecting their hearing as we did. The fish was fishy tasting. The ribs are dry. The calamari appetizer was pretty good. 
30060 Weak flavors. We didn't experience the serene quiet that a previous yelper did. 
30061 Love this place ! Great mid week dinner place 
30062 Friendly staff very helpful always have a smile on their faces. Great HH and daily specials! Family and dog friendly! 
30063 Simply the best Vietnamese food I've tasted. Call your order in if you don't have time to wait. My favorite is B5 with egg! 
30064 I've been coming here for 6 years to get a hair cut and I wouldn't go anywhere else. Jen is the best! I always get a very professional hair cut, and I always have a wonderful time as well. 
30065 Their coffee is a MUST HAVE! Columbian coffee here is always fabulous. We've had it many many times and it's always perfect. Empanadas are great I prefer chicken. Plantains are perfect. Place is BUSY! It is worth stopping in! 
30066 Delicious ramen! The prices are good for the portion you get. I find the quality of the ramen to be very good. I love the appetizers too, especially the curry. I will be coming back! 
30067 went to fratellos for the first time tonight and after ordering thought they over charged me 3-4 bucks, got home and the pizza was so good we didnt care if they did over charge us lol absolutely excellent! we will be going there again!!! 
30068 I had a good experience eating hot pot at the restaurant. However, it was ruined after the cashier at the front desk second floor slammed down the tray with the receipt and check and smacked a waiter in the arm with full force. I found it shocking and absolutely unprofessional. 
30069 Thai Cuisine is a great lunch spot! The food is fresh, consistent, reasonably priced, and good. What else do you want? 
30070 A pricy and low quality food! Got kashk e bademjun, barg and lamb kabab and got so disappointed! 
30071 Superb customer service, nice and clean rooms and not too bad breakfast and dinner included. Can't go wrong with that. 
30072 If you love fried chicken you'll love Gus's. The spicy wet rub crust was so crispy and good i am still thinking about it. 
30073 Cara and Sara, management please talk to them about customer service. Had to switch out tags multiple times because of mix up with age group. Will not be coming back because of these two. 
30074 Nice location after dining you can do a lot of things around....neat,decors are awesome i love the weighing scale by the entrance,quite place good service...foods are just average a bit pricey for what you are getting....all cards ok,free parking,family friendly....wash room clean... 
30075 This place leaves me speechless...like finding the Ark of the Covenant and I'm Indiana Jones. Free beer? Charlene's here! 
30076 I don't know of a better deal in Austin for price, quality and taste. Had the BYOB with salmon, yellow dragon sauce and brown rice - delicious! And the spicy salmon roll (4 pieces for under $3) was a great appetizer! We'll be going back regularly. 
30077 Stop what you're doing and book a massage with Wendy. After just one hour I felt like I'd come back from vacation. She is so nice and professional; Wendy gave me the best massage I have EVER had...I've done the research! Consider it your $80 Bahamas mini-break. 
30078 Been coming for about a year now. Consistency is key! And Guy is consistent with the cut! I appreciate it! 
30079 best full-service garage ever. I trust them - and I don't think I've ever trusted another garage! 
30080 This place is soooo GOOD! We come here at least twice a week. The sweet potatoes are delicious,and I love the spicy coconut sauce. Get the farofa and chimichurri toppings! 
30081 Really great panini sandwiches and very fresh fruit. I ordered an expresso which had a great bold taste as well. The cafe is located in a really relaxed, low-key part of the North End. 
30082 Mmmm yummmy! That was hands-down the best place to eat. Service-100%, food-100%, ambience-100%! Well.. german cake not so much. But overall- meets my standards. Will definitely be back if I'm in town! 
30083 Was really looking forward to a good bowling sesh w the squad to find out when we get there it closed a whole hour early:( 
30084 fabulous and super quality, fresh sushi! still love this place! 
30085 This a great intimate place. Being in the industry I am always looking for places like this - Great food, Good wine and good value with great service. Awesome charcuterie and an excellent wine list with something for every palate. I look forward to returning! 
30086 Pizza and Philly Rolls are the best. 
30087 Tasty Barbecues! The squid is recommended! The hand-pulled noodle is not hand-pulled at all, which is kind of disappointing. Everybody can get something they want in the hot dry pot. 
30088 Great fun with large party of friends. Plenty of wine choices and a surprisingly wide variety of craft beers (cans and bottles...draft was limited to 6 or 8). The menu was eclectic and appetizing. The staff was fun and energetic. Will definitely be back. 
30089 The wait was ridiculous of course but the continental burger was delicious and the truffle fries would definitely bring me back. 
30090 Great service lol I come so much they know my order lol !!! It's healthy n great way start your morning off!!! 
30091 No diaper changing table in the girls' bathroom. But it is clean. Have to be tall to lock the door. 
30092 The staff at the Milwaukie Oregon Carmax are fan-flippin-tastic! Pete and Kevin in the service center were so friendly, professional and efficient in handling a very stressful and unique situation with my car. I highly recommend this dealership and the guys in the service center are rockstars! 
30093 Perfect gym to workout at and has all the amenities. I have a passport membership therefore am allowed to check out all the gyms which is an added bonus. They have locations all around Boston which is convenient for all members. The Wellington location has great classes with convenient times. 
30094 So glad i found Discount Electronics, looking for a battery for my laptop. Thought I would be spending at least $200. Got it sooo cheap and shipping was fast. I will definitely recommend you to my friends. 
30095 Great neighborhood bar made by the amazing staff. Play darts, play music and relax in a bar that doesn't typically get the drunkards as they don't serve liquor... just beer and wine. My favorite bar in the area. 
30096 Great value. Super quick delivery. 
30097 Excellent home made desserts and fun atmosphere. They have reasonable prices for the caliber and freshness of their coffee and dessert offerings. I've come here many times over the last 7 years and have always enjoyed it. 
30098 Their guitar tech Mike saved my old Les Paul! He got it back in top shape, fixed a pickup issue and readjusted everything, and my old guitar lives again. Great service and advice. Recommended for guitar service. Go see Mike! 
30099 Food 5 service 0. Over 40 minutes to get oysters at an oyster bar? Can't understand the high ratings for this place. Also air conditioning not working well enough to keep the restaurant comfortable 
30100 I'm there about once a week. The salmon is usually my favorite - though every once and a while it is way too dry. Sushi is pretty good, and they have a nice variety. I've always had very nice waitpersons - one hugs me when I come in. 
30101 I said in my last review 4 stars because of the noise - and they put dampeners in! Fabulous restaurant. 
30102 I was really disappointed! Food was so mediocre. I went with two other people and we all thought everything was underwhelming. Maybe I'll give it another try! 
30103 My husband and I go here to see the dermatologist, Dr. Lela Lankerani. She is so personable as well as professional. The entire office staff is very efficient. I highly recommend Westlake Dermatology. 
30104 This is my favorite sushi go round type sushi place in Beaverton/Hillsboro! Good variety and delicious salmon hand rolls! They get really busy sometimes which can get frustrating but it's worth it! Definitely worth a try if you enjoy sushi. 
30105 Sunday brunch. Arrived just after noon. 20 minute wait. Had Fried Chicken and Waffles (w/kumquat syrup). Was really good--don't get me wrong--but for some reason the fried chicken white meat was much better than the dark (and I prefer dark fried chicken). Reasonable prices and service. I'll be going back. 
30106 Excellent cupcakes, cool ideas for flavors on offer and friendly service. Enjoy it every time I head out to the higlands 
30107 Everything is on point, with the exception of the service. Due to the language barrier, servers ignore requests for small things like a fill up in water. Also, plan yo pay with cash because that is the ONLY form of payment that they except. Great spot for congi! 
30108 Great prices for a filling lunch. Not a fan of the chicken. It has a funky metallic after taste, but the vegetarian options are pretty good. The chutneys are excellent, especially the spicy one. 
30109 Love this place. Fantastic sandwiches, unbelievable cookies, awesome service. New location is amazing. 
30110 I have been coming here since I was a kid! They have since changed spots but their beef salad thingy is SO GOOD. Very thankful for local Vancouver Restaurants! 
30111 I had a great experience. The staff were friendly and attentive. The steak and frites were yummy. The only negative was that the deviled eggs were pretty bland. 
30112 We came here with a large group for brunch. Since our group was so large, the owner gave us multiple complementary sweet potato tater tots sides for us to share. The service was great and the food was good. The Korean spin on popular American brunch items definitely works. 
30113 Food was ok. Presentation was good. Heard so much about this place before going. Too much hype for this. Its cool interior but the food was a bit of a disappointment. 
30114 I'm an IKEA addict and don't understand people who don't love IKEA. Best place for inexpensive furniture, home and kitchen accessories and a quick bite. Be sure to sign up for IKEA family for even deeper discounts!

30116 their sandwiches are so good! I asked the name of a super kind and helpful worker who was ready with my food when I had barely sat down and begun reading, and I think she said it was 'Love'. Either way I Love this place. 
30117 The best hummus I have ever had! The happy hour menu is excellent. I have been in during happy hour several times and always had excellent service. The hummus, Greek salad and meatballs are all delicious. 
30118 Great bar! Pool tables, music, GREAT staff and good food. I'm a regular here and wouldn't want it any other way!! 
30119 Endless appetizer deal is great, service was not. The french fries tasted old and our waitress was very forgetful. This place is very unorganized 
30120 Always come here to get my eyebrows threaded! Its always $5 before tax and the ladies are always fast and efficient. Don't have to worry about annoying small talk! 
30121 Super friendly donut shop. Literally greeted by multiple coming in. Really wanted the peanut and jelly donut but they were out. I got the maple bacon donut and boy it didn't disappoint. It is as good as it sounds. 
30122 Went to the takeout deli counter this morning for bagels and lox sandwiches and pastrami sandwiches. The food was utterly amazing, the kind of food that makes you groan audibly with every bite. The service was great. All-around, fantastic! I foresee many trips here in the future. 
30123 Greatest Irish bar in Boston. I love the bar and the people there. The music is usually great. The menu photo is somehwat outdated. 
30124 you can lost at this place... but they have everything for every room in your house - assembly and patience required .. 
30125 not the best food ever but it tastes pretty good. not the best service ever, by far.. but for that price, on Newbury, when you are sitting outside on a sunny day... awesome 
30126 Yum! We ordered the spicy chicken rigatoni, a huge bottle of their house Rosso wine, garlic bread and calamari. Everything was amazing! 
30127 Delicious food! I had the steak and the empanadas both were amazing! They have indoor and outdoor seating! 
30128 The last time I had pho was down in Mississippi and it probably skewed my expectations of pho. We did a takeout and the pho was pretty average. The broth could use more depth in flavour. But overall it was worth the money. 
30129 Ordered an apple fritter paid $$$$ and the thing was raw batter inside. I was already in my car down the road or I would have marched right back to them! Blech!! 
30130 Great experience. $20 lunch, that was more than enough for 2 of us. Great quality combo meat/fried rice, and special soup. Loved it !!! 
30131 This is not a place that does honest or quality work on your vehicle. They will nickel and dime you and them give it back worse than when you left it. 
30132 Our tour guide, Kate, made the brief tour of the Samuel Adams Brewery informative & entertaining. We really enjoyed her humour and style. The tastings after the tour were generous & delicious. The tour is free with only a recommendation for a small donation. Highly recommended. 
30133 Great place, we will be back soon. Service was excellent! Food delicious and fresh. We are lucky that many others like it too. I hope more people find bs this location. 
30134 Always my favorite place to get some drinks when I come to Boston. NOT and overpriced tourist trap. Just a good local joint with great food and an excellent atmosphere. 
30135 the wax treatment and the 5 second shoulder massage is a nice touch but it doesn't make up for the below average mani pedi 
30136 Great food! Had the "Our Burger" without cheese and Tatertots!! You just can't find Tatertots in restaurants! Suzanne J was our server and she was excellent. I will definitely be back! 
30137 Food and staff are always delightful. Never any parking available but nothing they can do about that. They get through the long lines fast! Ive been to other locations that were subpar so makes me appreciate this one even more. 
30138 Great Korean-Chinese cuisine and huge servings reasonably priced. I highly recommend the cold noodle soup and jajang nyun. Cold noodle soup is always great on a hot day. 
30139 Cute place, friendly staff, and the shallot/jalape√±o breakfast sandwich is incredible! Will definitely go back! 
30140 Worst service ever ! Too long to take the order and than way longer for the food ! I expected more, very disapointing ! 
30141 In and out in under 10min. Great service, friendly and honest. Took both our vehicles there. 
30142 The absolute best coffee ever. Wood fired! Moon milk is amazing! The more the better. 
30143 Brisket is way too salty and beef ribs were tender inside but chewy bark. I guess I am spoiled with other better Q joints in town..... 
30144 Terrific bicycle shop! The entire staff is friendly and knowledgable (they all ride). The shop has a great selection of bicycles and parts and accessories. I've purchased four bikes from JRA over the past 10 years and they have done a great job servicing them. 
30145 Pros: - Friendly staff - Nice pond for a 1-2 hour kayak trip - Proximity to Boston - Water looks clean Cons: - No bathroom - No swimming - Can see buildings & highways in parts - Parking lot can get crowded 
30146 A personal favorite venue for gigs. Nice small size, easy acess to "backstage" room. Just watch out for roofies on new year's eve... 
30147 I ordered pizza by the phone call. When I got there the pizza was ready. I gave money, but when I open the box the pizza was burn. They offer me to wait for another pizza and they didn't apologize nor gave discount. I wouldn't recommend this pizza place. 
30148 Very impressed with my fancy new nails! They look great! The price was great too. I will definitely be back :) 
30149 I really appreciated Michelle's attention to detail and commitment to making sure that I got Exactly what I was looking for. Great customer service, and a chic haircut. 
30150 Service was quick and friendly. My boyfriend and I each got a slice of pizza and ordered a second one. Would go back! There's a few games and a bar connected to it which is great, too., 
30151 OMG the vegan French toast with the homemade boysenberry jam is out of control ! Huge portions and fast service... it's a great quant little spot. I also liked the vegan sausage. I'd recommend this place to everyone! 
30152 Customer service great, restaurant was clean and organize. I had the jerk chicken w/sauce on the side and X2 cabbage. It was good, hot and spicy! Ill be back and the nxt i'll try another dish. 
30153 love their green chili pork enchiladas. also their texas two step option is always good. 
30154 This is the most discriminating nightclub in the city of Boston! Witnessed and was victim to race and class discrimination both by owner and unprofessional bouncers. Do not recommend a place that condones such behavior! We were just out to have a good time! 
30155 Love this place!! The food is really great but it's the atmosphere that keeps us coming back! The live music is very entertaining and you feel like you're having a meal with a very large, extended family! 
30156 Just had a super experience with Daniel, a store associate this afternoon, I had a complicated account problem, and he went the extra mile to get me the answers I needed, and resolve the issue. Very happy with the service at this store. 
30157 Best shawarma in Vancouver! This has been my go to place for 10 years, highly recommend! 
30158 This place sucks. Went midday Saturday, terrible service, poor food. It took 30 min+ to get a side salad, nachos and a cheese pizza. Nachos were a stale brick, pizza flavorless, and how do you screw up a salad?... Stale cornbread croutons. FAIL 
30159 A very decent and affordable spot to order noodle soup from for lunch or dinner. 
30160 Super yummy, and option to make anything vegetarian, which you can't find at most places! Everything was fresh. 
30161 Really doesn't live up to the hype. Dan-dan noodles were lacking in noodles, over-salted, and came in a tiny bowl. Other dishes were OK, but generally under-sized and over-priced. Love Flour, wouldn't come back to M&C 
30162 Cute spot and hippie chic vibe. The hookahs and cumfy couch were my favorite. The food was greasy:( 
30163 Ethan and Amanda saved us during a SXSW shipping emergency! Seriously the nicest and most helpful staff, especially during an insanely busy time. Thanks again! 
30164 Migas tacos from heaven. Great stuff across the board, with house made salsas. Migas tacos. From heaven. 
30165 This place has grown! Coming after a couple of years! I came for kefir and saw they have a restaurant now! Menu is nice, elaborate and healthy! Must try. Picked up the kefir! 
30166 Been here a couple of times and would recommend. The food is fresh, tasty and relatively quick from the kitchen. It's reasonably priced for what you get. Service was acceptable. 
30167 Slowest Sonic I have been to in my life...hire some people or close..Sonic should never takr 30 minutes for a combo meal. 
30168 Homemade and delicious - and is reasonably priced compared to other local places 
30169 So many different flavors and types ! Definitely our new favorite stop! 
30170 I don't believe this is Shanxi noodles unless that Xi'an I went located on some other Earth. 
30171 Really nice little hidden gem. The servers are very attentive, the menu is extensive and the food is really good. Great atmosphere and I like that the bar is tucked away from the restaurant. 
30172 If you are looking for a place to stay in downtown Boston, close to the action/restaurants/metro....this is the spot. They might not offer the best amenities (pool? where is it?!) but the gym is decent and the location cannot be beat. 
30173 The food is decent, the service is pretty quick. Good spot for a quick bite or an afternoon beer. Selection of beer is pretty limited, the sandwiches are solid but not spectacular. I will return but out of convenience (and the roof top seating during summer) more so than excellence. 
30174 Rica la comida, las entradas y los platillos con excelente saz√≥n, hay unos nachos de cangrejo deliciosos, el servicio muy agradable y r√°pido, el ambiente de primera. 
30175 Went here on a weekday for happy hour. Oysters tasted so fresh and the salsa with plantain chips (they were out of yucca chips) was really delicious, not the typical Mexicana salsa, but an herby tomato flavor with a slight kick. Service was good. 
30176 A great traditional neighborhood. I love the nightime feel, the restaurants, cafes etc. I always enjoying going, 
30177 Great tapas, great drinks, great service. Casual atmosphere with quite nitches to sit in as well as large tables. You can be as social or intimate as you choose. Would be a great place for a party or a date. Will definitely be back. 
30178 great German potato salad, great sausage and cream puffs the size of your skull, nuff said. 
30179 Place is relatively clean. Staff seem to be shouting in the back a lot... not sure why orders need to be shouted at each other when the place is not busy. 
30180 I love this restaurant! The food is awesome. I love the Quinoa bowl. It's yummy! 
30181 El Chilito is great!! I highly enjoy everything I've had there. The tacos are flavorful and large portions for just a couple dollars each. The salsa is also a must when getting food. I make it a point to stop by when in the area. 
30182 Love this place!! Fresh food and the moo goo chicken is my fave in a white sauce! The ladies are always so friendly. It's nice and quiet and the food tastes fresh. My fave little lunch spot 
30183 Adrienne is the best, most attentive bar tender and HILARIOUS! Loaded tater tots were delish! 
30184 Standard spa pedicure at a good price. I like this place because we didn't have to make a reservations. The women are really nice too. I'll be going back! 
30185 Everyone was helpful and nice. I asked the manager for 10% off a soundbar through an obscure price match. He took care of me. 
30186 Go here! I guarantee you will enjoy yourself' today was my Frist time to visit for lunch 
30187 This is the BEST ASIAN buffet in Austin ... Fresh homemade dumplings ...so much variety of sushi 'yummy ! I will be back for more!! 
30188 Great breakfast completely off the beaten path. Cozy, and comfortable. Takes some hunting to get here, but worth the effort. Piping hot and good portions. 
30189 Ah mazing! 14 course chefs tasting menu. Excellent from start to finish. Add the bev pairing for $45. Service equally thoughtful. We felt pampered. 
30190 Quotes " All of us. very impressed. Over-indulged and satisfied " I'll be back to do the Taj brunch rooftop again 
30191 This review is for their waffles and latte only. We stopped by their to go counter for dessert. The latte was rich in flavor and the waffles were perfect! So chewy and soft on inside and crispy in the outside. 
30192 My one experience here was scary....total used car salesmen. Since I was a first time buyer, they offered to cut the price in half. The catch was I had to buy right then....no time to think about it, no return....just hand over my hard earned cash. Go to Shane Co. 
30193 Mark Duncan is a blessing! He is honest and prompt. I trust him with my vehicles and hope that he is around for a long time for when those repairs are needed. He is the first place I go when something needs attention. Thanks Mark!!! 
30194 Great Taqueria in Salem. Great flavor combos. Some are hot enough to burn a witch. (Get it?! Because it's Salem? Get it?) Anyways, tasty stuff here. Bacon-wrapped jalape√±os are a must. Enjoy! 
30195 Just had my nails by Donna. She did a great job! Best prices in town. I'll definitely be back! 
30196 Beautiful house, comfy beds, heated floors, great price, great breakfast, GREAT coffee, nice people, easy and relaxed atmosphere, good location. Perfect B&B. 
30197 I'm not an expert in the authentic Chinese food field, but I would eat their pan fried pork buns (Shanghai style) every day. 
30198 Desperately long wait for one sandwich and ice cap since machine to make other stuff was broken 
30199 i'm not a tibetan food connoisseur but i did enjoy the food here. being located in davis, it might get lost in the shuffle of places to eat. the food is cheap. the staff is very attentive and the atmosphere is decent. check it out if you're in the area. 
30200 Divine. I recommend salmon salad and venezuelan chocolate pot! 
30201 The best mussels we've ever had. Very tender and lots of great flavor to them. Everything we had here was great quality and extremely fresh. 
30202 TT's a fabulous small venue to catch a show at anytime during the week. It is very personable and has a good mood throughout. The bar tenders are very nice and like the rest of the staff, laid-back and friendly. 
30203 Service wasn't great. Very slow prepping, and the food tasted very bland. Overall pretty disappointing experience. I wish they would have the regular menu at lunch. Maybe their regular pasta would taste better but I won't be back to wait another an hour to try 
30204 Love Mark's! Best Jamaican food in Orlando! 
30205 I love this place. Awesome BBQ, I normally stick with the pork. 
30206 Solid lunch spot. Great soups and sandwiches. If you like prosciutto, try getting a Caprese sandwich with prosciutto. If you don't, there is plenty of other great choices. Staff is also very friendly and accommodating. 
30207 The food is decent, the old man at the counter is amazing. 4 stars for great fast service, he was super nice, and always smiled. I wouldn't say I was thrilled with the food,but overall, I like good service, and that's what I'm rating. 
30208 Since we had two disasters in a row; P'cheen and Highland Bakery, the wife wanted a drink. So, we went across the street to this place. Ordered two margaritas. Homemade mix and it was good. 
30209 If you have an older or vintage bike; this is the Team to work on your Bike hands down! Cannot say enough good things about Paul or Shanna & Crew! They look after both my KZ440 and XS650! 
30210 This place is haunted. It's only open at night, likely because it's staffed by vampires. The cafe Borgia is the best thing ever, though, so I'd say it's worth the risk. Just make sure you take a friend with you to the bathroom. 
30211 What a neat place. Our waiter was so attentive and fun, the atmosphere.. especially the back patio is delightful, great drinks. I'll definitely be back! 
30212 Love Rice Bowl. I try new things all the time and I'm always happy. We probably order once a week. Potstickers are a family fave. 
30213 Obviously food was delicious! Waiting sucked, + the fact that they were not seating outside. Also a recommendation would be to provide menus to the guests waiting so we can be ready to order when we sit down! 
30214 Your basic Chinese restaurant. Good lunch special options. Nothing fancy just good old American Chinese food. 
30215 Came for the happy hour (3-6pm or 9-5 lose every day). Pretty good deals but disappointed with the food. I wouldn't recommend coming here. Personalized size margherita pizza for $3 was thin and oily. Yam fries $5 was good, normal. 2 tacos for $7 were meh. 
30216 This a new and beautiful Residence Inn-very nice grounds, lobby and room. I found the room to have a MAJOR issue. The AC will generate a constant (fan not set to auto) noise the can get in the way of the sleep you want. 
30217 This restaurant is near my store, I usually eat his pizza once in a month, his pizza is good ,his service is perfect, I will chose his big pizza when I busy that I don't have time for cooking, his sauce is sour for me but my son likes it. 
30218 Drinks are cheap, staff is nice. Great music selection, and the outside patio is set up very nicely. This is the go to place for my friends and I when we are around burnside towards the bridge. Oh and bonus, Sizzle pie next store! 
30219 Bi-Mart is a great store. Good prices on many items and an assortment of seasonal things, canning supplies, hardware and my favorite, outdoor gear! Thanks! 
30220 This place was not good!!!!! Tacos LOOK tasty but they aren't! Salsa is a joke. Don't waste your $$ here. 
30221 Quite honestly, I don't put a lot of emphasis on hotel bars. But, we needed to eat something and grab a drink before a concert. Well worth it and I suggest you try this place. 
30222 Went in here for a quick sec cause my husband was looking for something healthy! They were super helpful and super nice! This places is awesome!! The bowls tasted amazing!! 
30223 The absolute best venue in Austin. If you're into dance music and amazing vibes, you HAVE TO COME HERE!!!! 
30224 Amazing Bloody Caesars with candied bacon! Very fresh and delectable poke salad. Sister had the classic Benny which she loved. Potatoes were delicious. The service was great- very personable and fun waiter. Enjoyed the food and experience. 
30225 Flavorful, unique food. Absolutely delicious menu. Shrimp Ceviche, saut√©ed mussels, and forest mushrooms with farm egg all top notch. Big plus, happy hour starts at 3! Will recommend to everyone! 
30226 My first time trying out this spot.. the food is great and the proportion is HUGE w/ a drink for $5!! Definitely will eat here again!!! 
30227 This place is outstanding! If you want a great cocktail, warm hospitality and outstanding food in a beautiful space-this is your spot. 
30228 Fresh, handmade tortillas all day long!! I ordered the stacked enchilada at it was fabulous with all white chicken. Served with rice and beans. Excellent! 
30229 Was very excited to finally eat at the ravenous pig.The food was excellent, the service and the drinks where only average. Definitely check this place out just don't waste $12 on their cocktails. 
30230 Literally the best pizza you'll ever have. Service is alright but the place is known for its pizza. You won't be disappointed one bit. 
30231 Got my nails fixed here after someone messed them up I believe it was a lady named Heather ...., she did a wonderful job !!! I will definitely go back here ! 
30232 Came to get a new Schlage keypad lock rekeyed to the existing key. Friendly and fast service-- I was in and out in about 10 minutes. Note that it's cash or check only. 
30233 Lucky to be served by the owners daughter who is simply lovely. Place is packed on a Saturday night, but it's worth the small wait. Everything we had was delicious! A great date night in Vancouver. Who knew? 
30234 Fantastic food! Got the regular bowl, steak, mango and a ton of veggies. Amazing combination of flavors. So much food we took some home. Would recommend to anyone 
30235 I wish you had more docters and physical therapists.. then I wouldn't have to wait so long for appointments and treatments 
30236 Good beer. I like two of their burgers very much. The others are comparable to other restaurants. Get the Rubinator! 
30237 I love Amy's! The St. Edward's location is definitely the best! The workers there are super cool and friendly and you can sample any of the flavors. It is a little pricey but I think the delicious ice cream, fun flavors, and friendly workers make it worth it! 
30238 Great service! Arrived on time, did a great job in a very reasonable amount of time. Even pet allergies didn't stop them from tackling my cat-abode! Definitely a fan! 
30239 HEART the cassis-flavored macarons....and that is MACARON, not MACAROON :) 
30240 Solid food truck. Little on the pricey side. Portions are nice and offer a selection of sauces. 
30241 Just average. The food was actually quite bland and I wasn't excited to be eating it. 
30242 I was looking for authentic Cuban food. The is the chain restaurants of Cuban food. It was ok, it wouldn't be my first choice to go to. 
30243 Holy crap this place is good. Super nice owner, open all the time, and my face was blown off by the dosas. They are seriously delicious. 
30244 Love this place! Great atmosphere and punctual and charismatic wait staff. Excellent executive chef! Great food! 
30245 Delicious wood fired pizza. The crust is perfect and the topping selection, while limited, is delicious as well. We had the Italian sausage and ricotta pies - we will be back next time we're in Vancouver. Oh yeah, don't leave without ordering the tiramisu! 
30246 This place is a real diner! The food and service is always excellent. They always have interesting specials. Haven't had a bad dish there yet. Although I really didn't care for their in-house made corn beef hash. It wasn't bad though. 
30247 Get liquored up and laughing. What else is there? I will say I like this intimate setting more than Cap City, but both have provided endless laughs. Date night, friends chilling... it all works. 
30248 Went here last year and loved it. Had the tasting menu and everything was so tasty and fresh. I felt like i was in Europe as had such a good feel. Great price for the food. Great date place. 
30249 This location is pretty awesome! The vibe and atmosphere is on another level compared to most other restaurants. Our server Jessica was very friendly and positive. Good stuff, keep it up! 
30250 to my absolute dismay, Wang's has been closed for months and replaced by new managment 
30251 Perfect brunch place. Their eggs Benedict and pancakes are quite tasty. Good location and atmosphere 
30252 Sandwich Vegetariano. Well, that and a caf√© cubano, of course. 
30253 Loved tonights halibut. AMAZING. Service was just ok so 4 star. Go for the good food! Enjoy! 
30254 Wow. Delicious!!!! Better than Indian food in NYC. We are very happy!! The waiter George is awesome!!! ;D Wish it was a little less expensive tho. :) 
30255 What a great place!!!!! It is under new ownership, and they are doing a wonderful job getting it up its full restaurant. The manager is very nice and lovely. They hit jackpot with Iliana. I highly recommend it because the food was great, but the costumer service is even better. 
30256 This place is awesome!!! We love coming here and always take people who come to town here. Cool vibe, great service, amazing food and donuts!!!! 
30257 Breakfast at Thierry was awesome. I had the mocha and my husband had the Spanish latte. The macaroons were so delicious as well as the almond croissant. We wanted to order the tuna nicois but was not available yet at 9:20 am 
30258 Love, love, love Lionheart and the staff. These people seriously know their coffee and how to prepare it well. They've added breakfast options as well so now it's a no-brainer that this is the best coffee place in town. 
30259 Changing to 5 stars after coming back for day 2 of my conference- all i had to do was ask for less ice :p These guys are the best! 
30260 Authentic, authentic, authentic. I haven't tasted espresso this good in 14 years (since living in Rome). The hand made biscotti were delicious. I will be back again and again and again, so glad I found you. Can't wait to try every. single. thing on the menu. 
30261 Godzilla role is AWESOME, so is customer service and restaurant ambiance. This is definitely a local favorite! 
30262 Johnny D's with our two daughters and their wonderful guys. Great omelettes and sides, strong coffee, outstanding oatmeal, good background jazz, terrific conversation, easy parking. Priceless morning. 
30263 Fantastic experience all around....still...thank you Baby Doll. Tonight you guys were efficient on the phone. Quick with delivery...hot and well done pie in the box....easy at the door check out. Definitely Rockin it...thank you :) 
30264 The best pies in town. Fresh and delicious pastries and aromatic coffee, what more could you ask for? Lots of room to eat there or take your treat to go. 
30265 I tried the chocolate chocolate and Red Velvet. They were both good. The Red Velvet had a cream cheese inside, kinda like the old school hostess chocolate cupcakes, with a sweet frosting on top. I thought they had too much frosting, but thats not a huge issue. 
30266 None of my topping were cooked for some reason and hardly any cheese whatsoever. Strange for a pizza place. Gave more than one star because they were friendly. 
30267 Flavour of real italia in the west end! Excellent wine and incredibly flavorful menu. Fills up quickly, go early 
30268 Yum. Great coffee, baked goods and sandwiches. I also love the comfy couches. My only concern is if you miss out on those couches then you're relegated to uncomfortable wooden chairs around teeny tiny tables. 
30269 I've dined at Peruvian restaurants in a few major cities and this compares favorably with them. Prices are low and service is great. 
30270 Love the food here! Always fresh, large portions and great prices. The spicy salmon sashimi and crunch house roll are must haves for us every time we come here. 
30271 Yum!!! So tasty and friendly peeps too. Shrimp were really plump and flavorful. Taco Loco's still my first love, but this hits the spot. 
30272 Went there for my little sisters 21st birthday and we loved it. Cocktails lived up to the hype, food was fantastic and our waitress, Julia was an absolute doll. Atmosphere was great for an intiment occasion. Definitely be coming back! 
30273 When in Rome. This is great fried chicken. Got a tender a leg and Mac and cheese. Worth it. I will come back. And staff was great 
30274 Oh wow, as splash of class an Southern Hospitality. This lounge has one of the best bars in the entire state of Georgia. 
30275 Iced coffee is the best around!! Cool atmosphere! Haven't tried their good but will definitely go back for that!!! 
30276 Such an awesome neighborhood spot! The Shakshouka is packed with flavor and the bread that comes with it is perfect. They also have great biscuit sandwiches. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is bright and inviting. Really happy to have this in the neighborhood. 
30277 The cupcakes are so good! You can taste the flavor so well! My favorite is Vanilla Bean chocolate! 
30278 Was not impressed. The service and atmosphere were amazing but as for the food nothing special. I don't see this place lasting long if they don't improve. I went with a group of 5 people and no one said they would go back. 
30279 One of my family's favorite places to eat hot pots are amazing wings are delicious new has a location has a full-service bar right off of division with excellent ratings and excellent service will definitely come back 
30280 First time here. Pancake, biscuit and gravy, bacon. Outstanding. Pancake is 14 inches. Heavy nice big chunks of sausage. Going back for the chicken and noodles. 
30281 This place is a East Boston landmark and has one of the best pizza's around. They use extra corn meal which gives it a great crunch and their sauce is great! Santarpios is a must! 
30282 Came here for the cute matcha latte design but they didn't have a cute design on my drink! I appreciated the strong matcha taste though and the seating. I loved the swing chairs and the cozy pillow seat up. 
30283 Best pedicure I've had in a very long time! Definitely going back. My manicurist took her time and gave me the royal treatment. I highly recommend. 
30284 Excellent! Run by a lovely couple- the wife was our waitress. The Italian wedding soup was delicious, as was the homemade pastas. Really a gem and they were not pushy even though we walked in close to their closing time. Highly recommended if you are in the area. 
30285 Incredible drinks and great food. The staff is very friendly, make sure to ask for the specialty drinks based on your cravings. The wait can be very long so grab some coffee and waffle and go for a walk nearby. 
30286 First time visiting East Side Tavern! All I can say is Wow! Great food, very friendly staff, definitely plan on coming back! Be sure to try the brisket, your stomach will thank you! 
30287 Best Sushi I've had in the Stoughton/Canton/Norwood area. The staff is always very inviting and the sushi is really fresh. 
30288 My preferred Austin area restaurant. Quality food & servce. Great value. Consider spliting a meail to engae the Gumbo & dessert. Best in Austin. Check hours for lunch & dinner. 
30289 Love this place! So much better than your standard donut. All kinds of flavor varieties. The combinations and varieties are limitless. Coffee amazing too! 
30290 Really liked all the smaller side dishes like takoyaki (good sized pieces of octopus), onigiri (pretty big and tasty), karaage don (crispy and good chicken). Service was good. The ramen broth was good, but wished the noodles were chewier. 
30291 The food here is definately above average for bar fare and along with the drinks aren't priced too badly. The atmosphere of this place is always good and the crowd is varied. This is also a placewhere you can meet new people and strike up a conversation at the bar. 
30292 Food here is insanely good. Head chef also has a burger truck called Kickdrum which is also awesome. Their main bartender Stephanie is super nice and quick/good at her job. One of our favorite spots in Austin--make sure you try the pretzel, burger, or tacos! 
30293 Good for inexpensive Thai food but not the most flavorful that I've had. They are quick and dependable. Their pad see ew is decent but I wish that there was more sauce/flavor to it. 
30294 Once they did call me back they were very friendly. The massage was one of the best I've ever had. 
30295 This is my go-to Indian restaurant. I am never disappointed! The buffet is a delight with many wonderful dishes, both vegetarian and non. Go hungry! I always waddle out! 
30296 Following up on my previous 3-star review, the regional manager listened to my concerns and will be addressing the ones he can. Our conversation went well and I hope to visit again soon to check out a better experience. 
30297 Open 7 days a week & deliver until 3 am? Yes, please. Consistently good food & fast delivery time. Good stuff: Jumbo Shrimp w/ Broccoli Hot & Sour Soup Egg Rolls Egg Fu Young w/ Shrimp Szechuan Chicken Sweet & Sour Chicken I've also heard that the wings are good. 
30298 Super delicious food. Awesome vibe. I suffered through Disneyworld, and this was the highlight of the trip. My kids ate good, and decent wine for decent price. Not easy to find food like this, wish this spot was where I lived 
30299 AWESOME lamb burger and the parmesan truffle fries are addictive! 
30300 Anna is an awesome nail lady. She did exactly what I wanted with my nails and I'm picky! She was quick but efficient and didn't let me leave unless she was happy. I'm very happy with her work and I will def be back! 
30301 I tried Pho for the first time here and was very impressed with the service. You're not really going to eat for less than $10 here but the quality is nice. 
30302 YES!! My brother lives right around the corner from here and I will continue to visit him from NYC because of how amazing this place is. The whole serving is EXTREMELY GENEROUS and I barely made it through and I'm reeeeeeally good at eating ice cream. 
30303 Nice suburban sports bar decor. Lots of TVs. Food as bad as can be expected-taco Mac meets chili's. Kind of a DB hangout-bad music with lots of baseball caps. 
30304 the greatest thing that has happened to the South End since losing Pho Republique. My favorite poison of theirs, the "Tar & Feather", can't leave w/ out drinking at least 6 of them. 
30305 The food was amazing! We had fried chicken, smoothered pork chops, Mac and cheese, yams, green beans and potatoes, dressings and everything was really good. Super friendly staff. 
30306 Food was what I remember from college and the driver was nice. But, there used to be garlic sauce with the pizzas. And I ordered a veggie and a cheese but got two cheeses. Still service was fast. Maybe that's the problem with online ordering... 
30307 We eat here every time we come to Austin. Great food, they always have nightly specials. Staff is knowledgeable and very attentive. 
30308 So amazing! Seriously, we've been dreaming about the migas since the first bite! We ate there twice during our 4 days in Austin, and stopped back a third time to have them one more time before getting on the plane home! Just go! 
30309 It looks weird from outside and weird inside too.. BUT don't let that turn you away! Amazing price + kind owner = AWESOME! :) GRAB A FISH CAKE. SO GOOD 
30310 First of all.... when did this place get fancy? They like lifted the ceilings about 10ft and replaced everything with new new new. Anyways, get the chicken pho add steamed vegetables. It's got to be the best in Austin, besides Bun Belly. Thanks and g'bye. 
30311 The biggest problem was trying to decide what to order. So many choices and really great prices. The food was amazing. We drove an hour to get there and it was totally worth it. 
30312 The food is okay, nothing special. Margarita was about the same. Nice vibe. Good service. 
30313 This place has great Mexican food! Very tasty and the service is pretty good. If you're in Salem Mass check it out. 
30314 $3 drinks for happy hour on fridays and good service! Not sure how you can beat that :) 
30315 Great food, generous portion, reasonable price. My first time here, it's worth it! Good value for the money and good quality of food. The fragrance of Jasmine tea set the palate for our dinner. 
30316 Coffee is superb! Lots of spaces to sit and do work. Definitely seemed understaffed though, lots of people waiting for drinks and only one person making them. Would come back! 
30317 Love the choices, that they're environmentally conscious, and the location! Extra bonus that you can order online. 
30318 Screw Voodoo and their lines. Blue Star has the best donuts I've ever had. Get an old fashioned and then thank me after. You're welcome. 
30319 Over priced! Strip steak was worst I have ever been served at a steak house. Luke warm very thin with grizzle. Filet mignon good but served luke warm. Service very slow. Potatoes luke warm. 
30320 Like the food. Very fast delivery. We order from here a few times a week. The only issue is that they do mess up the orders a lot. They will fix the problems when they occur. 
30321 I ordered flowers here because of the recommendations on yelp...wasn't impressed. $60 (pick up no delivery) buys very little here. Yes they are nice people but... 
30322 Beautiful ambience, helpful and attentive assistance from the Australian bartender and delicious Tagine that I've been craving since we went. Also, the Lavender Latte! 
30323 First Ruth Chris experience and it did not disappoint! From the service to the food, it was all exceptional. Chris was awesome, very attentive and friendly. I'm typically a filet guy, but I went with a NY Strip and it was phenomenal. Will definitely be back for special occasions! 
30324 I lovvvvveeeeeee the people here. They're always friendly. The place is always clean. And the food is amazing!!! YESSSSS.... EVERY TIME. Did I forget to mention that they're a BLACK owned:)) 
30325 Friendly staff, good selection of products to choose from :) They carry the yummy chocolate chip gelato I like, and good local beer selection! 
30326 Ummmm not so much for me. Slow inattentive service. Out of menu items on a Saturday night at 8. 15 min between drink order and drink arrival. Food very mediocre. Save your hundred bucks and go somewhere else. 
30327 Great pizza!!! I started working down the street from this location and decided to try it. I ordered the "Topper" pizza. It's packed with pepperoni. You don't need to order extra cheese because there is a ton of cheese on it. Great sauce, also. I highly recommend!!!! 
30328 Just had a great meal with my non-adventurous foodie wife. Her first time eating at a Latin restaurant and we both loved it. Authentic food, friendly servers, local craft beer on tap, great value. 
30329 I don't usually give a 5, but this place has done so well to so many of close friends and family. 
30330 This is a touristy "asian" restaurant. Perhaps if I was from a small town and my experience of Chinese food was limited to a mall orange chicken joint, I would have liked this place. But to my SoCal pampered pallet it just seemed like crap 
30331 I loved this store. The customer service was wonderful. The items were well priced. I was looking for a new place to take my mom. She loves thrift stores. I live in orlando and took a chance on going to winter park and i was glad that i did. 
30332 Worst service ever!!!!! Payed my bill and now my service is cut off and nobody can help me till Monday? What kind of security company is that? Seriously thinking of saying screw it and disconnecting. Will not resign contract and will not recommend to anyone. 
30333 Best vegan breakfast tacos EVER. Amazing! Great sauces and sweet service too. Great vintage shops around that area too! 
30334 Love this place. Great food and service. My daughter always gets the Vaca Frita and loves it every time. 
30335 Cool little place about to order the mother clucker and a beer 
30336 Such a bad restaurant with bad service attitudes. Do not go to this place, they also make beef that is not completely cook. 
30337 Great environment with great food and excellent customer service. Deffinetly a spot to bring the family on vacation and get the true Florida feel. 
30338 Absolutely one of the best burgers I've ever had. Maple Bacon Burger is the way to go. Great atmosphere and nice staff. 
30339 This place is awesome. It's like Cheers with only wine. Great local spot for peeps in the Dr Phillips area. 
30340 Great fusion food. I was not too pleased with the Banh Mi sandwich, but everything else I had was great. I would highly recommend the kimchi fries and tacos. 
30341 Toned down, kinda modernized North Indian food. Nothing wrong about it, just does not thrill someone who had authentic food in India 
30342 Authentic Italian food at a GREAT price, huge portions, on-line ordering, and they DELIVER!!! 
30343 I went in for the first time for a simple man's cut. My stylist Crystal did a great job cutting my hair. I really love how much attention she puts in cutting my hair. Will definitely come again. 
30344 Amazingly fresh food, friendly, patient and knowledgeable staff: this new place is sure to be a staple in the DP area. 
30345 Love the burgers, fries and shakes. Can't wait for the Westlake location to open up, I will be a regular. If i could have only one burger place the rest of my life it would be hat creek, keep up the great food! 
30346 I love Italian food and the meals I have had here are somewhat unmemorable. Portions are large. If you go with a large group, and you are more focused on the people you are with, and want large portions, Maggiano's is a good call, otherwise, go to the North End. 
30347 We do take out and it is always delicious!! They even give plenty of bread and oil with the spices. The prices are fair and staff friendly. 
30348 This is a great Thai food restaurant. It is almost always busy. Portland is full of Thai food places, but this is for sure one of the better spots. I recommend going here when you have a Thai food urge. 
30349 Fresh food & delicioso desserts + great wine list. Best salads and empanadas .. It's a cozy little place that doesn't take reservations - I love the staff - never rush you to get out. 
30350 Tried it for the first time on Taco Tuesday. Great deal. For $2.50 tacos don't expect gourmet but they are tasty and filling. Also had the guacamole and a "Naked" margarita - both outstanding. Happy to welcome them to the neighborhood 
30351 Sandwich in a crepe? Yes. It works! I had a roast beef and it was excellent. The meat, cheese and vegetables, which were marinated in an amazing dressing (could stand on their own) were all good. Everything is fresh! The dessert crepes are excellent too. 
30352 Great spot for a low-key but delicious lunch or dinner. $4.99 specials on Monday and Wednesday for chicken and vegetarian momos, respectively. The staff is very polite. 
30353 Great people, great food, great restaurant. The portion size is just what the Dr. ordered. The owner is hilarious and always ensures his customers are taken cared of when he is in. Thank you for being 30 minutes from where I live. 
30354 Amazing! Best pizza ever, and the muscles app is one of my most favs! I go all the time and I am Never disappointed ! 
30355 By far one of the best food truck in town!!!!! Clean, fast and very friendly!!! Awesome customer service!!! My favorite is the Toston burger, mofongo de yucca with the chicharon de pollo!!!! I would eat here everyday!!!! You must try!!! 
30356 My favorite pho place in town. We went for dinner on a Friday night and got seated right away and the food came out very quickly. 
30357 Probably the best store bought Jamaican food i've had in the area. Somewhat pricy but they give you a huge amount of food. Unless you're just looking to gorge yourself, the medium plate is way more than enough. 
30358 I had the loveliest time this past Saturday working with Lucinda. She made the process stress-free, pleasant and so fun! I ended up with a dress completely different than I had envisioned and I couldn't be happier. Thank you for the best day! 
30359 nothing special i ordered coconut slush seems like a good place to hangout for highschool students reasonable prices 
30360 This is the best Thai in atlanta. Authentic this spices and family owned by people from Thailand 
30361 Best experience ever!!!!! The man who took care of me was so sweet and patient I would ask for him! Abdul-Hakim!! He is the man! 
30362 Very fresh ingredients, though a bit expensive for what you get. I think the pricing reflects the place's past success. To go from hungry to full for a guy, you're dropping $12-14. 
30363 Soooo delicious. Their golden rolls are so good that my friend and I got an order to go for a snack later. They have a pretty huge menu so I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more stuff!! while ordering the golden rolls again, of course. 
30364 an absolutey fantastic park with lots of sea animal shows and realy fantastic rides and thrills. it is very clean and the staff are really friendly. it is really good to go to with the whole family and you will kalk out astonished...and wet!! 
30365 Simply the best barbershop in Portland. Super chill environment, have a beer or whiskey on them while you wait. Book with Alex and you won't be disappointed! 
30366 Don't go if you're not one of the known people. I was watching the giants game sitting at a high top 4 th quarter and the manager just changes the game and doesn't even bother to ask who is watching it. 
30367 Cornerstone was great! They were very quick, responsive and pleasant--I would definitely recommend them to friends. Ryan even came to our closing and explained a lot of the lending documents, which I found very helpful. 
30368 Great food and the tapas portions are perfect to share as well as enjoy for a small meal. Cauliflower was incredible as well as calamari. 
30369 The best cheeseburgers in the entire country. Don't be afraid to order just a single cheeseburger, even though it's not on the menu. 
30370 Great Place!The staff is knowledgeable and crafty about what they sell, what todays lighting companies offer and most of all reasonable people to deal with.A Boulder based company,you cant beat em. 
30371 Food is very flavourful and good portions but I only come a couple times a year. It's not good enough that I get cravings that make me willing to endure the lengthy waits, especially since you have to stand and can't nibble on anything the whole time! 
30372 Better than Torchy's and they have wonderful attitudes! You have to try the red velvet cake! 
30373 Booked this place and don't regret it! Very good service and food was excellent! Every picture I took taste as good as it looks. A must try restaurant if you haven't. I'll come again. Didn't have to wait either... 
30374 Coffe was smoking hot best donuts in east coast and bagels are freshest I ever had in my life. 
30375 Great frozen yogurt with mix-ins! I miss their old Brighton location by Chansky's where they also had wraps and other things to eat, but at least they have their great yogurt here! 
30376 It's a target! Not much else to say about it. Came in just the other day to look around and saw some cute things. A couple of skirts I was interested in didn't have my size, but there were a bunch of xs and xxl! 
30377 Excellent authentic Vietnamese food. Everything on the menu is delicious and the soup base on the pho is flavorful and not doused in MSG. This is definitely one of the better spots for a great bowl of pho in Vancouver and all the locals know about it! 
30378 Really good salad rolls with a tasty peanut sauce accompany the rolls. The pho is always to big for me to finish and I am always full by the time i try to get to the broth. 
30379 Delicious and fabulous! Ordered a meal from the prix fixe dinner menu. I would easily have paid twice as much for the same meal and thought it a bargain. 
30380 I went to this location for the 1st time yesterday not really knowing what I was walking into - but I was pleasantly surprised by the variety. The staff was friendly and they had the cutest clutches and bags starting from $8. 
30381 Friendly service and good prices on food and clean restrooms. The beer is what I like the best with many different types on tap. 
30382 Love this place. Nobody makes burgers better than Texans and nobody in Texas makes burgers better than Hopdoddy. Makes me homesick just to think about it. 
30383 You'll be awed by the number of pool tables and bowling alleys this place has, but on weekend evenings, it takes forever to snag even one of these. On weeknights, the place is nearly dead. They have an awful selection of beers on tap, but the food is decent. 
30384 About 12 of us went there today after church. Got excellent service from Nick. He did an outstanding job with everything from drinks, refils, appetizer, fries and our orders. It was really an enjoyable place for us to have lunch. Thanks Nick! 
30385 Legit Dominican Food very good. Neighborhood isn't the best but it's on a very busy street so I wouldn't worry about a thing. 
30386 The staff has gone above and beyond for us tonight. Manager Ross got us an unexpected upgrade to floor seats tonight which was more than appreciated. Awesome experience all around. 
30387 Will definitely be back. Espetinho, mandioca frita, churro and coxinha were all great. 
30388 Tai is great. It's a good idea to follow up with him to make sure your alterations get done, but he does great quality work and for a very good price. He's also a really nice guy. 
30389 Really delicious restaurant with friendly service. Had a few small plates, all were superb. The cocktails were great as well, and the ambiance is awesome. Not too loud, perfect for a date or business dinner. Well attended on a Monday night. Recommended. 
30390 The only place I have ever had your wine is at The Loyal Legion. It is fantastic! This will definitely be my go to for BBQing and warm summer days. Or if I'm just sick of drinking beer. Eventually I will make it down to visit the winery. 
30391 Great pizza. The food is quite tasty with high quality ingredients. Also, customer loyalty program is one of the best ones out there; you receive coupons for free pizza and other menu items throughout the year. If you choose to eat there the atmosphere is very nice and festive 
30392 This place disgusts me and I'd give them 0 stars if I could. The crowd is unpredictable and the staff are unfriendly. You're better off going to Pour House next door where the crowd is more fun, the staff are friendlier/more inviting, and there's a dance party downstairs. 
30393 I can't believe I drove past this place for years and never tried it. Delicious. Fast. Cheap. 
30394 ONE OF BEST AND MOST FUN THINGS I HAVE EVER DONE!!! Reason why,well they are very challenging and fun to do and the stories are great. 
30395 Just got my oil changed by these guys last Thursday afternoon. They were extremely friendly/ patient with my lack of car knowledge and my oil change was completed in under 10 minutes! Will definitely be back in the future! 
30396 We went back to Maggiano's on our recent trip to Boston. Service was a little better, but the large groups get most of the attention. Again, food was very good, but we won't be back due to service. 
30397 Cheapest and best tasting food. $12.99 per person for the buffet on the weekends?! Delicious and very affordable. Bring the fam and eat it up! 
30398 Aaaaahhh.... My girls and I dedicated a day of our 3-day trip to Portland to loving our skin at Marywynn's spa. As always, we came out feeling so relaxed and our skin looked great for days! 
30399 I never miss the other 500 calories I would be getting in another restaurant. There is a simple brilliance in the cooking at Seasons 52. For spicy food fans, the chicken relleno is spy-C! Yum. Excellent place for a business lunch. 
30400 An extra star now that I've had the steak tips dinner!! Also, if you buy just a slice it seems to be more delicious than what you get on a full pizza. Dunno why, maybe they use better cheese for slices? 
30401 Do not eat here!!! Worst food ever! Burnt bacon twice and burnt pancakes! How do you burn pancakes! 
30402 A bit over priced for "OK" sandwiches. I love small businesses and hole in the wall places, but there are much better places down the street to eat. Had both the Pork Belly and Meatball. Nothing worth telling your friends or family about. Sorry. 
30403 Fantastic little spot away from the hustle and bustle of Disney. Food was fantastic and they were very kid friendly. 
30404 Great Venezuelan food, and even more amazing service! Manager is so nice and the food is on point! If you haven't been yet do yourself a favor and try it! I recommend the steak arepa. We tried them all. And the chicha and the tres leche. And the tequeno. 
30405 Unbelievably delicious Mexican food. The only downer is that it'll cost you to get chips and salsa. However, the incredible entrees make up for it. The vegetarian enchiladas are simply to die for. 
30406 This isn't a Mickey Mouse restaurant. Myself and 3 other people went for dinner on a Friday night, everything was amazing. get the Pork Porterhouse you won't be disapointed. 
30407 I get the pastrami brisket (yep) every week or so, whenever I make it to the Cedar Park farmer's market. It's pretty amazing and my dog knows when it's in the refrigerator and won't leave it if she suspects I'm not giving her any. The regular brisket is awesome too. 
30408 I got a chicken rice lunch from hear a couple months ago. It was delicious. I liked it. Friendly crew too. 
30409 Stylists are competent & professional. They did not attempt to up sell me and my 11 year old son. We will definitely go back 
30410 Just went for drinks on a Thursday night. It was a cool vibe, great music. Friendly bartender. 
30411 Great Mexican food! Low price with great quality and quantity! However, those strong Spanish accent.... Really hard for me! 
30412 This place is great. The food is always excellent and the waitstaff is always extremely nice. They do get very very busy and the place is small so the noise level can get up there. Totally worth it though! I go here all the time. 
30413 The falafel here is the best in Boston, bar none. I haven't tried the shwarma yet, but I know I will be coming back for the falafel and hummus on the regular. Keep up the good work Chikchak. 
30414 Went there last week with friends - line moved really fast and we all agreed, incredible food for a fair price. What more could you want for a take out? Short of complimentary wine (like THAT would ever happen) I can't see how they could improve! 
30415 They served us half burnt scallion pancakes!! We were surprised to see such food served! Normally Korean food is served with lots of fresh side dishes but they were only giving us main dish! Very disappointed! Don't recommend! 
30416 I got my tinting done their and I love it!!! They were fast and Staff is friendly.I recommend them to everyone!! 
30417 Great service and very friendly! I was walking in with a very large box, and several small boxes on a hand truck. The employee came to the door to hold it open. It's the small things. 
30418 Sasha is fantastic! She was wonderful with my dog and I could tell he was happy spending time with her every day. I would highly recommend Sasha and her team to anyone looking for a dog walker! 
30419 LOVE JP! All the staff members I've met so far have been extremely nice. A tad expensive but the smoothies are high quality and very tasty. Plus, they usually have free samples in the fridge, which is nice. The kale chips are also delicious! 
30420 I always thought Main Street needed a great wine bar. A fun place to "wine down". It is here no need to travel to Portland. Al 
30421 Worst hamburger I've ever eaten. Run. Eat yesterday's Krystal burgers instead. The bun was hard as a rock - crispy and crumbly. The meat was frozen bubba burger from WalMart. Had pretzels that were good, and previously frozen sweet potato tots. Run away. 
30422 Been there four times. Twice we had rude wait staff, inflexible and pompous. Especially the host. The menu is mediocre, bullfight has better tapas. Even the defunct Malaga was better. Really not sure why this place seems to be trendy right now there are way better options. 
30423 The best place for salad bar--EVER. Fresh veggies, 2 kinds of salad bars, sandwiches, falafel... just amazing. You could eat here every day and not get sick of it. Lots of seating. 
30424 Our son gave us a package of Wild Boar Sausage with Jalape√±o. WOW....if you like super-spicy - this is for you!! 
30425 Impeccable service and delicious food. Brasserie is the Balthazar of Boulder. Make sure you make reservations because starting at Happy Hour, 1010 is booked 
30426 Love this place!!! The food, service and atmosphere are so great! Get the power bowl for lunch or an egg croissant for breakfast you won't be disappointed! 
30427 S-L-O-W service. Many empty tables and waitstaff in no hurry to seat a bunch of waiting patrons. Food is nothing but marginal. Better off eating at Petite Provence or Tin Shed. This place is totally underwhelming! 
30428 Paramount was packed - so we tried this place for lunch. Meh. It's a bar. Standard boston bar. Food was standard bar food - beer selection was standard. Overall - standard. 
30429 Absolutely delicious! I had the chicken and waffle and fried buffalo cauliflower. It was wonderful. So glad to have another great vegan option in Atlanta. Would highly recommend to anyone! 
30430 Western US consignment store. Lots of great recycled clothes here. Great place to find vintage t-shirts and other kitschy clothes- most under 15$ 
30431 Really excellent, sincere food - neighborhood Italian plus plus, contemporary, and very reasonable prices. Fast, friendly service. Kids meals are excellent (and really good value). Brussel sprouts amazing. Great thin wood-fired pizza, nice pastas, good desserts. Definitely will come again. A real gem. 
30432 I stubbled upon this place.... great find... small plates.. family style dinning... delicious food... great service... get the lamb... it was my favorite:) 3 meats, a salad and mushrooms... so 5 plates was a great amount for two people... also self serve coffee... I love that:) 
30433 Convenient location downstairs at Pointe Orlando. Very classic feel, amazing, professional staff. The food: delicious!! Good sized (large) portions, lots of flavor. Good for business meals, romantic dinner, etc. 
30434 Needed links taken out of my new watch, they took me as a walk in, fixed my watch in 3min, and didn't overcharge me. Great price! Great service! 
30435 The food wasn't bad the customer service however was horrible. I went by myself and was not acknowledged for the longest. Good food but Ghetto fabuloso 
30436 We eat here regularly and have ordered close to everything on the menu, and all the items have been delicious. The alfredo and bolognese are exceptional. 
30437 Really amateur work. Better off hiring a college design student for better results at a better price, which is what we ended up doing after they did a brochure for us. If these other reviews aren't fake, these people are severely out of touch with what constitutes professional design. 
30438 We are back, we liked their cakes so much we decided to get three for our wedding. Cakes were made on time and everyone loved it. Thanks again 
30439 +1 for the best carne asada I've had in the PCNW. I think they need to amp up their tortillas a bit, but they are on to something with this asada! 
30440 These guys know what they are doing. They have great food, awesome bold flavored and great service. The shawarma is wonderful, the spicy chicken is awesome too. You can call ahead and go. 
30441 Excellent customer service. Very responsive. I have these guys for my quarterly service but they are always there when I need them. I wouldn't go with anyone else. 
30442 Great place to stop by for a beer. Good selection of newspapers to ogle. Never that crowded. Food selection is a little sparse. 
30443 Stylist Isabelle never disappoints. She is great at cut, color, and style which is rare to find someone who can do it all! 
30444 I go to the classes here and they're amazing. They have so many: yoga, barre, pound, strength, HIIT, cycling, etc. It's a really nice facility, the staff is friendly, and the instructors give you a great workout. 
30445 Beautiful and delicious food. Good service. Cozy atmosphere. A bit more expensive than I expected from the $$ rating, but enjoyed it very much. Refreshing to have a new/unfamiliar cuisine. 
30446 I enjoy their lunch specials, they are great. The fish selection on the counter looks limited in variety compared to H Mart. They are good quality but just limited number of selections. 
30447 Great place for massage! Not too crowded, not many people in there at the time I visited. Really got a chance to relax and enjoy the massage! Will definitely visit again 
30448 Awesome pizza! Great happy hour deal too. They should serve beer by noon though on the weekend. 
30449 Very nice hotel. Very clean rooms and common areas. The staff are also incredibly knowledgeable and helpfu. 
30450 Nicest and most professional people ever! Especially their engineers, who go out of their way to ensure your tracks turn out flawless. Book with Dan, he's the best. 
30451 Great addition to the neighborhood. Interesting, yummy, and feel-good brunch options! Nice atmosphere. Pretty good coffee. Definitely in my top 3 brunch spots in Cambridge. 
30452 The best onion rings on this planet....amazing!! I actually just went for the onion rings and a glass of wine (I know that sounds crazy!) Believe me, you will dream about these! 
30453 A rainy night spent at this cozy stop, again. tried my favorite bourbon with the smokey ice cube, nice! The bread pudding was fantastic, burger yummy, music the best. always happy we stopped, rarely disappointed. 
30454 I wasn't impressed by this barbecue, reminded me of a generic type of barbecue chain. 
30455 Amazing crust, fantastic marinara sauce - my son could not stop talking about the sausage. Service was friendly and quick. Yum. 
30456 Engineers gone wild!!!! At least that's how I felt while I was there. I still can't believe I got to tour a real submarine....amazing. Can't wait to go back. 
30457 Great food- Great service- Great chef- It's around the corner of Harvard ave. kinda hard to find but easy to tell their food is super fresh. Gotta try their korean style course menu. 
30458 10/10 would eat again. Had two pizzas delivered from Favor and it was delicious. Have really been wanting to make it by the truck in person, but glad I've had it anyway! When I do visit in person I'm hoping to get the Pizza/Ravioli split between the two trucks. Yumm 
30459 Amazing place! Great wine, food and service. Tapas style plates, employees are very well educated on the menu. 
30460 Excellent way to relax and create! Place is packed, make sure you have a reservation. 
30461 Tried a couple of sliders here after taking our dogs to the river at oak park. Both very tasty, will try them again to taste some more choices. 
30462 Sugar and sass. Thank you, Boston Tea Stop, for being open fairly late at night. And for having sassy (sassy-interesting, not sassy-rude) service.I recommend the hot Jasmine milk tea. With boba, of course. 
30463 Chicken wings are the bomb diggity!! Tastes just like the ones at Phnom Penh in Chinatown. Boyfriend says its even better ;) Why wait in line when you can get them at Angkor too? 
30464 Loved this place. The food was awesome! Went early for happy hour. We will def be back again soon. Only bad thing was it was really hot in there. 
30465 We really enjoyed it and will come back again. We had the Cuban sandwich, an empanada sampler and a pollo entree that I can't remember the name for. All were good! 
30466 Soooo good! Wife and I had chili dog, smokeshack burger, fries, Anita root beer and Apple Pie ala mode shake! Everything was so amazing. I'm stuffed and happy. Will be back soon. 
30467 don't get the hype.. not very traditional chinese dishes nor are they very tasty. may go try again some day but for now, not impressed. 
30468 Tour is ok, I think they water it down a bit to cram you into the bar area for the samples, but I assume that is why most people go anyway. Great idea for a thing to do with the folks when they visit. 
30469 This place is great! Been going for about 10 months and honestly the food seems better just within the last couple months. YUMMMMM!!! 
30470 Not a wine drinker, place is packed. Had seafood dinner and good pistachio crusted grouper, asparagus, mashed potato. 
30471 Chips and salsa, Fantastic! Service, fantastic!! Pork carnitas and chicken enchiladas and chicken chimys you guessed it, fantastic! 
30472 Ate at the one in Terminal A. The employees are so nice. I was traveling with my 8 month old son and was lugging his 40lb. carseat around, and the employee who helped me was very kind. Minus a star because the spicy chicken patty was pretty burnt. 
30473 unbelievable. called them 3 times for delivery. each time I was greeted unprofessionally and ridiculed. I don't know if the number was changed or what. 
30474 Dr. Whitman was referred by a good Dentist friend for oral surgery to extract a broken tooth. Great staff and very very little discomfort. Would recommend to my patients and 5 stars! 
30475 Very good lightly breaded fried shrimp along with good sides. My grandson loved their 6 cheese mac and cheese. Very reasonable prices. 
30476 A warm welcome awaits as you are welcomed into this cosy sushi spot from all waitstaff and sushi chefs. Food is fresh, prompt and delightful. The only downside I found was a little delay refilling water on the table. Will be back for sure! 
30477 The staff was very warm. The spa is clean and relaxing without being pretentious. I had a massage with Diane and a facial with Robert. Both therapists listened to my concerns and were more than accommodating to my comfort. Can't wait to go back! 
30478 Large selection of cuisines, but you have to be at the Home Depot HQ to access it. The staff is friendly, but the decor leaves a little to be desired. If you work at HD it is a solid choice. 
30479 Oh my lantaaaa! Get the Ham and Cheese Croissant. It's a game changer. Absolutely delicious, flaky and gooey, with just enough of each ingredient. You'll love it 
30480 I liked this place. I don't live to far from them and stopped by to get a new chain and a couple of tools for my Fuji. The salesman was very nice and helpful. I will definitely go here again in the future. Thanks! 
30481 Feta fire! This is one of my favorite things. Try it on the pita nachos. The fries are awesome. Only negative is that the last two times I've tried to call ahead for carry out no one answered the phone. 
30482 Always quick and nice employees. Also provide minor parts to get your vehicle to inspection standards at a reasonable price. Always take my vehicles here- will never go anywhere else!! 
30483 This hotel is awesome! I loved our room. The bed was soooo amazingly comfortable. Just the overall place is very well kept. The only issue I have is the parking. It's such a far walk from the hotel to the parking lot. Other than that, I would stay there again. 
30484 You'll always see an interesting crowd on this corner of Mass and Columbus but Ruth S is right, in a neighborhood that is sorely lacking for good 'za by the slice, New York Pizza is a welcome spot. Good wings too. 
30485 Wow no words to describe. Price is reasonable. Huge amount of food on most of the plates. Great service plus waitress was beautiful lol. Total package very relaxing. Might be deceiving since every time I come is not too busy but u have to try it. 
30486 Very Good Taiwanese style bakery. Very different style compared to other backeries around Chinatown- which are more hong kong style. I bought a case of moon cake as a gift to my family and all of us like it very much! 
30487 Falafel wrap was good. I had the vege kibbe - it was interesting with spinach on the inside, but seemed like heavy deep fry on the outside which made it less interesting. Very clean seating area and bathroom. Quite impressive for mediterranean place. 
30488 excellent personal service and the very best clam chowder we've EVER had. they have they own recipe and it's fantastic!! the manager was super friendly and very very nice! 
30489 Absolut √ºberragend! Besonderer Vorzug: Der Military Discount. Freundlicher Service und immer f√ºr einen kleinen Spa√ü zu haben. Sowohl der Kobe-Burger als auch der Bison-Burger waren jeden einzelnen Dollar wert. Doppelte Gin-Tonic ohne Eis ist zudem auch noch ein guter Begleiter des Abends. W√ºrde ich dort wieder hingehen? Auf jeden Fall! 
30490 I love this local treasure! The owner is very knowledgeable and has helped me with my cat's various issues. Her recommendations are always valuable and much appreciated. Much better than a big box pet store!!!! 
30491 I always order their deep fried squid (better than night market) and congee (you can choose between two sizes -- ones massive, to share). They serve a decent serving of the meat and rice combo and they have my fave hainanese chicken! 
30492 I'm Chinese and I've had steamed buns my whole life and I don't know how to appreciate this "Filipino" bao bakery. I think all their baos (including their popular deluxe one, balo balo) basically taste like all the other baos I've had my whole life. 
30493 I went to Palas to sell some items. The ladies were very nice & it's a cute space. The lady that worked with me was very good about explaining the different metals to me & I felt was very honest with me about my best options. 
30494 Well they're trying. But not getting it. Food was very sugary, experimental at best. Staff were good and attentive. Value, based on the food, so-so. Perhaps I didn't have the 'right' dishes, but there's nothing I saw or experienced that would compel me to come back. 
30495 Stopped in for a quick bite. It was a hot day so I tried the ahi poke taco and it was PERFECT with lettuce instead of tortilla. The poke was fresh and the seaweed was seasoned well. It was the right balance of protein and greens. Wish I ordered TWO 
30496 What a good burger with a modern, casual atmosphere. We ordered at the counter and had our food in 10 minutes. The Front Porch and Lockhart Legend burgers were fantastic. The kid burger was just the right size and they offer apples with it too! Loved the toasted buns! 
30497 One of the best breakfasts I have ever had. Ordered Benedict duo and blackberry pancakes. Just wow!!! 
30498 This is my go to place for noodle soup. Everything on the menu is tasty. Like: fried chicken, noodle soup, fish fillet, seafood hot pot, every thing on the menu!!! Not like: cash only, place could use some new decor, always crowded. 
30499 Its big, and the lanes are really good. Also, there's a large space for a large party. But I really don't like the food there. And its not cheap. 
30500 Great service. A nice fellow helped me figure out how to power an old imported pedalboard and Jerry rigged a functional supply. Will return! 
30501 I used to work very close to this location. They water down drinks, and have lack-luster quality. Applebee's isn't known to be outstanding, but it seems they take advantage of the fast business crowd in the area. 
30502 This hotel has the friendliest staff ever! I am probably misspelling her name but Nadelja Adero (sp?) is so kind. The hotel is fine, but the staff really make it great! 
30503 Great brunch ... I had the oyster sandwich on a ciabatta bread 
30504 Very fresh and delicious 
30505 Everything is locally sourced so the menu can change from time to.time 
30506 Really good rock shrimp, very reasonable price. Convenient as a lunch-time stop on way home from Orlando. 
30507 It's a chain. You know what you're getting into when you sit here. Yes, order extra cheese or meat for your pizza because it will be portion controlled. 
30508 Good food and long lines. Definitely try this place out. The wraps and the salads are very good, as are the smoothies. 
30509 Excellent pizza, great 'gourmet' toppings. They don't take reservations, and with their small dining room and excellent food it can get a little crowded in there. Prepare to wait a bit to get seated if you come with a group and it's meal time. 
30510 Jason, the mixologist at the bar had a really fun custom drink program. I just called to make sure he was going to be there for my friends next week and I learned he left. Jason - where did you go?? 
30511 We were here for the Pinning Ceremony for our daughter's graduation from the GSU School of Nursing - so of course I had to give it 5 stars ! 
30512 Great sushi! I recommend the double spicy salmon roll. It's delicious! The vegetable tempura is great too-came out hot and crispy. 
30513 Came here Friday night around 9 pm. Awesome live music that started around 10 pm. We didn't have to pay a cover fee since we came early. Would definitely recommend for a Friday or Saturday night, super fun! I didn't get food, only beer but it was definitely priced well. 
30514 Awesome! Helped brighten my friends day today! Lots of fun choices to choose from! They delivered same day and it was only $12 for delivery! Thanks guys! 
30515 The place is small and was very crowded. The food is so so good!! Best soul food in Atlanta 
30516 Our waitress Jackie was not very customer friendly to us but the food made it a place to return 
30517 This is the best farmers market I've been to. Foodthemes? Samples? Free coffee from Ula? Right down the hill from me? Indoors? Definitely spend your money here. 
30518 I ordered the beef tacos (pretty basic of me) and did not regret it one bit! The beef tacos are amazing and seasoned well. Definitely recommend this spot! The price is very reasonable. 
30519 When they first open they was great! But for the last 2 times I been here they kept messing up my order which is a simple venti passion tea sweeten..... 
30520 Best frozen yogurt place in Portland! You can be super simple or crazy and creative here. Something for every taste. 
30521 Convenient and the doctors I've seen here have all been great. Urgent care was compassionate and a comfortable waiting area. Not the ritz but more than I'd expect in the Vancouver area. Convenient location and my go-to medical spot in the area for my son and I. 
30522 No better dentist. Super professional and effective and mercury free. Gone through a few dental emergencies in the past few years and he and his staff have always been super responsive. Highly recommended. 
30523 Great restaurant!!! Wonderful,varied selections --interesting combinations and beautifully presented!!! Great service, atmosphere, and delicious!!! 
30524 This place is dope. They give you like 6 different salsas with your chips. Everything I have tried here has been great 
30525 Not only is Jessica amazingly competent on everything from the computer to the garage, but she is fast and makes intelligent decisions. She is willing and able to do everything and anything and is a delight to work with. Sheila H. 
30526 I absolutely LOVE the BBQ here. Its got a great flavor to it. The owner Chris and his staff are very friendly and welcoming, I go in for great food and great conversation. This is my BBQ joint!! 
30527 This was next door to the salon I was visiting. I ordered the shrimp fried rice combo and it was loaded! I wasn't expecting so much. I always enjoy the peach drink that they offer. 
30528 The place where it all started and now the place where they test new flavors and styles. Voluntary $2 suggested donation that goes to local charities. Free beer at the end of the tour. Walking distance from the T. Seriously, go, it's awesome. 
30529 This is a typical higher-end tourist place at Downtown Disney. The food is good, not great, but good. It's simply overpriced and overly busy. 
30530 Excellent dinner. Meat was cooked as ordered and very well priced. The desert was yummie as suggested by our server, ebony. Service was friendly and very helpful. Ebony was nothing but fantastic! 
30531 Favorite for Brunch, lunch, and dinner. Service is always the best. Attention to detail, flawless! Selections, typical French flair and preparation. Chicken, salads, beignets, ooh la la. It's all good. Great seafood too. 
30532 The staff and service here were great! The food was top notch. The salad bar was still very fresh at 9 PM. I was really impressed by this place for a chain restaurant. The asian dumplings are great! 
30533 We ordered the steak frites, beef dip, and chicken fingers. The husband's steak was really tender, and my beef dip was yummy. My daughter really loved the chicken fingers and the fresh raspberries in the fruit cup. Our waitress was really great too! 
30534 Very unique experience and super fun. A must-visit in Boston. We ordered a variety of food and everything was delicious. The service was also excellent! 
30535 The afternoon tea was divine. Good service and mesmerizing setting. I like how the waiter walked through the process in a professional manner to truly bring the essence of high tea culture to the table. 
30536 Went for lunch today- cool space and great burger! Enjoyed my experience. Fun place to eat and good food. 
30537 had their donut hole, they are pretty good. I also had their inner child but my friend was disgusted by the fact that it has colostrum so i couldn't drink it... 
30538 Customer service was great along with the food. Parking is a challenge but it's worth it. I love the option to get drinks reordered right from the table without having the server hover around 
30539 Got a groupon weekend brunch deal. Fantastic service. Love the fresh ingredients. They took us to their 2nd floor where it has more space and awesome decor. I had lavender latte for the first time and it was heaven. Overall, I had a fun time with my boys and husband. 
30540 I've been going here for about 15 years. Consistantly the best bubble tea in town. Lychi Slush is awesome 
30541 Wonderful experience, beyond satisfied! Beautiful, clean grooming salon, kind and courteous staff. Handmade dog treats , eco friendly care products, and tons of accessories. Personally welcomed and thanked by the owner! Great Job, My dog is Gorgeous and I will definitely return ! 
30542 happy hour nachos 3$ 22 oz. samuel smith for 5$ a back patio that rules the school and the beautiful chorus of the nearby trains. yes please! 
30543 The duck salad is so delicious. Vermicelli bowl with grilled pork is good too, but the noodles are a little bit undercooked. Vietnamese fried chicken platter is yummy as well. 
30544 This was my favorite antique store in Concord. Lots of fun stuff, most things reasonably priced, lots of great supplies for projects. Things were well displayed and labelled. A wonderful place to go to bury yourself in paper ephemera and vintage rings. 
30545 Best pedicure ever! Tina is very good. I did not have to wait and she took her time. 
30546 great in service, i need to run to work and they quickly make my peppermint hot chocolate for me. 
30547 Not gonna lie, food was delicious. On the otherhand the lady who took my order was extremely rude and made me feel very unwelcomed. 
30548 So excellent I returned a few days later. Ordered tacos de Caritas - so delicious! A house specialty. Meat so tender and loved the cheese. Also, the chips are thin / crisp and the salsa is great. And the caramel cheesecake is the BEST! 
30549 As of 8/16 it still was not open and did not look close to doing so. Something appears to be holding them up because the hiring sign is still hung on the door. 
30550 Delicious!! Had to get back to eating healthy so I ordered the Carnitas Bowl and Survival Kit smoothie. So so good! And the price was so reasonable. I only paid $14 for the meal! A definite to come back to. 
30551 Tacos were delicious the beer was cold and the atmosphere was awesome. Great service with great food. Can't beat that! 
30552 We shared the asparagus wrap, grilled octupus & squid, lobster fra diavolo, gnocchi bolognese, veal porterhouse w/ rabe and lobster roll. Well executed and presented food. Great service. 
30553 Great place for really good take out! I love the salt & pepper shrimp! It is amazing!!! The staff is always friendly & the prices are extremely fair. You get a lot of quality food for the $$$. 
30554 This place is very charming and in a great neighborhood. I know I can always count on a tasty breakfast here! 
30555 Some of the other Ethiopian restaurants in the area get all the notoriety, but this place is definitely a gem. The food is moderately priced and the portions are hearty; I ordered fir fir for breakfast and I had enough left over to have with dinner. 
30556 I've been here a few times, and had a good experience every time! Love the unique menu, Asian tacos?!? Yum... Good value too, they have a $5 daily lunch special that has yet to disappoint me. 
30557 This place is nice. The staff is friendly, the food is good, and it's conveniently located near PCC's Rock Creek campus, making it a good place to stop after class for a bite to eat or a drink with classmates. 
30558 Awesome work and fast Took my ugly clown orange shoes and made them dark brown love them now 
30559 Jaho has Great selection of coffee and the ambiance of the place is great to get work done. Will made my latte perfectly and topped it off with a beautiful heart. Stopping here for a coffee is definitely a must. 
30560 Wow! Amazing coffee! I ordered Hazelnut latte and I'm in love. Will be back for more. 
30561 Good food. Easy atmosphere. Playscape for the littles. Big grass area to run/play. Turkey Almond Salad...thumbs up. Cesar Salad....thumbs up. Kids LOVED the pizza. The kids pizza was big enough for them to even share! 
30562 Well worth the ride. The eggplant appetizer was fantastic. The wheat pasta w/ butternut squash, peas, and mozzarella was surprisingly really good. Wish they had beer on tap but no big deal, the sangria was good. Service was top notch. 
30563 Awesome, surprisingly large portions for a deli place. Staff very friendly and nice hometown feel. 
30564 Great tapas and nice atmosphere next to the waterfront 
30565 I love the octopus dish here ,it's a must try! 
30566 Best Asian food we've found in Austin for great prices!! Get the appetizer sampler. Love when they have live music, too. 
30567 I took our Shipooh to Deena at D'Tails and she did an amazing job. It was money well spent! I could totally tell the difference between a $40 grooming visit and a $65 visit. You pay for what you get, and we will definitely be coming back. Thank You, KSD 
30568 Horrible McDonalds. Something is seriously wrong here. The staff is incompetent. 20 mins wait times for crappy service and bland food. 
30569 Best hotel not only in Orlando but in America. Very personalized for each guest individually. Everybody is very kind and helpful. The best room service I've ever had. Ravello is by far the best restaurant in Florida excellent food and service. 
30570 Stopped in after a long flight into Atlanta because it was walking distance from our hotel and we couldn't have been more pleased. Absolutely delicious drinks (try the bullfighter), exceptional service from our server Grace, and every plate was rich and satisfying as Spanish cuisine should be. 
30571 This place used to hold slaves, and if that isn't enough, a prostitute died here along with a child (who's now a notorious ghost). Enjoy your meal. Food's pretty good 
30572 I just thought the burger was just ok.... I bought the double burger. I can't put my finger on it but something tasted wrong on that burger. I think it was the bacon. I ended up picking it off of my burger. 
30573 The broth here is amazing. I'm not crazy about the thin noodles they use, so I only ate a third of the noodles, but I slurped every drop of the incredibly robust-full-bodied flavored broth. Friendly service. 
30574 2 tacos for $7 is not exactly cheap and these tacos did not blow me away. The picadillo was fine and so was the steak. I left feeling full and my belly was satisfied. Will I crave these tacos? Definitely not. 
30575 Handy Electrician and Percy was incredible! He was on time and did the job in a timely manner! Very trustworthy and affordable. He is coming back next week to do another project for me... Will use him agin and again! 
30576 Everyone is very welcoming and Gia did a great job on my gel manicure and best foot forward pedicure. I brought 2 friends and we had a little birthday party while everyone was having their services-a great atmosphere for this. 
30577 Mojo's is great. I can hang with my pooch on the patio. Service is great, staff is friendly, food is awesome. Turkey Bourbon sandwich is killer, pizza is always fantastic. 
30578 This place keeps getting better! Great food! Great happy hour and great brunch... Great Pig Benedict #pig #benedict #eggsbenedict #rockcreek #rockcreekcorner #brunch #eggs #siracha #spicy #pulledpirk #amazing #Great Job @rockcreekcorner #yummy 
30579 Nice spot to grab a late breakfast! Like 4 pm! They make there own Chai too! Nice folks too! 
30580 Service isn't great and the food is so-so. I'd go back if I happened to be in the area. 
30581 Pretty good. The man is friendly and the bubbles are perfect. Price is great. Lots of specials on the menu but still it's easy to read and order. He gave us a sample of the avocado ice cream and it was really nice. 
30582 Without a doubt the best shopping carts ever! They're super smooth, steer in a straight line and out in the parking lot you can get up to like 20 miles per hour in them. 
30583 the food and the service were both fantastic! I had the spinach and cheese ravioli, they were great and the sauce they were in was even better! Luis was our server and he was fantastic, very attentative and polite, I would definately recommend it! 
30584 The perfect old-school hole-in-the-wall sandwich shop, somehow still situated in the middle of water st., with patio seating, and a fantastic view of the mountains and burrard inlet. And trains! What more could you ask for??? 
30585 This place is amazing. The pita bread is baked perfectly, the salads are fresh, and the lamb is tender and juicy. The older lady that works there is like a grandmother. She was super nice and brought me free beignets every time I went! 
30586 Been here twice, both times had to wait almost 2 hours for pizza slices on nights that weren't even busy. No excuse for this. Pizza was tasty for sure, but this is unacceptable. Will never go back. 
30587 Staff is friendly. This place like many of this franchise is way over priced. Blood stains in the crotch of a pair of $40 jeans. I would prefer goodwill or even Ross at that point. 
30588 Really good food, great pricing, minimal design, good staff Place is also clean and very well positioned 
30589 Legit food. Definitely going back. Avocado salmon toast was the bomb, and the specialty drinks were also superb. 
30590 Very good food! My fiancee and I both had the fried haddock and fries. Everything was delicious including the hush puppies and cole slaw. The waiter was very cool. Overall, a nice place to have some seafood. 
30591 Before even eating the food, the owner is friendly, knowledgeable, obviously puts his heart into his cooking! And I am 1000% sure the food will be amazing! It smells amazing! Go go go! 
30592 A bit dingy and baristas have gotten rude. Hipsters Only 
30593 This is not an authentic Malaysian restaurant. It has been fusionized heavily to cater to a wider demographic. However with that said the food is still pretty decent but as a Malaysian the flavor did not fall inline with what I'm traditionally accustomed to. 
30594 Chef Gil catered a wedding I coordinated. The food was amazing! The steak, chicken, asparagus-everything was delicious. The staff was both extremely helpful and professional. I will highly and gladly recommend them! 
30595 So fun. Great comedians and the service was quick. Decent drink selection and yummy nachos. 
30596 The combination fried rice is really good. Be sure to try the spicy version, the Creole/Cajun in me loves the flavor. 
30597 Why I love it: Basic burger is 5 dollars. Best Burger Ever is 7 bucks, and it has GOAT CHEESE on it. Live Oak in a kings cup Maine Root Beer Fluffy, delicious fresh baked buns that make the whole place smell kind of like pancakes. Cool atmosphere. 
30598 EXCELLENT!!! First time trying hookah and it was great. Cool, laid back, upscale crowd. The owner came over to meet my husband and I and continuously checked on us. Food and drinks were great. Definitely going back. 
30599 What an incredible find! This small restaurant provides amazingly flavorful food. The fried green tomatoes were some of the best I have ever tasted. And the pork tasted like it was slow-cooked at home by a Latina grandmother. Highly recommended! 
30600 Top Barber!!! What you get here is a great haircut, time and time again. I'm a regular customer 3+ years. He runs an efficient shop. Miguel is friendly and a top professional. Prices are fair, too!!! 
30601 Visited on a recent business trip and loved this place. Great vibe, incredible food and service. This is a must visit for me again! 
30602 Great momos! It really takes the taste buds back home once I bite into the chicken momos. The noodles are the next best thing on the menu in my opinion. Don't forget to over-drink the awesome chai available for free while you wait for all the deliciousness! 
30603 I'm a tourist. Pros: stairs, views of the river and downtown, little trails. Cons: parking, no wheelchair/ disabled access that I saw, crowded, maybe stairs if you aren't active. Would def return if I'm back in town. 
30604 Me and my wife been looking forward to some fried chicken all week and Gus's came thru in the clutch. Some of the best chicken I ever had 
30605 Bought some of their Kombucha at the farmer's market in Boulder on Saturday, we ended up picking the pineapple flavor. Tasted great! Went a few days later to refill our little growler at Rayback Collective. 
30606 This place is so amazing! The food is so good ! The service was so amazing! The food was great and the cook was amazing ! The best restaurant in Atlanta!! 
30607 Great Dinner. Chef was very interacting. Food was wonderful and tasty. They give you soooo much food. This restaurant deserves 5plus stars. 
30608 The best ramen in Portland so far. They serve whole egg!!! And if there's photo in the menu, you know it will be awesome. I'm recommending the killer ramen! 5 stars! 
30609 Dropped in while in town from Phoenix.... Dane, the instructor, was super helpful! Everyone was welcoming and supportive. The workout was challenging and was just what we needed! The facility was awesome with more than enough equipment for everyone. I will definitely come back next time I'm in town! 
30610 This was my first time there and thought they an acceptable job with my clothes. Although I got my clothes back and they seemed a little more wrinkled and places I've gone to before have done a good job ironing my clothes for me before I picked them up. 
30611 24-Hour service on the inside only but the drive thru not open for some reason unbeknown to the customer with no sign or anyone working on the inside having l the common courtesy to tell the line of people that your drive thru is closed. 
30612 I'm from San Francisco and I have lived in India and the Vijs is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to the nique dishes with an original flair but also of the spices of India delicious chai an amazing service so happy ate it for breakfast 
30613 First time here, loved it. Got the buffet to try everything. Favorites were sausage stew, Bahama Mama, and potato salad. Cream puff was delicious too. Excellent authentic German food. 
30614 Usually 4 or 5 excellent vegan options. Spicy tomato chutney is my fave. 
30615 Response to Brian's responsr: Brian, you forgot to mention that you were verbally abusive as well and then REFUSED to take payment. Worst. Customer. Service. Ever. 
30616 Worst ER I have ever been to. I would rather die on the way to Grady than deal with these clowns. 
30617 I bought a scale that wasn't calibrated correctly and instead of switching it out I now have to spend more and purchase a weight to calibrate my scale. Disappointed. 
30618 Very cute couple. Very sweet but prices are not listed. A friend of mine and I got similar haircuts at VERY different prices. Wasn't impressed by my first haircut, but decided to give another chance. I guess this sweet couple just wasn't right for me. 
30619 The concept of this restaurant is fantastic and should be commonplace in more cities. That said, various chefs' innovations are well-prepared and the offerings are diverse. 
30620 First time here for a routine eye exam for my daughter. I highly recommend this office! Dr. Don was excellent and thorough. The rest of the staff were very helpful and friendly. Thank you for a great experience! We will be back! 
30621 Sandwiches and pickles were really tasty. Side chips were all smushy and weird. Service was fairly poor and took quite a while to get our food on a slow Saturday afternoon. Environment was dirty/dingy. 
30622 Finally a Thai food place bear my house that I like that is almost as good as my favorite Thai in town. Red and green curries are really good. Staff is friendly, servings are large and wait wasn't bad. 
30623 Absolutely a great place to go out and watch a movie. Currently $2.50 per anyone over 13. Large soda and large popcorn or kettle corn, only....$6.50. So much cheaper than giant chain theaters. Cool nickel arcade too! 
30624 This is the best sushi place in Vancouver if you are looking for cheap casual sushi. Highly recommend trying the sashimi and spicy tuna roll. 
30625 My nail stylist was absolutely hilarious and fun to talk to. They were very fun and kind and my nails turned out flawless. I will definitely go back due to my experience and the cheap prices. I wish I could give it 6 stars!! 
30626 Hands down one of the best dining experiences I've had in Austin in the last 10 years. An assault on the senses. Spectacular service. Every dish was outstanding. An all around five star experience. 
30627 Had lunch here today and was very impressed. I had the smoked salmon bagel sandwich and my dining companion had the chicken salad sandwich. Both were excellent quality, freshly-prepared, and delicious! If this experience was any indication, the food here is really good. I'll be back. 
30628 I had a fantastic experience here. Hilary helped me find what I was looking for quickly and easily. They had plenty of options in my size, which is on the bigger end of things. The shop is beautiful and well organized. I will definitely be back! 
30629 So delicious! They have so many amazing options, I literally wanted to try everything but I finally decided on their zucchini pasta in a jar and it was out of this world! Definitely keeping this place in mind next time I'm in the Orlando area. 
30630 Showed up evening of 10/7/15 with 18 teens Pizza was great. Friendly staff more than willing to accommodate our wishes. Will definitely return. 
30631 I can't shake this place. Every time I crave Italian food, I want to make the long drive back out there and get some more of that wonderful Italian food. The bread and that dip, fantastic. The lasagna was SO good. Everything looked amazing, can't wait to go back! 
30632 A little pricey, but the food was delicious! Had an awesome waiter named Orion. And the belly dancer was cool too 
30633 So delicious! They have plenty of vegetarian options and the pan fried rice cakes were one of my favorites. The kimchi fried rice was also delicious. I will be returning. 
30634 Very nice atmosphere and we had great service. I did not dine... This time. The food looks and sounds amazing. 
30635 We had the salmon roll, crunch roll, tiger eye and shaggy dog. So amazing. Fresh. The shaggy dog was my favorite!!! 
30636 Pulled pork sandwich was awful. And the beans, oh my the beans were even worse. So much so that I won't be getting BBQ for awhile after this. Fries were good but that's about it. 
30637 This place is so good i can't even put it into words, but ill try. GET THE MANGO STUFFED FRENCH TOAST, it will change your life. Everything was delicious, and for not being a vegan myself, this is still some of the best food i've tried. vegan or not. 
30638 Seriously... What is the smell outside this place? It smells like a dead body trapped in a grease trap. 
30639 Was looking for an apartment in a rush. They helped me out in no time. Very professional, super nice, and made it so simple. Glad I found them. I will def use them again. 
30640 I was not impressed with the Pollo Picatta the breading was undercooked and the chicken was overcooked. Go figure. La Andanna is a much better choice for dinner. 
30641 We ordered the Italian fries bolo style and fried meatballs. It was excellent! The atmosphere was neat because it is also a market for Italian meats and cheeses. 
30642 Food is horrible. They were out of the first 3 things that I asked for off the menu. Ordered jerk tacos, horrible, shrimp tasted funny. Ordered spinach dip, dip was luke warm. Zucchini fritters was just ok, more batter then anything. Service was ok, nice decor. 
30643 If you have any dietary restrictions, you'll have to dig through several screens after booking to find the option to have a special meal on board. Otherwise they will literally have NO FOOD you can safely eat. This information will not be conveyed in any way before boarding the plane. 
30644 This place is by far he place to get records in Boston. If you're looking for metal, punk, hardcore, or indie LP's go to Armageddon. They have a bunch of 7 inches too! 
30645 People are in the habit of hating on Starbucks in general. Including myself. But I like this location, I've only experienced great, quick service and my drink and food are always what I expect. It's clean. It's consistent. It's good. 
30646 Delecious, fresh. Took the whole family, everyone ate. The sushi was sooooo good. And the prices and services was sooooo good, too. Yea! Got a good place northside. 
30647 Absolutely delicious! Taho was amazing. I don't what they they did but it's just perfect. 
30648 Great local for sea world. Corner JR suites rooms are HUGE. Love the open atrium hotel lobby and nice pool for kids. Great value and staff is very good. Especially the valet and bellman. 
30649 Both the fish taco and the steak taco were amazing here! The steak wasn't over cooked and tasted really good with the light green salsa that had a good kick to it. The fish taco had some chopped up mango pieces and it was super fresh! 10/10 recommend 
30650 Best pizza in Boston. Best cannolis I've ever had. They make all of their own cheese fresh daily, and it makes a difference. Wish it was open for lunch on weekdays. 
30651 Love the pitch and putt here, trails are lovely and not too long. On the far side near the stadium is a fabulous kids park with different areas appropriate for different age groups! 
30652 Great place to have some great New England food 
30653 Clam chowder was excellent also try the stuffed lobster with crabmeat. I suggest you go for lunch or be there before 5PM for dinner or you will be waiting for a while. 
30654 I love my friends at Starbucks in Salem! They take good care of me. They know my name, my favorite drink and are always positive and kind. If you've gotta get your caffeine fix, definitely go there! 
30655 They were alright! We got the blueberry one, the coco puff one and the "dirt" doughnut. It was decent but I mean ahh ‚Äç it was jut neat Bc of the variety 
30656 I went here on my 21st birthday with my family. It was such a great experience. We loved the Sangria and the paella seafood and Chicken paella. It was like being with family in Mexico. This was our first taste of paella and we loved it. 
30657 Great local place. Good subs and pizzas. Usually I come here for a decent weekend lunch. 
30658 Just throw mud on your car and save the $20.00 
30659 trust me the only thing you will notice is , you still have $20.00 in your pocket. 
30660 Very responsive and detail oriented. Also, we had several scheduling problems and they handled them well. I was most impressed with the prep, power wash, scrape and sand. 
30661 Decent stadium overall. The dome kills a lot of atmosphere though; however, it does retain more noise. Seats all have backs which is very comfortable. No legroom at all. 
30662 I love Bead Time!!!! I live in Jacksonville, but make the trip to shop here whenever I am in need of gemstones or wood beads. They have the best customer service & a wonderful selection! 
30663 I love whites so much! Worth every penny! I always get the tirimisu cakes, canolis, the ones with chocolate strawberries on them, just everything tastes good and fresh. Been going to this location and their Brockton location since I was a little kid. 
30664 Red robin is always delicious with a great menu. It is extremely kid friendly ad you don't have to worry about how loud they can be. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The honey mustard is by far the best I have ever had. 
30665 Still my favorite place to go. I keep telling them they should have another location in Boston. I want food delivered to my house in Boston too lol. C'mon but this is definitely the place for Haitian food with great presentation and awesome customer service. 
30666 Stumbled upon this amazing place on a Saturday morning, the people were amazing and the food beyond expectation! Loved them would drive out there in a heart beat to eat there again. 
30667 I think this place knows its stuff. It is a great pub. Food is creative pub fair and the drink specials are great too. Its hip and has a patio out front. A great addition to my neighbourhood. Try the deepfied pickles, they are delicious. 
30668 007 all the way!! So delicious! And I love that it's served chilled but because there is no ice, it never gets watered down! 
30669 I like that this location has a drive thru window. I enjoy their lunch & happy hour specials for sushi. the food is always quick and flavorful. I really enjoy their Chicken Tempura sushi rolls. 
30670 I'm usually annoyed by Restaurant-As-Performance-Art. But when it's laid-back, interesting and tasty I appreciate it. Great night out without breaking the bank (too much.) 
30671 Had a breakfast date with my 2 year old son on a Saturday morning - was super kid friendly and the coffee cake was amazing! 
30672 A quality boutique shopping experience for men. Nicely curated selection. Solid designer labels. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices. All within a Portland Victorian. Highly recommended. 
30673 The food is Not good. I have been on 3 occasions to try and support this place, but the food is not fresh and many of the dishes are not homemade. You can taste the packaging, not to mention they have found a way to make all dishes sweet. 
30674 Fonda Rosa saved us last night. We left another restaurant because the service was not good and were still very hungry. This place made our night! We were seated and served very quickly, the food was delicious and the servings were large for the price. We will be back! 
30675 Chicken pot pie was awesome!!!! also had a coconut cream pie and Bailey's with coffee... Those were pretty good to..... Small casual venue.... Definitely recommend for a casual bite to eat and simple atmosphere =) 
30676 This place was great!! I was looking for a local place and I could not have found a better spot. I brought a bridesmaid dress there to get altered and when I left it fit like a glove! I would happily bring other items here to get altered. 
30677 The niche market of businesses catering to hipster asshattery has been adequately saturated in Portland, thank you. You and your leggings can go away. Some of us growed ups would like to drink now. 
30678 This is definitely the coolest looking yogurt shop I've ever seen. Super friendly staff. I had the peanut butter and Dutch chocolate with no toppings. It was so good it didn't need toppings. I got mine to go but I wish I would have stayed to enjoy the atmosphere. 
30679 Absolutely LOVED this place for the first time this morning!! Linda, our waitress, was a delight. Food was delish!!! Tuna melt to die for and cake that could make you slap your mama. We will be back. 
30680 This is an exceptional hair salon headed by a celebrated hair stylist, owner Patrice Vince. Skilled, accomplished and talented is how I would describe her and her team. I left there looking and feeling as some of her Hollywood client! 5 Stars!!!!! 
30681 Fun selection of burgers and the fries are yummy!!! Also a great place to hang out after work. Good vibe. 
30682 YUM! Hit the spot for a good dessert while walking around town. Service was great, good prices and WONDERFUL ice cream cookie sandwich!! 
30683 Really fun brewery tour. Everything is very nice and clean. We had a great tour guide and really had fun on the tour! 
30684 First time come to this restaurant. Nice view and a lot of people in there. All services a Japanese very kindly. Food is very good. 
30685 The food is great, but the wait isn't. I'd go more often if it didn't have an hour wait just to get to place an order. 
30686 The hours suck. Everything is the most donuty deliciousness you've ever experienced. Eat the god damn donut. 
30687 Amazing food every time I visit. Incredible quality at an unbelievable value. Highly recommend the pepper steak, ginger chicken, and crab puffs. 
30688 Unreliable. They were supposed to be here today and didn't show up. This left me in a bind. There's no way I'll give them a second chance. If you can't get the showing up part of this figured out, there's no way I'll trust you with my kids. 
30689 Lots of nice items to choose from, from dining tables, dinnerware, kitchen accessories, furniture and a whole lot more, but you better be rich or crazy to shop here as this stuff is way over priced or perhaps it's just too fancy for my simple country blood !!! 
30690 Great Atmosphere, excellent way to finish or start a date. Sample any flavor you want with any topping as well and you have yourself a 5 star ice-cream shop. 
30691 I always come to diamond nails their staff is great and have the best pedicure and manicures in Austin texas 
30692 I rate them 5 stars overall 
30693 Michelle was extremely professional and welcoming which are two major things I look for in a business. I would love to have been a regular client if I didn't recently take a job in the Midwest. I will be back soon! 
30694 I am northern Italian and recently moved from the NE U.S. to Orlando. This is the first true taste of Italian I have had in Orlando. Excellent food and great atmosphere. 
30695 The shop itself is decorated very cozily. Lots of interesting chairs, unique couches, and swing seats. Food itself was pretty good too. 
30696 Food is awesome and staff is friendly. Large place with bar and several tables. There is also a separate counter for ordering to go and a self serve dessert case. Reuben and lox bagel are super yummy!! 
30697 I love this restaurant. Great food, service, atmosphere, staff & prices. Favorite restaurant in Boulder. 
30698 Mich better coffee ham you can get down the street at the French pastry shop. Excellent coffee. Friendly service. Super clean restrooms. We will definitely be back! 
30699 It's alright. Long wait for an average burger. Maybe I will try it again another time. 
30700 Very good food and very authentic. Shrimp wonton soup is amazing. If you don't want the shrimp or wonton the broth is just as good. Food looked and smelled so good I ate it all before I had a chance to take a pic! 
30701 Long turnaround time and choppy, inconsistent communication. However, the repair was executed well; my watch is finally back and working properly. 
30702 Best mexican in town. I love there prices, the employees are friendly and great. The food is always fresh and it never feels frozen. The seats and tables are always clean and I have a blast eating at Qdoba 
30703 Great little hidden bar/resturaunt Ive been here for food and drinks and really like it... ive ordered their Mac & Cheese, burgers, skins and wings throughout my trips there.... all very good.. The staff is great.... just an all around good spot for a night out or just for dinner. 
30704 We got in and were seated right away. It was a pretty busy afternoon but we were served pretty quickly and the food was great. 
30705 AMAZEBALLS! If you love cheese (who doesn't?) this place is a MUST. They make grilled cheese with your choice of cheese AND your choice of bread AND one of the choices is Kings Hawaiian Rolls! I mean, do I even need to say anything else?! Just go! 
30706 Came back and came in around 9pm. I always knew I was gonna come back here for the food. We got a table right away and I left really satisfied. Will go back again this week for the chicken and coconut soup 
30707 Delicious shirini (sweets) and the best napoleans in the northeast! 
30708 It is the freshest omelet I've ever had. Thin layer of egg, stuffed veggies inside just made the omelet perfect. The home fries is very well seasoned, full of flavor! 
30709 Delish! It really is all you can eat. Great vegetarian options I left feeling very satisfied. Was glad to see they had a decent beer and sake menu as well which went awesome with the hot pot. 
30710 The food was fantastic. I don't like pancakes, but tried them. They didn't need syrup they were so good. It's tight in there, but the food is worth it. 
30711 Well worth the Boston detour. The burgers were delicious. Quality meat and homemade tasting bun. Price not bad either- $7.95 for my cheeseburger. Sit down service or self service/order available. 
30712 We came for brunch and had a great experience! Loved the harvest bowl and the avocado toast. Loved the Narrative Ros√© by the glass!! Highly recommend. Thanks for a good time!! Will be back. 
30713 This is a really great place for a casual meeting. They have awesome food, are vegan friendly, and offer indoor and outdoor seating. Parking can be a little tight, so you might want to park on a nearby street. 
30714 Since the remodel this is a great gym. Nice people, family vibe and good equipment for a great value. Men's locker room needs a new cleaner. 
30715 Arrived right on time, called before getting there. went right to work identified the problem and repaired it right away. very reasonable, fast and courteous. 
30716 Excellent food, great service, a bit pricy but worth it! The kind of place where they learn your name, and really care about your food and overall experience. 
30717 Always a great 'go to' for breakfast/brunch/lunch. Don't expect 5 star dining, just honest flavourful perfectly prepared Benny and such. 
30718 Samurai was one of the best experiences we've had so far. We've ordered Takoyaki, Curry Rice and the Veggie Combo. The food was delicious, excellent service and the place is extremely comfortable. 
30719 First time here and I was impressed. Friendly staffs and quality drinks. Had tiramisu milk tea and I loved it. Will come back in the future. 
30720 Everything is deliciously good!!! My favorite is the citrus burst and key lime pie. The German Chocolate cake is moist and rich. Their cupcakes have the perfect sweetness. 
30721 Nice random bar that seems like a sports bar and Irish pub in one. Great for the game or a pint 
30722 Walked in for a screen cover for my new iPhoneX. I was greeted by Don Ekland from your Natick location. His customer service was impeccable. Great knowledge of products and delightful conversationalist. Not to mention the screen covers he installed look perfect! 
30723 Their omurice with pork cutlets were delicious. We went at noon on a Sunday and the wait was only 10min. 
30724 The food was absolutely incredible. I had the swordfish steak and it was very flavorful and fresh. The food came out fast and the service was wonderful. I would definitely come back here again. 
30725 The bartender seemed to be to preoccupied with a conversation. He took 10 minutes to see me, and then forgot to make my martini.. once he finally looked up and realized how rude he was.. I was ready to leave. Unreal, really wanted to try it.. 
30726 Great place! I had the rawtartar burger with a side of onion rings. The burger was great! And the beer battered onion rings were good! I had the Nutella milkshake with it, and it was amazing! I loved it! 
30727 Wow this ice cream is AMAZING! I tasted the grapefruit/rose water sorbet and the coconut lemon sorbet and both were great. I was in the mood for something creamy and ended up ordering a scoop of sweet cream and a scoop of coffee ice cream. So good! I'll be back. 
30728 Like the food it's the staff with attitudes that stop me from returning. Two of them yelled at Me! 
30729 First time in Boston, this place looked alright based on reviews.... Friendly waitress's. Ok sandwich. Good beer. Would go again! 
30730 Pretty cool place. Nice artwork. Good food. Attentive staff. Ate here for breakfast. LOTS of food. 
30731 The most friendly and welcoming staff and very consistently delicious coffee. Also very strong if you really need your caffeine kick! But no bitter taste at all. One if my favorite places in town (: 
30732 This location in Midtown Atlanta - Amsterdam Walk attraction was smaller in size compared the Catch Air in Marietta, Georgia. But was not ripped off in pricing nor experienced any bad customer service upon entry. My toddler had fun and of course cried on the way out... 
30733 Really enjoyed the flavor! The kale slaw was very tasty and fresh. Loved the sauce combination I had. 
30734 Worst service ever. Can't get orders right, omit entire entrees and then they don't care. Won't be back. 
30735 We stay there yesterday. I didn't like there because blanket,bed set, bathroom everything were dirty. The room uncomfortable. Reception is unfriendly. Paid $80 but not worth it. 
30736 Wow, amazing tacos! Very happy I tried this spot. I had the vegan migas & the nueva onda. The salsas were great as well. I will be back next time I'm in Austin :) 
30737 Not the best experience, after waiting for almost three weeks for my tires to arrive, they try to sell me tires a year and a half old, i feel like i wasted my time there. 
30738 Went to try the Jalapeno Popper sandwich. Great spicy vegetarian sandwich. Not that big, but great quality. 
30739 I've been to Kinokuniya several times and it never disappoints. If your into trinkets, or stationary items you'll be in heaven. They have a great selection of books and of course collectible for mangas and popular shows. I could spend a good while in there looking around. 
30740 This is for sure my best place for brunch in Vancouver. The service is amazing and the food quality extraordinary. Don't skip the fantastic waffle with many different toppings. 
30741 Service was very fast and reasonably priced. I came in with a flat tire and they patched it in less than 20 minutes. I will go to this business if I need service again. 
30742 Best chicken in noodles I've ever had. Big portions and small prices. Will always be a family favorite 
30743 Disappointing. A steak sent back and still not right. Of course, cold vegetables when the still raw steak returned. Lackluster service. Lackluster food. Hardly worth it. 
30744 Best taco place around sandy springs! The steak tacos are marinated perfectly & the corn tortillas are awesome. They have a salsa bar-which is my favorite because I love salsa!!! It's busy at lunch time so be prepare to wait a little. So worth the wait!! 
30745 Love their special and I'm down with any place that has cheese fries! Wish they gave bigger sodas but this is the perfect hangover food spot :) 
30746 We ordered delivery and I swear I bit into a rock!!! My salad was lettuce in a plastic dish.... we had 2 orders of garlic cheese bread that was good. The rest was horrible!!! The order was $40 and not even edible!!! I'm attaching pictures.... 
30747 Had a great experience. Lovely ambience, great food and wine. Will return. I especially recommend the avocado toast and patatas bravas! My boyfriend liked the jamon serrano and steak as well. 
30748 My wife and I are from Boston (we are on vacation) and saw that Caroline had great reviews. We were NOT disappointed. Amazing food and drinks. Great service. Upstairs lounge, roof deck and bar. Couldn't ask for much more. 
30749 Fabulous restaurant!!! Great food, drinks, & staff!!! Right in downtown Salem!! Sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but it's worth it!! Delicious!!! 
30750 Quick and responsive. Worked with Carmine to get a rush order placed and printed. Came out better than expected! 
30751 Atmosphere is nice and soothing. Soft music plays in background. Not the cheapest. Paid 35 for an hour. Massage was repetitive. Didn't do many different techniques that I've experienced at other foot massage places. 
30752 very delicious breakfast. Multiple coffee options , very fresh taste. The service is nice 
30753 They will make your day 
30754 I really like the small BBQ chicken sandwich, and it's really cheap and comes with a side (I recommend the mac and cheese). 
30755 Been here for lunch and dinner and love it! Service was lacking one time but I think it was a fluke thing. Beautiful restaurant with a nice patio. Bustles and is a bit loud at peak times but the food is beautifully presented and delicious. 
30756 I went here last night for happy hour after work, and had a great time. We hung out on the outdoor sunken patio. Our bartender was awesome and made us very strong drinks. Food was also excellent, and prices were good. I'll definitely be back here again. 
30757 Wild Ginger has the best Thai food in the Norwell/Hanover area! Highly recommend! That staff is also very friendly! 
30758 Great food and beer selection and the atmosphere is really fun. And you can't miss Tiki Tuesday, hey have great drink specials and you get to keep the fun ceramic cup! 
30759 Waiter was fantastic. However, undercooked and very cold food. Unacceptable. Waited over an hour for our food as well. Disapponiting all 3 tries at this "could be" great restaurant. 
30760 Super nice vets answered all my questions before I even asked them. I came in for ear infection and a skin allergies and they broke down each thing and took care of them both. Great place 
30761 Will update more on the dog etc in couple weeks 
30762 Edible yes, nice concept, menu looks good, but food sucks overall. Sorry, I really wanted to like it! 
30763 The food is very low quality and the service barely luke warm. I have tried it a few times hoping that i had caught it on a bad day but it just seems to keep getting worse. 
30764 Cheapest prices around by a lotttt much more variety of products and stuff that actually works. Been going here since high school and always will 
30765 My friends come here all the time for after work drinks, and pregaming for the weekends. We love this place because its walking distance from the apartment and conveniently located near some of our local favorite restaurants. Friendly staff and great drinks!! Love it here! 
30766 Ph√§nomenal gutes Essen Ich war heute zum zweiten Mal. Incredibile Der Tuna, unglaublich was das K√ºchenteam gezaubert hat. Ich bin hell auf begeistert. Und ein aufmerksamer Service. Beim Eintritt heute wurde ich begr√º√üt: Welcome Back. Nicht von einem sondern von 2 Mitarbeitern. Ich war und bin sprachlos. Hammer 
30767 This place sucks. I hate the atmosphere and the food is terrible. Slow service and no parking. 
30768 Most delish not fish taco EVER. I got the vegan Del Rey 
30769 Super tasty. I also got the avocado reale - also super yummy. 
30770 Rooms were comfortable. Free wine every evening. Dogs welcome. 
30771 the cod in the fish and chips has a thicker than normal batter, thus holding more grease and giving it a soaked, heavy sponge feel. It was wet, but not gross enough for me to stop eating. Fries and tartar sauce were good. 
30772 We love the food, service and atmosphere here. It's fun with the sports playing on the numerous televisions around as well as a few slot machines! 
30773 I have no idea as came to watch the blue wild card game and three people were in the bar. Not much of a sports bar. Walked in and walked out. 
30774 The best customer service bright and early at 7am by Patti- this woman is awesome and such a pleasure when I am rushed to go to work. Love the Ruta Maya coffee and the early bird taco! 
30775 It doesn't get better then scotch, cigar and a cool day on SFA hotel bar on the balcony. It's a fun spot to yell at the occupiers protesting below on the streets. Yes, I said that. 
30776 I love this place! Yummy tacos, mole, and fajitas! Actually most everything is tasty. I like their margaritas too. Good prices for the amount of food you get. I wish there was a SE location closer to us. 
30777 Coming from the UK I know a good curry, and their Lamb March Masala with a pint of Kingfisher was one of the best I've had. The service is great, our waiter helped make the evening memorable and enjoyable for the whole party. 
30778 Great location and very good service. It is the best place to enjoy a shisha service the hookah was good and the tea is delicious 
30779 It is a simple but honest pizza place. Pleasant and attentive staff. They accommodate my kids requests. I like their veggies pizza. The meatball subs are great. No problem with their delivery service. 
30780 Great food,,service and I would recommend that the large margarita. Steak fajitas delicioso 
30781 This is really a first-class establishment! It's beautiful inside and they have the "tasting machine" as Kara K called. I had to try that out. So I bought a card and tried sips of the Riesling and the Merlot. I'll definitely come back here to buy wine in the future. 
30782 Amazing soup base, well done noodles, and perfect pork chashu. Really surprised by this place, will definitely coming back! 
30783 Smaller place in the area. You may overlook it because it is on the side street. However, nice pub with great service. Be sure to try the fried Avacado... It was super yummy! 
30784 Outstanding pizza, salads, desserts and service. It's our new go to plaza place on the west side. 
30785 The best place to go for breakfast! Perfect spot for lactose n tolerance! Lots of dairy free options at a good price.(: 
30786 I love this place because it's close to my house and the food and service I get here is always great no matter how busy they are! 
30787 Food was great.. best services in the area.. I'd recommend my friends here... specially chefs! 
30788 This pint-sized shop is the perfect place to grab a cup of joe and explore Worthington. We'll be back on another trip though central Ohio. 
30789 Dog friendly, that was so appreciated since we were visiting the area from out of state with dog in tow. Food was great and the service was very friendly and prompt. We'll be back. Thanks so much for catering to guests with pets. 
30790 Great food! But, I only can give it 3 stars because the owners wife who works at the register is ALWAYS so rude. I'll even send my clients to this restaurant because the food is great and they complain of the same thing. 
30791 This restaurant is fantastic. The atmosphere is delightful. The lady attending to me was cheerful & rapid. Everything I tasted was wonderful. The rice was flavourful & cooked to perfection. The curry was the best I've had in Orlando. You must try this restaurant. I'm pleasantly surprised. I'll be back. 
30792 I order from here almost every day and its simply amazing!! Butter chicken pizza is a revolution here :O 
30793 Blue Ox Tattoo had a great, professional atmosphere. The staff felt very welcoming and were able to help you with your requests. My tattooist, Dylan, did a great job on my forearm tatt and will definitely go back to complete my sleeve. 
30794 Had to try it since it's a new place, it was fair at best, the sausage was tasty but the pie was underdone and extremely over priced service was ok at best. We won't be back but I wish them success 
30795 Neat place, nice atmosphere snd great food. The complimentary sugar coated fried biscuits were amazing. 
30796 AMAZING food, but only gets 4 stars because every time I order take-out, they take about 15-20 min longer than they say they will. 
30797 ditto for muu-muu's! this place converted me to sweet potato fries! i luvv sitting at the booth only because it created such a cozy, dark atmosphere! 
30798 One of the last cool, original, old school Austin bars on the block. This area is quickly developing, so get down here, grab a plate of bbq and a cold beer or two. They have lots of good local be selection, so don't be shy! 
30799 Nine Bar has finally added the one thing that they were missing: several more substantial (i.e. non-pastry) breakfast options. Their egg sandwich is top-notch, with a creative and tasty set of toppings and good size for money. And of course their cappuccino continues to rein supreme in the Boston area. 
30800 The food was great but the service was HORRIBLE. took 20 minutes to bring us water and the waitress was inattentive. Do not come here if you want a quick bite, the service was one of the worst I've experienced. 
30801 Great local bar with soft tip darts and billiards. Good selection of beer and each time in had something new I haven't tried before. Also enjoy the live music and occasional events. 
30802 Been here 20min. My friend is almost done with their meal and I haven't even gotten mine. They've messed up the last 4 orders and the bathroom is unacceptable. 
30803 I have had a back pain for over 5 years and after a month with Hillary you would have never new I had any back pain. A life saver!!! 
30804 Located in a cute food truck village with lots of seating. I tried one of the suggested combinations... Broccoli, cheddar and hot dog. Very good cheese sauce on the penne. Cheddar goes on top. Next time I think I'd go with Mac plus broccoli for that fresh crunch. 
30805 Breakfast vas very good, no wait.. sit yourself down and order. Very good quality and very tasty. Great prices! 
30806 It's got decor straight out of the 80's. Shady characters and horrible service. But some of the food is decent, like the chicken wings and bone in ribs. Plus the entertainment value of watching people who can't sing try to do Karoke is hilarous! 
30807 Stopped in for a few beers and a bar dinner. Better than expected. Chips and salsa were quite good. 
30808 The best happy hour in Boulder...The Med is a close second. Make sure you reserve a table. 
30809 I am very pleased with my experience at EyeSpot. The optometrist who refracted me was thorough, knowledgeable, and helpful. and with my wife's help I managed to find an excellent frame at a reasonable cost. The lenses were ready sooner than I expected. Yes, I would definitely recommend EyeSpot. 
30810 They have smoking rooms on first floor so lobby smells very bad. 3rd floor room was fine but very small bathrooms. 
30811 Good service. Since the location was so close to our hotel we ate here once for dinner and once for lunch. The lunch appetizers (Avocado Egg Rolls, Stuffed Mushrooms and Eggplant) were delicious. The Cavitapi pasta was good. 
30812 Wow, kebabs are pretty tasty, but equally wow, some of the kebab wraps are simply shameful (think huge wrap with lots of lettuce, few pieces of meat, and dollop of sauce). 
30813 I ordered Takoyaki and spicy tonkotsu ramen, taste pretty good! The broth was not very thick, but the flavor was there. I recommend this ramen place. Also, they have my favorite One Piece on the wall! This worth at least 1 and half star! 
30814 I too enjoy sliced strawberries and friendly staff. I don't always go out of state for breakfast, but when I do I go here. 
30815 Pisses me off when they close off the deli by 8:30 pm and wont make Philly Cheesteaks. 
30816 My roommate is obsessed with this place.. which got me going. Love the guys that work here. Just tooooo small of a place to really enjoy. Other than that.. 4 stars!! 
30817 I happened to be in Harvard square so decided to stop here. It is open 24 hours which is nice. Clean interior. There are many self checkouts. 
30818 It's just OK and pricey as all get out. we're being nice because it's deep south Austin after all. 
30819 Delicious, seemingly authentic food (not a native). The sample platter is a great deal with a good selection along with the beef tartar and the spicy scallops. However, prepare for the next day with generous amounts of toilet paper as everyone in our party experienced gastronomic distress. 
30820 Very good atmosphere to chill and relax. Good view of the lake. They got really good gyro..but don't recommend their stir fry with rice. The rice is super hard and dry 
30821 Amazing place and authentic biryani and indian dishes. After moving from the Bay area, this place was homecoming with variety and amazing taste. Cheerful people greet you with a warm welcome. Nice place that you cannot miss. 
30822 I usually go to Rimsky when I'm visiting town. It's such a novelty and a delight. I really like their teas, quirky yet soothing atmosphere, and "haunted" tables. Fun place! I always recommend it to my friends who love a wacky experience. 
30823 we were at the lpga event yesterday at columbia edgewater, and tried the veggie fremont slider...excellent...black beans, lettuce, thick, nice sauce...the staff were real nice too...thx! 
30824 Great food combinations. Kinda overrated. I had the lamb burger and it was kinda dry. Pretty expensive for a burger place, 
30825 They are quick. Over $48 for a basic oil change. I wish i caught them when they had $10 off, I might be back as long as its convienent 
30826 Kind of a campy 2nd rate bike shop. I mean it's good, but things seem a bit overpriced, and the workers are kind of patronizing. But their stuff is quality and...well that's it, it's a pretty bare bones place. 
30827 It's as good as it looks! And their special sauce sets it off. I was full before I got it but knew I'd regret it if I didn't try it. So good! 
30828 Had a great time at Pour. The Mediterranean wine flight suggested by our waiter was wonderful. Our cheese and meat order was a bit wrong but they quickly fixed both mistakes. Nice place to sip and enjoy the Dresden Drive happenings. 
30829 Ordered my go-to Bulgogi Bonchon wrap. Tasted good but was 2/3rds the size?!?! Still hungry lol! In Northern VA/DC, enormous. Service was good. Eh may return but may not order the wrap. 
30830 Excellent caring and compassionate care from doctor and staff. Very thorough. Tests and treatment well explained. AEC does not take Medicare, but sometimes it pays to pay for quick response and excellent service. Highly recommend on every level! 
30831 Awesome margaritas and guacamole make this a great happy hour stop. Granted, the bar can get pretty crowded and the music is crazy loud, but it's a fun place nonetheless. The prices seemed reasonable, though I prefer to eat dinner in a quieter locale. 
30832 Great customer service, and the Techs are well trained. I highly recommend this company, service is great at an affordable price. 
30833 Food was not super good or original. However, the beer selection was very good and the draft beers that were made there were super good! Service was not bad. However, walked out smelling like cheeseburgers. And parking is a nightmare so get there early! 
30834 Easy to sign up hard to cancel.....been on the phone for over the 10 minutes they said my wait would take.....I decided to sign up as a friend had attended a webinar, but I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. Looking for other services that are much more business friendly 
30835 Awesome shop! Great atmosphere! Enjoyed every minute of getting my latest tattoo! Chrystal was awesome. You want a tattoo in Orlando? Go to Good Vibrations and ask for Chrystal! 
30836 If you like going shopping and not being injured then stay away from this store. The door has a jagged piece of metal on the bottom that sliced me when I opened the door. As of yet no one has offered to help me. Wtf. 
30837 Really enjoyed the scallops, cappelletti pasta and sorbet dessert. Nice drink menu and beautiful ambience. 
30838 I'm less impressed than I was. My hot dog buns were stale and fell apart as I was holding them. And the smart-ass behind the register had the nerve to question my prononciation of "hummus". That's okay; no tip for you. 
30839 I've leased my last two cars from Broadway Toyota. I love their products, so I keep going back. Their customer service is definitely getting better. The salesman worked with me this time around was fantastic. 
30840 I mean, its donut and nothing special. But my wife loves it so maybe there is something to them. But for me, they didn't blow my mind as advertised. 
30841 I've never done a review before, but we had such a wonderful meal I had to post this. Great food, great wine, great service and great Limoncello to end the meal. Will be back often. 
30842 My friends and I were in town at Universal and wanted to skip the chain restaurants and Theme Park food...we decided to try this place out and were not disappointed. Authentic Mexican food and friendly homey environment. Will definitely be back our next trip to Orlando. 
30843 Dr. Singh has been an incredibly thorough, patient, and warm doctor--not to mention he's an excellent surgeon. We're so grateful to him. 
30844 Thanks, Yelp! Great find. I didn't feel up to One Flew South and decided to cast about. So glad I did! I'd recommend the spinach salad for starters. It'd b pretty good food anywhere but taking into consideration it's airport food? Yippee!! = ) 
30845 Elizabeth was our tour guide and this young girl has a bright future. She is not only intelligent but really funny too!! Thanks Elizabeth for an awesome tour!!! 
30846 A quiet place with excellent food, great music and helpful wait staff. We have been a few times as near home and have enjoyed our food every time. Some unique options also. 
30847 Delicious low key spot. Enjoyed sat brunch. Had hash with egg, black cod fishermans stew abd orrechiette- all tasty. Sangria was a little bitter and served withiut fruit. Friendly service and cute atmosphere. Single bathroom so plan to wait. Would like to try for dinner since lunch is brunch menu. 
30848 Love Cha Ba Thai, My daughter always asks for it for dinner. We always have options for people who are vegetarian and those who aren't. I really like the curry dishes and their spicy is pretty hot. Great soups as well. 
30849 This food was a waist of our time waited over 1 hour in drive thru and the food came looking like this as well as cold why the fuck is this place even open 
30850 The Alehouse is a great place to meet some friends, have a few beers and enjoy yourself. You can enjoy a delicious meal while sitting on the river. Live entertainment at the end of the week. Try the Irish stew. So very good. 
30851 My go-to Thai place in north austin. It's very consistent and just delicious. If you're ever wanting Thai, just go here... You'll be satisfied. 
30852 Love this service! Easy to schedule, environmentally friendly and fragile items are more secure then in a flimsy cardboard box - did I mention affordable? The delivery and pick up teams are fast, friendly and took great care when maneuvering around our apartment. I highly recommend this service. 
30853 We had them deliver to our hotel. Pizza had a good crust and great sauce. Better than most west coast pies. 
30854 I love PF. 10 down and 10 a month is what I pay. They have very flexible hours and the atmosphere is very comfortable! 
30855 Best wedding ever!!! From the moment we walked in for lunch in the pub, oysters and hamburger were delicious, throughout the entire wedding reception where once again salmon perfectly cooked. Service could not have been better and people so accommodating. We look forward to going back. 
30856 Great taste but very disappointed lately!! The torta bread tasted MOLDY and the burrito I cut in half and was about to give my toddler had a piece of plastic!! Thank god I caught it before I hand it to my son! 
30857 Amazing my nails were in a bad state they spent an adequate amount of time and it was extremely relaxing! I will definitely be coming back I have been searching for a nail place and I highly recommend them there service is superb 
30858 Mary's nice the food's great and just love the low key atmosphere. Always a cool casual location to catch up with a friend or to hit before drinks in Central... 
30859 Stellar. Really enjoy Spanish food, in Boston Toro has long been our main stay. But Barcelona is giving them a run for their money. Excellent food and good wine list. I highly recommend getting the meat on wheels. 
30860 Delicious salads, so flavorful. Very friendly and helpful service. Intimate and beautiful decor. 
30861 whooo-weee! You want a lomito sandwich, believe me. Great food all around. Definitely a place to take out-of-town guests. 
30862 Been bringing our two dogs, a shiba and a lab, here for years. We have never had any problems with the doggy day care, boarding or the grooming for our shiba. 
30863 I've really liked just about every single dish I've had here. I've loved some too - its not always on the menu but I love love the squid ink noodles. It's sooooo good. Once it disappeared from the menu but I asked for it and they made it. Delicious. 
30864 We were stuck for about 30 minutes. Not exactly a great experience. No guest recovery whatsoever. 
30865 Employees are great!! If they have the taro flavor, you should try it. Overall, great customer experience. 
30866 Service wasn't friendly at all, the cashier was short with us and rude about the menu which was surprising since we were first time guests. The chicken sandwiches were incredibly salty. Neither of us could finish our meal, so we were pretty disappointed. Crinkle fries were good though. 
30867 This place is fantastic. The service is top notch, the food can be both tasty and healthy if you are so inclined. It tastes oh so fresh. To top it, the prices are very reasonable. Do yourself a favor and swing by. 
30868 cold pizza, 30 minutes late, unwilling to refund me. That will be the last time I order here 
30869 I've been hoodwinked by fellow yelpers again with all the rave reviews of this place. This was in my top 3 worst meals of all time. We had the beer battered fish, wings, reggae rolls and nachos. The nachos were consumed. Everything else was transferred to the trash. 
30870 meh. weak beer selection. not so friendly staff. weak vibe. I wouldn't suggest this place. Keep on walking .... 
30871 Everything the other reviewers say! This was the best breakfast we've had in years! Pancakes , bacon & hashbrowns are perfection. Service was super friendly. 
30872 Upon return, I have readjusted my liking toward injera. The slightly fermented flavor definitely pairs well with all their nicely flavored dishes. The orange/yellow lentil stew is definitely the star here. Nothing else stood out at this trip, but all offerings tasted excellent. 
30873 Pretty mediocre. At least the prices were cheap. The cheese the used taste like it was Melted craft singles. 
30874 This business has been quite generous and aims to earn repeat customers. Twice this year they have given us complimentary service for issues beyond their control. Roland, the manager, is always around to help, too. I'll be back! 
30875 We stayed at the nearby Columbia River RV park for two months and ate often at the Sextant. Great food and service. Wonderful view, right on the river. Value for money. 
30876 I had the burrito with chicken and broccoli. It was really tasty and made for good leftovers the next day. The prices were reasonable, and the woman who took our order was really friendly. The ambiance inside isn't great, but the outside area is really cute. 
30877 Second time here and I liked it a little more. Nothing special about the food. Standard Vietnamese food. I saw a lot of people drinking. Maybe that is why everyone raves about this place. 
30878 Good food and great customer service but a little pricey. The atmosphere is very casual. It's a nice place but for the price there wasn't anything that special. Not sure it's a place it will keep going back to. 
30879 Clean, courteous and knowledgable dental staff. I'm glad to make this office my go-to for dental care. 
30880 Good News for those of us near perimeter!!! Alon's will have another location with better parking in the former Eatzi's accross from Perimeter Mall!! :-) YEAH!!! 
30881 That was awesome service! Super-friendly, on-top-of-it, in-and-out in two minutes. If only parking downtown were easier to find, it would be my go-to post office all the time. 
30882 I love love love my banana splits but I'm very sad that they took the snickers blizzard off the menu. 
30883 Very nice place with a great atmosohere. Food is very good and tasty. Good wine too. Waters highly professionals and prepared. Good view. 
30884 Amazing food at a good price and friendly staff. Get the seafood combo with the garlic butter and Cajun sauces mixed (I like it spicy). You won't be disappointed! Don't forget a side of bread. Sooooo yummy! And the red potatoes, delicious! 
30885 Here for the annual Ohio Star Ball Ballroom Competition. The Hyatt has done a great job of updating the place. They do need to add humidification though. It's very dry. 
30886 Needed a graduation gown pressed at the last minute and the hotel couldn't do it. I called here and the did it while I waited. I want to highly recommend them and appreciated it. 
30887 This location is a wonderful place to meet with friends and get work or studying done! Parking can be a bit tricky and the bathroom (which is outside the suite and communal for the building) is less than ideal, but not the fault of SummerMoon. A genuine Austin experience! 
30888 First time here and it was good! Delicious fried chicken!! Only downfall is parking..other than that I will definitely return. 
30889 Horrible service by rude, obnoxious people who don't want to be there and aren't interested in making any decent food. The service was most awful and the food was less than subpar. Sorry, not sorry- I learned my lesson with this place. BLEECHHH. 
30890 Best time while in Orlando!! We had so much fun. The park isn't crazy crowded!!! We were able to get up close to the animals. We loved it!!! 
30891 Arrived 10 minutes before closing on a Sunday night and received expert knowledgeable service at a more than fair price on my watch battery replacement. Two more customers walked in after me and they weren't turned away because of the closing time. i will never go anywhere else now. 
30892 These guys are absolutely incredible. They came, they moved, they were very nice and respectful of my time and belongings. Nothing bad to say about these guys. The movers, Kenny and Kenny, were amazingly awesome. Definitely will be using them from now on for all my moving needs. 
30893 My coworker brought a variety of their donuts to work today and OH MY GOD. I had the Horchata Glaze, and it was by far the best donut I've ever had... truly gourmet. Whoever said "not as good as Voodoo" is clearly missing most of their taste buds. 
30894 Sat at the bar and had some Poke and my husband had some outstanding pasta. They do a nice pour on the wine and the small plates were very tasty. Have tried to get in here several times and it is often packed. 
30895 I would not go anywhere else in Austin. As a woman it is really nice to be able to go to a place and get an honest assessment. I really owe Frank, he and the guys went above and beyond my expectations. I would highly recommend going here. 
30896 Have had multiple very good meals here. The last time was a few weeks ago with my parents and our server (male, don't know name) was great! We were seated outside and he was generally prompt and answered all our questions fantabulously. 
30897 i really like this place. Yummy food for everyone, good ambiance, good coffee & cocktails. Nice patio that is partially covered. Family friendly, date friendly. I've never come here and not enjoyed myself. Great place without breaking the bank. 
30898 With four people we tried four different appetizers and entrees. Each was fantastic and we're looking forward to another four. Definitely a fan. 
30899 Def. not a bad option if you want to grab some decent, healthy food options while at the airport. Large portions so no one will go hungry, and lots of fresh items to choose from. 
30900 Worst customer service- my mom waited 45 minutes to sign in with a teller to go down to the safety deposit box. Which does not make sense at all to do since they have a table set up in front of the deposit boxes. 
30901 The epitome of a good vet! Grew up here, went to UF and loves his pets. I could go on and on. It's a special place, that's for sure. 
30902 Terrible customer service. I am the only one in the line but she waits until I place my order to replace all the straws in the all the dispensers and forgot my order. The worst customer service 
30903 Love the breadth of products 
30904 I'm a fan 
30905 Prices are good, too 
30906 good tacos my fav is cheese quesadilla and fried beans margaritas with mezcal highly recommend it ;) 
30907 Everyone seemed flustered, took forever to get out food, super expensive, overly boujie, flavors didnt meddle or make sense. Kale salad had horseradish. We are all fans of both horseradish and kale but it was just weird. Please pick somewhere else. 
30908 I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the lack of attentive service. Food was excellent and presentation was wonderful. Waiter and bus-girl only came by sporadically to refill drinks. 
30909 I use to come to this place often because the cakes, and the pies were the bomb, however when you place a future order during thanksgiving and Christmas, the menu narrows down not including apple pie. How can't you not have apple pie during those holidays. 
30910 Needed a dress drycleaned last minute... Glad I found this place. They got it done same day, and there is actually a discount if you don't leave it there overnight. The people were friendly and my dress was spotless =) 
30911 HORRIBLE ! Horrible! Service 
30912 It's owned by Indians and they're service is not friendly at all ! They snatched my card and rushed for me to pay so they can close. I only went thier because American deli was closed, and this is service I get 
30913 Never again. 
30914 Very good Korean food..true and authentic Korean....great customer service...and of course...can't beat flavor soju..great atmosphere..they are located in the old SUBLIME lounge in Cocoa village...definitely recommend in trying it out...Korean BBQ is coming soon so can't wait for that! 
30915 cold brew iced coffee was soo good. mellow, sweet, tangy perfect. they have a sort of awkward back patio but it does the trick. my friends got a sandwich which looked substantial and was grilled and filled with avocado and melty cheese and turkey and thick bread. yum. 
30916 Very greasy, everything is too sweet. Its not authentic asian food as it says in front of the restaurant. Better to try another place. 
30917 Great outdoor seating and overall ambiance. Food is okay if a bit pricey for what you get. I enjoy the hookah although the flavor selection can be limited. Overall one of my favorite spots in Cambridge to work, enjoy hookah/tea/a meal, and meet with friends. 
30918 Quality of the items is good, but the staff is just other-worldly in their rudeness/smugness. 
30919 Poor poor food and infinitely worse service. I think the kitchen may do well to remember a key ingredient - spice, and the staff could use a lesson in being less lazy. 
30920 What a great experience with our server, Rachel. As usual, the food was great. My husband's tacos were loaded. My oysters were crispy and juicy. It's wonderful to have a GF place that has such tasty fare. 
30921 Coffee was great! However, the three times I went they didn't have AC! I am sorry, but I love hot coffee and how am I supposed to enjoy it if the AC is broken! I did love the ambiance! Parking sucks, as usual in German Village. 
30922 Great beer prices and pretty tasty food-the dirty bird really hit the spot. Friendly staff, and now smoke free! 
30923 Got the crab cakes and gumbo. Portions were large and staff was very friendly! Gumbo was okay but my boyfriends French toast was better..Great breakfast spot! 
30924 Service was great, our waitress was so sweet and welcoming. The happy hour prices are great! Also the jalape√±o bombs were....bomb. Will definitely return!! 
30925 First time at this place, but what a difference to the dealership. Paul took me on a test drive after the basic updates performed and showed me what to look for. Best experience I've had with a dealership so far. Reasonable prices and quick turn around. 
30926 Could use some new furniture but the food is unmatched. Delicioso! 
30927 The place has a nicely unpretentious, ungentrified rough-around-the-edges decor--legitimately worn from the years rather than made to look old. The omelette and hash browns was decent, perhaps a little better than a typical greasy spoon--but not much. 
30928 This was really good I love the sweet chili sauce so much I had to buy some to take home. I will be coming back. 
30929 Great food, kamikaze roll and salmon hot pot. Nice side of wasabi and pickled ginger with the roll. Salmon in the hot pot was perfect. All washed down with sparkling water San Pellegrino. 
30930 Nachos where great that's it. Our server services every African American table 3 times more than ours. No refills, 45 min food with no flavor, and shoved against a wall. Used to be a great place. Down hill last few times I've been here. 
30931 reasonable services, price as stated $$, quality was ok but nothing really shine. i was there in Jan, so need to found my photo :( later 
30932 This is absolutely the worst sandwich I've ever had. The manager made it, forget the guys name, but instead of putting my requested tuna melt on the panini maker he microwaved the tuna. Bread wasn't even toasted, this is the worst lunch I've ever had. 
30933 Disgusting, the beer was flat and the glasses were dirty. The service was poor and very slow. Waited 15 before we were even acknowledged. Honestly, it needs a deep cleaning just too filthy. So many other options in Portland not sure how they keep the doors open. 
30934 wonderful food! great servers ( MISS YOU DJ!) and awesome atmosphere cheap too! get the cheeseburger & fries. itll blow yo mind 
30935 Solid coffee shop with co-habitating bakery (although it's a sep business) 
30936 The service was good and the mala pot had big potion! One of my favorite spicy food restaurant. 
30937 Hidden Heaven! Loved the flavors of the food. Their raw pies are to die for. We had the mango pie and it was put of the world. Great portions! 
30938 Typical Menu items for a McMenamins. I had the elk burger great. Super view it was busy the waitress warned us the kitchen was behind. Very friendly and always checking drinks. I liked being out next to the Columbia. Great place. 
30939 We have been several times. their service is always good and their drinks are our of this world. The queso is sometimes good and sometimes not and it is hard to know when it will be good or bad. But the drinks alone are worth going for! 
30940 Great service and a real friendly atmosphere. 
30941 I feel like this place is really ideal for happy hour. Their prices during that time are really great. I don't eat seafood but I tried the coconut shrimp and it was delicious. Really happy with the outcome of the food and drinks. 
30942 Used to be okay, but the breakfasts have simply gotten too inconsistent. After one too many times waiting too long and another serving of cold pancakes, we decided it wasn't worth the times they get it right. 
30943 Best sushi i've had here in Austin. (ex NYCer) Went with a friend on a Tuesday night. Sat at the sushi bar. Nice atmosphere. Personable wait and chef staff. Able to hang out and chat and enjoy great food. Will definitely go again. 
30944 Great is an understatement. This is the real deal!! Lobster ravioli is so sweet and creamy. I will definitely eat here again. Great first meal in Boston and start to vacation. 
30945 Love the crispy salty chicken. It was the best I've ever had for so long in Boston area. 
30946 Terrible pizza, garlic knots, chicken wings! Did not follow any of my order wishes. Took forever to deliver. Will never eat here again!!! 
30947 Love this place happy hour all day Sunday and they always have at least one football game on. Plus lots of options for HH. 
30948 I got the shawarma combo with beef and chicken. The meat was very dry, and didn't have much flavor at all. The rest of it was good- rice, salad, white sauce, pita etc all were fine. The portion size is good, but for $14 I expect big portions. 
30949 We had a miscommunication with RDFiT regarding freezing our membership account. Scott, the Founder and President, was very reasonable with us. These are good people, doing good business. I recommend RDFiT. 
30950 Excellent burgers, but I don't care for triple fried French fries, a bit to crunchy for me. 
30951 Dj was great. I think he was trying to charge for requests but he gave in. I liked my experience though. I give it a chance a 4/5 
30952 AM Cleaning has been cleaning my home for over 4 years. Talk about professional and punctual. I love walking into my house after the ladies come in to the smell of cleanliness. If you are looking for reliable, trustworthy, and immaculate cleanings then this company rocks. 
30953 Who needs to go to tourist town whe. You got this right here next to home! Amazing place. Recommended 110%. I wish the place was bigger but its cozy 
30954 Pretty dang good. Their burgers are always amazing, and their fries are almost the best in town. No take out, but that's sometimes a good thing. It tastes better fresh. Gyro burger! 
30955 Great quality used tires for very good prices. They'll get everything related to tires fixed quickly and the prices and service are great. I've been here a couple of times and will go back again. Good, honest, hard working people. 
30956 Absolutely love their food their sauce amazing. Definitely will visit when ever I come to Orlando. Do not miss this. 
30957 My dad and I went here last night. It was AWFUL. They charged him for 2 iced teas. Nowhere on the menu did it say that iced tea was bottomless. Stay far away!! Bottom line: Pleasant Cafe, you are not pleasant at all!! 
30958 Stayed here recently for a workshop in Portland. Stylish hotel, truly nice and helpful staff. The bed was incredibly comfortable! Walking location to a lot of downtown and easy access to drive around town. Great food. Would definitely recommend and stay here again. 
30959 Really lovely little hole-in-the-wall with great food! We stopped by for lunch and were very happy with both the food and the service. The owners are quite charming and very proud of their food. As they should be! Really great little place. Go check it out! 
30960 Pretty good food. The meals are enough to share with someone else. The rock shrimp is a must if it's your first time ! 
30961 Loved the chocolate yeast donut and the voodoo donut- essentially a chocolate yeast donut stuffed with blueberry filling (Could use more filling though) Went about midnight on friday night and the line was about 50 feet long but moved pretty fast. 
30962 O.k., so Carolyn's has improved on the service tremendously, so I'm a happy camper. Also, they have NOT CLOSED. They simply moved across 14th Street to the One Atlantic Center building at 1201 W. Peachtree Street. 
30963 This restaurant at the austin airport is horrible. Extra slow service, they can't be bothered. Food was cold. Don't bother 
30964 Lidia is so amazing! I was freaked out because my hair stylist left the state and I have a thick head of hair not a lot of people can handle. Lidia knew exactly what I wanted and my hair turned out amazing! So maneuverable and layered. I love it. 
30965 Officially, my favorite coffee place in Austin! Their vanilla latte tastes so amazing, even with skim milk! Their coffee is very high quality. The decor is also very nice... Sleek and modern. Love it!!!! 
30966 They have very little selection. The frosting is alright. however they seem to love to put this chocolate thing in the middle of all the cupcakes and it tastes like dirt. I've had three cupcakes from there and they all had it. 
30967 This is a great barber shop, and I am really glad it is near my house. Very friendly folks working hard to serve the community. Highly recommended. Great haircuts every time. 
30968 Just like my beloved shop in San Francisco...I can't tell you how excited I was when I found out that we were staying within walking distance. HEAVEN. Every night we would grab dinner and then end with a Nob Hill Chill. It makes me smile just thinking about it :-) 
30969 First time here and had such an amazing experience. Staff is very nice and accommodating. One of the best pedicures I ever had. Will definitely come back and recommend. 
30970 Tasty food and beverages, nice quiet place with lots of seating. I like the vibe of this place! Really good baked goodies 
30971 Worst Korean food I ever had! The vegetables taste like rotten, and the side dishes feels like made ten years ago... 
30972 Service is always professional and consistent and the food is something to look forward to. The bar is great. 
30973 Love this place! Been going there for years; one time we had a mini-gathering there with a bunch of us displaced kama'aina... it was wonderful! Auntie knows how to cook, and I love going there. Great service, great food... no ka 'oi (the best!) dis place! 
30974 They did a perfect job! I loved 
30975 A spectacular job, the seller of suggestions that helped me a lot to save 
30976 Zaya is a cool Mediterranean restaurant with a nice atmosphere. The food is good and the menu is full of all the classic Mediterranean dishes. The wait staff was just ok, so definitely do not go on a busy night. Overall nice little place. 
30977 Handy does not have competent cleaners. Cleaner claimed that she had vacuumed that floor but later on a friend was walking barefoot and stepped on a large nail and bled. It might be cheap but you'll be better off doing the cleaning yourself. 
30978 It is what it is - a no frills watering hole. We were a group of four and rolled in after the Boston Pride Parade and had a great time! Cold beer, darts and a really welcoming bartender (thanks, John!!). 
30979 Audrey is the best tour guide. She is funny and knows a ton of information. They also give you a ticket that you can bring to Doyles to get a free cup with a beer. It's not too long of a tour and they let you try limited release beers 
30980 If you are having delivery issues do not blame UNOS Yelp its self is the reason we wait so long they no longer care for customer satisfaction since they are in the billion dollar mark now 
30981 Nothing more to add that hasn't already been said. If you take your packages to someone else you're doing a disservice to the best mail shop in Austin. Greg is the best. 
30982 GO ON MONDAY NIGHT because all DOSAS are $5.99!! You can't beat the price, portion, and yumminess :) And I also recommend trying their Chicken 65. The service can be pretty slow but the servers are nice and friendly overall. 
30983 Great Mexican at reasonable prices. Friendly and attentive staff. Love their fajitas - they have a great lunch special on them too. Margarita's are also excellent. 
30984 I called in A PIZZA for pick up well over an hour ago. It is all kinds of crazy that my fianc√© is still sitting outside the establishment (because despite serving food, the place is filled with cigarette smoke) waiting for a pizza. 
30985 This restaurant is a staple in our life. The green chile breakfast items, inventive specials, and welcoming community atmosphere keep up coming back time and time again! 
30986 First time here and completely amazing and satisfied!! So awesome and so much food for the price!! So glad I live right across the street!! 
30987 OMG, the breakfast burrito will do for breakfast, lunch and leftovers. It must weigh about 2 pounds, what a deal. It makes the cheap inner me quiver. 
30988 Went in today to look, possibly purchase, an electronic drum set. The sales associate apparently was too busy conversing with his buddy to help me......oh well. I'm sure there's someone that wants to sell a drum set.... 
30989 Good donuts but for $58 worth of them I wish they could've at least had my order right. 
30990 Go here. The Masala Fries are my third favorite fries of all time. The cocktails are great too. 
30991 Food is ok I guess depending on what you get but the service is great,cute atmosphere,nice people..still don't think I'd pick it for breakfast personally. 
30992 This place could definitely use some TLC and a bit of a remodel but otherwise it is great if you are looking to have a place close to universal that you aren't breaking the bank for. 
30993 Went by the Saturday morning of Marathon weekend. Doors were open early, which was great. They had some therapists doing some race prep for those interested. Available items were slightly limited and picked over, but that is most likely due to the Marathon. 
30994 We had the Mangonada and the fruit cup; simply awesome, surprisingly so. Make sure to put this on your list of places to visit while in Austin. 
30995 This is my go-to place. food is always good, quick service and love the tea. It's been really busy lately, I'm really happy for them. good job guys! 
30996 First Watch has really healthy meals and the food is good and reasonably priced. They have excellent coffee and hot tea. The establishment also provides free wifi. My only complaint is that there is often a long wait on weekends. 
30997 We love the food here!!! Both chicken and seafood Paella's are magnificent. The small plates are tasty and creative and the bar tenders do a great job choosing our wine. A bright fun atmosphere, perfect for anytime. It's becoming our go to spot! 
30998 The meat was good, but to pair it with them cheaply prepared Mac and cheese is an insult ... I was very dissatisfied with the overall food quality... 
30999 If your juicer this place is right up your alley. They pretty much got any type of juice drink you would like or they could make. Also they can put pretty much anything into it. 
31000 I love shopping here can never get away without spending $200! Wish they had hot coffee, instead of bottled water and sugary soft drinks! 
31001 love their food! nice to have a gluten free option, taste so good you can not tell. little expensive but other than that it's a great place to eat. 
31002 As others have stated...Fin point is up to the 5 star rating! We had dinner here with amazing service from Joel...and returned for brunch with Jessica! Food is fresh and well done! Atmosphere is quiet and classy! Fin point is on point! Go here!!! :). 
31003 Food was excellent. Kudos to Andy Duncan for his recommendations and Nicole for hospitality and service. We will be back very soon. Great place.. Because of my work, I travel a great deal and this place is an absolute standout. Well done! 
31004 This is the first Hotel that I have been to that does not offer WiFi. The bathrooms are outdated and TV/Phone's do not work. 
31005 Pretty dam good ask for liquid nitrogen on your drink. Megan was great! We will be back. 
31006 Once again a good burger made the way I wanted it. Solid customer service I actually recommend sitting at the bar for ease 
31007 I got a massage here and was inappropriately touched by a pervert whom I believe does not even have a massage therapist license. Not once, but three times until I left. He kept peering at me under the sheet. It was disgusting and I hope this place is shut down. 
31008 Yum! I ordered the Zuni roll for take-out. It was really good and the interesting mix of flavors went together really well. The side cranberry chipotle sour cream sauce added an interesting twist to the wrap. The potato salad side was also great. 
31009 They've been playing the SF Giants on a projector during the playoffs, so it gets five stars from me. They've got a couple good veggie/vegan options, too. 
31010 Very nice selection and gourmet deli. Beautiful selection and wide variety of wines, beer, cheeses, meat and such a nice selection in the deli. Love to Monica, Allison, Carmen and James. 
31011 The waiter who tries extremely hard to act hip/funny while sacrificing getting drink orders correct looks just like Rob Schneider--not like Jonny Depp. "I'm f'ing Johnny Depp!" No you're not...not in any way. No question a duplicate Rob Schneider. 
31012 One of the best omelettes I have ever had. Worth the drive to Austin. I like the hash brown casserole and choice of local hot sauces. Great service, decent coffee and excellent food. 
31013 Excellent service- efficient, on time, thorough and very effective! Cleaned my rugs and couches and made all look new again! Will be sure to use Lily's carpet cleaning again- worth every penny!! 
31014 go here when family is in town. Its a cool atmosphere and right on the water with beautiful views of the city and harbor. Price is just right. If you are looking for a fun place to go, the staff will make it worth your while. 
31015 Our family goes here often. They even did my sister's wedding cake which was DELICIOUS. Great friendly service! 
31016 Always delicious:-) great casual patio overlooking Lake Eola Park. I love working from here. 
31017 This place is great for many reasons; its right down the street from my house, its cheap, drinks are good, food is good, staff is friendly and attentive...what else do you need for a neighborhood bar? 
31018 Great food with a wide range of prices and options. A perfect combination between upscale pub and neighborhood grille. 
31019 I had a great experience and highly recommend Emily Taylor. She listened to what I had to say and gave me exactly what I wanted in a haircut. I loved her so much I went back for coloring! thanks Emily~ 
31020 No, it isn't the most pleasent eating experience as the place is chaotic and too small but you can't find better dessert or pastries in the city. Nothing comes close, in my opinion. 
31021 First time here was fun. Lots of easy going people to talk to during the late night listening of the jazz band. I tried the stuffed mushrooms and they were good. 
31022 Not the best asian restaurant but passable. I only go there when I go to the natick mall and dont feel to eat at the food court. The service is just ok. Nothing to bragg about. 
31023 great burgers beef always fresh but the line is always long and the wait is ok price are a bit high for a burger will come back for sure not sure how often I can do it due to the pricing 
31024 love love loveee their veggie burger!! I'd recommend it even if you're not vegetarian! :D Their goodnight burger is also really good... Also, you should try the red velvet milkshake, yum! i tried the salted caramel milkshake and it was okay... not really what i expected i think... 
31025 I am ALWAYS crazing these tacos. Quality is great, staff are incredibly sweet and food comes out really fast. 
31026 We their sausage for the first last night (chorizo, rosso, parsely and three cheese) and it is the best I have ever tasted. It's places like this that make me happy to live in Atlanta. 
31027 Was looking for something a bit healthier but not too expensive one day for break. They have an item that is their vegetarian chili over a bed of quinoa. It was delicious, filling and cheap. I would recommend it as something a bit different than other mall food. 
31028 My family loves it here! We live down the street so we go often. Great food and fabulous atmosphere. We also love the deli and bakery.

31030 I love Pure Barre. Always a great burn and workout=). It was the closest location for me living south of Boston. I would drive 45minutes to get this amazing workout! It's a mix between ballet barre, pilates and yoga. 
31031 I have been using their services biweekly for 6 months now and I have been happy so far. Sometimes they might be up to 30 minutes late but once they arrive they do a very good job! I hope they will keep up the good work! 
31032 The salmon dish that came on shredded daikon was very tasty. A lot like the Hawaiian dish poke. The dungeness Cali hand roll was very god. Other items just okay. We tried about 6. Super nice touch-- instead of water they poured hot tea. 
31033 Wonderful meal. Casual but very creative food. The proprietors are really sweet - a husband and wife team. Highly recommend the crispy mussels and mushroom hash. A real gem that is as good as any restaurant in Boston. 
31034 Delicious waffles, the best way to start your day! My favorite is Nutella with marshmallows! 
31035 This market is a little small but has a lot of great stuff. Fresh produce, delicious pies, candy, nuts, drinks and more. I used to attend weekly on their on seasons, until I moved out of state!! Highly recommended to visit tho!! 
31036 My favorite all time flavor really shines here with a fun play on today's culture; LIGERS BLOOD!! It's awesome. I love the texture of the snow too, very reminiscent of NOLA shaved ice, My other fav. flavor is blueberry muffin. yum-o. Good job Ice Queens. 
31037 Loved it. Best Cuban and burger we had in a long time. Well staffed and live music. Those Cuban spring rolls across the way looked awesome as well. 
31038 This place is located in a busy street with limited parking spaces. I felt rushed by the waitress and she was kinda rude too. The food was nothing special. I won't be returning 
31039 Not worth the trip. Small portion or giant plates? You decide. Bad service and low quality food. Very loud in the restaurant. I honestly can't figure out how they stay in business. 
31040 Clean facility. Sauna, pool, not a lot of meat heads. Good place to workout. 
31041 Doesn't get even close to as good as Amy's. My son won't eat it. I would but there are better options out there for the calorie spend. The kids that run the counter are nice but I couldn't get the owner to email or call back. 
31042 Well I'm going to change my review I have been back several times now they got rid of there bar tender and have a new one and the food has been great the new sauce is awesome twisted sauce it great on wings or pulled pork 
31043 Interesting flavors, fresh, overall tasty donut. I prefer the slightly chewier consistency of the raised yeast from Voodoo. Definitely "quality over quantity" because quite frankly don't like to pay $3 for a donut if I can help it. 
31044 Great delicious food and totally worth every penny! Definitely be returning for more! Yummy!! 
31045 Great new nail spot! The staff is so friendly and kind. I went with 2 of my friends and we all had great experiences with their service. It's a modern and clean salon with reasonable prices. I highly recommend it! 
31046 DELICIOUS doughnuts! Coffee is great too. Get there early before they run out of maple bacon among the many greats! 
31047 love love love, I mean anything salt & straw is good and to ha r a soft serve place is awesome. 
31048 Went for brow & lip wax based on Yelp comments. Very clean surroundings. Christy was very friendly & professional. I'm very happy with the service & will try her for my nails soon! Usually go to Kenneth's, this was much better price and I enjoyed the "homey" feeling. 
31049 I've been looking for a good Thai default place. This very well could fill the position. It's not the absolute best Thai I've had but it's pretty darn good 
31050 Good food, comfortable place, yummy Brazilian food and great service. Better than other all you can buffets as you order "a la carte". Try the appetizers. Yuka cake was delicious. 
31051 Very cozy atmosphere. Delicious food. The tiramisu was delish! Heard the veal was amazing too. 
31052 Excellent. It's really is, all these reviews aren't lying. I had the Lamb Pita, I will be back. 
31053 Love this place!! Great service and very cool atmosphere. This is one of my go to spots. Good people watching 
31054 Mongolian Beef? Pheonix and Dragon? Sweet and Sour Chicken? So where's the damn HUNAN food?? How can you give 4 and 5 starts to a Hunan restaurant with no Hunan food?? 
31055 This place is a pretty standard pho place. I always get the seafood pho, which again is standard for pho. Last time, I got a Thai shake with boba. The boba was really hard... Prices are cheap, and there's a discount in those college books. I come here pretty often.. 
31056 3 stars is for A-OK, which this was! Tasty sushi, normal prices, well-presented and delivered on time. Order: Dragon Roll: 4 pieces but they were huge. Really tasty. Spicy Tuna: Good and totally standard. Fuji Tempura Maki: this is a bit fishier tasting than other rolls but I enjoyed it. 
31057 Very nice and relaxed atmosphere. My friends and I enjoyed the blueberry hookah and I will definitely come back again. 
31058 Fast service but kind of annoyed that the doctor didn't talk to me for more than 90 seconds... 
31059 I had a great time there! They did my moms and my eyebrows, and did an amazing job!!! Highly recommended! 
31060 Delicious, All Natural Smoothies. A bit expensive, but you get what you pay for! Its a nice place to sit and talk over a smoothie. I'll have to try the juices next time! 
31061 Lou's is normally an amazing place to go. last time I went it scarred me.. The dough was hard and it completely changed my mindset. I will give it a 3 for inconsistency. 
31062 The worst sushi ever. Can't believe that for the first time we left sushi's (if you can call them that) on the table and left. Such an insult to this beautiful Japanese cuisine. There are plenty of other sushi places in this town. DO NOT GO TO THIS ONE! 
31063 I will never be back. I have a crying screaming child having severe ear pain and the staff lacks the urgency to treat and see patients. I can hear the doctors and nurses talking about the break room and blah blah blah.. Come on people! 
31064 Great store with awesome cheap close-outs. Hit and miss kinda place but you can find some great bargains here. As far as the grocery side, the meat section is small and a little overpriced but (4) stars instead of 5 overall a great place to shop! 
31065 Honestly this place has become my favorite restaurant of all time. Eating out here doesn't have to be bad for you. Best vegan options for everything you are craving. They even have happy hour! Service, deserts, meals, hours -- it's all amazing! 
31066 Very pork sandwich. Good service. Will go back. Pros: very clean facility, good cafeteria style serving line, freshly prepared, Excellent slaw Cons: ok sauce (if you life sweet sauce than you will love this), did not have enough smoke taste for my liking. 
31067 Small restaurant - good food! Huge parking lot in the back, don't miss out. Good service- I believe the owners even came out and asked about our experience. Would recommend this place for tapas! 
31068 I love maggianos the staff and food is amazing !!! 
31069 The food here was so good!! We had the mixed meat plate, lamb plate, sarma, baklava, and Turkish coffee served with Turkish delights. The owners were so nice. It was a little warm due to the lack of AC but I would be back anytime. You must stop in! 
31070 They make their own rolls which makes most their subs great. Best steak and cheese in the area. Great Italian subs. Great meatball subs. Good pizza 
31071 Block+Tackle has Roe located in the rear of it's restaurant. Sit at the bar, where the lengthier of two tasting menus is offered. French style service. Recommend the pear w/salted praline-caramel popcorn & creme anglaise. 
31072 Visited on a Sunday night recently after 8. Our server was at the top of his game and adorable without being overbearing. Live music, hooka pipe(did not partake) and excellent food with a peach sangria was all perfect. I really like it here. 
31073 I enjoyed a wonderful view from the Sun Dial restaurant. It is on the 72nd floor of the Westin hotel. As you dine the restaurant rotates and completes a 360¬§ rotation in 1 hour. Great place to take a date. 
31074 such a cute place! goodies of all sorts from candies to cookies to coffee. deli food and drinks but also loved that they cooked warm food. this was perfect for an early morning breakfast before catching our flight back to san diego. 
31075 Stopped here after seeing good reviews and was not disappointed!!! These guys are friendly and VERY thorough. For the service provided the price is unbelievable (very reasonable). Will be coming here from now on! VERY IMPRESSED!!! 
31076 Great tacos, great margaritas. Tacos are a bit small, but appropriately priced so you can order many and get a good variety. 
31077 Always packed but worth the wait. Awesome selection of specialty pancakes and killer homefries. This place has great service, great food, and reasonable prices. 
31078 Found this place roaming Fremont St. Omg! The marinara sauce is amazing, full of flavor and the crust is crispy which I like. Glad we stopped in. 
31079 This place is great! Everyone is so friendly. The atmosphere is very laid back and they always see me at my appt time. I have never had to wait James Freeman 
31080 Same service and quality across the board at Fellini's. My standard is the mushroom and spinach pizza. One slice usually does it. Fellini's is now also the unofficial sponsor of the post climbing meals. 
31081 This place was so much fun! I came here with friends a few months back and it was great! Just be prepared to get your hands dirty because the seafood is messy! 
31082 This is our go to place for Dim Sum and the selection is very broad. If you don't see it ask for it 
31083 Yum !!! 11-2 sat and sun only This is the only dim sum in town too 
31084 I too have been hassled by the oversized bouncers here about my ID & I am well over 21. Food is eh, so-so & the waitresses are ok. This place can get hopping after work, so it's good to meet people. 
31085 Service is always great but food is ok. Clam and linguini is bland and chick parm was not a hit for me. Fried calimari was too salty for me. I been here a few times and probably won't be back for a while. 
31086 The food here is amazing! We ate shredded beef and Gouda Arepas and Plantains and loved them. The Arepas were so big we'll have enough for another meal. The only bad part is that it's far from home so we can't return regularly. 
31087 Ridiculously salty. Anytime food is overly salted, it makes you wonder what they're hiding. 
31088 The work outs are energetic and fast paced. The coaches are fun. Love the program here and am seeing good results. 
31089 I LOVE this place!! Make sure you make a reservation or you'll be waiting forever. The Creole Chicken was delicious and different then a pasta dish you would get elsewhere. The ambiance and decor is beautiful. I will be back soon to try the Brunch! 
31090 Loved this place. Great ice cream, great shakes. An Austin treat. Can't say it's better than Coolhaus, seems more traditional, but definitely very good. Top notch. 
31091 Be going here for years. Love this place. A must stop. Greek Fries and Mad Greeks and Mad Americans are the best. 
31092 Great place to watch the game after work great for good drinks and small bites to eat. 
31093 I was hesitant to try it but I'm glad I did! It wasn't filled with college kids like every other Mission Hill bar, and was so affordable! $6.50 Jameson, early 2000's throwbacks, and cheap pub food. This might be my new post-shift pub of choice now! 
31094 The food looks good but it wasn't. I got the chicken and waffles the chicken wasn't fully cooked and the waffles were cold and stale. I also ordered the just peachy drink and it was pure alcohol very disappointed with the food. 
31095 An absolute must if you are in Atlanta. Great food and very attentive staff. This is the real thing. 
31096 Fantastic Food. Try the BBQ mix plate, two meals in one...unless you're really hungry. 
31097 Buca is decent, but they have the magical ability to make food 3 time more expensive than other Italian restaurants that are much better tasting than buca. 
31098 Fantastic comfort food! The staff is super fun and helpful and the food is amazing. I adore the warm chicken salad. Feels like home to eat there and it carries out to home well too! 
31099 Amazing food, atmosphere and service. Empanadas were fresh and tasty. Skinny Cuban salad is a good lunch choice. Sangria is the best in town. Highly recommend! 
31100 We went to Polaris Grill for our anniversary on a Friday night. We made a reservation but it wasn't needed - there wasn't a wait. Had a very competent Cosmopolitan. Ordered the pork chops - tender, excellent seasoning and cooked to our specifications. Delicious. Casual crowd & friendly wait staff. 
31101 This place is delicious! Great cocktails. Thank you, thank you, thank you, for amazing fried chicken! I can't wait to try the burger and the fried chicken sandwich, oh and everything else on the menu that's not vegan ;) the caramel cheesecake was AWESOME! 
31102 Awesome breakfast & service! Best German pancake I've had. Quirky ambiance. Very Portland. Love this place. 
31103 This place was super cute, there was a good band playing and the food was great!! Definitely will be back! Great date night place. They also have brunch and a patio I want to try! 
31104 I have had some freaking terrible experiences with waxing in the past. Luckily I have never been so happy with the services I receive here. Cintia and Lexi are very professional, personable and fast without making me feel rushed. I would recommend going here to anyone! 
31105 I was very pleased with the service. The wait staff was very accommodating. Great choices of food. Good atmosphere. 
31106 Fantastic. Made me feel relaxed (I'm super nervous about dental torture). Competent, friendly, efficient, organized, kind. Highly, highly recommended. 
31107 I've been coming to tokoyo for over 5 years! I love the sushi here and the service is always fast. The sushi is also reasonably priced. 
31108 Visiting from Maui! Coffee was amazing! The store is beautiful and well lit. Service wasn't very friendly other wise I would give it a 5star. 
31109 Nice interior, good drinks, but it's too pricey, loud, & full of assholes. Also, why the hell it seemed like a good idea to name a semi-posh cocktail bar after a memoir about an internment camp is something that puzzles me often. 
31110 My husband will always use Direct Tire in Watertown for his car maintenance. The employees are polite and attentive, and they explain everything to their customers. The work is down well and costs are affordable; waiting are is clean. 
31111 Went in the other day for first time it was AWESOME so many vintage games bringing back some good memories.. I spent quite some time talking with the owner and he def knows his stuff... I will def be a repeat customer. 
31112 First time stopped in and tried there jerk chicken appetizers with coco bread....it was good meat fresh bread soft n warm...than ordered salt fish with calalloo and it was good with bananas.. actual got full from appetizer. They serve big portions....price is good for some home Jamaican food... 
31113 I agree with the last review. These guys know their stuff and their prices are the best you'll find. My husband and I buy our Whey Protein there as well as protein bars. They have the latest on new products. 
31114 Falafel wrap out of this world..! I waited a little bit it was worth it ! The chef even gave me 2 falafels as an apology for the wait.. I can wait longer ;) 
31115 We were so happy to find a sub place that offered gluten free bread! They did not disappoint. The subs tasted great and they were not soggy, as some other places have been. The staff were all very nice and friendly. We enjoyed it here! 
31116 great place. very clean. friendly staff. and Erin does a great job on my nails!! 
31117 Best Chinese food ever!! So good! Fried rice was perfectly cooked not too dry. Orange chicken just spicy enough. Delivery accurate with time given. 
31118 My day starts with this place and ends with this place! Totally worth it. Favourite place for coffee the havre responsible for turning me to coffee from English breakfast tea 
31119 Awesome mexican food!!! They have white queso! :) Ordered the chips and guac with a side of queso and got free refill of chips. Yasss. The enchiladas verdes portion was hugeeee. Felt guilty and unhealthy after, but it was definitely very very satisfying! 
31120 LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant. This has quickly became one of my favorite brunch spots. I have tried quite a few items and all have been awesome. I normally order the strawberry orange juice. The staff is friendly and fast. Food comes out so quick it is scary. 
31121 Amazing bbq. Stopped by on our trip from Chicago, and we were not disappointed. The best part is that you can choose how much meat you'd like (sold by the slice), so it works for your appetite. Would definitely come back. 
31122 One of the best happy hour and lunch menus in a popular part of town. I always took out of town friends there when living on 22nd. Really great prices, worth visiting. 
31123 Delicious! We ordered the bone-fire combo platter for $42, and it was enough for 3 hungry adults. Meats were juicy, variety was on point, and Ashley (our server) was outstanding. Try to sit outside by the fire! Makes for better ambiance! 
31124 Had an amazing time with my boyfriend for lunch I had the trio of burgers they were amazing I had the butchers cute the rbq and the fried chicken sandwich they were all very yummy! I loved the milkshake I had it was different and interesting! 
31125 Great food and great service. The food was on point if you are searching for some authentic French quarter/New Orleans food. Don't be scared to enjoy the food with some wine. 
31126 Enjoyed a late night dinner yesterday with family and friends. Food was great, good selection of craft beers. We had an awsome waitress Tiffany G. She was very knowledgeable about the craft beers and the menu. Although she was very busy, she was attentive and made us feel like family. 
31127 Food was some of the best I have had in Boston better than most of the north end. Pasta was perfect and the sauce was out of the world. By next time I go to Boston I expect I will have to wait in line to get into this place. 
31128 Food and drinks were very good, well thought out, creative. Portions were tiny - my appetizer was more like an amuse bouche portion. Didn't bother me, but made my husband crazy. 
31129 The waitress was very nice. Loved the sushi rolls. Edamame was a little over cooked. So glad to see a great Asian restaurant in the area. Really loved the live music!! 
31130 Great old fashioned donuts. For the price thought don't think it's worth it. Great selection of flavors. 
31131 Incredible! I tried the chicken torta with cheese and wife had the veggie bowl. Only regret is not getting the fried egg on top. 
31132 Some of the best BBQ in Austin. Gives Salt Lick a run for their money - and we love Salt Lick. :) 
31133 This place is awesome. Food is always fantastic. Worth the wait if they are busy. The place always has a fun Park Ave vibe. 
31134 Friendly staff, very attentive! They answered all my questions. I enjoyed listening and learning about their products. 
31135 If you want great tasting Caribbean food, this is it!! Fresh and hot everyday. Friendly and clean and good prices too. I can't say enough how good this place is. We have eaten here at least four times and we crave to come back again. 
31136 The best produce in Boston -and multicultural - I'd say it rivals Bread and Circus for veggies and fruits (especially in price). Just don't shop there during prime time - it's worse than Boston traffic during rush hour - try weekday mornings. 
31137 Oksana colored my hair today: high and lowlights. She did an outstanding job at an incredible price! This was my first visit, and I will definitely be back! 
31138 $28 drop in...a bit steep guys. Everything checks out, the place is nice, but you aren't going to get much summer business with those rates. I vote to bring the drop in rates down! 
31139 Overrated and expensive. I don't care if the flavors are different everyday. Go to Voodoo and save money. 
31140 Really great Indian food where spicy actually means spicy. It's affordable and delicious! 
31141 Wow!! The service here is amazing now! The food was really delicious too. We sat at the front bar tables. The manger catherine checked onus all the time! Love this place 
31142 Love the nurturing and relaxing environment. I didn't see a single person talking on a cell phone. Love the comfy seat where the driers are. Pillows and plenty to read. Allison did a great job on my cut and highlight. 
31143 The best Thai food I have ever had. Everything was so delicious especially the taro fritters! 
31144 Had dinner here after getting engaged. Loved the atmosphere! Small, vibrant, upbeat. Felt like a locals place and not a touristy place. Sat at the bar and had great pizza and pasta. 
31145 Really good pork ribs plate. It has a good char flavor of salt, fat and spices! The pickles are a great palette cleanser so you can really taste the food. The fried rice is also very delicious! 
31146 The cakes here are delicious!! They even have an amazing gluten free cake that is chocolate chip cookie cake flavored. The name doesn't do it justice. If you're GF, you need to try it!! So yummy! 
31147 For pizza, this place is great. Sure there was a line, but you get to people watch while you wait for your slice. Good service, too. Someone on staff noticed that we had been waiting a bit and gave us 2 free beers! 
31148 Delivery was fast ! Unfortunately the food was sub par at best. The sub was nothing great and I ordered the cheese sticks as well. They are absolutely nasty. The driver was friendly and the food was still really hot when he got here. I probably won't order here again. 
31149 Great coffee, helpful staff and convenient location. I was delighted to find an indoor courtyard with seating, where you are surrounded by paintings and artwork by local artists. Will visit whenever visiting Vancouver in the future. 
31150 Came here for dinner and drinks on a Wednesday night, Tapas were great and service was pretty good, drinks took a little bit long but when the place is this busy I guess you can't blame them. Will definitely be back soon! 
31151 place is unreal. amazing food and amazing service. could not ask for more! 
31152 Absolutely amazing experience. Drinks, music, and hospitality. It's a must go!. Loved the old school music and the friendliness.. 
31153 One of the best dive bars in Portland. The drinks are cheap and VERY stiff. It really doesn't get any better than this for my money. 
31154 i'm afraid of midgets, but i'd rather wrestled 12 of the wicked little bastards covered in mayonnaise than eat at lung fung. 
31155 Don't suggest the $4 salad. Just handful of fancy greens with a scoop of greasy substance 
31156 The waitress was kind enough to remove off my bill. 
31157 This place was horrible. In addition to taking information 2 weeks prior to my visit, no one verified the insurance information. Then after my visit was complete and insurance information was verified, it turns out I wasn't covered. All of this should have been done and corrected in advance. 
31158 Try the duck wonton soup or just the duck .. Love this place ... Always have a wonderful experience ...been going here for about an year .. This is a gem .. 
31159 Great service and friendly staff. The bartender was very good too. The food was the standard setup and average. It is a decent sized club with the new design to it. Great area to relax and look outside as well. 
31160 So good, I ordered the veggie ramen with kimchee and mushers, then I had a food orgasm! I love me some ramen, no I sayin? 
31161 So good! Corn bread was sweet and not dry. Shrimp was fresh and lightly breaded; the dipping sauce that came with it was amazing! The best was the crab cake, so fresh and tasty. A must get. The food takes a while to come out but so worth it. 
31162 Went here to try their dim sum.Found the food ok,portions were small prices a little on the high side.Probably won't go there again when there are better places out there with better value for your dollar 
31163 Was very efficient, inexpensive, and professional. The guys worked hard and put our things where we wanted. I agree with the other reviews. Thanks guys! 
31164 Taco Tuesday. I get two tacos one fajita steak and one fajita chicken Mexi rice refried beans. It is the best 
31165 Good place. Could be really busy at peak hours. Generally good food and quick service! Stop by!! 
31166 I love Greek food. This was one of the worst meals I have ever had. Not only was it expensive the chicken was dry and had no flavor. 
31167 Great austin original. go for the comedy show.. it is sooo sad it is funny :) you will laugh.. you will cry.. you will try to hide.. but you will have a blast. they have great coffee but they also have beer. 
31168 Best breakfast in Lake Oswego. They use the freshest ingredients and their attention to detail even in their coffees and mimosas are worth the price. 
31169 I use Serra exclusively as they carry the items that I use. Specifically the cartridges and flower. They are very helpful, courteous, and their rewards program has saved me money. It is a clean and bright establishment very modern appearance. GAA 
31170 Delicious juice and smoothies cart. Get something with Kale in it because it's good for you. Sip serves all juices and smoothies the right way. This is a must stop by place if you are in the area or shopping at the Co Op. 
31171 Ewww....They double dip, and no plastic in the spa bowls. Nope not for me! 
31172 Had 3 baby's and my back was hurting after having kids and posture and hips were all messed up , went in and he knew right away what was wrong 
31173 He's amazing I would recommend to anyone 
31174 Holy cow. So much better and CLOSER than Boston FishHouse. I will be back. AMAZING YUMMY FOOD. the clam strips. Wow. Just wished the clam chowder was ticket w a little more calms. But other than that. WOW. GREAT JOB. 
31175 I've been here a few times and have always really enjoyed it. I usually get the Chicken Lo-Mein. I think that it is a pretty good value. 
31176 I really love living here! The location is amazing and the staff is super friendly and helpful. They also host resident appreciation events regularly and fun activities. My neighbors are super friendly- especially my dog park friends- and there is a positive social atmosphere here. 
31177 This is the place to go for sports! Great food and plenty of tvs. Excellent friendly service. Even the music playlist is legit. 
31178 Went there at 2pm to be turned away by the owner. Drove an hour to get there to try it. Will never come back. Clearly they can handle on there own 
31179 I'm surprised by all of the negative reviews! We had a big party here (with about 20 people!) and the service was incredibly accommodating, and the food was delicious! I highly recommend this establishment, and I am thrilled that there is somewhere upscale in Mount Dora to eat at! 
31180 I love the menu at this burger place. Great beer and bar, always is packed so be forewarned... 
31181 I see Dr. Jackson here (2+ years now) and have never had anything less than a great experience. She and everyone on staff are attentive, kind, patient and helpful at every turn. I can't imagine a dermatologist with a better experience overall; they're simply the best I've worked with. 
31182 Very good italian restaurant (real italian cuisine with italian owner) and good happy hour at reasonable prices. Try the pork tenderloin! And the atmosphere is nice too! 
31183 Fantastic food, great ambiance and superb staff - can't wait to come back again soon. 
31184 Small place. Great selection. Prices in line with all the other Fro- Yo places in the area. Lady running it was pleasant. Good little place. 
31185 Shop here first before going to a big box store and you'll save a lot of money. 
31186 Awesome place!!! Food was excellent, best Spanish flavor in all Orlando. We Tried: Garbanzo Frito Empanadas de Carne Callos a la madril√®ne Tortilla Espanola Alcachofas Marinaras Everything was really good. BTW, The garlic fresh bread was awesome too. 
31187 Best spin class ever with Bob, one of the owners of the Studio. I've taken many spin classes, but Bob's has a unique style. It's cardio and whole body at the same time with a lot of personal attention and fun. 
31188 Best grilled cheese ever. Tomato soup is a must if hey have it. Perfect for a cold, winter day! 
31189 I ordered through Grubhub and loved this service. The food was excellent and great for a working lunch. MMMMM 
31190 4 starts because I always have fun there. The patio is awesome and just full of life. So many people to meet and just watch if that's your thing. The drinks are good and well priced but the food is icky. 
31191 Nice place, I use this place regularly to meet up with friends on week ends. Their freshly brewed coffee is actually fresh and on occasions they game some coffee on the house while their coffee is being brewed. 
31192 Great neighborhood noodle and sushi spot. Food is universally pretty good. Service is always great --particularly Abby, who's incredibly friendly and helpful! 
31193 Bates is a great addition to the landing! They have keno (which 4square and elsarape do not have) and the nightly specials are a great extension to the menu! Plenty of seating, TVs and beers on tap! 
31194 Good thin crust pizza made from organic and gluten free ingredients. 
31195 Michael is a coffee genius! Also had the best sugar cookie of my life! We drive from Beaverton just for his fresh baked goodies! Thanks so much Michael! 
31196 We love this authentic German restaurant. Wonderful German food all run by a small German family. We go every time we come to Portland. Well known for the dill pickle soup. 
31197 Very good margaritas and very tasty Mexican food. 
31198 Great place! Amazing brews of all styles all brewed in-house; their German IPA is outstanding btw. Also, solid food options and a new chef special every day. The service is also super quick and friendly. Last but not least, TRIVIA TUESDAYS!!!!! Stormbreaker is my shiznit! 
31199 EXACTLY what was needed tonight! Wonderful food and wonderful and friendly service! We look forward to many more visits to further explore their fabu menu! 
31200 I love Mikado. It's my fav in the Austin area. However, the reason this is 4 stars is because they put spicy mayo on the spicy tuna hand roll vs. marinading the tuna spicy. Am I a total food snob or what? : P 
31201 Awesome donuts! Definitely a great balance of flavors in all the donuts we tried. Great service as well, super helpful in making our decisions. 
31202 If your shopping at Lenox Mall you might want to check this place out. I tried the Samurai Chai Mate Tea for the first time and it was the bomb! Teavana best believe I'll be back ! 
31203 Visiting Cambridge and tried this shop out. I was displeased with the politeness of the barista and my mocha was milk, Hershey syrup and an espresso shot. I wasn't impressed. However, their mushroom omelette was very good and I appreciated the presentation with greens and pita. 
31204 The cachapa and Argentinian steak meal was amazing. Very flavorful. The lomo saltado was a bit bland. 
31205 Authentic Mexican with a great price!! Guacamole is made to order. Tostada Pork Pastor is to die for! 
31206 I went to the new Burnet location and the service was excellent! The people working there are nice and amazing. The food was fantastic, although the portions were small for how much it costs. It was filling though. 
31207 This is a great place to take your animal. If you don't like being charged $60 to just walk in the door like most vets do, then you will really like this place. They have strange hours though so call ahead. 
31208 Food is good, drinks are even better! Always look for their drink special and you will be sure to snag a great deal. 
31209 Came here for a gathering of about 20 people. Great vibe for hanging out and also a wide selection of beers. The welcome flights are the way to go, super good deal. 
31210 Don't be in a hurry, don't expect to get away for less than $15 per person if you want to be happy. Do get the sides, they are ah-mazing! Fish is good to excellent depending on what is fresh, be sure to ask! 
31211 Cost-effective = No. Best pair of jeans in fit and look I've ever owned = Yes. 
31212 This is my favorite starbucks. The barista named Megan is always so cheerful & makes the best drinks! Long live Mill Run Starbs. 
31213 Stoppped in here Wednesday night to celebrate my birthday with some close friends of ours. I was the only one out of the four of us that have been here before. Lets just say that they loved the food and atmosphere. You definitely have three more fans!! 
31214 Had a killer SUP class this past weekend. Well worth my time and money. Staff was great, especially our instructor, Kelly, who was professional, fun, supportive, cognizant of all skill levels and really made the experience memorable! I will be back with friends! 
31215 My husband and I visited this spa for our anniversary and each had one of their "spa packages". We were very pleased with the experience. The entire place is very relaxing and the service was incredible. Definitely give them a shot! 
31216 Wow! Great menu, trust the chef, meal of perfection created perfectly paired with both white and red wines finished off with exquisite desserts! A MUST return! 
31217 007 was amazing, location is very laid-back, plenty of outlets and wifi--parking is a little cramped, I can see it being a problem some day, but it's a popular coffee shop on South First, so what are you gonna do? 
31218 Probably the best brunch food I have ever had. Staff is amazing and really love there jobs. Great service! Eric behind the bar was awesome! 
31219 Well, I wanted to like it but I did not, I had the barnyard burger. And you would think with all that stuff it would be very flavorful but it was not, a very average burger and very expensive for the experience. Nice facility. 
31220 Awesome Italian food. I've never had Italian in the North End, but I hear this place is way better than anything there! Everything's tasty, portions are large, and it's not too expensive! I highly recommend this place! 
31221 Service here is great. Especially if you sit at the bar. Food is consistently good and fresh. The raw oysters are the best! 
31222 Coming from San Francisco this method of public transportation is great. I rode the Red Line everyday to and from school and was able to go everywhere I needed to when I spent 6 weeks in Boston. 
31223 The seafood platter that I ordered came out hot, with good sauces. It was ok. Not worth the $16, but they know they have a captive audience. Service was adequate. 
31224 GROSS GROSS GROSS. from clam "water" chowder to greasy pizza. BLAH! Made me and both my kids sick. NEVER again. 
31225 Food is good... Prices are reasonable... Atmosphere is what you would expect.... Right down to the accordion player in the corner playing "roll out the barrel" ... Staff is friendly but a bit slow considering the few people here... Overall a good time... 
31226 I never pass through Beverly without stopping at Nicks. After all these years their roast beef is still the best on the north shore. definitely the best i've ever had! 
31227 Just as bad as any other subway with the added gross out factor of a very sketchy clientele. Bad for the neighborhood too, they intentionally blocked the drive through lane of neighboring cafe Speedboat coffee shortly after subway starting to serve breakfast. Coincidence? 
31228 Decent. At best. Overpriced for what it is. Good selection, but def not worth it in my opinion. Would've been way happier to take my money to Bamboo in NW. Pork belly yakitori was def the winner today. 
31229 First time here. Went with a friend. Typical bar and Dance floor. Pretty fun. They had quite a lot of entertainers. Decent drink prices. Pretty crowded on weekends. 
31230 I've been here three times now and each time was a great experience! Kayla does a wonderful job and makes me feel so comfortable. I will continue coming here and seeing Kayla! 
31231 Yummy! I always get the palomilla steak with black beans and rice with platanos maduros. Sometimes I get a cafe con leche too. Waiters are usually very friendly. Love this place! 
31232 Great decor, staff, and coffee. The shop is in a cute neighborhood with a colorful sign- you can't miss it. 
31233 Called in a take out order. Was told all set and would be ready in 20min. Arrive in 25min and they have no record of my order. Not that busy. Service is suspect - could use someone around who acts like a manager. 
31234 As a burger fanatic, I really loved the customizable nature of this place. Being able to make my burger however I wanted with no hassle was great. The food itself was very very good, and you HAVE to get the root beer they have on tap! Wow. 
31235 Solid authentic Mexican with really friendly staff. Great sopes. Loved the shredded beef. Really good guacamole and salsa. 
31236 Amazing food. It is great to have FRESH fish and seafood. Entry thing was hand made. 
31237 While the drinks are prepared fantastically, the staff is the best part of this bar. They are so sweet and welcoming. If I lived near here, I would be a regular. It's not often you find such great people in tandem with great drinks. 
31238 The wife and I went here for dinner. Good food and great service. We'll definitely be back. 
31239 Food and drinks were absolutely fantastic- great flavors and maybe the best burger I've had in Portland. 
31240 Everything you don't want in sushi. Three ice cream scoops of tuna out of a rubber bin. It's too big, sloppy, saucy, hard to eat and sits like cement in your stomach. Not for me. 
31241 Delicious food! I love the cuban sandwich, although for some reason, the bread always ends up a little soggy. This doesn't really detract from the delicious flavor though. They also have great daily specials. You should definitely try it!!! 
31242 Great southern breakfast - hot coffee, great atmosphere. Love this place! 
31243 Freaking Awesome!!! try the Gang Dang -- can not wait to go back 
31244 High end restaurant. Tables, utensils and floor are all very clean. Drink menu is great. Food and services are not as good as years ago. Waiters are a little arrogant. 
31245 Horrible customer service. I waited an hour for an order that got lost. I asked if I could get my bowl for free and they said no. Needless to say, I waited an hour and went home without a bowl. I will continue going to Blenders and Bowls 
31246 Hi Blue Star, My wife and daughters just flew home from Portland, they had been carrying around a Blue Star Donut box which got a lot of attention. Now I'm enjoying your donuts in Utah. They are carry on the plane worthy! Nice work. 
31247 Bar staff rocks. Great drinks and food. The live entertainment was top notch. I'm from California and I'll be back! 
31248 Great food! Really great food! The chips & salsa & guac were fresh & delicious. I had the Chili Relenios. OMG, it was good! No margaritas though & very limited seating. But I'd drive an hour + for this place. 
31249 Meh, nothing special. You get what you pay for. Big portions but the taste factor is missing. 
31250 Came for wing week and stayed for the atmosphere! Really enjoyed the braised bulgogi wings and I also got some great bacon wrapped jalapenos. A fun area of town and nice big tables. 
31251 One word:bland .Ordered 4 dishes,steelhead tartar,some pastry, chicken stuffed with rabbit,some assorted seafood in a tomato broth.Only the tartar was decent,then again, is hard to mess up tartar.Rest of the dishes either need more seasoning ,or lack the wow factor.rabbit tasted a little bitter.Service is good though. 
31252 I love Purdy's Pit Stop! Great coffee and even better baristas! The crew is just lovely and I always get some great Jo! Highly recommend this place! Autumn is my fav :) she is always super sweet and cheerful! 
31253 I absolutely LOVE this place Cape Verdean food is de-li-cious!!! 
31254 The RED VELVET CAKE Cupcake is so moist and good 
31255 Baby that HOOTENANNY HARVEST APPLES is on point with those apples in the Middle ....they are tasty......The thing I don't like were the prices and the greasy frosting.....Love the truck concept 
31256 Delicious! We searched the area for something fast and that had good reviews. The service was awesome and quick. Can't beat any toppings for one low price. 
31257 we were magically transported to Brazil.. caipirinhas with cachaca.. cerviche.. salsa band with dancing.. food and drinks all great" 
31258 One of my favorite spots! Great pizza and wings. $1 beers are an added bonus. The staff takes really good care of us as well. I walk out of there with a full belly and a little buzz for $15 bucks! Can't beat that. 
31259 Best steak tip dinner for a drive through fast food restaurant. It's really good. 
31260 This place needs to get their act together, not only did they make the reservation for the wrong number of people, we had to wait an additional half an hour PAST our reservation time. Do not come here. 
31261 Single serving and full serving meat and fruit pies. Great prices and flaky dough. You can fill your meal pie with an assortment of toppings and they have alcoholic beverages and ice cream for dessert. Open late and the service is friendly and efficient. 
31262 A beautiful way to spend a morning, rain or shine. A nicely redone classic mansion. The staff is super smart and helpful with all your questions. The views are some of the best in Portland, just beautiful. Last words...learn something! 
31263 A great place in the heart of downtown Oregon City! nothing fancy but if you want cheap food and drinks and that great bar feel then this is your place. limited seating so plan ahead but not a bad place at all! Friendly staff too! 
31264 The best fried chicken I've had (I still have a few more places on my fried chicken bucket list to try out). Will drive to Austin (from Houston) anytime I have a taste for it. The fried green tomatoes are straight from God's kitchen. Highly recommended! 
31265 I love this place I'm a lifetime customer...great food, great customer service and the Manager always makes sure my family is satisfied........p.s. try the Rice Krispies with the Mexican caramel it's delicious!!!!!!!!!! 
31266 The food here used to be good enough that I could overlook Nida's rude service. Not anymore. The food has progressively gotten worse and Nida is still just as rude. 
31267 The club is on the newer side. I like the scarlet red velvet curtains. Dancing area is smaller than we thought. The music is too heavy metal for our crowd and a little hard to dance to. Floor is sticky. 
31268 I made two trips there, my first & my last. The food is mediocre and they use chipped plates and no real ambiance. I won't be back. 
31269 the food is ok but the service sux. you wait at least half an hour for food, then you wait another half an hour to serve. 
31270 READ YOUR CONTRACT very carefully! They charge you 75% of all of your REMAINING MONTHS when you close your account. Just a word to the wise for anyone reading this. 
31271 We always order them via Grubhub and the food is always delivered on time. Their boneless chickens are great. We have tried almost all of the flavors they offer, and the best of them might be buffalo (only our personal opinion). 
31272 How do you generally feel about good things? Delicious things? Well then, go to Pattycake. I recommend the chocolate cupcakes, lemon cupcakes, and pumpkin cookies sandwiched together with pumpkin spice frosting. 
31273 I find it exceedingly unfair that we have such an abundance of crepes in Seattle but no waffle stands. Just try to convince someone to drive you for 3 hours for your waffle fix. It ain't happening. Please eat a waffle for me. 
31274 Lovely little donut/coffee shop. The guy that worked there was very patient and helpful. The coffee was great and some of their pastries are monstrously sized. Very nice price range there too. 
31275 Incredible service by genuine people. High quality coffee and food. Owners take great pride in their options and it shows. Highly recommend. 
31276 I like the deivision of this place (dance upstairs typically live music downstairs. Only problem is expensive drink (typical of Fanueil Hall) and crowded dance floor. I typically have a good time when I go here, despite the lack of elbow room. Not a place to go and talk, though. 
31277 Went in to grab a slice of pizza last night and the staff was really friendly. Pizza was definitely better than ok, but I wouldn't call it great. I'm sure I'll see them a few more nights. 
31278 Went for a meeting and breakfast and great little place. Plenty a room for a meeting, people are friendly and very comfortable. I really like this place, food is great also. You need to stop by and check it out. Very Austin. 
31279 Do not stay here. Elevators broken. Tried to eat in restaurant but waited 15min and never got recognized by the 1 and only waitress. Not really her fault i guess but at least acknowledge me when your busy. Will not be back. 
31280 Karen from ipic hr asks for your info but never follows up. Seems I'm not the only one this happened to 
31281 I lived in Thailand for a year and this is the only place in Austin I've found with som tom- an awesome spicey papaya salad! Also have nam tok! 
31282 Ate here today with my family 
31283 I thought the food was ok. I think that it is better choice than Golden Corral 
31284 Flan for dessert is a good choice. 
31285 Got delivery, it was prompt and hot. The fries were okay. The falafel was close to the worst I have ever had, flavorless. The hummus tasted like it had cinnamon. Couldn't eat most of the food, very disappointed. 
31286 This is a 5 star place. Innovative and fresh seafood. Small and local. Oysters, soups and lots of different and New takes on local New England things from the sea. Place is small so make a reservation. 
31287 They don't carry a lot of stuff. I wanted to buy a Too Faced lip gloss, but they didn't carry that brand. The shop assistance was very helpful, though. 
31288 This hotel is amazing! Everything and more you would come to expect from a Disney Resort. Grand Lobby, gorgeous pool, and amazing views of the lake in the rear of the property. Monorail and Ferry stops on site, very easy to get around! 
31289 With only two hairstylists my son had to wait for about 45 minutes,next time he will check in online. Haircut was good. 
31290 Reasonable but not extensive number of selections. Food in general excellent. Price is also reasonable for the weekday buffet. Garlic naan is one of the best naan I had. Very clean place and kids friendly. 
31291 I ate at the restaurant bar. Food was pretty innovative and good. Nice atmosphere. Good location. I look forward to going again. 
31292 Really great find for just stumbling upon the closest place we could grab a coffee! Tasty salads and smoothies, dog friendly outdoor seating area, quirky and quintessential Austin atmosphere. 
31293 They just started Sunday brunch! I guess the hours on Yelp haven't been updated yet. The food and atmosphere are awesome. Not pricey either. 
31294 Bowling was fun and cheap. The lanes malfunction a lot but they get fixed pretty quickly. Food is good and cooked to order. I had the wings, fries, and fried okra.The pink lemonade is really sweet but its good. 
31295 One of the best restaurants! Everything is great but I usually end up ordering the lamb popsicles. Well worth the wait. 
31296 Excellent! You can find a lot of fun accessories there, including fun hosiery and hand-made arm-warmers. Customer service is very good and store owners care about their customers. 
31297 Their juice is really fresh and tasty. I've been to the cart in SE and Alberta and the people were really nice and willing to accommodate special requests. 
31298 I went for brunch this morning, what a great place, it was a surprise for me. The waitress was so nice. I ate French toast, it was excellent, good portion. The place it a must!!! 
31299 I've been here twice. It's a little spendy, especially for lunch but well worth it. Portions are big and there are so many choices. The hardest part is deciding what to order. Everything is delucious! 
31300 I have been going to this place for years. The staff is amazing, the services are great and best of all they keep it CLEAN! Love my nail shop! 
31301 Seriously. This place is changing the world! I love everything about it and all the awareness they raise. Making a difference is rad! 
31302 What a surprise to find an amazing rest in downtown. Literally a basement cafe serving up good eats. A must try and a must retry. 
31303 Had to visit for needed supplies while in Atlanta. Short cheap Uber from the Convention Center. Good service. 
31304 Hands down, the best Mexican food (dare I say best restaurant) I've ever had and that's coming from a former Los Angeles native where there are a TON of EXCELLENT Mexican restaurants! 
31305 When I said I didn't want my pint in a plastic cup, I got refused. GFY!! I'm not a fratboy!! 
31306 The men's selection isn't as broad despite the store's size. I was able to find something that would do, but some styles have limited sizes available and some brands are poorly represented. The prices are good and I guess that's the trade-off. 
31307 Pizza=5 stars! Excellent crust! Toppings=5 stars! We ordered four toppings and the pizza was loaded with each of the four. Staff=5 stars! Personable & efficient. Atmosphere=4 stars! Booths & tables in three dining rooms We will be back! 
31308 The best pizza and calzones around. They have been expanding their menu and now offer Falafel which is uncommon to find in the local suburban sandwich shoppes. The two guys I usually see when I am there are pleasant and efficient. 
31309 Tried this place since it was in the neighborhood and I love their other place, Ria's. Food was good but nothing exciting and a bit pricey. 
31310 I love this salon. I got a mani & pedi and they did an excellent job. The salon is immaculate. I definitely recommend this salon! 
31311 Lovely atmosphere with extremely knowledgeable and friendly hosts. Love this place for drinks with one or two special people. 
31312 Solid stop during my visit with a knowledgeable bartender about all beers on tap. Try the amazing pork bell tacos with a watermelon slaw!!! Probably the best meal I had this go round in Austin. 
31313 Paisley was our amazing server! It's my birthday celebration with the family! The food was amazing. 
31314 Loved the vibes of this shop and loved Jason Mackenzie even more! He is an amazing artist and did a great job on my families matching tree tattoos! 
31315 Jason was awesome! Very informative for my first time. Chill place-check it out :) I'll be back! 
31316 Walked in 4 years ago when it was (James Madison Salon). From the first minute I knew this was going to be perfect. Sue is amazing and always does a superb job. I now travel all the way from Sandy Springs and look forward to my visits. Happy Customer...... 
31317 I must've ordered incorrectly because I ordered a grilled chicken salad with hummus and got a sandwich instead. Whatever, it wasn't bad but wasn't my favorite thing either. 
31318 Lovely venue for the North Shore Magazine Women's Night Out event. I really hope they have it here again. Beautiful old mansion gives a specialness to an event of shopping and smoozing. Very clean and historical and the grounds were beautiful. 
31319 I really enjoy my wraps from this place. I love the interior too. The price isn't too high and they provide a good product. 
31320 I went here a few weeks ago and had the best experience. The food was amazing and fresh, the service was excellent. The two people serving us which we think might have been the owners were so friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend!! 
31321 When I miss living in Birmingham, Alabama, I come here. Then I remember why I moved to Boston. 
31322 I belive that they used inferior glass. After a year, the windsheild is full of dings and is now once again cracked, and needs replacment. I will not be using safelite again. 
31323 I used to order from here all the time when I lived in Boston, and I thought it was really good for a neighborhood pizza place. Good subs too. The people were also very nice. 
31324 Worst Thai food ever! Over seasoned. Fried rice was burned. Ginger chicken was soaking on oil. Chicken satay taste like rubber. 
31325 One word: garbage. Rude staff and the lady who did my french manicure, I believe her name Kim, made the lines uneven and there are spots of white outside the lines and on my fingers and palms. Absolute garbage. 
31326 Great donuts. Portland has great donut shops and this is one of the best (MUCH better than Voodoo). The shop was really nice, in a great part of town, and the blueberry bourbon basil donut was amazing (maybe the best donut I've had). 
31327 this place is OK, the servers check in a little too often and can get a bit annoying. Somewhat good food. Would come back again but not often! 
31328 Not bad, but also not fantastic. I had the gnochi bolognese, and it was tasty, but nothing to knock my socks off. It hit the spot in a pinch, but I wouldn't go out of my way. 
31329 The waffles are really good, but if you've ever seen the Portlandia "Brunch Village" sketch, you know what to expect: this place is too popular for its own good, meaning it's almost always packed, service is a little slow, and your bites are aspirationally priced. Recommended, but with some caution. 
31330 I agree with the pricing - it is a bit high. Perhaps the rent is expensive here? Who knows. The only thing I've seemed to find cheap here are books. They do seem to run sales relatively often, just never when I go there...odd. 
31331 Very nice and friendly and willing to work within your budget! 
31332 My favorite Japanese steak house. Great value for lunch. The food is excellent and never burnt. 
31333 Cozy vibe, great place to study. Bring a charged computer incase you don't grab an outlet, though! 
31334 Doesn't get better than this. Creativity, taste, amazing options-- everything a wonderful surprise. Best grilled edamame EVER. 
31335 I really enjoyed this place. They have a friendly staff, great tacos and sauces, and a good vibe overall. Fun place, will return next time I visit ATX. 
31336 Their chile relleno en crema is one of Austin's best meals. It's also one of the few places in town where you can get real interior Mexican food -- pepian sauces, ancho chile sauces, and deeply rich moles. I'm pretty indifferent to the atmosphere but the food is outstanding. 
31337 Great band. Horrible, rude, bartenders with bad customer service. They actually ask if you will tip them good before they serve you! Wouldn't come back here if someone paid me. 
31338 This is the best restaurant I've ever eaten at in my life and this isn't an exaggeration. Do yourself a favor and visit the place. Close your eyes and pick anything on the menu. You're guaranteed to win. 
31339 My hand surgery healed nicely and my finger nail is looking normal again. I suffered only a little pain for less than 2 days. 
31340 High prices for a taco joint. $16 for a skirt steak (4 pieces) 1 taco $4, with rice and beans is a bit too high. I am gonna emphasize on the service, maybe WE got a rookie server but, she kept disappearing and did not check back often on us. 
31341 OMG, the best bagels ever! If you need more evidence, just check their website - their product is endorsed by the one and only Hanz Gruber! 
31342 Worst cab company of all-time. Sometimes they don't even answer their phone. I've no idea how they're still in business. 
31343 Great sports bar. Standard drink prices and a good crowd. There is a lot of seating and good music too. You couldn't look somewhere without seeing a TV. I would recommend it as a place to go and watch the game and there are Red Sox fans by the plenty. 
31344 Great burger and fries! Flow of restaurant can be confusing for first timers but friendly staff was able to assist. Luckily there wasn't a wait for us and food came out promptly. Garlic fries were great to share. Loved the boozy drinks! Great lunch or dinner option and family friendly! 
31345 I've had better Indian food in bigger cities like London, but this is good for being in Texas. The place was packed and it was a bit of a wait despite having reservations. Food came out fairly quickly though. Overall a good experience. 
31346 Avocado margaritas! Sticky booth seats! Veggie Molletes! Stoned-ass waiters! Kiss-ass managers! Nogale sauce! WHY THE EFF DID BOTH NORTH AUSTIN LOCATIONS CLOSE?!!!!??? *Note: Avocado ritas best with a buttload of tabasco sauce in 'em. What? Try it! 
31347 My wife and i really enjoy the food at the Antique table! Actually perfer here over the North end, fantastic food great ambiance and service. 
31348 Far better option than chipotle. Guacamole is included and you don't feel like your stomach is turned inside out afterwards.
