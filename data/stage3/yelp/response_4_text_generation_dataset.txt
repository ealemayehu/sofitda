[BEGIN] Great food, always hot and fresh. I wish they had more vegetarian options though. good price. It gets very busy and loud so eat early is possible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best bubble tea/slushee/sweet drink place I've ever been to. I really enjoy their fruity drinks (anything with mango) and also their cold horlicks and ovaltine. All the fruity drinks are made with fresh fruit, portions are generous and prices are great! Nothing much else to ask for.  [END]
[BEGIN] food was excellent, the owner himself asked us if we enjoyed our food and then he said he has something for us, he ends up bringing out a new chocolate dessert on the house. He is a super sweet, caring guy and it definitely shows. Thank you !!!  [END]

[BEGIN] Loved this venue. It has several places to stand so you can see the band from different angles. Also, they always bring great music to Austin.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious, but get there earlier rather than later if you want the full selection. They had vegan options, too, but we didn't try them. Their buttermilk bars are amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I honestly cannot get enough of their lavender latte! This place is always poppin' during morning and slows down a bit in the afternoon. The food is tasty but on the heavier and more flavorful side. Please do yourselves a favor and order their waffles, you won't regret it.  [END]

[BEGIN] Best "fried chicken" out there, Asian flair or not. Great customer service. I also had their grilled salmon salad - not a traditional Korean dish, but was extremely tasty and fresh. Tteokbokee is also to die for. Ask for it without the cheese for an authentic Korean taste.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I adore this place. It's the best we've found since moving down here from Seattle/Tacoma. Broth is always perfect, meat is still rare in the soup when you get it, and they don't skimp on the noodles. A great pho experience.  [END]

[BEGIN] I have three things I dislike, and one I love when dining out...Matador is doing well for me on all accounts. Tequila at it's finest and 21 and over for the whole place. Beautiful. It's adult time, and a killer atmosphere to boot. I'll be back... ;)  [END]
[BEGIN] We are regulars (every Sunday) at Uncle Charlie's Finer Diner. Love the food, quick service, but most importantly the amazing staff. They are so welcoming - I feel like they're family Given all the local breakfast places, I choose Uncle Charlie's  [END]

[BEGIN] Best value for best tasting ice cream. This is a win/win situation. Don't tell them I might have paid double what they charge. Seriously though, don't cos that's one of the huge appeals of this place. Great flavors & a friendly staff that encourages sampling.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome food at a great price. Service was prompt and very friendly. I would go back in a heartbeat.  [END]

[BEGIN] One of my favorite Portland restaurants. It's 30 degrees outside so of course they provide lap blankets and have a warm fire lit. The service is always amazing, and your server will always explain menu items and specials with enthusiasm.  [END]
[BEGIN] Emo time (in couplets). ....... Filled with self-loathing Full of foreboding 6 years I've been near Delayed coming here Why oh why Cry cry cry What the fuck, I suck. Caffeine: Clean, pristine. Tip well Or go to hell. ....... End Emo rant. I really like the coffee.  [END]

[BEGIN] Even more menu options than the original location on Grand. This includes whipped garlic--garlic, olive oil and lemon juice (pretty intense but novel!) and the Arabian Breeze Mezza.

[BEGIN] Amazing. Lavender latte - such a treat. Love this place for lunch or brunch!  [END]

Plus they have Japanese candy and snacks! The Neighborhood Eatery is a welcome fixture to the downtown Orlando lunch and dinner options.  [END]
[BEGIN] Long lines but easily one of the best burgers in town!  [END]
[BEGIN] Big portioned southern cooking as its finest. I'm a vegetarian and there are always options for me. The peach cobbler is terrific as is the sweet tea. You can't go wrong  [END]
[BEGIN] The donuts really live up to the hype. They're so soft, I wish I could just get some kind of Union Square Donuts loaf of bread. Come early in the day because they can run out of certain flavors.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was an excellent place to eat! It's cheap and quick and authentic. We really enjoyed it after our last day at Disney!  [END]

[BEGIN] Are they playing soccer on more than two screens? Yes Do you want an entire fish cooked to perfection in your taco? Yes Only fault is the lighting, its romantically weird for lunch alone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kiki at Mod Salon is amazing - total perfectionist, lovely, kind and talented! I love my cut and color - she's the real deal highly recommended oh and she gave my 6 year old daughter a perfect cut too  [END]
[BEGIN] Honestly the best street tacos I've had here since moving from LA. Salsa counter was a great touch. If you gave this place a bad review you belong at La Mariposa or Three Margaritas.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best stylist at Leeba is Charbel!!! He is really great at what he does. Cuts are incredible, expert colorist and a nice guy. Go to Leeba if only to see Charbel he is the best in Boston.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recently moved to the area and have been tired of the same places over and over so we found this place and tried it a couple of weeks ago and it did not disappoint. Pizza and fettuccine were our favorites so far! And it's a plus that they deliver!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very friendly and honest staff. Well organized with a better selection than almost every other Barnes & Noble in the area. A+ selection of vinyl records that anyone can easily find something to fit their personal tastes. My new first Barnes & Noble stop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the Tacos and they where great! A little disappointed in the smoked jalapeños. They give you 2 for a side but they are cut in half so didn't seem like a side more like a tease.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent buffet that is well worth the price! The salad bar is updated regularly and the soup choices were vast. There's pasta, pizza and a potato bar! Not to mention soft serve ice cream! The staff was friendly and eager to help.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I get takeout here at least twice a month. So delicious, all dishes have so much flavour. You must have the "prawn d'piaza". One of the best (probably the best) Indian dishes I've ever had and I LOVE Indian. Fast service on takeout too. Love this place!  [END]
[BEGIN] I went here for brunch yesterday with two friends and the service was amazing and the food was excellent!!! Highly recommend this place! We ordered various items on the brunch menu and also cocktails the server recommended and everything was awesome!!!! Great place! I will be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have ordered directly, or purchased at Hope Farmers Market: 2 King Cakes, Caramels, Nougat, Ribbon Cookies, and various other treats. The flavors, textures, and quality are always second to none. But most important, everything they have is just GOOD!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place! Really nice inside with an insane beer list and yummy food! Great stop. Lots of tvs too for sports people. Oh and pool tables/darts. Go try some new beers.  [END]

[BEGIN] This place was great! The food was amazing and the baklava was the best I've ever had. It was not the most fancy place inside but if you care about great food I would go there. No clue as to why it is not a 5 start overall.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is consistently good. Generous portions, fresh, and healthy. Where else can you get wild caught salmon at a fast casual restaurant. But the real treasure here is the most excellent customer service by Alex, who operates the front counter! He's engaging, funny and makes us want to return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing service. Amazing food. My only regret is that I didn't get an entree. We got the tasting menu and it was fabulous but, not enough food and the time between courses was too long. I will be back to try brunch and maybe dinner.  [END]
[BEGIN] My local go to for a nice variety of pizza and pasta. The pizza is traditional and does not have that fast food feeling. Many great options, even some for vegans! I usually get the Mediterranean pasta or the veggie Stromboli with no cheese.  [END]

[BEGIN] Love this place! The cream of garlic soup is really good and everything is done with so much Austrian flair, even the way the bacon is cooked. The potato salad too was really good. Highly recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] Was looking for a Benjamin Moore paint dealer in the Stoneham area and ended up at Spartan Hardware. Great selection of paint and color chips. Staff was friendly and the store has it's own parking lot right in front of the store. I'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Five stars simply by the playlist. Non-stop Depeche Mode. Will be back to try this place out soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] My new favorite spot in South End. Seriously good espresso. Counter Culture Coffee served by Espresso Royale and Thinking Cup alumni. There's a nice and quiet window-filled room in the back so it's a good place to do some work or read a book.  [END]

[BEGIN] I walked away from this tour genuinely surprised at how much I learned. Bobby offers a refreshing take on our founding fathers, defining moments in our nation's history and Boston's landmarks all while hitting up some of Boston's finest pubs.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the burgers I had (Greek and Magic Shroom) but the winner is definitely the Sea Salt Caramel shake and I don't like caramel!  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely worth the wait! My favorite burger in Austin. Their beet is always cold, staff is friendly and burgers and fries are delicious! Magic Shroom, Primetime, Ahi Tuna are my favorites!  [END]
[BEGIN] This was an excellent meal with beautiful presentation, with very good service. Unexpected for a hotel restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely peaceful atmosphere, delicious macaroons and a great assortment of teas. A perfect place to spend time on a rainy day.  [END]
[BEGIN] So delicious. Maple bacon was outrageously good, hazelnut crumb and vanilla bean both fantastic, bourbon caramel least great. Yeah they're expensive, but they're worth it. I don't care about the cultural commentary of other reviewers, just shut up and enjoy the damn donut. *concise is nice*  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome sushi and even better service. I have a gluten allergy and they made special sushi rolls just for me. Delicious! So accommodating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty dang great! I believe it's the best fried chicken in town. I go here pretty often on my lunch break when I work at the Convention Center.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the sweet verde juice and it was amazing. My boyfriend ordered the tropical green smoothie but that one was not as good. Wheat grass shot is served with an orange slice. Prices and quantity are reasonable and you can't beat the freshness!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fabulous coffee and excellent breakfast tacos. Great outdoor space for eating outside. Service is good. Sometimes there are lots of kids there on the weekend mornings but families have to get coffee as well, no? And the weather! Way to go Cherrywood!  [END]
[BEGIN] The best mexican food around! Went for my birthday. They are so nice and accommodating  [END]
[BEGIN] OH. MY. GOD. guaranteed the best doughnuts you will eat & they're vegan on top of it. they're not you're typical circle either. these are bigger than your hand, delicious, flaky, puffy, iced goodness. just try it. just do it.  [END]
[BEGIN] New found gem... Great inerior design, spacious but home feel. Great drinks and service. They totally get the South Austin feel and in harmony with the texture of SoCo  [END]
[BEGIN] Good variety for vegetarian taco options! Cute and generally chill interior, I love that it is slightly out of the way of Krog Street market because that makes it feel more like an intimate neighborhood spot. Very friendly staff. I wish they were open on Sundays.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great environment. Very romantic. A little stuffy but nice for a date night out. Amazing food. Pricey.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best Chinese food I've ever had ! Food was fast and fresh! Absolutely love the teriyaki rice bowl ! Come guys ! You should try it !  [END]

[BEGIN] Diane was awesome.She cleaned my kitchen and both bathrooms and they looked a lot better than what they did before!!  [END]

[BEGIN] I have been there more than once and wonder why it isn't packed. Great food and nice folks. Check it out! Garlic knots are fabulous. The salads and pasta are very fresh. Good house chianti also. Help it stay open with the new train coming!  [END]
[BEGIN] I went to Austin for the first time in June and had the pleasure of finding the awesome kitchen at Javelina. The Javelina burger is fantastic, service was great, and they had some interesting drink recipes that we tried and enjoyed. Definitely worth the visit to Rainey St!  [END]

[BEGIN] Amazing food, service, and feel. Wasn't a big fan of brunch but that certainly changed after hitting up Catch 122.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried several desserts that were great. Must try the Greek honey biscuit. Dense, lightly spiced, warm, and melts in your mouth. Not too sweet, just perfect. Almost like a scone but warm and more of a cake like consistency.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm loving this place and its brunch menu. Today was my second time visit, and I have tried Dirty Breakfast, Chorizo Hash, The Catch 122, and Eggs Benedict. They were all CAD$13 and in good portion. I will definitely try out their happy hour and dinner menus!  [END]

[BEGIN] There's no excuse not to come check it out. At most, it'll take ya 10 minutes to get to the top. I enjoy going early morning on week days. It's a short trail, good view, and not a pain to get in and out of.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent food...I mean EXCELLENT. The butternut squash soup was exceptional, the pork shank was terrific, and the chocolate dessert was fantastic...and they had Chartreuse...of which I availed myself a snifter.

[BEGIN] Wow! Great sliders! Seriously, this is a great spot to get something real quick and then blown away with how good it is. I had the Steel slider and it was perfect. Also like the Portland bridge theme with the slider names. Next time I'll try the fries...  [END]
[BEGIN] Very professional and high quality product. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated with scheduling using google calendar.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best around. Healthier than ice cream and just as creamy and flavorful! I love the plain tart. Prices are reasonable, I will be a repeat customer for sure!  [END]

[BEGIN] I don't know about favoritism, but I've known Derek for years, and that's something he does not practice when it comes to business. Hands down best in Everett.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fukami has consistently impressed me and equally continues to raise the bar. My expectation for sushi and subsequent disappointment at Portland's other, less traditional Japanese cuisine, is reinforced by Fukami's dedicated approach.  [END]

[BEGIN] I've had these guys over for 3 separate jobs and each time they are professional, efficient and nice. We tried a Craigslist plumber once and he was just awful. Pay a little more and go with these guys. Will call them again with our next issue (hope there's no more!).  [END]
[BEGIN] Great SoCo spot to eat. Outstanding food and service. Don't miss the migas. We'll be back.  [END]

[BEGIN] 作为harbor point的居民平时不想出去吃，就会去楼下吃他家的。 就凭他给我提供了一个有的时候早上起来能吃上一碗热的面机会 这个五星我就给了。哈哈 这家店的优势在于它的地理位置。hp里，附近确实有很多学生，包括中国学生。不喜欢自己做饭，又不想开车，或点外卖的就会这家店。但是感觉如果有竞争的话他们应该会很快没有办法维持。第一，很多我身边的朋友都觉得这家店的食物在波士顿是中等以下。第二，服务确实差了一点。感觉他们用的都是这边的学生没有什么服务经验。 推荐牛肉面，咖喱牛肉饭，如果喜欢鸭脖什么的人 可以试试。  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and hotel is built as a 360 so each room has different city views which is unique and our view of park and Ferris wheel was great at night  [END]
[BEGIN] The waiting room there is very comfortable and the staff truly cares. Unbelievable experience!!!  [END]

[BEGIN] Two dollar mimosas on Sundays and friendly bartenders always fun when we watch the charger games on Sundays  [END]

[BEGIN] What this place lacks in ambiance it makes up for in quality and service. I will never visit Vancouver without a stop at Best Quality Sweets for take out gulab jamun and samoas. Super nice people.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been a couple of times, and the pizza has been excellent. Pricey, but delicious. Great beers on tap, as well.  [END]

[BEGIN] Awesome. Never been to a Ramen restaurant before. So good! The noodles were homemade and you could tell. Broth was great, not salty like I am used to out of a package lol. Wait staff explained menu and options to me. Very nice place  [END]
[BEGIN] Great salon, great service. And, since it's an Aveda salon, the products were wonderful. Thanks FX!  [END]

[BEGIN] Fotini, is upfront and honest and a pleasure to visit. The ambiance is very relaxed and spa like. I loved the results from the cold laser. Smoother and brighter skin as promised!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been twice great selection of local beer food was very tasty atmosphere was very nice mussels were fabulous and also crab cakes were good  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it. But don't leave anything of value visible in you car. Very sophisticated car burglars. Broken glass and a trail of ATM and credit card charges in three different directions simultaneously. The cemetery is a true jewel of this city.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a great spot! The food is delicious, the staff is above and beyond some of the friendliest in town, and they have a full bar. It's often empty, but I've eaten here many times and loved it, so I don't know why. Check it out!  [END]

[BEGIN] The best assortment of meats, always delicious! The salad bar rocks with shrimp, gourmet cheeses, tabouleh, etc! Their desserts are heavenly if you can save room for one. It's hard not to over-indulge in the Brazilian meat when they keep bringing more and more!  [END]
