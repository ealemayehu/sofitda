15566 3 Yay, vegan slices, available late! My favorite vegan pizza in Portland, and that's saying a lot! 
15567 3 This place is definately still open and the service and time estimate is always spot on. Friendly and efficient. I first went there from a coupon and I continue to return. 
15568 1 I tried the chicken tandoori and goat curry one evening. Chicken tandoori was okay but goat curry was not at all tasty. It tasted dull and goat was not well cooked. Not a good restaurant , there are better restaurants in the area. 
15569 4 I have had many Chinese massages, and this is a very good place to go. The price is excellent and the massages I have had here have been wonderful. It has been getting busier, so make an appointment. 
15570 4 The guy went trough my entire car let me know what it needed. Great and quick service. Definitely recommend it for people who need to get a quick oil change at a great price and great service. 
15571 4 Just go and find out! Be sure to drink way too much and over tip the staff! 
15572 1 If only there were a restaurant category for "tourist trap" and you were warned before you got there. Alas, I wasn't. Really expensive seafood eaten at a picnic table under a tent. Um, no. I'm good, thanks. 
15573 4 Most Honest shop in the Somerville area,bar none !..I've been going here for 20 years,always get treated more than fair..Thanks Charlie,and Jimmy..A.G. 
15574 3 Ordered a BBQ Beef banh mi for 3 dollars, can't complain. A lot better than most places for the price in the Boston area. 
15575 4 Wow so delish! Gnocchi, spaghetti bolognese and prosciutto pizza were amazing! Super friendly service in a cozy, warm atmosphere. 
15576 0 Someone reached out from corporate and said someone from the retail section would contact me. They reinforced the poor customer server by the retail section not contacting me. Typical crappy customer service. 
15577 4 Very nice hiking trail! Water was super low but that's expected to happen in the summer. I enjoyed every moment omg he trial. 
15578 3 Delicious cupcakes on a food truck. The service is always great. My favorite is the bananarama...I might be spelling that wrong but it's just full of awesomeness. 
15579 4 Fantastic service and great food. The menu selection is huge and you can't go wrong with any of them. Only negative is the parking. But if you from Somerville or Medford it is pretty common. Must try at least once if your in the area. 
15580 4 i have been coming to salon monet for years and never leave disappointed. the staff is great, it's located in a convenient location, and i get everything from wax to haircuts. i highly recommend this salon! 
15581 3 I like Zo a lot. I got the greek salad with chicken. Everything was really fresh and the service line moves quickly. This may sound silly but my favorite part of the dish was the warm and fresh pita bread. It was the best pita ever! 
15582 4 First time and it was worth the wait! My dog enjoyed the food as well! We will definitely be back soon! Best service and great food 
15583 0 0 Stars! THE WORST! Do not get Century Link! Horrible connection and horrible customer service. 
15584 4 I have used Chef Gil for many events. He always is on time, and prepares the most delicious foods! He goes above and beyond with each event, and we will continue to use him for every event I plan! 
15585 3 Friendly staff, big portions, tasty food. We really haven't had a bad experience. Good margaritas! 
15586 4 Five stars for the moon milk! The coffee is pretty good too, not the best in my opinion but it's definitely worth coming for the summermoon or wintermoon. Sometimes you just crave that moon milk! 
15587 4 Love this place. Love watching movies and eating food. Orders go through pretty fast. Love the Jam & Aioli Burger. Love the Chocolate Chip Cookie Shake too. 
15588 4 I go to Thai Bistro once a week for lunch. I love their yellow noodle and Aroy (soy sauce base) soups. Always full of flavor. These dishes are not on the actual lunch menu but they will make whatever you ask for! 
15589 4 Literally don't have words. Condado is the GOAT. I just had the tres amigos this time but I love the tacos too! Also love this locations vibes. So awesome! 
15590 4 Smaller then the Mother Ship but still has a great selection. This is my goto store at the airport for a little travel reading. The people are helpful and always full of suggestions. Keep up the great work Powell's one of Portlands finest 
15591 3 Very nice view. Clean, modern style rooms. My husband and I will definitely stay here again. 
15592 1 What happened? This place used to have the best nachos. Today my nachos had stale bagged chips. No guacamole just 3 thin slices of avocado. So disappointed. 
15593 3 Great burger and fries! More than enough to be stuffed and great topping choices as well. Helps that the food is ethically grown, reasonably priced and quick service. Also had a grown up banana bread soda float as I was being adventurous and it was delish!!!!!! 
15594 3 Had a great fast lunch! The salmon sandwich was great:) I told them I needed to be in and out in 35 minutes. They did a great job getting my order to me fast! 
15595 4 This guy is awesome! Super friendly and great and fast work. The price is also great compared to other overpriced barber shops. I definitely recommend this place! 
15596 1 This place is a hit and a miss and my last few outing have been duds but that was like 2 years ago at least it seem that long to me. Thinking about going to check it out again and give them another chance. 
15597 4 They do not do acrylic nails for obvious reasons, and I don't have strong nails to grow them out. Otherwise I would only go to this salon. Service is phenomenal, ladies who work here are great. 
15598 3 For traditional charuscaria brazileira this place works. Very reasonable, very hard working service. Worth the trip 
15599 0 Ordered a burger that was not cooked at all in the middle and all they could offer me was 10% off my meal. That is not acceptable. I guess they don't care if any of their patrons get sick. 
15600 4 Some damn fine fried chicken. Bout the best I've had. 
15601 3 We got the melon and chocolate bouqet for our office. It was pretty tasty. The fruit was fresh, not too ripe or unripe. The only gripe would be that the condensation in the bag caused the chocolate to get wet. Wet chocolate isn't good, folks. 
15602 3 $1 raw oysters at happy hour. Sushi is high quality but expensive. Your servers are authentic Japanese people with accents. Some of them are quite attractive. 
15603 4 I love it so much!!! I celebrated my 50th birthday there and it was fantastic !!! The food , The atmosphere , The stuff , Music !! Everything was just great !!! Highly recommend to everyone 
15604 0 Ugh. Probably the worst burger I ever had. I literally have to go to the bathroom to gag myself. I will not go to this place ever again. 
15605 4 Beautiful, cheap... a lot better than initially expected! Beautiful big jacuzzi tub, two sinks, a tv that actually works & a little living space adjoins the hall and bedroom. Complimentary breakfast is pretty good too! 
15606 0 Like the review below states there is nothing urgent about this place. A twl hour wait and there is no one in the waiting room.. You could be seen faster at an emergency room. Awful service. 
15607 0 Very slow service. Only one person behind the counter after midnite. Signage indicated fastbreak members can proceed to garage to get car. But not true after midnite. The fastbreak booth was closed after 1am. They do not tell you that on the signage in front of the budget airport counter 
15608 4 Food was wonderful!! Service was also relatively quick and efficient for our big group. Also the burrito was filling, the guac that was paired with it tasted great as well. Highly suggest the 20 oz beer deal with refills that they offer 
15609 3 Had first hair cut in a long time (I usually cut it myself) and I picked a great place. Stacey was excellent at men's hair cuts. Also, can't beat the price for a professional hair stylist. 
15610 3 Great food and service. I had the dirty pig and my buddy had the brisket sandwich. Delicious! Really enjoyed the selection on beer too. 
15611 3 great food! i've never been in the restaurant but i always order delivery here. volcano sushi, cali roll and that other one i can eat are really good. not big on sushi as i can't eat raw fish. their teriyaki and chicken wings are good too. 
15612 4 Sew Creative and it's sister store Creative Yarns are wonderful local places to explore and shop. Sew Creative has a focus on cottons for quilting, and they offer classes. They have a wide selection of prints and colors - and, you are supporting the local economy! 
15613 4 Julie is the best! I first started going to Julie after I got a really bad cut somewhere else. I have been back to her twice and she has saved my life! Go see Julie! She's amazing! 
15614 1 The food is below average, the Menu is strange mostly Asian then you have Seasoned fries, BBQ Pinto beans, BBQ ribs. I think this place has a identity crisis. The server was very nice but not very knowledgeable. At least its cheap. 
15615 3 I am not a vegetarian and I still choose this palce over others sometimes. The dishes can fool you into thinking your eating meat when it is actually soy. The noodles are among the best in Chinatown. 
15616 4 This pizza is delicious! Wonderful flavors made with great quality ingredients! The restaurant is very clean and the restroom is very very clean! This is going to be our pizza place, when we go to Austin!!! 
15617 4 Judy is fantastic! She's a perfectionist when it comes to getting knots out. Everything is super clean and I will definitely be coming back. 
15618 3 Had the Nasu and it was wonderful, the P-38 and the Shag and they rocked. Finished with the Koviche and it was amazing. The service was awesome. I will go for happy hour henceforth because this about broke me. If I was rich I would eat there daily. 
15619 4 The healium center is my favorite place to come once a week if possible. Open studio is an amazing way to relax, unwind, and let your creativity flow. 
15620 3 My favorite pizza (thick and chunky tomato sauce)!! Yummy, doughy-centered, free rolls. The only downside is the boring, bland salads. 
15621 0 They didn't have hookah...they didn't have any dessert... This place was shady...they did not pick up our call... But they offered 50% discount on our next visit..who wants that.. First impression is the last...u can do better guys... 
15622 3 The wait on a Thursday night was about 35 minutes. In general it was satisfying but Boiling Crab in Cali is better. Order rice so that you can use the sauce to eat with it! 
15623 0 Been here many times before. But tonight's service was absolutely deplorable. Took 20 minutes I get serves drinks. And the our server just vanished. Waited like over 40 to pay the bill while rude 20 somethings took over the dance floor. Very disappointed. Will not be returning. 
15624 4 Thank you!!!! I got everything very spicy and it cheered my day right up! I had panang curry and a beef dish with eggplant over rice (I forgot) but wow very good. I got delivery and would do that again 
15625 0 The only thing that was good was the garlic bread the food is not made fresh more like frozen food that was slap on a plate not worth the price avoid this place. 
15626 4 The DVC wing is phenomanal with its own pool. You will be treated with elegance and politeness. I recommend Narcoosees and the lobster. Also, take your kids to 1900 Park Fare with the characters. Best Resort in Disney!!!!!! 
15627 4 The food was amazing. We loved the haddock sandwich. Great service also. Definitely enjoyed the place 
15628 0 the pretzel tasted maybe a bit stale. the cheese sauce was cold. (is that even legal?) no go. 
15629 4 Malaysian food is delicious. Malaysian food from Tamarind Hill is incredible! If you have never had Roti Canai, you must try it. A soft, squishy, chewy, sweet little fried bread that you dip in curry peanut sauce. Unbelievable. 
15630 3 Delicious crepes in a wide variety. I haven't been tempted to try anything other than the sweet crepes, but those are quite tasty. The loyalty card is a good bargain too. 
15631 4 Good Food. Good service. Nice peaceful location. I like here to go here during evening/after sunset when you can have food outside. 
15632 4 Doughnut decadence...killer dough nuts, fritters, etc...trivial to remarkable...Loved the Old Dirty Bastard doughnut and Bacon Maple bar....Yummy!! Reasonable pricing!! 
15633 3 Love it! Creative menu, great space. Nice to see some chicago items on the menu. 
15634 0 Stopped by for dinner and found a BINGO hall. We left and went to a real restaurant. This place offs so poorly run, I wish some one would fix it. Apopka needs more restaurants. 
15635 4 The Stay and the Good Dog are PHENOMENAL "Stacks." Stay has an amazing series of flavors many thanks to the Rosemary mushroom gravy. Good dog offers the right level of spice to make it hard to drink hot tea but enjoyable to eat. 
15636 4 Oh man, where do I start with Grand Dynasty?! EVERYTHING WAS SUPER DUPER DELICIOUS!!!!!!! What a great end to a day spent at the casino!! Thank you Grand Dynasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
15637 0 The worst restaurant ever! The service is bad. There is no one taking my order and serving drinks. 
15638 3 On a busy night service was attentive and prompt. Wine was a nice Montepulciano d'abruzzo. Entree was a wonderful papperadelle with lamb ragu. Flavorful with large juicy chunks of lamb. Very tasty meal- when back in Atlanta I'll visit again! 
15639 3 Cheap thai. Good, but some days borders amazing. A bit hit or miss but you won't get a bad meal- especially for the price. 
15640 4 Amazing environment. the food is very delicious and cheap. The Margaritas are good but not the best in town. Definately coming back!! 
15641 3 I love the modern feel. They have a great bar and a good bar menu.They make good drinks, have a good wine selection and the food always great. My rule when at a steakhouse get steak and they make a good one. I also like the AHI Tuna app. 
15642 4 Delicious baked goods, quality espressos, and amazing lattes. I loved their variety of beans. Baristas are friendly and the place has amazing decor. This became our go-to place to grab coffee and something to eat in the morning. 
15643 4 This is the most delicious Korean place I've ever eaten at. I had the Korean tacos with the kimchi and sweet potatoes and it was all so delicious. It's very clean and the staff is very friendly. I highly recommend. 
15644 4 Mouth watering burgers. I was all in for the El Diablo, spicy but great. I would recommend the trufle fries. By the way, I hate the 2 hour wait. 
15645 1 I tried this place the other day because sushi garden was packed. Everything looked good. But I would say the food isnt that good. I probably wouldnt ever go here again for thai food. 
15646 2 Sad to report that rent increases have forced the owner to close this location. 
15647 4 Simply amazing food and very friendly hosts. Love it. Will definitely recommend.thank you for the wonderful dinner 
15648 2 Service was good for a busy Sunday. Seating space was cramped with our party of 5. I tried the Red, white and blue salad (half) and was happy with it. 
15649 3 If you love Jamaican food, or want to try it for the first time so by this friendly little hole in the wall. The portions are very large and the prices are very fair. The staff and chef make you feel welcome. 
15650 4 Krispy Kreme doughnuts are like pastries coated in crack - they are that sinfully good! Seriously, I'm surprised that more people haven't reviewed this place because their doughtnuts are unbelievably good. Melt-in-your-mouth, mini-orgasm good... mmmm!! 
15651 1 I was a regular here but stopped ordering take-out because I find the young guy who answers the phone and works the cash register to be just plain rude. Like, he's just sullen, sulky, and unfriendly - and I just found it tedious. 
15652 0 You should just think of closing. horrible food and service. dont waste your time or money. 
15653 4 The best mojitos I have ever had. Service is quick and food is scrumptious! My go to restaurant when I am in midtown 
15654 4 Chef Brock is a legend in the industry breaking boundaries at every turn. We need more of his attention in the city of Atlanta. The tortillas are some of the best the city has to offer. 
15655 2 Chirashi was small portion compare to the price. we waited more than 30 mins to get the food from the time we ordered. But fish was fresh. 
15656 3 Fajitas were delicious! Strongly recommend the sangria any day of the week. I would definitely add this to my list next time I'm visiting Orlando! 
15657 1 Over the last three years that I have been in the Austin area, this place has gone from decent to not bad to meh! Go there ONLY if this is your last option for Indian food. 
15658 4 We loved the atmosphere and the food was very tasty, especially for the price! If I lived in Boston I would definitely return over and over so I could try more of the entrees. 
15659 3 I love their Free 30 day neck trim policy. 
15660 3 Lovely large downstairs and ground level seating areas. Service is fast but cashiers can be rude and argumentative. Salads and lemonade are my Monday night staple every week. Food 4/5 Service 3/5 Atmosphere 5/5 
15661 4 This was sooooooo good. Customize everything and add as many toppings all for less than the price of a DiGiorno. 
15662 3 I love this theater. Wish they got in more independent films in, as a single screen I understand why that is difficult. The owner is great and really listens to the feedback, it is obvious they care about the community. 
15663 4 My fav South End brunch place! The Eggs Benedict and a glass of freshly squeezed OJ to start the day out perfect! Staff members are friendly. 
15664 3 Don't usually frequent fast food places but this was recommended by a local. As we don't eat meat, we had the portobello mushroom burger... YUM! :-) Absolutely fabulous... Would definitely come back and definitely definitely recommend!!! 
15665 2 First of all the opening hours in Yelp is wrong. Secondly, my porkchop rice wasnt the best. The meat taste like it has been there for days! 
15666 4 The wasabi encrusted Tuna burger is to die for. But there is a crazy long wait all the time. (the wait it always worth it though). 
15667 4 Healthy, original selection. Nice variety, and very generous with the portions of each ingredient. Not watered down with the fruits and veggies that produce the most juice (like apples, cucumber) like some juice bars. My favorite spot for juice in Portland. 
15668 3 Nice food for an airport, like it Terminal F at Hartsfield Stopped at Jekyll Island for a Pinot Grigio, and a quick lunch of crab & corn soup and crayfish! 
15669 3 OK place! Their beers are standard and solid I came here with a few friends and enjoyed it. 
15670 4 Absolutely one of the nicest business owners in L5P I have known Darryl for years. He has a really cool shop with lots of great music! Moods Music is a must when visiting Atlanta! 
15671 4 It was very delicious and filling and not too expensive. We had the pimento cheese, the fried chicken and the shrimp and grits. Milky was an awesome server; fun, knowledgable and attentive. This is a definite recommendation! 
15672 3 I usually don't enjoy their food but had an absolutely fantastic chicken chili! yumm-o ! 
15673 4 Wow! Amazing and classy. I almost thought it was closed because it's hidden away in a dark corner of this building. Had the shrimp gumbo special for soup - a lot of pepper but good. 
15674 2 This cafe is typically my last resort when eating breakfast downtown. I like that they serve local organic food. The service is always great. Their food is always underwhelming. I've eaten here 5 times in the last year. It's consistent in the experience. 
15675 4 Holy cow the hype is not hype at all its reality. Everything is unbelievable. The sandwich I got was great the bread could not have been any fresher in the cappuccino was phenomenal and I haven't tried the chocolate mess that I've gotten. But. Everything has been absolutely phenomenal 
15676 4 Beautiful facilities, and the most calories that I have ever burned in a spin class. 
15677 4 I had read about the Porchetta sandwich, which did not disappoint. It's on good, toasted Ciabotta bread, and layered with a variety of tasty ingredients, which I'll let you discover on your own. 
15678 4 This place is a gem. I've brought clothing, comforters, even large mascot costumes and they've all turned out PERFECT. I drive the extra distance to get my things cleaned here. 
15679 1 I called ahead and ordered the Jalisco and Del Rey. Good service and the tacos were unique and decent BUT one of them was VERY COLD even though I opened it right when they served it. Pretty frustrating for the price. 
15680 4 The raisin milk butter bread is absolutely insane. Wtf So good. I am going to purchase another one soon. I don't know why they put huge slices of apple on the fruit tart. The egg custard thing is good. 
15681 4 Jerry aka Jordan gives great service. 110%. When you order, whatever, how often he never gives you an attitude. He's always polite. Drinks and salsa great too! 
15682 3 The outside is a little deceiving as the inside is quite large and the food is very good 
15683 4 We come here about once a week. Pizza is delicious and the wings are really good too. We usually eat next door at hoplandia which is also awesome. Get the Pizzatna , amazing! 
15684 4 Picked up a custom made 6ft bar made of pecky cypress and red cypress. Unique one of a kind that'll always be a topic of discussion. Thank you JandScypress! 
15685 1 The bubble tea is watery, i ordered 3 , thai tea & 2 jasmine green milk teas all of them were watery, no respect for tea. Customer service could've been better. I enjoyed the arcade games though. 
15686 3 Very good. Crust is awesome and the toppings are spot on. I usually ask them to cook the pizza a bit longer to get extra crispy. 
15687 3 This location was a wonderful find with absolutely delicious food and terrific prices!! Would recommend to friends and most definitely would come back again. 
15688 4 Even though Arlene wasn't my realtor, she offered SO much advice, and sent me potential buyers pre-MLS too! She is super kind, very knowledgeable and knows NW Hills area thoroughly. I would highly recommend having Arlene as your realtor. Thanks Arlene! 
15689 4 Great selection and options. All home needs for Euro styles are here. Fair price And good customer service. 
15690 4 Great menu and selection. Love how everything came with a biscuit and potato pancake. Also a great place to sit outside with your pup. Eat here! 
15691 2 Pretty good, but nothing amazing. It was a fun place to go to after the clubs closed. The food was good, but the service was pour. It took a long time to get refills. 
15692 4 I work third shift at Grady Hospital and we constantly order delivery food so we have tried just about every delivery place in Atlanta. Burger Joy is great. Good food, super fast delivery, friendly staff, and reasonable prices. 
15693 4 I ordered the avocado Margarita that they are famous for. I was not disappointed. It was super creamy and they add just the right amount of alcohol that creeps up on you! :) I also ordered the tamales- also were very delicious. 
15694 4 I haven't been to On the Border in years. The food was really good, and the location looks brand new. Service was great. We had a really great dinner. 
15695 4 Fantastic food and environment! Ashley was a fabulous waitress and gave us great recommendations and didn't go wrong once! Corey was an amazing bartender and is creative and attentive. A fun experience and the Richard Blaise menu does not disappoint- especially the chorizo burger! 
15696 3 I had a vegetarian dish and it was really good. The service was great. Fairly priced food. I will definitely come back here. Highly recommended. 
15697 4 Service was straight forward and the food was good. The brussell sprouts, with a variety of sauce options, and a good IPA really hit the spot as a healthy appetizer. It is a great walking destination by Mt. Scott Park. 
15698 4 Awesome quality, this place knows how to make good pizza. Skip the cheap places(I.E.Blazzin' Pizza and Little Ceasors), pay a little extra and get the real thing. 
15699 4 Awesome all the way around. Went before a concert recently. Got in to order on the happy hour for some items -- ordered regular menu for others. Service was perfect. Red snapper -- he's STILL talking about it. Tartar, escargot, pate. All wonderful. Can't wait to go back!! 
15700 0 Came here on Tuesday night and found out that the entrance door was closed with no reason. No sign or anything to inform us. 
15701 3 I grew up in Newton and then moved away for awhile. My family is still around and when I go home this is always one of the first things I want to get. I love this style of pizza! Yum. Nothing like a good "House of Pizza." 
15702 4 Great hotel, clean, efficient and well run. Free breakfast and dinner, decent food, excellent value. 
15703 4 Eggs benidict to die for, must try sweet potato hash. Heaven on a plate! 
15704 2 Good Thai food. Recommendations: Veg Spring Roll, Pad Kee Mao, Red Curry. 
15705 4 Really great lunch menu. Great, light portions at a fair price. Definitely will be returning. Server noticed we were there for a special occasion and brought a dessert. We were floored by how sweet she was. Don't let the outside fool you. Very modern and fresh decor inside. 
15706 4 The food here is normal Burger King, but the attitude of the employees and the customer service is always top notch. Employees have always been friendly and helpful. Enjoy eating here. 
15707 2 Kudos for making the sushi right in front of you instead of pulling it out of a package in the fridge. Overall sushi wasn't very tasty. It lacked flavor and the ingredients didn't taste very fresh. 
15708 3 Straight up yum. Molto yum. Also great a/c on hot days. We always get the basic dog with homemade (real) fries and leave with full bellies. Go before or after noon - it gets busy. 
15709 3 food was great but the bill was shocking only will go back on a special occasion 
15710 4 Had the pasta and steak tips one eve and there was easily enough food in two servings for 4 people. Everything was amazing, just ordered a buffalo pizza just due to how it looked under glass. 
15711 1 Chill with the bean sprouts bro! There's more to Vietnamese crepes than bean sprouts and won ton shell 
15712 2 Average Japanese-Chinese food similar to pandas, perhaps a notch lower; rice, oily meat, and a soda... It's satisfying for a quick lunch but it's nothing grand. Look elsewhere if you are in the mood for Japanese. If you're on the run then this is ok. 
15713 3 Found Natasha via Yelp after she responded to an appointment request. She's very sweet and FAST!! She did a great job on my nails. I'll definitely be back. 
15714 3 Love the apartments. Rooms are big and cozy, the gym is packed with equipment, just wish the internet was fast or didn't get bogged down so frequently. 
15715 4 This place has been amazing, and welcoming to my daughter. Master Tatum is firm but fair with the kids, and all the staff interact well with kids and adults, alike. Highly recommended! 
15716 4 The oysters and shrimp were amazing. Beer selection was impeccable and the atmosphere was amazing! Beer selection is great as well! 
15717 4 Pinch me, I'm in heaven. Great food, service and value. Will come back many times. 
15718 2 my first trip here. It's a brilliant idea that you can make your own. I tried the lime/pasley rice, it was nice. but will forego it for just meat & veg next time. 
15719 4 This Walgreens is like a Disney store! There's so many good stuff on top of their regularly awesome deals! Cool and convenient! 
15720 4 Great bike repair/stuff shop. John and his crew are beyond knowledgable. They are kind, never make you feel stupid, and helpful beyond measure. Great prices, fast-as-hell service... Top notch. 
15721 1 Stella's is okay. Just okay. I would compare the way I feel about their food to frozen pizza. You know what you are getting every time...it's always decent, but you could definitely have better if you weren't being so lazy. 
15722 4 In honor of ways to survive Austin's summer- rock your world w/ the coconut paletas here. If you're in a taco mood- the tinga de pollo w/ a limeade chaser is also delicious. The manor establishment sees me every few days...the paletas will get you hooked. 
15723 2 Best pizza in the west rox/Rozzie area by far. Get your pie well done. Veggie topping are good, as is the meatball. Very moderate prices on the pizza. Watch out on Friday nights around dinner time there will be a line. Don't order the wings, big mistake. 
15724 4 Legit Curry house run by a lovely Indian family! Great authentic vibes and great flavors! 
15725 4 It's kind of amazing this food comes off a cart. It's ridiculously good. These guys clearly know their stuff and care about their food. It tastes in every bite. I'd go out of my way for the Jook Joint. It's worth it. And don't miss the corn fritters! 
15726 4 I was recommended and it was worth the drive. They were quick friendly and fast. I will definitely be back the prices were right. 
15727 4 Great Bookstore. Can roam for hours , have a cup of coffee and continue roaming. 
15728 3 Well priced gelato in a cool little shop reminding me a bit of a Dr. Seuss book. Ladies behind the counter were cute, nice, and helpful. 
15729 4 Friendly staff, GREAT HAPPY HOUR NACHOS, and plenty taps to choose from. This place has fun games (darts/ pool/ trivia night/ and more) and is a nice place to watch a sports game and just chill. 
15730 3 We can't stay away from Hopdoddy's. The best burgers and the fries are killer good. Also love the Dublin Dr. Pepper. But take my advice, and try to go during off hours, or you'll be in line for 30 minutes. 
15731 4 Awesome place for tapas and superb service. A must place to dine. 
15732 4 A great nail salon!! It is very clean and everyone is so friendly and helpful. I LOVE Kim! She is so gentle while giving me my pedicure and manicure:-) Give it a a try, I do not think you'll be disappointed. 
15733 4 Found a great spot! Great food, service & atmosphere Did I mention how bomb the food n drinks are! 
15734 1 One of the problems I have with this area is that the food choices basically boil down to the following: Pizza/deli or soso Chinese. This unfortunately is the latter. Although the service has generally been good and friendly, the food has been generous in portions but not that tasty. 
15735 2 It's Mother's Day dinner! But it takes 40 minutes to have two soups only! Well, talking about the quality of the dinner, I would say nothing special in a restaurant like this. Will not come back. 
15736 4 Very good food. Solid service even when busy. Clean restrooms and clean business. Wonderful place to meet with friends. 
15737 0 No tray. Slow service. Short staff and no more napkins. I couldn't get a tray cause they were "all dirty". 
15738 2 We have been waited 3hours to have a table for 7 persons. The gril lobster was pretty good 
15739 2 Meh only went in because 2001 was closed for the Holiday. Pizza was kind of cold. They have Tandoori Chicken pizza, but even that was just ok. Seriously go next door. 
15740 4 Sal and Trayvon were so great. The service was fast and well done. They told me other services Peace Frog offers but no pressure to do anything other than what I ordered. The experience was excellent from getting a quote to paying. I will definitely use them again. 
15741 3 Good prices and on sale right now too. Quite a few different items including for different ages from babies to teenagers. More younger kids though. From clothing and accessories items for both girls and boys. Decent service and pretty organized too 
15742 3 The Coffee is good, hours are pretty late and the shop is in the old downtown of Westerville which is nice. 
15743 2 We had an early reservation before theater, at 5:15. We had to push the hostess to get a view table, with only one other couple in the whole place. Really? Absolutely beautiful. Table service good. Food ordinary and very average. 
15744 3 Still a great place. Looks like the menu has been revamped recently. Great happy hour snacks. Exceptionally good service. The perfect hangout before a flight/layovers 
15745 4 I have belonged/ frequented gym's in Boston, NYC, Chicago & Tel-Aviv. This is by far my favorite studio for classes. All the classes I have taken are amazing. My personal favorite in Tabata Burn with Jonathan Cruz. I recommend this studio to all my visitors and friends! 
15746 4 Upgrade to 5. Consistent...service and product. Friendly vibe. Continued WIN. Extremely consistent on presentation, quality of product, service and general vibe. Check it out...and you'll return! 
15747 4 We were old. They were young. Ok then. Got past that. Good beer selection. Great bartenders. Good prices. Excellent on campus bar. 
15748 4 Truth - I crave ice cream on a regular basis! It was a very hot day in Orlando on Monday, water and ice tea were not satisfying my thirst (or that is what I told myself). I purchased a Ghirardelli chocolate single dip in a chocolate dipped waffle cone. Satisfaction! 
15749 3 Have been coming in for a couple of weeks and the bar service has been excellent. Manny takes care of everything for you and the drinks are always on time. The food has always been great. I come in early and late same great service 
15750 4 What an amazing store. One of a kind items, great location and wonderful prices. This is my go to place for gifts and treats for myself. The owner tries to stock the shop with locally made and with fair-trade items. 
15751 4 Great little by-the-slice place. Stopped in for a slice and ended up getting seconds. Good food. Good people. Good service. 
15752 0 Crappy car wash, stay way. Will take your money and just sprinkle somw water on your car. Will be filing a chargw back sinse owner done respond. 
15753 4 Outstanding. Lived up to all the hype. 
15754 2 Shaved ice is a great substitute for real ice cream if you love icy stuff, but can't afford all the calories in ice cream. I think they could work on how they put their desserts together. The balance of ice to ice cream, and other toppings. 
15755 4 This place is great. Non Pretentious, fantastic prizes and above all these 2 ladies are excellent at what they do. I'm not going ANYWHERE else but here! 
15756 3 Great service scott went over and above the typical average service we are so used to in the city. The food was good I had the egg salmon sandwich. Atmosphere was very nice and clean Cofee was delicious and the bill was reasonable highly recommend it 
15757 4 Great pizza, great service, great deals. I got the tall boy special - 4 dollars for a PBR and a slice of cheese pizza. They were exceptionally nice, and the pizza was absolutely delicious. Massive slices. 
15758 3 I go here regularly and get a gel manicure and pedicure. Everyone here is very friendly and helpful and they know me by name. :) Love AJ's manicures (last at least 2 weeks) and go once a month for pedis. Works for me! :) 
15759 2 Nightmare or savior? I can never tell. This location has crazy lines. Both inside and at the drive thru. The drinks are made just as good but the wait is scary. 
15760 4 The menu only has two sandwiches (plus a special of the day), but they're consistently excellent. Expect a long, but fast-moving line around lunchtime. 
15761 4 Service great, Friendly, chatty, always fast. Great food My favorite breakfast place. 
15762 3 I have been to Not Your Average Joe's at this location once with my wife. She enjoyed the food served here, the environment and food selections were all good. I love their bread and garlic sauce. Recommend it to folks around the area :) 
15763 4 Really yummy food, portions are really generous! The meat is seasoned so well and the service is great! 5 stars! 
15764 4 Rented bikes for a few hours from here to ride around the city and Stanley Park. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgable. The bike selection was great, the bikes were newer and in great condition. The kids seats were brand new and top of the line. Highly recommended! 
15765 3 Got the Migas, girlfriend got the Pans. Migas was alright, I like the ingredients but they don't work together enough. Pans I think is much better. Love the place though, and we got to use a Chinook Book coupon (2 for 1), so i was very pleased. 
15766 4 We love the people who make and serve the delicious, warm, nourishing food here. The food is aromatic and delightful before you even start eating, and then to eat it is amazingly satisfying. The atmosphere is colorful and comforting as well 
15767 4 My IPhone 4S was 18 months old and the battery was on its last leg. The back glass of my phone was also cracked. The owner of the shop replaced the glass and the battery in under 5 minutes. Well worth the $70 it cost. 
15768 4 The food here is amazing and well priced. The chef specials are always great. I love the Tom ka and the thai tea is my favorite drink ever. Seriously one of my favorite restaurants ever. A must try place in Louisville. Once you do, you'll keep coming back! 
15769 1 Went in for the buy one, take one. Food was mediocre. $8 for a barely drinkable glass of house chardonnay. Service lackluster. $30 out the door (for one person) and not worth it. 
15770 4 Very honest and fair, they don't try to up-sell you. They told an elderly lady in the waiting room how much padding she had left on her front and rear brakes and left the decision to her. No scare tactics, just facts. Refreshing and appreciated in this day and age. 
15771 4 Their little cart is so cute. The chicken wonton soup was so delicious. The wontons were super flavorful, had good texture, and good filling to noodle wrapper ratio. The workers were so nice as well. 5/5 on everything 
15772 3 Great little pub. I've liked everything I've had there. My like that you can make any salad a wrap. Especially enjoy the spicy chicken. Good fish and chips. Make sure you get the fried pickles. 
15773 4 Amazing brunch, best eggs in town! Love the friendly waitstaff and atmosphere. Dog friendly with outside patio. 
15774 4 Great urban bike trail that can take you all the way into Boston. Well maintained and great stops in between like downtown Lexington where Trader Joe's is conveniently located. Summers tend to be busy here so get there early for a parking spot in Bedford. 
15775 3 The fish was fresh (@7 pm) and the spicy sauce was spicy, but I suspect a catering business as the eating area has room for about 8 people. Service was fast and friendly. Many combo deals for lunch. 
15776 0 This place is unnecessarily slow and the quality in no way makes the wait worthwhile. There are far better burgers that you can get much, much quicker in Austin. 
15777 3 I really enjoyed the style of this bar, a bit old school classic. There is a Barber shop connected to the restaurant. Our bartender was very nice, can't remember his name though. Great place to hang with friends or coworkers for a drink or two. Great beer and scotch selection! 
15778 4 I've been coming here forever. It's a time warp, and in Austin, where everything else seems to be changing by the minute, it's a comfort that you can still get a good greasy cheese burger from Nau's... 
15779 3 Good for the panorama view of Portland and if you pay a small fee you can get a guided tour about the house on a hill and Portland history. 
15780 4 Omg... Fish fry Wednesday's are amazing. You expect thin pieces of tilapia but it's not. Also highly recommend the gator bites. 
15781 4 Fantastic happy hour, tequila cocktails, nachos and music! My new favorite place x100 
15782 1 Use to come here a lot but the last time my thanksgiving burger was raw. That's was that, never to go back. That was over 2 years ago and I haven't gone back since. They run out of food items constantly including alcohol. It's just glorified fast food. I'll pass. 
15783 1 Had the matcha with condensed milk...way too sweet, first time I couldnt finish my portion of any cold dessert. 
15784 4 I like this place because it has indian food items, haldiram, deep, masala, naan, paratha, frozen cooked meals, etc. 
15785 2 It was alright. Quick, Clean and comfortable place. Another (my favorite) place to go is Boxer Ramen. 
15786 4 Momos are exceptionally good and it's only $5 for 8 momos which is a deal you don't get anywhere anymore. Definitely the best bang for the buck. The Choiyla was spicy and excellent. Will come back soon for more...owners seemed very nice too. 
15787 4 Pretty views of the lake from the Lakeshore Inn in Lake Oswego. Great customer service. Location is good for easily walking to stores and restaurants in downtown Lake Oswego. 
15788 4 Awesome people ! Great vibe! Amazing artists :) Tons of talent. under new management. My new favorite shop in Portland. 
15789 4 It's the best coffee within walking distance of downtown offices, delivered swiftly by a polite staff. It's not magical, but when something's the best at what it does, it should get five stars. 
15790 3 I love this place. Fabulous cocktails and pizza. I have never had a problem getting a seat at the bar. Great meatballs and bread too! 
15791 0 Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Lazy emoloyees stay in the back and try to look "busy" while they have one employee on the front line. Food isn't the freshest. Will never go there again. They should replace with a food business who works hard and wants to keep their customers coming back. 
15792 4 The photos are before and after. The brisket is exactly what you hoped from Texas BBQ. Perfect smoke flavor and very tender. 
15793 1 After reading all the reviews, I chose 3 as spicy, but it was not spicy at all. It lacked in flavor as well. The spring rolls were tasty but the dipping sauce also lacked in flavor. 
15794 4 Very generous portions for a very reasonable price. The oxtail Pho is very good if you don't mind using your fingers to take the meat of the bones. 
15795 2 I wish you would just grill your halloumi cheese! :( It would make your sandwich soooooo much more delicious. 
15796 4 This is the best place to get smokes. I don't want to pay higher prices for ambiance and marketing...I want the lowest prices for quality goods. The owner is awesome, and I always feel welcome. Support this local business and save a few bucks, too! 
15797 4 We had quesadillas, smoked turkey club sandwiches, tacos, and cottage fries. Everything was delicious and the service was great. 
15798 4 Delicious, delicious, delicious! I had the voodoo doll donught, it looks a little strange, but tastes awesome. Family also tried maple glazed, m&m covered cake donut, maple bacon glazed and apple fritter. All of them were tasty! 
15799 0 this is very poor customer service!!!!! this has been 3rd time. always same!!! we have just arrived now. 20 min waiting for checking in:-)) wow of course they are very sorry. but being sorry doesnt fix anything 
15800 4 Excellent food! Fantastic crab cakes and swordfish! The service is impeccable, but parking can be a challenge depending on when you go. Thankfully, they offer valet parking. 
15801 4 My new favorite bakery. I drove 90 minutes to get there, but it was a party in my mouth. Guess I need to pack for my next trip. 
15802 4 Excellent tacos! The Rajas Poblano was the perfect bite! Also I love the Brussels Sprouts salad. Everything here is spicy and tasty. The shrimp taco was over-cooked and chewy, but the rest was terrific. The Valentina cocktail is so good, too. Lots to recommend at this place. 
15803 4 This is a great place to get pizza and beer. The pizza is really good, and they have a wide selection of beers on tap. Sitting at the bar, you'll have a good chance to engage in interesting conversation with a stranger if you like. 
15804 4 Lots of yogurt flavors and toppings to choose from. The place is always clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. I like the idea that you can try a sample before you fill up your cup. Highly recommended if you love frozen yogurt. 
15805 4 So far so good! We started using Neighborhood Cleaners about a month ago due to poor service from another dry cleaner in town. We have taken in several orders and every one of them has been on ti e and correctly. Highly recommend them! 
15806 4 Been here a few times. Love the pizza, love the ambiance, love the wine. Service is top notch, everyone is friendly, the bathrooms are clean and it's a perfect place to start your night out in Davis! Go here and love it like I do! 
15807 3 small, and we did the whole museum in an hour... but paints a good picture of JFK, his family, and his short career as a politician. beautiful view! 
15808 4 One of my top 5 places for lunch downtown. Consistently serves quality food with sizable portions for a reasonable price. They are also great at getting you your order in a hurry, as they have a cafeteria style assembly line thing going. 
15809 3 The food deserves 5 stars, the wait time dropped it. I waited an hour but the food was fresh, cooked to order and delicious. 
15810 4 I didn't know it was cash only. F am I dumb. I had one measly dollar. I'm blowing it. The guy who made my asada hibachi style tells me it's OK, and quickly hands my stupid ass the taco. Five Stars haters. 
15811 4 Just like in Spain. The owner, Pepe, was a very nice host. Jamone Iberica was simplify amazing along with the clams, seabass, and quail legs. It smelled like my Spanish friends moms house in Madrid. 
15812 4 The food here is authentic and when you order the BBQ they give generous size proportions. The service is really good too. It's family run and my family and I love coming here. 
15813 1 Banh mi was pretty weak. 
15814 2 Decent pizza, kind of pricey. Nothing that sold me on returning. I just got 2 cheese slices... left me feeling ehh. But I know they are a local favorite and use fresh ingredients... so they get a 3 :-) 
15815 3 What can you say about Starbucks pretty predictable the McDonald's of coffee. If you like Starbucks you will like this one. 
15816 1 Prices are super cheap - but first trip there they lost my favorite shirt, gave me someone else's, and didn't really seem that concerned with the mixup. Didn't offer a discount or anything - said they would call if they found it. Bummer. 
15817 4 Phoebe's is wonderful. The staff is attentive and personable, the food is incredibly satisfying, and the wait is never long. I'd highly recommend the shrimp and grits to anyone. Next time, I'm going to try their daily specials! 
15818 4 Best margherita pizza, Cambridge is lucky to have this wonderful trattoria style place like Gran Gusto! The calamari is great too, and the portions sizes are perfect. The personal pizza dish can be shared too. 
15819 1 Don't bother getting any bubble tea here. You'll be paying $3.70 watered down flavored drinks. The mochi ice cream on the other hand is the only good product on the menu. Lychee, green tea, and chocolate coconut are three delicious flavors. This is a first and last time for sure. 
15820 4 I grew up in Sichuan. To me, this is so far the only authentic Sichuan/Chongqing hotpot in greater Boston area. Koi is located a bit far from where I live(Cambridge), and there's usually 30+wait until finally seated...nevertheless, it's eventually worth the time when the exciting spiciness touches my tongue. 
15821 4 Exceptional tacos. Fajita chicken or steak are incredible. Among the best tacos in Austin. Would go out of my way to eat here. 
15822 4 Seriously best doughnuts everrrrrrr! Love the Downtown location too and the different variety of treats each location offers! 
15823 3 This is by far my favorite chinese take out in southeast orlando. Ever in the vista lakes area got check them out. 
15824 4 This is my favorite neighborhood nail spot. Every mani/pedi I've gotten here has been flawless- highly recommend. 
15825 1 I thought their selection was weak and wasn't overly impressed with the cupcake I got (vanilla, chocolate frosting, with sprinkles). I've had, and even made, much better cupcakes. Overrated! 
15826 4 I'm going to make this short and sweet. GO HERE! this place has one hell of a happy hour. Everything was priced well. Although the empanadas were flavorful, the best thing on that menu was the steak sandwich. The meat was sooo tender and just GO HERE! 
15827 2 The Pad Thai was okay - nothing spectacular to write home about. Could use a little sweet chili sauce on the side to add some flavor. The scallion pancake was a little on the greasy side. 
15828 3 I had to bring my CRV in for recall. The dealership was super busy but they moved everybody through quickly. They gave me a great rental car. Everything went smoothly. Great experience working with the dealership. Thank you Lance! 
15829 4 Excellent job. I hold my stress in my shoulders and neck and Leslie did a great job of using different levels of pressure where I need it. I am looking forward to a good routine of visits to keep myself nice and relaxed! 
15830 4 You can taste the love Salvatore puts into his cooking! We had the Caprese salad, pasta Bolonese & spaghetti with calamari! Everything was awesome & we can't wait to go back! We are now lifetime customers! Thank you Salvatore! 
15831 4 This place is awesome! The staff is super friendly and the waffles are amazing. Even on a busy Sunday morning they were quick and efficient. Will definitely come again! 
15832 0 Sub par food, sub par service. First and last time we go there. Blah! 
15833 2 A Ok Book Store Went There Because Online It Said They Had A Book But When We Went To The Store They Did Not Have The Book. A Little Disappointed.The Store Has An Okay Selection Of Books That's Acceptable For All. 
15834 4 Lovely Valentines dinner at Bluehour last night. Food and drinks were Fabulous. 
15835 4 I've trained a lot of places across the US and Paragon Austin is one of the best. They have a good focused program with qualified instructors. People in the class were welcoming and positive. The prices are fair and the facilities are clean. 
15836 3 Great little diner. Owner and staff are welcoming and friendly. Food was delicious. Space is small and seating limited. The wait was a little longer than I expected but there were 2 cooks serving the whole place. Give the guys a break! You must stop and enjoy this place. 
15837 3 Best pho broth I've had so far - nuanced and delicate. They also have blended fruit drinks. Customer service is a little spotty - this is one of those places where there's a trade-off of good customer service and comprehensibility for good food. 
15838 3 Taco Tuesday's and Blazer games. This is a great little local spot. Good service and they even have karaoke :) 
15839 4 Wow!! High prices may put off the penny pincher, but don't let that stop you from trying the buffet upstairs. The spread was amazing.. 2 hot food/chef served bars.. 1 giant salad bar...a sushi bar... and the baddest ass dessert bar youo ever saw...*sigh* chocolate fountain how I love thee! 
15840 4 We have been eating here for years, the food is always top notch!!!! The ambiance is so relaxing, drinks are great and the service is the best !!!! If you have an opportunity to request a waitress, ask for Trisha, she is the best of the best!!!!! 
15841 3 I really liked the way Wendy did my manicure and pedicure. It was totally worth it. The nails colors are nice and options are plenty to choose. Go for the gel color for hands. It lasts for many weeks. 
15842 3 Once had it from an event, tried the 'sliders', the veggie and beef patties are both good. Somehow they had the sweet potato chips, which taste amazingly good. Not a big fan of the fritters though, they are just not my type. Quite a comforting experience. 
15843 1 The people weren't friendly at all. Did not introduce themselves, didn't offer to give us a tour, gave us the wrong price over the phone for the daycare and misinformed us about the policies over the phone. Definitely going to try another daycare. 
15844 4 Delicious food. Great prices. Friendly service. No meat. What's not to like? 
15845 1 Super sleazy pricing. My cruise was listed as $129/person. Only after many checkout pages on the final credit card page, did they list $50/person extra in yeah-right fees (fuel fee?!! WTF?!). All they had to do to not be sleazy was include all that in the price to begin with. 
15846 4 The Diego is the best bowl in Portland. Perfect portion. Fresh greens including rocket. And you know it's good when the flavor of the beans shine through. All the ingredients come through with fresh and balanced with just the right subtle chile spice kick. Consistent and always spot on. 
15847 4 Had an amazing birthday dinner here in October. Really cool aquariums and the food was delicious. Great spot for a special occasion. 
15848 4 Spicy, delicious, and reasonably priced. Will definitely be coming back for the hot and sour vermicelli! 
15849 3 Food was great, but took a bit to get in since the door was closed after it was supposed to be open, oversight I'm sure. 
15850 1 Not the greatest sushi but it was the closest place I found to the hotel. Good service. 
15851 4 Just delicious! Had the lamb gyro with Greek fries. It had super fresh ingredients and the lamb was seasoned to perfection. It was really delicious and their tzaziki sauce was also fresh! Highly recommend! 
15852 4 As amazing as everyone says. Arrived around 8:30, NO wait, super pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable staff. In and out in less than 30 min. 
15853 4 Food was really good with friendly service. The patio looks really nice would love to check it out when the weather is better. 
15854 2 I just want to dispel one myth.... Treadwells is NOT homemade ice cream. They actually use Puritan Ice cream out of Roslindale Massachusetts. Decide for yourself on the quality Personally?....I prefer Giffords, Shains of Maine or Richardson's.......in that order 
15855 4 Excellent service - this store provides ezcellemt workmanship with real ustomer service. I forgot to pick up shoes for travel the next day. He opened up the store at 9pm to get me my shoes. Absolutely amazing service. 
15856 3 Sashimi Sampler Appetizer was delicious and well priced. 
15857 4 Dot's is great--one of my favorite places in Portland. Can't say enough good things about it. Great food, great drink selection, great ambiance. 
15858 3 Excellent pizza with high quality ingredients. It's brick oven pizza the way it's supposed to be. The wings were baked and fall off the bone. Very good flavor. We would come back. Only 15 minutes from Disney. 
15859 3 Thank you yelp for sending us to a delicious place to eat. Great food, chowder was delicious. Ambiance is cute and clean. Prices are reasonable, Mark enjoyed the clam roll! 
15860 4 Still my favorite local jewelry store! It's a nice treat to pop in and find something to brighten my day or find a great gift for someone. The owner is really sweet and the store is so cute! Highly recommend! 
15861 4 Loved it. Dive bar atmosphere with fantastic southern inspired food. Loved the fried chicken and collards. Pool, pinball and shuffleboard provide entertainment while your sucking down tasty beers or cocktails. 
15862 4 I live right next to hat creek and have eaten their twice. Got the same classic burger and fries meal both times and cannot complain. I do not ever eat fast food but really enjoyed these burgers because they aren't heavy and greasy like a normal fast food joint. 
15863 2 Ah yes, the cluster of shoppers around each corner. You almost need to attach blinkers on the front of your cart so you know where everyone is turning. Good prices with brands you expect. 
15864 1 Check it out if you like the feel of a frat party. I don't. I probably wouldn't like any of what are basically the "campus" bars around Northeastern. 
15865 4 Excellent food, good service, clean restaurant and great prices. The only problem is the long line ups. 
15866 2 This is a huge dive bar, which is open later than anything else in the area, so you inevitably end up there if you hang out at other nearby establishments. The place is super cheap, though, and has attractions such as darts to while away the time. 
15867 4 This is out favorite scali around. You can go to other local grocery stores and buy Winter Hill breads for $3.50, or come straight to the source and only spend $1.95. The service is always very friendly and welcoming. 
15868 4 This place was fantastic! Immediately upon entering they offered a beverage and chocolate candy. The staff was very friendly and the establishment was very clean. I will be coming back! 
15869 4 Its definitely worth the wait. We waited over an hour to be seated. Great little mom and pop spot. Awesome breakfast. 
15870 3 Outstanding service, great options (buffet once, all you can eat or buffet plus all the meat you can manage) Reasonably priced for a Brazilian Steakhouse. You will not leave disappointed or hungry. 
15871 4 I enjoyed myself it was my first time what made it so good was our waiter JoJo he was EVERYTHING..... the best service he was energetic he went beyond love loved it will tell everyone about this spot for sure. 
15872 4 Great interesting drinks and gave me a vibe similar to the cosmopolitan in las vegas and good food. Small portions but really good 
15873 3 Great atmosphere, good food, cool vibe, and reasonable prices... What more do you want? I really like the outdoor patio with huge fireplace. Very cozy! This is great place to hang out and people watch on the last Thursday of each month! 
15874 4 The ambiance, food, drinks and service is impeccable. The crabcakes, chicken wontons, philly eggrolls, wings, spinach artichoke dip are all fantastic. The bartenders make very good drinks and everyone is very attentive from the owners to the staff. Atlanta has a gem on their hands! 
15875 4 Best Turkish food in town!! Amazing experience. I had there mix kabob platter which included Adana kabob, chicken kabob, doner and beef kabob.. Very delicious, and enough for two. I'll be back. 
15876 3 Food is good, beers are tasty and when the line is short, it is an especially good place to eat! Fries are over rated but the vast selection of burgers are all delicious. 
15877 3 Ate here Saturday. Was busy as hell. Pot roast and Red Velvet Cake. I am ashamed to admit, I ordered a second desert, banana pudding. OMG! I'm an ole Mississippi boy and if it's one thing I know, it's country cooking/soul food. Eat here and then eat here again. 
15878 0 Invited by a friend for her son's birthday party ,we were rudely pointed to the kiosk to fill out waivers etc without instructions, not a safe place for kids jumping over , many more better outdoor activities stay away !!! 
15879 3 Server was awesome, prices a bit high but lovely variety of shrimp. Lobster tail was yummy! Corn fritters were a yummy hit and more of a dessert as not very corny lol 
15880 4 These guys have been doing it right for years. If you want authentic, Boston character then check this place out. You'll understand why this place will never go out of style once you've eaten here. 
15881 4 I've started to become a big fan of Japanese food literally overnight. I recently went here for a birthday celebration and enjoyed the food selection. The only problem was that I didn't have enough space in my stomach to finish the food in front of me :) 
15882 3 Food here is always good. A little pricey but with a lake view and fun vibe, we don't mind if so much 
15883 4 Solid A++++ taco's, mang. Seriously though, the meat was well seasoned and the corn tortilla was not fall apart-y like some places are. I'd eat here every day if I could. The Al Pastor was definitely my favourite. 
15884 4 If you like wine as much as I do, and especially if you like to try new wines, this is the place for you! Huge selection. Whatever your budget, I'm sure you can find something delicious here. 
15885 4 We were visiting from Buffalo, N.Y n looking for a specific vibe from the bars after walking in and out a couple we found it at The Point!Friendly staff.Drinks were great and a local who told us all the great places to go! 
15886 4 This is the best homebrew shop in Portland, and the most centrally-located, and it's all-around great. However, my first LHBS (local homebrew supply store) in Berkeley, CA was better. How I miss brewdude and Homer! 
15887 4 The food here is awesome, definitely try the waffles they are to die for. Service is quick and friendly but parking can be a pain. They did a great job renovating the old La Provence and the decor is great. 
15888 4 I stopped in here today to inquire about fixing some sharp edges on the prongs of a ring. The friendly staff was able to fix my ring while I waited and didn't even charge me for the minor repair. I will definitely return for any future jewelry repair needs! 
15889 4 Everything we ate was PHENOMENAL! The staff was so attentive and the drinks were amazing! CANNOT wait to come back!! 
15890 3 I get a double-meat spicy chicken bowl with brown rice for lunch several times a week. It's like crack to me! 
15891 3 We rate this restaurant four hops! neighborhood could be better beer was great.food was excellant. Had pecan crusted chicken it was to die for! 
15892 3 Fantastic! This location always delivers. Table was VERY dark, but they cranked up the lighting when asked. Food was fantastic! 
15893 3 Fun find while visiting in Metrotown Walking distance from the hotel we were staying at. Movie theater was nice , comfortable seats and nice big screens with clear surround sound. The only downside is that the concession is pretty pricy 
15894 4 I'll never shop for pet needs anyplace else. The people at this store are first-rate, Kayla and the groomers are wonderful, management and employees are caring and wonderful. Kudos to all of you. 
15895 0 Held the line, opened 2 hours late, didn't honor "specials". There's plenty of options in the city. I wouldn't make this one. 
15896 3 Fantastic service!! The staff was all VERY friendly and helpful... which is always nice for a girl who has no idea what anyone is talking about when it comes to cars or tires. I didn't feel like they were trying to pull one over on me. Would definitely return!! 
15897 2 This is a nice hotel with moderately priced suites. It's located not to far from the theme parks. Free parking on site and complimentary breakfast. The breakfast wasn't really hot and turned cold fast. There's Free Wifi. I would come back 
15898 0 Nowhere else in Boston will you be charged $6.50 for a bud light bottle. Highway robbery. The prices are Champion's main problem, although the food is nothing to get excited about either. 
15899 2 Dropped by for a mid-day snack and grabbed an average lemon bar and some King of Pops. Nice selection but pricey. They apparently supply local shops like Honeybubble too. 
15900 4 If you ever want quality food made fast and fairly priced go here. Only problem is that you must pay in cash. I recommend their roast beef 3 way and their chicken fingers! It's been in Beverly for ages and a must try. 
15901 4 Food was fantastic-good kids' menu for a place like this. We were there with my aunt, a vegetarian, and she frequents it because of their vegetarian options. Good selection of wraps, salads, pizza and pasta dishes. Flavorful food and fast, friendly service. 
15902 4 AG has been superb. I loathe medical facilities and Austin Gastro has always made me feel comfortable, listened to, and cared for. Good facilities; good people. 
15903 1 It can get crowded, humid and the tables are really close together. Being a left handed person, I find myself sometimes bumping into the person in the table to the left. 
15904 1 The food is okay, but their delivery people are consistently rude. There are a lot of restaurants in the area with better Italian food, so I highly recommend taking your business elsewhere 
15905 4 Thanks Paul! you came promptly and fixed our dryer right away! And very personable and nice to work with, great service! 
15906 4 Absolutely a cut above the rest. First time at a friends condo here.. Great staff accommodations and good food and drinks. Would certainly return. Must see Treasures Tavern for good food and laughs.. Thanks Sheraton. 
15907 3 Highly recommended. The selection here is awesome. They have really awkward parking in the back; I'd stick to the streets if you can. 
15908 4 Old Chicago does exactly what they say they will ... Serve great deep dish pizza and salads, on time, with great service. The staff is professional and accommodating. Take-out is a good option, too. It's always on time and delicious. We'll definitely be back. 
15909 2 Enjoyed the tap room. Lots of interesting flavors mixed into their beers for craft brew week, like coco puffs stout! The drumsticks were great with chunks of blue cheese....the hummus was not (i don't think there was any tahini in the mix and it was coarsely ground). 
15910 4 A great neighborhood bar. The games are amusing (there's nothing like sitting outside and listening to a big-Jenga game), the service is good, the prices are low, and the location is right. It's not a place to drive across town for, but it's perfect for where it is. 
15911 3 I love this store! If you have friend who understand dark and sarcastic joke, here is a place to buy a gift to them. (Or they have super sweet stuff too. ) 
15912 4 This is by far the best pie place in saint cloud, Fabio is the best, when it comes to Italian food. If I could give 10 stars I would 
15913 2 It's one of the worst UNO's around. They still get business because they're in a prime location. Most of the workers are college students and could care less about their job. When your server only gives a half effort it's hard to enjoy a meal. You can connect the dots. 
15914 4 Great spot! Anything you desire is probably here. Great atmosphere, seating, heated and lighted! A firepit as well. We had a beer, shared a earth veggie burger and Indian food. Reasonable restrooms as well. 
15915 4 It's hard to find a clean nail salon that doesn't smell of acrylics. I went here with a buddy of mine and had both manis and pedis. The ladies did great work! I would definitely come here more often if it were close to home! 
15916 4 Great experience. Awesome drinks. TRE the bartender he is awesome. This place is is closed to Pandora. Perfect for a couple drinks. 
15917 0 Horrible service on my friends birthday. Waited over an hour for drinks. Did not id..but food was ok 
15918 2 Sometimes it smells too much like fish for me to handle. Sometimes you can't sit cause there is a show later that night. Sometimes there is a rediculous line and cover. But then again, it could be just what you need. 
15919 0 Ugly place. Internet service doesn't work, television doesn't work, and the room is so damp that it smells like mildew. 
15920 4 I ordered a new cover for my Hot Springs and these guys were Johnny on the Spot. They delivered installed and hauled off my old one in a matter of minutes. 
15921 4 I've been looking for a great halal/gyro place in north Austin and I found it! I've come here for the past two days. Fantastic food. Location could be better. 
15922 3 Amazing Spanish Lattes!!!! Would definitely recommend trying the ICED Spanish Latte as well. Service is never constant... but the beverage makes up for it. A pretty good environment to study/do homework but no power plugs :( 
15923 0 Joined last year for the 2 gyms one price year special. Went in one day and i was told to leave the gym because they "ended" the promotion because of some internal squables. Bad business!I would have been a member for life 
15924 4 Sooooo gooooood!!!!! We were really skeptical about German food but OMG this place was really Delicious!!! The fresh bread while we waited for our meal was amazing and hot, the flavors were On Point, the portions were really generous... overall an AMAZING experience !! We will Definitely come again!! :D 
15925 4 1 year ago, I went with my wife to eat a cheeseburger and ribs! The food was delicious! They have excellent customer service! I will recommend this place without hesitation! 
15926 3 Great walk. Tons of poison ivy lining the path, though. Parking for Cambridge residents only in the main lot. Nice get-away if you're looking for a change of pace from the usual city life. 
15927 4 Ordered a pizza yesterday, though I forgot what it was called. It was really good! And it was on thin crust when I forgot to tell them I wanted thin crust! Great!! I like em more than Gattis that's for sure. 
15928 2 Staff has always been nice and the food is pretty decent standard Americanized Mexican food. There is a small patio which si nice and easy with the kids. No surprises here. I have never had a wait which is nice when you are in a hurry. 
15929 4 Best tasting donuts in the Portland area. I am very glad I do not live nearby, as I would weigh 500 pounds. 
15930 1 Meh. The spring rolls are okay, and the ginger chicken is well-spiced, but you can't get brown rice with your order. 
15931 0 Extremely unprofessional always late and always overcharging. They are always late but will not wait even for 5 minutes if you are I would give them 0 rating if it's possible. Don't believe awards, they got those through family connections 
15932 0 The service is awful! The bartenders are either high as a kite or just plain rude. Only been there twice and both times an issue. After leaving late night we overheard the bartender say good, get the f&&k out. Both times the place was empty. I'll never go back. 
15933 3 Solid dinner, great bar seating. The octopus was fantastic. Great little place with inventive food. 
15934 3 It's in such a weird place (on Sherman Street, which is kind of quiet,) but SO GOOD! Delicious food, all fresh and made on the premises. I had the Margherita pizza which was amazing. The Tiramisu was great too. Highly recommend. 
15935 4 So wonderful. The service was extremely knowledgable. Any pasta can be substituted for gluten free. Even gluten free bread for the olive oil! Prices are VERY reasonable for the quality of service. I did not expect such a good experience for such a good price. Will be back next time! 
15936 2 Fun atmosphere. Great, fresh food. Dog friendly. Really slow service. It makes the great stuff kind of not worth the wait...Makes me a little sad. 
15937 4 Best pizza in portland ,everytime we visit there we ordered. And no disappointment at all. They delivered to our hotel And always before the estimated time .so fresh,hot and good. Love it. 
15938 4 Good food. Great service. Always a lunch and dinner special weekdays, breakfast special on weekends. "Twonie burgers" on weekends that are pretty good for 2$. Most menu items are under $10 and have large portions. 
15939 4 The best restaurant in Portland, Oregon no ands ifs or buts. Service is excellent and the food is amazing. 10 out of 10 every time. 
15940 3 If you want fresh, tasty Chinese food, prompt friendly service and you are ok with either take out and a modest clean, atmosphere that is very reasonably priced, then you will love the Lucky Garden. 
15941 4 Great business to use. Excellent customer service. I worked with Javier and he is very good at what he does. Clean and convenient location too 
15942 0 This place gets a zero out of five. I had an appointment at 10, at 1045 I still haven't seen a dentist yet. Thank god I wasn't in alot of pain. Never coming back. 
15943 0 2pm Sunday. closed thought the sign said Tavern. 
15944 4 If you're looking for an awesome, down to earth, hip coffee shop then this place is perfect for you. Great food, nice staff and clean all around. Right in the heart of downtown Austin and it's literally walking distance from the Capital Building. 
15945 3 It doesn't look like much on the outside but the inside is very nice and the garden patio is lovely! The food is a bit pricey but good. I have eaten here twice and we had a good experience both times. The outdoor garden patio was my favorite. 
15946 2 What I like about this, not only the food but you can use the drive thru and it's uniqueness of it. Give it try, you will see what I mean. Really nothing mind blowing about Schlotzsky's, except maybe the insane high prices. 
15947 4 Very Awesome place , TV's Everywhere if your a sports fan as i am , Margaritas are the best i've tasted by far. 2 for 1 special cant beat it.... 
15948 3 The most helpful and friendly staff. It is so nice to have found a doctor that is dedicated to finding the root of the problem and fixing it, not just trying to fix the symptoms. I am really glad I found this place! 
15949 4 Wife & I frequent this location regularly. Staff is always very friendly & make an effort to remember us. They are efficient as well. Beverage quality is on par with any other good Starbucks location. 
15950 3 Shrimp and Grits were amazing! Nice and spicy! The biscuits and gravy were good. And the house coffee and caramel latte were great. The place was really cute, the staff friendly, and although it was pretty packed they were quick and efficient. 
15951 3 I really like flip burger. I get the turkey burger and all the flavors are perfect. Be sure to get fresh fries. They are hand cut and those aren't good after they get cold. 
15952 3 Good clean facility. Great services from Hien for myself (pedicure and eyebrow wax), and mani-pedi for my mom with Tina. Good prices. Friendly workers! Was offered water or soda while drying. Will definitely return! 
15953 4 I've been here for dinner and brunch. Fantastic food with great service. The sangria was very good and the arepas were great. 
15954 4 We have been coming here for awhile and each year it gets better. The haunted houses were amazing. I didn't really care for the walking dead haunted house, but the rest of them were very scary. But it's safe to say I will be returning next year 
15955 4 The falafel over rice and salad with house dressing is amazing. The falafel wrap is quite dope as well. Some of the best falafel. Support this new little locally owned gem. You'll be glad you did. 
15956 4 Seriously delicious. The whole bowl has got it going on! Who knew rice and beans could be so yummy? If you're looking for something simple and delicious in SE, this is the place to go. 
15957 3 Clean. Comfortable. Good service. Great location. Enough said! 
15958 3 Good service, price ($11.99) and variety for a buffet. Sushi was just average but that's what you'd expect at a buffet. 
15959 4 Great sandwiches. The place was crazy busy on a Saturday at lunchtime, but understandably - the food is great. Lots of interesting sandwich concoctions. I wish I could have tried more of the menu. Highly recommend for a quality lunch spot that's authentic and won't break the bank. 
15960 3 Good food, disgusting dirty bathroom. Management should clean in more, and perhaps have more than one. 
15961 2 I wouldn't get the Cubano again (too drenched in mustard and pretty small for $7) but the beer selection is admirable :) 
15962 3 Love this place, the food is average for the price, but it's a great place to eat. The staff are real friendly. I always take visitors from out of town here, sometimes you get to see Paul 
15963 3 Hurricane Grill is a great local spot by the water. My Fiance and I love coming here for a drink or bite on the weekends. Nice food and friendly service. Their pulled pork nachos are the best! 
15964 4 Delayed review for what was the best pizza I've had on the north shore. Went several times and always impressed. A shame if the reports are true that it's closed. 
15965 4 A classic seafood restaurant. We ordered 3 different things and they all were delicious. The service was great as was the cocktails. We especially liked that it was quiet enough for conversation. The decor was old seaport and we had a view of the harbor. 
15966 4 Really amazing food! We drive from Tampa just to get their seafood. These are worth every penny. 
15967 4 My wife stumbled onto this place while walking the freedom trail. After eat the poutine with pork belly and the crispy chicken sandwich I would suggest you find yourself here as well. Great music friendly staff. 
15968 4 The food was outstanding. We had the Wagyu Beef sliders and the baby grilled octopus. The octopus was cooked perfectly. The flavors were savory, on point. Great wine list. Had wine from Paso Robles, so amazing. Atmosphere was chill, relaxing with a touch of hipster. 
15969 4 So good, so friendly! Quite possibly the best taco I've had in my life. Highly recommend the barbacoa. 
15970 2 This is a great place. Wed. they have karaoke, but the second floor as time goes on it get packed. Get DJ, had a blast with my girl. Will go back for sure, for a good time. 
15971 4 Normally, not one for cupcakes, however, the organic carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and a double espresso was a great juxtaposition of bitter and sweet. Not too many places open on Sunday evening in Cambridge, so this spot was a Sweet find. 
15972 2 It's got a great NW atmosphere and your typical NW fare but it's a bit too expensive. I think the happy hour is decent and fun place to go after work. I think dinner is overpriced and overrated. 
15973 3 Turkey pot pie is delicious!!! I can't get enough of it. Mac n cheese and green bean casserole are fantastic. The bbq is awesome too! Staff is always friendly and professional. 
15974 3 This place is so fun, there location on 6th Steet is a perfect fit for the business here in Austin! I ordered two-dozen for my co-workers and I to try. We enjoyed them all, except the cereal topped ones, the cereal was chewy and not cruchy. 
15975 4 Excellent food. Very authentic and the price was right. I had tacos 3 different ways. Homemade guacamole was top notch. Wish they had their liquor license though. Could have used a margarita. 
15976 4 Been here many times. Food is consistent, Service is excellent. Highly recommend the Tuma won tons to start. Can't go wrong with the flat breads or burgers. Something for everyone 
15977 4 Very friendly staff. Fresh and clean food which tastes like the way it looks. It's vegetarian so for people like me is an added plus. Will be my new favorite whenever I'm in Boston. 
15978 3 Amazing food and great ambiance. Perfect for a special occasion but very laid back and not at all stuffy. 
15979 2 So slooooooow. Only one order in front of me and the order that came in after me, including food, were served before me. You have a great shop with much needed non-chain great coffee in SW, but you gotta speed things up. 
15980 2 Overrated and over priced. My local Chinese spot makes way better grub, for half the price, and delivers. A few pros: The staff is friendly enough and the restaurant is comfortable. The lettuce wraps are tasty, and half price during the day. I also like their iced tea. 
15981 3 Yes it's in an airport but it's still made well and tastes great. The lines were long both times we stopped here but they went quick and we got our food fast, and nothing was wrong. 
15982 4 French toast was amazing with REAL maple syrup & fresh marion berry syrup casual nice atmosphere located on the corner of S.W. 3rd & S.W. Pine with lots of windows 
15983 3 I got some gorgeous decorative tile for my bathroom at Roma. They have a good selection of really nice tile. Some of it looks like jewlery. They made the purchase really easy. I bought a case too many and the return was very easy too. 
15984 3 Everything on menu is $6. Although they out of most items the price is great for what they do have. The veggie burger rocks! Good size burger comes with either salad, soup or fries. Good deal! 
15985 3 Wow- great macarons and croissants. 
15986 4 Friendly service even at 10:30pm! And delicious donuts! Best donuts in the area. I will definitely go back if I am in this neck of the woods again. 
15987 0 Weird vibes in there and I don't think the bartender knew how to make a margarita the right way. Nasty. 
15988 0 A big downgrade compared to my experiences on Southwest Airlines: less comfortable waiting area, confusing, disorganized boarding process, skimpily padded coach seats, dirty plane windows. Then the two giant downgrades are the huge ticket change and baggage fees. Lastly, the passenger injury and death record is much worse than Southwest. 
15989 4 There was a small wait outside the "cozy" restaurant (20 minutes for a party of 6), but it was worth the wait! 
15990 2 Even tho the 3 star rating says A-OK, it really is Meh. But its not bad enough for 2 stars. I have eaten here twice for lunch, and while it was okay, it didn't make me want to go back. Ha-ha, but I did! 
15991 4 AWESOME coffee. The reg roast is one of my favorite. Their bagels are good. Probably the best "chain" bagel store out there 
15992 3 Never tried waffles for 'dessert', so I pretty nervous trying one when one of my friends told me about this place. All I have to say is that it was best freakin' waffle I ever had... Saus....I'LL BE BACK! 
15993 4 Went for my sisters birthday! Great drinks as well as food. I would probably only go for special occasions because of the price. 
15994 4 Amazing! Great coffee with out breaking the bank. Very cozy place and great service. Gabby is amazing, always gives us a nice warm greeting and great coffee art. 
15995 4 Awesome older flixs and Indy pics! 
15996 3 Love the new Dragon Bowl menu and concept. The roasted broccoli is amazing!!! We ate there twice this weekend. I'm a big fan of the classic Doc Cheys menu as well. We still frequent the Morningside location. 
15997 2 Friendly staff. Ample parking. Price slightly above average but portion is a bit generous. I've tried the shirmp in sour-based soup (sinigang) and friend pork with tofu -both delicious. My wife ordered the sizzling pork (sisig) and white rice, equally delicious. Will go back to that place. 
15998 4 Stopped by for brunch and was pleased with the choice. Food was good, as was service. The waitress offered some good suggestions as well. It's a be a great breakfast or brunch spot - just make sure you don't want a mimosa. No liquor served. 
15999 4 Fantastic service from the valet to the GM. Their food is excellent. The steak was right on par to better than the standard Atlanta legendary steakhouses. We went in on a whim and we are certainly going back. 
16000 4 Just enjoyed a great dinner. Sushi was super fresh and service was very fast! Have been many times and does not disappoint. 
16001 3 My new favorite taco place.. although props to the others.. my favorite has to change every once and a while to keep things exciting. I LOVE the pork w orange taco. Mmmmm 
16002 3 Almost always busy, always fantastic and worth the wait. The meat is high quality, the bread is delicious, the condiments are homemade, and the cocktails are classic but imaginative. Always a great place to go for a greater burger. 
16003 4 I really love the decorating and the food here. Everything is so good compare to other Thai restaurant. You can tell this place more authentic than others. Definitely come back again. 
16004 3 who would not want a well made huge burrito with chips and a variety of salsa.. I'm a fan of their Tomatillo salsa.. it is the BEST !! The homewrecker fills your appetite and you have chips to kill your time after lunch.. The taste is good as well.. 
16005 1 Sometimes good and sometimes very bad. Never been impressed and there has got to be better Chinese food in the Lewis Center area 
16006 3 Pretty good! The place looks a little divey, but the food was good and service was good. Price didn't break the bank. 
16007 3 Great coffee drinks and baked goods. If I am close by and want a coffee this is the place I go. 
16008 4 I'd like to repeat every other review by saying that the green sauce is amazing. My favorite thing is the fajita nachos. They use queso instead of melted cheese. 
16009 4 Dekalb medical hospital doctors are thoughtful my daughter is admitted almost every month the doctors call to make sure she is ok.No other hospitals call to check on her at all.Thank you Dekalb medical Center 
16010 4 We had a great experience. Fish & Chips, shrimp cocktail and coconut flan were all amazing! Perfect cole slaw! Atmosphere just fabulous... Loved the service too! 
16011 4 Thank you, HPB&G, for once again treating the entire faculty and staff of Bryker Woods Elementary to a fantastic end of year lunch! We appreciate your generosity, thoughtfulness, and support and are so lucky that you are a part of the BW family! Thank you!!! 
16012 3 This is one of those places where you can get a delicious one of a kind burger thats not like McDonalds or Burger King. Its kind of "pricey", but worth it. 
16013 3 No veggie menu Friendly service staff Good family atmosphere Hot coco is hot Fun menus Great prices 
16014 4 The food was amazing especially the empanadas vegetantes! I heard it has good reviews and I thought I should try it and you yelpers got me again! This is the second place I decided to go to and were right about. Thanks guys. 
16015 4 I LOVE X3!!! I've been a member since 2009 and I can promise you the workouts are never boring. Every class is challenging, but the instructors give options for advanced, intermediate, and beginners. It's always fun, always different, and always a challenge. 
16016 4 This place is great! I love the atmosphere. The people are friendly and the food is really good. We had the corn beef, salad, and the clam chowder (it has a little kick). We will definitely be back here! 
16017 3 So much more than just a good massage. My therapist was very thorough in making sure she had the right information to tailor the massage to my specific needs. The space is low key but very clean and comfortable. 
16018 4 A little expensive, but totally worth it! Their homemade OJ in mimosas made my morning 
16019 3 I love Produce! They have great cocktails and a nice environment. Can be a bit hard to find. Service is friendly and they outdoor patio is awesome. 
16020 4 Great service! Quick, free minor repair to glasses I didn't even buy from them. Great business development strategy! I'll give them business for sure. 
16021 3 Everytime I've been here the sandwiches have been really good and really fresh. Sometimes they pump some good music and there is alot of comfortable seating. Tons of frozen yogurt 
16022 4 Love this place. Fantastic food, great menu, and excellent cocktails. The happy hour is perhaps the best in Boulder. Make reservations, even for happy hour as this place fills quickly every day. Such a great asset to the Boulder food scene. Will be back again and again. 
16023 4 This is right near where I work which makes it very convenient and inviting. Also the staff are amazingly nice! They always get my order right! It is a very clean place that is never wicked crowded. I will go here for my tea fix every day! 
16024 2 Lousiest service ever. Although it was a busy lunch hour we waited at least 45-50 minutes for a fish sandwich & a burger. Somehow the cook lost an order slip. At least that's what we were told. 
16025 4 Kendall is an amazing teacher and her love of dance is very evident through her teaching. She does an excellent job explaining choreography and enjoys working with students at all levels, from the very beginner to the professional. Kendall is so fun to work with and her excitement is contagious! 
16026 2 Small pet shop. Has tropical fish, chinchillas, and a degu. My biggest impression of the store though is that they have a lot of birds. I went there to look at finchs specifically but they had tons of parrots, huge parrots who just roam around the store. 
16027 3 Great instruction and classes in a clean and inspiring environment. They offer classes and instruction for all levels. Plenty of parking. 
16028 3 Very tasty ramen. Nice that you can choose either pork belly or pork shoulder for your chashyu. 
16029 4 Consistently great and an unbeatable price. Can't go wrong with Chicken and waffles or sausage and biscuits! 
16030 0 sad to say...they are closed. we really wanted to check this place out. drove to the location to find it no longer exists...cheers 
16031 2 Such great sandwiches and bread... Quite rough around the edges, salty and blue collar, without a hello or an excuse me, Lambert's says I'm not gruff enough to wait the lengthy line. But it's absolutely worth the experience. 
16032 4 Schmidt's is always delicious. And the cream puffs are amazing! Loving the booths at the fairgrounds! 
16033 4 Big fan of Clement's paint. Scott and Ray and the rest of their employees deliver great service and their zero VOC paints are our go-to products. Convenient locations, great service, and quality products! 
16034 0 Worst experience ever. Waiting 40 mins in the drive thru and they still didn't get the order right. I will never be back again 
16035 3 Finally tried the filet mignon! Absolutely amazing! Sides were their Mac and cheese and the asparagus. Also great. Definitely recommend the steak! Pricey but great! 
16036 0 This place was disgusting. The floors were filthy and trash all over the tables. Not to mention the cashier girl Dolores was very rude and seemed annoyed that we had a big order. Lesson to be learned here....... always, always choose Chick-fil-A 
16037 4 Love going for a slice at happy hour, and taking a loaf of fresh bread home (we got the walnut and a raspberry croissant which were both good). Really tasty pepperoni! 
16038 4 Well the combinations of seasoning food is awesome I was very surprised at the food very good service was great 
16039 4 Best Chinese food at the mall !!!! Ask for your service To Go (more food that way) I used to eat at that place for while when I worked at Mall at Millenia and after years .... the taste is still the same. ...awesome !!! 
16040 3 Thai Cuisine is the perfect size restaurant, more intimate for small parties. The staff is extremely nice and courteous. The Garlic Shrimp was very good and the Larb salad is one of my favorites. I would highly recommend Thai Cuisine. 
16041 4 A large group of us visited here over a recent holiday weekend and all left satisfied and happy. The food was delicious, and the service was outstanding. We will definitely be back! 
16042 2 I ordered the combo, which is chicken and beef, with pita on the side for $13. The order normally has tzatziki sauce, rice, and a full container. Guy hands me a gyro with no rice in a half size container. It's a mess! 
16043 2 Their sandwiches are ok, but not that great. The meat is tougher than I like and the one I got had a big clump of fat in it. The baguettes are hard/stale to the point they kind of hurt to bite into. I want to try their beignets though. 
16044 4 This place is awesome! Great service, design and very clean. Very is super tasty! Portions are big. Very recommend this place!!! 
16045 2 We loved it, great food. Would have been nice if they waived the$ 8.00 per person cover charge since we spent over $ 200.00 on dinner 
16046 3 The exterior may not be too inviting. But the rooms will impress. Very comfortable beds. Clean and updated. Good location and a great value in price Booked a double queen bed room on a Tuesday for Friday night $55.00 on Travelocity. Will definitely stay again book early for best rates. 
16047 4 Loved this place. Good ol' fashion diner type. Classic fries and burgers that are just plain tasty. 
16048 4 Amazing amazing amazing! I'm from out of town and was looking for a good greasy spoon and this place was it. Great service and food was superb. Thanks Fat City! I'll be back! 
16049 0 The service is terrible, overpriced hookah that wasn't worth it. The owner was very unprofessional. Never would go there again. Actually looking forward to see this place shut down. 
16050 3 Wings.. good. Big TV screens... good. Boobs...good. Why the hell would anyone give this place less than 4 stars? 
16051 3 The food is absolutely delicious and the service is very pleasant. 
16052 4 This is by far the best tea place I have been to. I used to live in Boulder and went here everyday. Awesome people, good food and the best soy chai I have ever had. Place is always busy. I highly recommend. More tea than coffee though. 
16053 3 I went here for A casual drink and convo! Listen..the mojitos are pretty good with the cane sugar stick in it. 
16054 0 Screw this place. I have called 4 times trying to place an order and every single time they place me on hold and NEVER pick back up. I waited on hold for over 10 minutes before giving up. 
16055 0 Disgusting and bland, their kitchen looks smaller than most apartment kitchens. The food taste like it's been microwaved. Gross. 
16056 4 Dr. Zinsmeister is wonderful! He fixed my foot and did a spectacular job. Super personable, gentle and intelligent. Highly recommend him. The ladies at the front desk are extremely kind and helpful too! 
16057 3 Outstanding food. The bolognese is the best I've ever had. Fresh pasta, tasty drinks and usually good service make Stella one of my favorite places in the South End. After a dozen trips over the last year, I can happily recommend this place. Try the outdoor seating - it's great! 
16058 4 This place does the job. Threading is amazing. The girls are nice and patient. It's worth wait and also can't beat their pricing. 
16059 3 I love that bags fly free! I never have a problem with Southwest. Good prices and quality service. 
16060 4 Very expansive menu. Refreshing taste. Fast service for being lunch hour. Great service as well. Comfortable atmosphere 
16061 4 Appearances can be deceiving in this hidden gem. inside you will find quiet eligance with excellent food and service. Great for lunch too. Yummy sushi and plenty of choices. dishes can be modified for special tastes or needs. Nice enough for special occasions and yet family friendly for a weeknight. 
16062 3 The Mongolian salad is amazing! Value here is actually quite good - you can be very full on a side salad w/protein and cup of soup. Also, watch for coupons on the back of your receipt. 
16063 3 Great environment, friendly people and decent coffee 
16064 2 Not so great, donuts were good, but not fantastic like I have seen on Tv. Lots of weird stuff on the walls, which adds to the voodoo image, but not impressed with the dirty feel and tables that were sticky. Not planning to go back.. 
16065 3 The Laab salad was delicious and the red curry was pretty tasty. The pho and the veggie rolls we're "eh". Service was friendly and pretty quick. 
16066 4 Possibly my favourite bubbletea place. Bbt tastes fresh and fruity, and there's a good selection, not to mention specials for cheap! You can also get free pearls or coconut jelly. I think I'm addicted to their curry meat balls (and 8 for $2.50 is a pretty sweet price). 
16067 4 We had a blast on Friday, Latin night! I went to Gilt for a sorority sister's birthday. The manager was so nice that we got complimentary VIP access. We will definitely be back! 
16068 4 Man do I love this place!!! Can't wait until they open in my town comping soon in Wilmington, NC 
16069 3 The Veg. Lasagna and Chicken Cacciatore were amazing. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was very inviting. 
16070 3 Today's service was good. It wasn't as great as I had in the past. That's why it's only 4 starts today. The sangria is amazing also!! 
16071 4 Been coming here for years. Best cup of coffee and doughnut in town hands down! 
16072 4 Always a SUPER HIT whether I go with friends or family!! Their margaritas (virgin and alcoholic) are AMAZING and their enchiladas in the tangy chipotle sauce is to die for! Yummy! Definitely one of my favs in the area!! 
16073 3 I love this place. I like to get the build your own bowl and do the kale and cabbage salad as the base with Brussels sprouts, carrots, chicken, cilantro, and peanuts as the garnish and then the peanut sauce. Highly recommend. 
16074 2 this place was okay. the only downside to this place was that the walls were paper thin. neighbors were easily disturbed, then proceeded to complain. NOT COOL! 
16075 2 Great location and the staff was so friendly from the host to the bartender right down to our server! Typical Mexican fare....was good! There was a live mariachi band there too! 
16076 4 Tried four of their cupcakes today and they were AMAZING! I love cupcakes, and these are especially delicious. The cake was moist and delicious and the frosting literally melt in your mouth. This is definitely my new favorite guilty pleasure! 
16077 3 I have ordered take out from Zoe's twice and have been quite satisfied both times. The food is always ready crazy fast, it's pretty cheap, and it's great! The servings are large and can easy be shared among two people. Definitely a good option for takeout. 
16078 2 Pretty good, but not as amazing as i would have hoped. bacon was soggy, chicken was good, but definitely not better than a authentic hand made fried chicken sandwich 
16079 4 Great people. Great food. They care about quality and take pride in their work and it shows! Love them! 
16080 2 I love Dutch bro, the only thing I find strange is the turn over rate at this location they just come in go. There only a few staff members that seem to been there for long time. I rather see faces that I recognize then new faces every day. 
16081 4 Food is terrific. The wow factor is the customer service. I wasn't sure if they were pet friendly but my server Heather even brought a water bowl for my puppy. Fantastic atmosphere. I will be coming here more often when I move to Atlanta. 
16082 4 Great ribs and excellent selection of BBQ sauces. Everything was very fresh and tasted great. Even tried the Gator bites, which were delicious. Service was fast friendly. Definitely will go back. 
16083 3 Thin crusted tasty Italian style pizza. Suitable for both couples and groups. Noise level acceptable for conversation not meetings. Opened less than two years and popular. Make reservations. 
16084 3 Pork tenderloin is delicious. It could use a little more mashed potatoes with it, but it was great food. It's definitely authentic to Austin and worth checking out this time of the year. Service was great. 
16085 2 Korean families seem to love to celebrate family gatherings here, including ours. The prices and food are decent. This location seems to host a lot of parties because they have some relatively well-priced banquet menus. 
16086 4 Best Caribbean food in Orlando. I will be back for lunch and dinner. The Jerk Pork is excellent filled with flavor. The curry goat was delicious 
16087 0 Horrible experience!! Made appointment easy enough. Dropped off car, watched it come out from being washed. Then waited 45 minutes. No one touched it for 45 minutes!! Manager asked me to reschedule. Avoid at all costs. Better off doing it yourself, like I ultimately did. 
16088 4 I love their salads and the staff is always very friendly. I have been there on my lunch break a few times and the food always comes out in a timely manner. 
16089 4 Great dinner as always! Fantastic service and food! I loved the porterhouse and my wife loved the salmon! 
16090 4 Cozy, tasty, friendly, & seldom overcrowded. A great place for weekend breakfasts. Corned beef hash is solid - good eggs - proper iced-tea. Comfortable, well lit - charming and intimate in the way a diner should be. Highly recommend. 
16091 4 Nice place! Nice staff and Monday nights they do local hip-hop shows. great for the community. Educated minds are great hosts and people 
16092 4 We had the pad kee Mao with chicken, sizzling beef, yellow curry and pineapple curry. All were wonderful and reasonably priced. Service was attentive and cheerful. We'll definitely be back. 
16093 4 J&M diner is hands down no doubt the best breakfast/brunch around. There is always a wait, but it is absolutely worth it. The portions are massive, share or be excited to take some home. I have been there countless times, always satisfied with the food and the amazing friendly service. 
16094 3 Loved the little café and the bigger sized macaroons. 
16095 2 pretty much the worst food imaginable, but sometimes you need that in beacon hill. grab a drink here and get a pizza at ninos next door. 
16096 4 Fan Tas Tic!!! Delish food and bloody Mary's. I hear the Winedown Wednesday is amazing. Grits were great. Sandwich was mouthwatering and the flat bread was awesome! Recommend this spot for anyone! Fun nighttime music. 
16097 4 great job! she is kind and have great attention to detail. i love the alterations that she did. ela fez um trabalho maravilhoso!! 
16098 4 Came here for a late night study sesh. My clumsy friend dropped our chocolate banana bread and the barista gave us a new one! Service was great and the drinks tasted amazing. 
16099 4 happened to go for happy hour wooo the blody marys were great and the beer back also. the mini corn dogs were to die for, will surly go back. great staff 
16100 4 I used to not like Chili's but I gave it another try and the past 2 times I've been there the food was amazing. I loved the fish tacos. Yum!! 
16101 2 It's was good. Not great but good. Hot the double burger and fries. Good service too. 
16102 3 We have been there for dinner and brunch. Very special fish for dinner. Their omelette was delicious and good service. The restaurant atmosphere is good. 
16103 4 Awesome smoothies had the Matilda and it was so delicious. Friendly service Great morning sweet spot looking forward to coming back ! 
16104 4 Hit this on a perfect day. Atmosphere, view, and food were great 
16105 2 The liquor store took over the space of the recently polarized bar/music venue The blue monk. The downstairs still boasts a much needed dance floor on Belmont. It might just be the night I'm in here but there is a really tired San Fran meets Dig a Pony vibe. 
16106 4 Always helpful and prompt. No fuss no muss! Always greeted with a smile and friendly staff. 
16107 3 Great Japanese food for a great price. Offers student/faculty discounts on 3rd Thursdays and always have a plethora of sushi to choose from. Cool ambience with Japanese lanterns, grass blades, square cushioned chairs, and black and white photos. Oh yeah, and free wireless...can't go wrong there! 
16108 4 My favorite is happy hour. I recommend the bacon. They have a great choice of sake, cold is best here. The staff are always friendly and helpful. 
16109 3 Wide and tasty selection of foods. Everyone at my table ordered sea food and soup so I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but it was reasonably priced and very tasty. Fried banana desert comes in a crispy wrapper and is delicious. 
16110 3 It was not bad, the price is reasonable. The flavor just isn't as strong as other ramen places. Good service also. 
16111 4 Awesome food with the right quantity of all spices...Tastes delicious..Tried Madras Chicken and Chicken 65 biryani..Will definitely go again...A must visit to all the food lovers. 
16112 4 Joey G is one of the best experience service managers I've ever interacted with. He truly cares and tries everything to make things quick and effortless. Thank you! 
16113 4 Rich is terrific to work with-- I find tax time's a lot less stressful since I've started coming here. Highly recommended!! 
16114 0 Completely disappointed. Rice was mush and had a "weird" taste that I can only describe as "not right". The corn, which I can only assume was expired, was nothing but lime flavor and soggy texture. A waste of time and money. 
16115 0 I landed at MCO at 1:15. I waited a hour for a shuttle. It is now 3:27 I still have not arrived to my hotel. I WILL NEVER RIDE WITH MEARS AGAIN. 
16116 4 I ordered 2 slices to go----QUICK AND DELCIOUS. The Bacon Mushoroom and Ham and Pineapple slices is by far the best I ever had for sliced pizza to go. I will be back!!! 
16117 4 Awesome KFC!! And great service!! Have been here many times and am never disappointed. The owner is fantastic and will encourage Soju bombs all night long!! 
16118 4 I have used them for round trip airport trips for myself and family and they are always on time, professional and very friendly. I used to book book them for my boss (2009) and continued to use them for my personal use and have never had a complaint. 
16119 3 Good Nola food. A bit on the pricey side, but I do get my Cajun fix here. The desserts are great. 
16120 0 More and more of Carey's cars are having air fresheners in them. I hate that smell. Makes me nauseous. And their reservation app has poor usability. The service is otherwise fine. Those problems are a major nonstarter for me. I'll update my review if they fix the smell problem. 
16121 4 Company was like a 2 but our waiter (who goes by the alias Chad) was a solid 7. Maybe even 8 if you're feeling generous or have lower standards. Making this experience a full 10/10! Cheers. 
16122 4 Great German meat and beer restaurant. Have the lamb shank. Its amazingly tender and delicious. 
16123 4 I just moved to the area and dicovered this little joint just by pass by. Decided to try it and didn't regret. The food is good, fresh, and delicious, good portion for the price. This will definitely be my regular place to go. 
16124 2 A "veteran" establishment on Main Street, this little eatery continues to deliver the goods. Solid food and some great brew selections. Great for sitting outside on the patio section and people watching. 
16125 4 Food is great and the service is actually quite good!! This place can get really busy at times and the parking situation here is pretty dire at best - plan on carpooling. 
16126 2 There was no wait time to be seated because the place was pretty empty which was great. Our waitress was nice she messed up a little on our order but corrected it with no problem. The food was pretty good but my husband said the strawberry lemonade sucked! 
16127 2 Overpriced for the quality of food (I had the bibimbap) but good service and location. I probably would not return next time, but I enjoyed the experience. 
16128 4 Linh rocks! Gave me awesome lashes when I had none. Clean, friendly and takes you on time for your appointment. Convenient location in Southie. 
16129 4 I just had a fabulous cut and color with Laurie Ann at Halo. She is an experienced stylist and a licensed massage therapist so she has great hands. The salon is conveniently located in NE Portland and has an open and relaxing atmosphere. I highly recommend Laurie Ann and Halo. 
16130 4 I love this place. Coffee was excellent, food was excellent, atmosphere was excellent. I can't wait until they open in salem! 
16131 3 Delicious - two of us split the vegie platter (vegan) and there was more than enough food. Simple interior + nice people. We will definitely return! 
16132 2 An interesting landmark built to resemble a ship. it has an IMAX cinema and exhibition halls. 
16133 0 I would NOT recommend coming here. Terrible service and taste is NOT good. 
16134 3 I really thought this place has delicious food!!!!!! Gread home made bread, busy, fun atmosphere and great customer service. Only downside was my omelette was little dry....but the potatoes were YUM! 
16135 2 A little too expensive and pretentious for the quick lunch break. Food's pretty good though. 
16136 1 Friendly staffs, thought the service can be extremely slow and the place can be quite crowded... Their green tea bubble waffle was definitely nice. However, I would only recommend coming here if you really have the time to spare and don't mind being in a crowded area. 
16137 4 This place is so great. Very good value and always super fast and great service. The owners are super friendly. I brought 5 people here who had never had Ethiopian before and they loved it! I need to come by at lunch time and try the buffet. 
16138 2 Decent chicken caesar salad at an average price...that's about it. 
16139 4 My favorite store for plumbing issues. Well experience people and always great help. Very sad to see its door closed. Where can I find odd parts now-a-day with a great help? 
16140 4 Great service from the host to the bartender!! Great food and great drinks with fresh squeezed fruit!! Absolutely no complaints i will defiantly be back soon !! 
16141 4 I Absolutely love this place everyone was so kind and generous definitely returning back I love my pedicure and manicure everything was very clean and I met a earth Angel there today. 
16142 2 The doughnuts are good but too rich and overhyped in my opinion. This isn't your classic donut. It's a bit too fancy for me. Not sure it's worth the wait. 
16143 4 Generous portions, amazing flavor. Cafeteria like atmosphere but the food and service are certainly worth it. This place bustles with activity and energy. Highly recommended!!! 
16144 4 This was our first visit and I had the gluten free fried chicken and my wife had the steak and eggs special. Bother were amazing! We will definitely be back. 
16145 3 a very chill lounge to kick it with people. Not the place to get trashed and dance like crazy, but GREAT spot to catch up with friends, actually chat, and have a few drinks and shakes in this uber cool environment. bricks, and carpet rugs throughout. 
16146 4 Ah! Lichee Panner is the best thing you can get. They have authentic Indian flavors unlike other places where you find same menu and taste. 
16147 0 First time and last time. Red sauce was very runny, and the pasta was cold. Caesar salad was drenched in salad dressing and cheese, and someone in the kitchen had a heavy hand with the garlic. Save your money. 
16148 1 Long wait, small plate, food was blah. Will not be coming back too many options around the area. No rice or chicken shwarma. Price wise I'd get chipotle with guac 10 out of ten times instead of chicken with some bean soup and a couple pieces of lettuce with dressing. 
16149 4 This man is a beast. Fixed serval broken in under an hour at a discount since many of them required opening up the phone. Just an animal of an iPhone fixing machine. 
16150 4 I love the humble setting. The staff & chefs are amazing!!! My scallop & mushroom omelette was cooked to French perfection!!! I am looking forward to trying dinner. ‍ 
16151 4 Service is perfect. Don't know what to say more. I bought Samsung galaxy s8 from them and I'm happy. They're telling their honest opinion and just trying to make you happy. Thank you! 
16152 3 The best garlic Knots in central FL !!! Awesome Lunch specials, great service and quality.. 
16153 4 it was a great idea trying the app, and get someone to clean, she did all what I asked her for and I was so happy, definitely will schedule with her all the time 
16154 4 Honest folks here. Just what one needs when one's car catastrophically fails. Had my '92 Miata towed here when its tranny died and could have been massively taken advantage-of. But not by these folks. Thank you for being ethical in these times!!!! 
16155 4 Oh...my...gawd. The mushroom sandwich is to die for! The bartenders are fantastic, been the best I've come across in PDX so far. I've been to Muu-Muu's three times in the 8 weeks I've been in the neighborhood, and will continue to go. Love this place! 
16156 4 Can't go wrong with the chicken fried tenderloin and a ranch water. Add on a "fire in the hole" shot if you really want to get the night kickstarted. 
16157 4 Chad (the owner) has always been very accommodating. I have had my clothes done there time and time again and they have always been perfectly. I have also have items tailored and again, they have come out perfect! 
16158 4 Salmon chips are AMAZING & packed with flavor!! Definitely try them. Fontina cheese app was also tasty. John is a friendly server. 
16159 4 Love this place! Great neighborhood sushi place. The service is stellar, the owner makes this place. I eat here a least once a week! 
16160 4 OBSESSED. everything is good. I especially enjoy their veggie burger, fries and shakes! There will be a long line. GET OVER IT, it will be a good meal. Also, you drink beer in line and it comes in a goblet! Who doesn't wanna drink out of a goblet?! 
16161 4 Great beer and great people to talk to here. One of the best breweries I've been to, great selection and helpful bartenders. Tasty beer and a cool outside sitting area to meet some really interesting people Double bucket head. 
16162 3 I love this place! I come here often and enjoy the mussels. It could use some updating on the interior. It has a great menu and nothing seems to disappoint. 
16163 3 Good local bar with friendly staff. They recently changed it around a bit and now there are a lot more TVs for watching sports. The patio is a fun place to hang out when the weather permits. They serve food too....standard bar fare. 
16164 4 Favorite place in Atlanta. Everything on the menu is amazing. Dont miss the deserts the cream cheese and guave emanadas are good and the tres leches is some of the best cake ive ever had 
16165 4 Surprise treat out of the blue ! Authentic East Mexican food ... The best in Portland 
16166 0 I was so hype for this ride and it sucked. Spider-Man (which came out in 1999!) is WAY more immersive and fun. Skull Island is basically a 60 person tram with a movie. The animatronic Kong is not impressive, either. HUGE disappointment. :-( 
16167 4 Try something new! Just make sure everyone with you (including in your car, waiting in the parking lot, etc) is 21+ with valid ID. (seriously.) 
16168 2 decent food but a little pricey for what you get i would still go back there agian 
16169 4 Love this event! Every time I think to myself what possibly could be there that I'd want to go back for and then I find myself back at OMSI and have the BEST time! Can't wait til the next one! 
16170 4 Wonderful Vietnamese food. Have gone here 3 times already since they opened barely 2 weeks ago. They're so nice and friendly, and the food is amazing. My partner is strict vegan as well and there were plenty of options. 
16171 4 Excellent curry!! With a pleasant atmosphere and friendly service, this is one Thai gem you won't want to pass up. Will definitely eat here again. 
16172 4 The chicken was incredibly juicy with just the right amount of heat. Definitely will be back. 
16173 4 Yumm. Definitely the authentic taste I was looking for today! Very picky about carne asada & they met my standards 
16174 4 Great service and quick seating. Would recommend to anyone in area. They have a new margarita on menu. The view to outside is clear and well lit. Check it out for yourself you won't be disappointed. 
16175 4 Loved the outdoor patio dining. Beautiful. This was our first time here. The Drunken Noodles and Massaman Curry with chicken were wonderful. Service was great. Don't miss the Ginger Ice Cream - best I've had. 
16176 4 I have been going to Smita for the last 3 years. I have been here for threading and waxing.Never a bad experience. If you have a time constraint, it is good to let them know as there can be a wait sometimes even though you have made a reservation. 
16177 4 This is so cool!! I can't wait to take my daughter!! This place is very small, but so unique. I hope they do well so they can stick around. I've been telling everyone about it. 
16178 3 I finally experienced this place today and loved their burgers!!! Very different and their Zulu sauce, whatever it is, is great with the fries. I'll definitely be back to try their empanadas. 
16179 4 Visited Lechon while on vacation on the recommendation of a server at another restaurant. Turned out to be one of the best meals I have ever had. The drinks were amazing and the service was superb. I recommend this place to anybody in the Portland area or visiting. 
16180 4 Pizza and a couple drinks for me and my three girls for under $20. Great deal. Called ahead. Shows up hour and ready. Great toppings, tasty sauce and cheese and buttery crust. He even the in a couple cookies, can't beat it. 
16181 4 Place is amazing and no matter how many years go by it stays amazing ! If U are a true austinite U no about this place and I don't even have to explain why it's 5 stars 
16182 4 This place is so cute! They have clothes, some jewelry, and other little trinkets. My roommate bought ship glasses with a matching ice bucket. We went up to pay and they print out receipts on an old typewriter. The only downside is the adorable red couch is not for sale. 
16183 3 I've been coming here regularly since they re-opened after the fire next door. Thai Son's pho is always spot on, and it's one of the best in Vancouver. Service can feel a bit impersonal if you're used to western restaurants, but it's swift and consistent. 
16184 1 Standard Pizza Hut we wanted to pick it up so we came to the establishment however the establishments smells like fuel oil, save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else! 
16185 3 Good pho place with decent price! (The booths are really comfortable FYI!) Will definitely go again when I'm craving some Vietnamese food 
16186 0 I'd compare it to the cheap delivery chains around town just with a bigger price tag. Over cheesed, doughy. 
16187 4 Just came here because I saw a long line up of people, so I figured it had to be good. Then it was for a reason. Had the best butter chicken I've ever had. Highlight recommend it !! 
16188 3 Naomi did a great job: she is strong, polite, confident, and gave a great massage. I will happily go back. 
16189 3 Place has a million staff and the waitresses seem to work in pairs, may have been training but the amount of staff swarming around is crazy. Everything my party and I ordered looked great. I had the Singapore Street Noodles which were very good and came in a HUGE portion. 
16190 3 Still good every time we go! My boyfriend loves the huge selection here. Food is always fresh and the restaurant is kept clean. A little more expensive but worth the money! :) 
16191 4 Drive up at least once a month from San Antonio just to eat at 888. Best restaurant ever. Must try crispy pad thia and sizzling red snapper with red curry. 
16192 0 Stale fries, dry and cold burger, no straw and I asked for a happy meal toy, which I was charged for and never received. DON'T GO HERE! 
16193 4 Got passes here with Discovery Cove package. It was a great experience to see right before Discovery. My son got to see sea life like dolphins and sting rays before getting to swim with them. Then combined with Busch was even better. Lots of things to see. 
16194 0 Warren Rader is a complete jerk with no people skills. I cannot understand how he is still in business. 
16195 4 This place is Amazing!!! Affordable and fresh, with bomb horchata. I ordered the taco carbon and was not disappointed. Oh, and the drinks were strong. Great atmosphere for after work or celebrating birthdays. Will be coming back. Staff were friendly as well 
16196 4 Wechat official account : chihuoboston Everything is so fresh and the food is soooooo good Love it :) 
16197 4 Oh my. The eggs Benedict and sausage n gravy are Devine. What a fun place. Keeley, great service and Chef Rick - awesome food. We will be back when we come through the area 
16198 4 Restaurant has great service and the atmosphere is lovely. Food is unique and so delicious!! Cocktails are beautifully crafted and tasty! Taproom is a super fun spot and you can enjoy multiple items from the kitchen for a fraction of the cost! 
16199 4 The food was great but the service really put this place over the top. Everyone was so accommodating and genuinely wanted to make sure you enjoyed the meal. Would go back in a heartbeat. The best tortilla I've found since moving to Boston! 
16200 1 The food tasted good. The waitress who took the orders were trying too hard to sell their products (i don't like this). They rushed us when we were deciding what to order. The price of the food was not cheap at all. 
16201 4 The best roast beef and onion rings bar none. Period. Great folks who have run the establishment since I don't know when. Wonderful. 
16202 4 One of the best hotels we've stayed in - just everything is free and comfortable and staff are lovely. Spread the word about this place. 
16203 3 Wonderful food with an old fashioned style. My mother would love this place. I had the Nova lox plate with scallion cream cheese. Amazing! 
16204 1 we went for dim sum, but i can tell some of the dim sum such as shrimp dumpling might be brought frozen in some kind of asian market. all the dim sum we had were just ok, nothing special. 
16205 4 The best rotisserie chicken I've ever tasted and the white dipping sauce just as amazing. Super nice service 
16206 4 Best Chinese food we have ever had! My husband and I both ordered the chicken and mushrooms entree. Everything about the meal was tasty. We should have split it because the portions are huge. I can see why this place is highly rated on yelp. Will definitely be coming back. 
16207 3 I'm not an expert on Korean food but I've had good and bad - this was really good. Sad to see restaurant empty on a Friday night , is worth a visit ! 
16208 4 Always happy with the pedicures here - they can generally take me right away, and they last for a long while (I always get a gel pedicure). 
16209 3 Great place love the smoked mushroom ravioli, wine selection and staff. Just wished they would take reservations 
16210 4 Had a great visit. Dr. Pena was wonderful! Very knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable. Best dermatology visit I've had since moving to Texas in 2010. 
16211 1 The food was wonderfully flavorful. The execution of the meal was well below expectations. The apps arrived at very different times, well below temperature. Service was poor. The atmosphere was forced festive, demeaned by way too loud Greek disco music. It was almost punishing. 
16212 3 Had a drink made with egg-white... Amazing but don't remember the name! Really cozy restaurant. Make sure eat there in summer as they have a really nice backyard dining... 
16213 4 Demais! Todas as atendentes são brasileiras, a comida vem rápido e tudo é muito bom. Porém meio caro... 
16214 3 Great little place hidden away in the New Seasons lot in Happy Valley. Love their pastries! 
16215 3 Its always excellent... authentic, delicious and easier than going to Lebanon!!! 
16216 3 This large bowl of Pho cost $9, the small one is $8.5, they also have combos for you to choose. Friendly ladies and men, cozy environment. Amazing broth and noodle!!! 
16217 1 Called in flowers over the phone and I was pretty unimpressed with the arrangement they delivered. 
16218 2 This is a good restaurant, absolutely. Food was good but hamburger slightly overcooked vs pink as promised but tasty nevertheless. So... One star for location One star for price One star for friendly staff (Rob) Minus star for food Minus for "Above and Beyond Expectations" factor - it simply wasn't. 
16219 4 Amazing ambience. We come here often on weekends to work. Love the feel of the place. Coffee and baked goods are 
16220 1 Weak, weak $8 hoagie. I'm furious I paid that for a grilled cheese with packaged turkey slices. The sandwich was less than a inch tall. Ripped off! 
16221 4 I don't normally leave reviews, but the food here is amazing! Yes, they serve a variety of food on the menu, but it is most accurately an Indian food restaurant. Chicken swarma is fabulous- so flavorful. Prices are excellent, too! 
16222 4 This place is great! The food is awesome and the service is great! The food is prepared very quickly, and they were so kind to bring us dessert on the house, not once, but TWICE! Well deserved 5 star review, I will definitely be back! 
16223 3 Welcome! Great food. Excellent service! It is great to have this wonderful spot open.!Ate the sausage and beef. Both tasty and seasoned perfectly. Recommend it highly! 
16224 4 They did an amazing job with a catering order we had this past weekend!! We ordered for 20 people and there was enough for everyone to have seconds and even take some home. We were all impressed with the quality and quantity of the order. 
16225 3 Don't let being at Disney fool you. You can get serious eats here. Of course the potato wrapped snapper is the draw, but I had a LOVELY steak here as well. Sitting at the bar watching the kitchen work is a nice treat too. 
16226 4 The best Greasy Spoon in Portland hands down! The hash browns can't be touched and I haven't found thicker bacon anywhere. You will come back I promise! 
16227 3 This place is great, usual cabbagetown friendly, funky wait staff, the food is great, and cheap!! Best fish tacos in da ATL period. Great outdoor patio to boot. 
16228 3 Simple menu, reasonable prices. Delicious bacon, and the banana pancakes are awesome too. It's a great go-to breakfast/brunch joint with the kind of atmosphere you appreciate on a very lazy Sunday morning. Simple, straight forward breakfast option for anyone who lives in the area. I'll be back. 
16229 4 My wife and I loved the food here. I had the chicken & waffles and she had eggs. The food was fast and the service was excellent. When I go back to Vancouver I will be back. 
16230 4 Awesome place! First time and I am already super impressed with Grace's work! I have super long hair, but she did exactly what I wanted(and even more) in less than an hour! Will definitely come back! 
16231 3 Good Japanese steakhouse. We've been there two times. The waitresses could do better service wise, but the chefs are good at their thing and the food is good. Not the best I've had but better than Kobe from a price standpoint and taste standpoint. Would go back again. 
16232 3 This a reliable go to. The wait staff is attentive and friendly. The food is tasty and cooked as ordered. 
16233 4 I brought my classic German 4x4 for rust removal and paint. My expectations were met which means Laser made the Vehicle whole again. They found the correct paint color and did a flawless restoration to the exterior. Thank you Laser and team 
16234 4 Delicious food. Friendly staff. The dinner menu is super awesome! 
16235 4 I recieved impeccable service here yesterday! My nails look amazing, and I can't wait to come back! Such a convenient location, and the technicians are all so nice, and they even laughed at my jokes, haha! I'll be coming back here for sure! 
16236 4 Awesome oxtails!! Great food and friendly service :) Great joint before heading to ATL. 
16237 4 Crazy good, healthy, and filling wrap. The owner also dropped off an amuse bouche just cause. 
16238 4 Loved the entire original experience. One that only Austin's eclectic food scene could provide. Donuts and "Real" food (combined) as a desirable pallete pleaser!! Can't wait to return. Try the Saussy Cock! 
16239 4 Medusa Skates is the best. Great staff, great service, great selection. Going anywhere else is a dumb idea. Don't be dumb. 
16240 4 Nyema gave me a Global Keratin treatment. She's super professional, timely, and fun. I will definitely be back, great environment and price. 
16241 4 Absolutely loved this place! The salon was very clean and well-maintained, and all the technicians were friendly and fun. Great customer service. First time visiting: no question I will be back! Beautiful results and great attention to detail. 
16242 0 The bot chien was dark and cold. It was crunchy and taste good when I tried it before. Maybe they changed the recipes? The food looks oily like they have been using old oil for a long time. Had to throw away what we ordered. 
16243 4 This place was amazing! I had the Soba Set that rocked my world. The noodles are made fresh and the broth was outstanding. The sushi super fresh!! I will be coming back again. 
16244 4 Do not have to pre-think about workout before arriving. Every workout is different. High intensity makes me feel like I am optimizing my 60 minutes. Music and energy of class makes the 60 minutes fly by. Its super fun and you see results! Also, great coaches and staff! 
16245 3 A friend introduced me to this place. What a delight! The potato pancakes were good. A bit oily, but hey...it's tasty. We also had the kielbase kebabs, which was fresh and delicious. Will certainly come back again. 
16246 4 This pizza is the best in Portland and surrounding area. It is as close to east coast pizza that you can get out here. 
16247 3 I went to Blue Ginger tonight for dinner and it was as good as it was the last time. On this trip I had the Blue Ginger roll and the Kamikaze Roll. Both were expensive but both lived up to their names. 
16248 4 Awesome! sashimi is fresh! The owner is kind and service is great! I like the scallop most! 
16249 4 These guys are fantastic. We have an older vehicle and found the mechanic we have been looking for for 25 years. They know what they are doing. We found everyone to be very polite and professional. 
16250 0 The pizza is ok. The owner is rude and aggressive when there is a simple misunderstanding. You can gain clarity politely. 
16251 4 Best Asian restaurant in Austin, IMO. Delicious, wide variety of food, and great service! Open until 2am. 
16252 3 Good drinks, decent food, great atmosphere. Also onsite parking for free! 
16253 3 What can I say....... Chipotle is some good food. This place is cool. Large seating area, typical quick servers, and good parking. Just have to deal with a roundabout. Workers are nice and a fine looking group. 
16254 3 Been there multiple times. Great bakery, awesome selection. Busy all the time. Breakfast paninis are delicious. Staff just seem a tad impersonal especially the people at the checkout counter. 
16255 3 This place has stood the test of time. Real hot-dogs, real good. No boulder attitude at all. 
16256 4 Best Thai food in the Southside area! If you're in the area or by the Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson Airport Zab E Lee is your best bet to go too! Amazing Authentic thai cuisine in town! 
16257 3 Meow, meow, meow. Meow meow meow mew meow. That's my cat, Kicius. He says this place was great. He loved the friendly staff who quickly ferried him away from the barking dog in the waiting room. Quick, easy checkups and such nice veterinarians. Right, Kicius? Meow! 
16258 4 Great chicken schnitzel, food here is excellent, service is also very good. The excellent reviews here are well deserved. 
16259 3 Very solid, strives to do wine, beer, and liquor well without being a warehouse-sized store. They select well and keep things interesting. The shelf of exotic singles (beer) is truly impressive. Prices are not great, but given the apparent collusion among local liquor stores to overcharge, they're not outrageous. 
16260 0 We stayed at the Hotel for one night. Very nice room, tap room, restaurant. The problem is they double charged me for the room. Even though I had the confirmation number and receipt. I had to go to my bank to get it taken care of. 
16261 4 Awesome. That is all. 
16262 4 Great drink specials and food selection! Really enjoyed the mango mojito and chicken burrito. Our waitress, Montserrat, was friendly and provided great service. Would recommend 
16263 3 Beautiful restaurant! Food and drinks are great. Was able to try a pasta dish, salmon and duck. All were very good and full of flavor. 
16264 1 Want good Italian food for the same price? Go to the North End. This place is one star away from the Olive Garden. 
16265 3 Very cute dessert place. Huge portions. Macarons, but not so tasty compared to La Duree or the ones made by J'Adore Macarons. Asian style desserts. 
16266 3 It was solid. The kraut tasted a little burned, but everything else was really good, sausages to cream puffs. a word on the cream puff, its the size of my head. Next time I'm in Columbus (a word on Columbus, its a VERY cool town), I'll definitely go back. 
16267 4 I am a fan for sure. It is amazing how they get such amazing flavors without any butter or fats all without going over 475 calories. Hard to find when you are looking for a decent restaurant that is health conscious. 
16268 4 Excellent! The broth is not too salty like Michi and Tatsu-ya. It tastes like the Ramen I had in SF. 
16269 3 Hyde Park Grill rarely disappoints. The Pork and Mac melts in your mouth, and the Fried Egg Sandwich is great with a freshly-squeezed mimosa and a side of their legendary fries. It can get pretty busy at peak times, so go during the off-times to get a table more quickly. 
16270 4 friendly staff and the service is great... Placed an order over the phone and when I arrive they offered a special they were having wi thy out me asking 
16271 1 Terrible customer service. They do not operate under the mentality of the customer is always right. They don't even operate under the mentality of making customers happy. Safeway no matter the location is a crock unless you have a Safeway card, terribly overpriced. 
16272 0 Strongly would not recommend this place bad employees the drive-through is always broken for the second time in a week they forgot my fries employees do not keep up with the cleaning and the cook did not look concerned about touching his face and not changing out his gloves. 
16273 0 I just was delivered a zero- star pizza. Paper thin and rock hard. Literally as tough as beef jerky. I think this pizza was probably left over from yesterday and put back into the oven today. Worst pizza I've ever had in my life. 
16274 4 The chicken garlic pizza was delicious. Great customer service from a foxy brunette! Definitely will recommend this place to my friends 
16275 4 I love this place.Not only do the have a great selection of flavors, but a full toppings bar. I feel like a little kid every time. Also super clean and very friendly staff. 
16276 4 Great service! I love coming here for any treatments. The staff are kind, courteous and friendly. 
16277 4 Best sushi I've ever had. Just sit at the bar and let the sushi chef give you what he wants. It's amazing. Good prices, too. 
16278 4 Ok, this place is totally a dive but the pizza is amazing! Go here if you don't care about the atmosphere or service but you want some great pizza for cheap. The hawaiian, mr. toad's wild ride, and the smokey joe are my favorites. 
16279 3 Great sandwiches and salads. Friendly and fast service. Pizza is perfecto! 
16280 4 I love the homemade fettuccine noodles and the lighter option. Good Italian food. Be ready to pay a few dollars though. It is pricey. 
16281 1 Nice selection of cold cuts and tasty coffee drinks, but mediocre bread (including extremely dense and tasteless sourdough), no cheese, and poor service. Not worth your time. 
16282 4 I am in love with this place. My corporate office is in the Back Bay Area and someone local suggested I check this place out. My life will never be the same! The tower was amazing, service was excellent and the poached butter lobster tail changed my life. Incredible! 
16283 4 Amazing atmosphere! This restaurant was the perfect mix of chill and fine dining. With it's laid back, knowledgeable staff, and creative entrees, I will definitely going back. Get the crab cakes if you go! 
16284 4 Easily the best chinese buffet food in the Portland/Vancouver area. All the food was fresh she being rotated out...The waitress was prompt with seating abd refills...it was busy but still full food and easy to walk around. 
16285 1 This place is Very overpriced! $4.75 for one scoop of ice cream, seriously?? The place smells nice and ice cream is just ok, but extremely overpriced and overrated. I will not go back or recommend this place. 
16286 3 This colonial tavern offers a variety of beers on tap, regular tavern menu and is conveniently located in the tourist part of Charlestown. 
16287 2 Good selection of Vietnamese dishes. Bahn Mi was descent. Bubble drink was disappointing - tapioca pearls were not fresh so hard to chew. Good service. 
16288 4 Nyra is the best server ever. She is always so sweet and make sure my order is always right. Definitely will be back! 
16289 4 I recommend taking the Lower Mcleay Trail to the Wildwood Trail and up the the mansion and then back down (5 Miles round trip). Or you can park on NW Lovejoy and go on the WildwoodTrail (an shorter route). 
16290 4 Food came out hot and exactly how we asked for it, our drinks were refilled constantly and our waitress Emily was awesome and on top of things. Great experience. 
16291 0 I went there looking for something to wear. I have never seen such a collection of execrable, flossy, unwearable clothing in one place in all my life. Who wears that stuff? 
16292 2 Solid little take-out/delivery place. Prices are reasonable, and the chicken parm basket is a good value. La Mamma's has gotten me through more than a few hungry nights. 
16293 4 I love this place! The most delicious fried chicken in Austin. Also very fond of their healthy grilled chicken options! Great place for every type of person. 
16294 3 Great pizza. Not a ton of seating so hope you don't show up on a busy night. We had the chicken broccoli Alfredo pizza it came out fast and was very flavorful. 
16295 3 Very nice hotel, centrally located, with wonderful pricing. Food and service were all outstanding. 
16296 4 I'm a regular here. It's the best Japanese food in the entire Greater Boston area. Everyone's friendly, and the wait can be long, but it's always worth it. 
16297 3 I like Cracker Barrel because the food taste like they have a little old lady in the kitchen cooking everything... like your grandmother would make it. The prices are reasonable and the food taste homemade. 
16298 3 My burger was really good. The hostess, order taker and server were all very personable. The location is perfect. 
16299 3 Great little spot for breakfast. They have a nice variety of different options from savoury to sweet. You can eat inside or enjoy your meal on the sunny patio. 
16300 4 I ordered catering form here and the guy waited 30 minutes for me to get there to pay for the food! AMAZING SERVICE and DELICIOUS PASTA. I would recommend the pesto shrimp-- its so good! I cannot wait to go back and eat again and again. 
16301 4 Very consistent, very quick and easy! A very nice place during lunch and dinner A friend recommended and now I'm a regular. 
16302 4 First time here and the food was not only delicious but the atmosphere and view of the innerworkings was very interesting to see before our meal. The ultra spicy level 1 ramen was perfect and hit the spot! I will be back for more! 
16303 4 Fantastic service & pricing. I stopped in while visiting from Edmonton. This has been hands down the best manicure & pedicure I've ever had. Friendly service & professional job. Great hand/foot massage. 
16304 4 Friendly and informative staff with a strong passion for the donuts they serve. Wonderful recommendations when asked. The donuts are either cake or brioche based with modern flavors including passion fruit, blueberry, olive oil, etc., Well worth the visit. 
16305 2 Good burgers. Nice toppings. But sometimes they forget to put all the stuff you ordered on the burgers. Fries are McDonald's. Tad overpriced. 
16306 4 What a bicycle shop should be. As a year round commuter, you need help when you're bike breaks on the way to work. Stefan remembers my bicycle, what he's repaired, gets the work done on time, and always does that little thing to make it work better. 
16307 3 Live music, flavored mojitos, caipirinhas, and tapas like grilled flat iron steak, hearts of palm, arugula, clementine, white balsamic and lemon make this great place kick back, relax, and enjoy some really good food. 
16308 3 The taco salad, The loaded nachos and the quesedillas are awesome. Didnt know this place existed until 2 weeks ago. Evertything is very fresh 
16309 3 My new favorite place in Austin,TX is flyrite chicken!! When you go make sure to get your sandwich "Superfly", you'll thank me later! They took Chicken Sandwiches to the next level. 
16310 2 I'd give a 3.5 if I could. This place is fine and I like the big outdoor tables but you are in a parking lot. Good beer....got the lentil salad with arugula, which was good but all the lentils and yogurt dressing made it a bit too wet. 
16311 2 Not open when their website says they will be. 3 pm on a Friday is during 11:00am-5:00pm, right? I'm not saying you have to give me 2 weeks' notice before adjusting your schedule, but if you aren't gonna be open, have a little notice on your website, or Tweet it. 
16312 4 Excellent work on a small surface (ladys watch) friendly, quick, reasonable price. Would def use again/recommend~~!! 
16313 4 Delicious baguette sandwiches and crepes! The atmosphere was relaxing, many a good meal and conversation were had here during our summer in Portland. 
16314 4 Three weeks after tasting Render's cortado, I still reminisce about it. It's become one of the Boston anchors that could pull me (a Californian) back. Their lattes and bagel sandwiches are also surprisingly delicious -- surprising because high reviews sometimes lead to disappointment, but they were REALLY good). 
16315 4 just had the lamb meatball sandwich.. it might be the best sandwich i had! cant wait to try other stuff on menu. 
16316 0 I rate this places no stars. This is some bull. He told me at the front desk this was best room.. I wouldn't recommend this super 8 to know one. 
16317 4 I adore this place. The selection of juices is vast and all of the juice I've tried so far have been delicious! The staff are always friendly and the atmosphere is very welcoming. I really like the coffee and crepes too! 
16318 2 Great quality and taste but Indian food is really the cheapest in the world so I dunno how Vij managed to bring the prices up to unreasonable amount. Bring the down the prices and let people enjoy their food without feeling snobby. Redefine luxury food of India! 
16319 3 Delicious food. Great service. Staff(especially the coffee staff) is a little rude. I was asked to move to the back room because, according to the barista, the restaurant was getting full while there were only a couple of people occupying a single table. I'd go back but mostly for takeout. 
16320 3 Great food. The location is nice too, when you find parking. The one downside is that they don't take reservations but they do call ahead. However, if you have party larger than 6 they won't move tables to accomodate everyone, so you would separated from your party. 
16321 4 Clean bathrooms, lots of parking available. About 5-6 food options including one inside the connected gas station. I'll use this rest stop in the future when traveling north and coming back home. 
16322 3 Comida é boa. Em se tratando de Orlando o horário de atendimento é bem elástico o que ajuda muito. Equipe muito atenciosa. Recomendo e retorno com toda certeza. 
16323 4 Amazing venue for a birthday with a couple of friends. Great food and great entertainment. You have to go to even understand what the rave is about! 
16324 4 Love this place! The manager David sat us down right away. We had so much delicious sushi we could explode! I highly recommend the special salmon roll...it melts in your mouth! I need to come here more often. 
16325 3 I appreciate the well-lit displays, the variety of products available, as well as, the helpful staff. 
16326 4 Most amazing burgers and the late night hours are perfect for the night owl. Real gem on that side of town. 
16327 4 Surprisingly it was my moms first time at Panera. The cashier was very patient with my mom and answered all her questions. Such friendly staff and relaxing environment. The food was great and filling. Love the strawberry salad. If I lived in the area, I'd probably come here almost everyday. 
16328 3 This hotel really did exceed my expectations! Came here with our dog and they are very dog friendly. When checking in they gave us a goodie bag for our dog. Rooms are clean and quiet. Would stay here again! 
16329 4 Everything about this place is top notch! From the office itself to the staff and all the latest dental equipment! All of it and the staff are amazing. The dental hygienist was so patient with my 5 year old and Dr. Cook was so sweet to my boys! 
16330 4 Excellent sushi and sashimi. Freshest sashimi in Austin, and I've gone down the Austin Eater list. Also, they have a riceless roll option (the Austin roll) which is appreciated. Staff and service is prompt and friendly. 
16331 4 I've never had such a delicious serving of Mac and cheese. Bleu cheese, franks hot sauce, chicken and penne. I recommend it greatly! 
16332 1 Good pizza, slow service. Lots of choices on Hanover but wet settled on this one. Enjoyed the food, and it did get out quickly server got lost somewhere for 30 minutes. Good place if you're not in a hurry. 
16333 4 Creature Comforts is the Starbucks location in Animal Kingdom. They have it going on! The line moved quick. Everyone was nice and my order came out quickly. Get a Mickey Cinnamon Roll! It is HUGE! 
16334 3 They did a good job in a timely manner. No complaints. Framing in general is expensive. I didn't find it any more expensive than other places. 
16335 4 We loved the #6 pie. It had just the right amount of flavorful toppings. 
16336 4 Nice, little local barber shop, and not too expensive ($20). Holli was very good. No complaints. 
16337 1 Ehhh. Not a fan of this place, but gave it a try. Yelped this one and it was a miss. 
16338 2 The food's great (especially the burger) but could someone, anyone, pay attention to their customers? And when they do grace you with the bare minimum of their attention, could they lose the attitude? Pretty please? 
16339 1 Overpriced for less than mediocre food. Also they charged us for water... We chose the still water option which is typically "tap" but when we got the bill their "tap" water was ten dollars a round. Won't be going back 
16340 0 Sour summit on Friday I guess! Pulled in on Sunday and no IPA on tap. Ordered a sour, obviously not my thing, never drink one again! How do you not have an IPA on tap? 
16341 4 Wonderful job, prompt service. Great communication. Will use this team again in the future. Thanks! 
16342 4 Love the collection and not too pricey.. The lady was also super helpful I would definitely come here.. 
16343 4 We just went to Urban Garlic and found out from the cart next to it that they are closing for good. :( I'm so depressed, and I'm going to miss the sweet "Garlic Lady." It was one of our top five places we always wanted to go to in Portland. 
16344 4 Charming, cute place with beautiful kind people. The food is delicious! The tables idea guacamole was the BEST I've ever had! We will be back for the fresh food again!! 
16345 1 Going to this restaurant was a big mistake. Really bad food. Nothing close to persian food. Service wasn't good either. Worst part is they include a 20 percent tip. 
16346 3 Awesome Sandwiches. I ordered the special - chopped steak and cheese. It hit all the notes you would expect. Crispy bread (not burnt), gooey cheese with a nice cheddar flavor, and tendered chopped steak (Philly style) with a deep flavor. It was a welcomed and much needed meal during SXSW. 
16347 4 Fabulous Toys, fabulous prices and fabulous employees! Once you step foot in this cute little shop, you won't want to leave. There is complimentary gift wrapping, so take advantage of that! 
16348 4 I eat there every Thursday. This man makes the best burgers/ sliders in town. Seriously worth going and trying from anywhere in the Portland area. AMAZING ! 
16349 1 Place is great but I'm confused why we have to asked for knives and napkins and have people ignore us. These things should be out like everyone other restaurant 
16350 4 I love this place. It isn't cheap, but worth the money. Great salsa and queso. Order the crab enchiladas or the enfrijoladas with a chilango margarita. My only complaint is how loud it is inside. 
16351 4 Friendly service, great atmosphere with tricking fountain and nice decor, and delicious food! Lots of great options that I've never seen at other Thai restaurants. I got the jackfruit dessert, which was fun and interesting. I would definitely recommend. 
16352 4 Awesome steaks and the brie appetizer is so amazing it should be a dessert! Consistently good over several visits. The Blue Ox never disappoints unless you can't get a reservation! 
16353 4 Great for lunch... great for night life... Can't go wrong here- Tracie, Gina, and Peggy are amazing. 
16354 1 Sent in jeans and shorts for minor patching. They did the job I guess but it was overpriced compared to previous places in Vancouver and the quality looked rush. They do have good hours and are convenient. 
16355 0 Yummy donuts but went in with family and staff couldn't have been more rude and surly. Not going back. Maybe they are so used to serving angry drunks that they don't know how to be polite to families? 
16356 4 We ordered the pork with yellow rice and beans. The pork was tender and flavorful and the rice had bacon and fresh cilantro. Very delicious! For $6.95, it came with a side salad as well. Excellent little place with cute decor! 
16357 3 The atmosphere of the room is so good,the foods are actually pretty good but my whole attention was on chatting so Waiters are really nice 
16358 4 Omg! The crepes were so delish! And they also have hot dogs. I ordered the mojo dog which had seaweed as a topping. I was worried that imight not like but it actually was really good. Can't wait to go again :) 
16359 3 4 stars because the food is just so good. Don't ever come on a Friday or Saturday for a night out, but come by for food and leave satisfied. Country fried chicken is great, the blackened chicken pasta is delicious, and all of the fried apps are worth a try. 
16360 3 My son's favorite beef eating and people watching spot. Love the Portobello burger. My T-rex has tried them all and loves them! 
16361 4 Everything has always been top notch when we come here. Luis had always taken care of us, and the food is tasty. 
16362 3 Great casual dining! Went with my 12 year old step son and was pleased to find light options that tasted amazing! Highly highly recommend the Ensenada Chicken - so yum! Fun decor fun place fun family place! 
16363 4 The servers and managers were very friendly, the sushi was amazing, and our drinks were never empty! My wife and I decided to have a date night, and will definitely be back! 
16364 1 This place offers some good Mexican food but not the best some stuff is tasty other are a waist of money and almost everything in the menu is guarantee to give U a stomach ache for a couple days 
16365 4 Britney was the best! I had injections that help with fullness in my face and she won't over do you! I will be back Britney!! Don't leave anywhere 
16366 2 Got the eggs benny, portion size is extremely small, only getting 1 tiny egg, so I suggest getting 2 eggs, maybe even 3 if you're really hungry. Langauge barrier affected service. Food came quick. 
16367 3 Lunch Review... Excellent service, very tasty entires which includes the ginger fish special and the juambulia. Great service... ENJOY! 
16368 3 Tacos are incredible - unique, flavorful, exquisite. Not a fan of the chicken skin. Little pricey. 
16369 0 Information is wrong. They close at 10 pm on Fridays. I just had the door hurriedly locked in my face so my date and I couldn't come in. Very rude. The employee could have at least spoken to us instead of closing the door on our faces. 
16370 3 Really good lobster roll! Price was a bit high for the size. Quality was excellent though! 
16371 1 Been there twice. First time was great. Last time was pretty disappointed. Our lab bodean came home with the back end sliced up pretty close to the skin in several areas. I called. Texted photos and never heard back. 
16372 0 Awful awful awful. Wait times are absolutely horrendous. I waited 15 minutes for a regular iced coffee. A regular coffee should require zero wait. You want to order a foo-foo frappuccino then a wait is required--not for a regular coffee. Unacceptable. 
16373 4 This is definitely a must try ice cream place in Boston! So many different choices to choose from! The egg puffs were a great addition and service was very quick! If you are in the China town area definitely stop in! You will not be disappointed! 
16374 4 Great place on a nice afternoon. The brat and chicken were awesome. And the fact you can add beer and cider makes it perfect. I highly recommend. 
16375 2 They have pretty good pizza andthey just redid the restaurant so its actually really cute now. I'd stop by, its a friendly spot. GOOD FOR: Pizza. 
16376 3 This is a cute little space right in the middle of the Harvard street buzz. great coffee, great ice cream, great people...odd use of space. 
16377 0 Definitely not returning here. Salty food, overpriced and very slow service. Not sure how this place is able to maintain business. 
16378 3 This is a great restaurant in Southie. Fair prices, good food, good service, nice atmosphere and parking too! 
16379 3 Their pizza is okay but not the best. It's a bit pricy for pizza too and I feel like their crust doesn't have much flavor. This particular location has always been nice though and they are really good with large groups from what I've experienced. 
16380 4 I love love love this place! Food is fantastical. Location is cool. Decor is cool. Just a great place! Money well spent.. 
16381 4 Great Italian Food. Nice to find something authentic and not a chain restaurant for a great meal reasonably priced. 
16382 4 Great bar. Very hard working and experienced tenders. Food was great as always. Top top top notch. 
16383 4 This office has some of the nicest people ever. Every time I have an emergency they get me in as quick as possible. I've never been more comfortable with a dentist. 
16384 4 By far the best pizza place in town! Amazing staff super friendly. I ordered a cheese pizza, bruschetta, touch of Italy and all were hot and fresh when delivered. Love love love this place! 
16385 4 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Great home cooking an outstanding hospitality!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
16386 4 Loved this place. The owner was super nice and informative of the juices. Will be back for more! :) 
16387 4 Simply amazing. Probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had! I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in town :) 
16388 3 Great place but expensive and not great service. Clean , trendy but bartenders have a bit of attitude. 
16389 4 French Press coffee and a wonderful selection of breakfast yum yums. A must in Portland!! 
16390 4 Amazing pizza! The best we have found in Clintonville. Get any of their specials with the garlic crust, you can't go wrong. 
16391 1 Was let down on the quality. They didn't cut my nails even though they used the clippers. They didn't buff them at all even when asked nor did they cut back my cuticles. They aren't cheap either. Very friendly nevertheless. 
16392 3 Lunch today. Really good job. Several visits in a row of excellent food and service. I love the choice of flavors and the wings are large, not the baby wings you get at other places. Great atmosphere and friendly employees. 
16393 4 Delicious food and a lot of options. They seated us even though our friends forgot their reservation. They did forget one of our orders, but they comped the entire meal without us even asking so I can't really hold that against them. 
16394 3 Good breakfast. Nice mix of food offerings. Great for late night! 
16395 4 Awesome atmosphere and fresh food!!!! Sushi rolls were BOMB!!! Free parking is a plus! 
16396 3 Really enjoyed my burger. Can't wait until we get them in the Houston area. And yes, I love Whataburger too. 
16397 2 Got the hot chicken. It wasn't hot. Chicken was a bit dry but crunchy. For 8 bucks I expected a cut above the rest. But meh. Average. 
16398 4 Great greasy spoon. Prompt, friendly service. Great food. Lots of character. Opens at 6am. 
16399 4 Man I'm so impressed with this spot. Definitely going to be a regular. Food waa awesome so waa the service! 
16400 4 We love this restaurant. It is our go to every time we have family or visitors in town. We always order the hummus, haydari, and kofte for appetizers. For our meals we usually go with the mixed grill, Turkish pizza or chicken Adana and The Turkish delight for desert. Amazing! 
16401 4 Amazing food amazing place!!! Amanda is definitely one of the best waiters I've had. For sure will come again. 
16402 4 If you want authentic Brazilian delicacies at a reasonable price, this is the place to go! A wide variety of goodies that will leave your moth watering, from sweet to salty it's a no brainer. I Love this place! 
16403 3 They are generous w/ the noodle soups and it's delicious! They made are my bubble tea the way I wanted!(combine taro & coconut) Fred wants to come back here if it wasn't so far. It's not expensive very affordable! 
16404 1 Nice place, trendy and the food was decent. The tacos were too small and the drinks were too expensive.. 
16405 4 Seriously had the best coffee of my life, the Wintermoon Latte....yummmmm!! On top of the great coffee, Brian was super nice! I'll be back next time I'm in Austin, unless you decide to open a location in Dallas! 
16406 4 Sausage buffet!! Mmm mmm good! The garlic sausage trumps the Bahama mamma surprisingly. Nice beer selection on draft too! Friendly fast service. Always a nice time! I come back every time I'm in the area. 
16407 4 Great food, great service, Great location! We tried their veggie momos last Friday. Never had such a tasty momos. When we went there owner was actively working in the kitchen. Staff are very pleasing and friendly. Service was very quick as well. Will definitely be one of their frequent customers! 
16408 4 Went to a wedding here and it was awesome! Groom area was huge with bar, pool table, flat screen and plenty of lockers and showers. Dance floor was huge and the food was delicious. Beautiful facility. 
16409 2 Food is solid. Service is friendly. The restaurant itself needs a make over. Some of the chairs were so worn out you can feel the nails when sitting on them. it's right by the Casino, I think it was priced for big winners and high rollers haha 
16410 3 Great espresso, coffee and muffins! The paninis look really good thought I didn't try them. Nice play with wi-fi, right across from Old North Church! Come enjoy an espresso with a shot of history! 
16411 4 Out of towner here. Came in for a haircut after walking by and seeing that it looked liked an awesome place. I wasn't disappointed. The staff there are hilarious, and Anisa, my stylist, was great. My hair looks awesome AND I left with a ton of laughs. 
16412 4 What a wonderful healthy omelet that tasted better than any I have had. Service was exceptional and owner, Earl, made a point to ensure we enjoyed the meal. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes. 
16413 2 Decently priced buffet at $7.99 for lunch, but pretty limited. The naan is fresh and delicious, though, and the chicken tandoori and the mustard chicken were good. They have rice pudding for dessert on the buffet which was so-so. Friendly service too. 
16414 3 Wonderful service! I've been here with friends and babies (multiple!) an have always felt welcome. Fresh, tasty naan. Rich palak paneer. The only downside is the lack of spice in the buffet. Bland, which is probably how many of the customers want their food. :-( 
16415 3 Great place to experience some different pizza flavors when the same-old same-old just won't do. The sauce was pretty sweet, and I loved the red pepper/zuchinni/mozarella pizza. The crust wasn't crispy, but it did taste good. Best for take out. 
16416 3 Steps away from Stanley Park, where we needed to catch a show. The owner (an extremely friendly Italian) helped us get in and out in 30 minutes on the dot. Great service plus live piano. And we had a coupon for a free entree. 
16417 4 Good food and very polite service. I had the tofu clay pot and pork BBQ. Good stuff! The place is a little small, but everything else made it a good experience after all. Will definitely go back again 
16418 4 This cafe is an unknown treasure near campus - had a great cup of coffee and breakfast taco, a very pleasant interaction with the barista, and loved the atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back, thanks! 
16419 3 They recently catered an event that I attended and had a full plate spread with meat, cheese, marinated red peppers/mushrooms and goat cheese. Beautiful spread with awesome cuts of meat. Simple yet effective. They also went the extra mile or arranging it nicely. 
16420 4 Wow! Unbelievably incredible sliders. So many flavors that create a symphony of awesomeness for your taste buds. How can we get you to come to California? SMF Sliders :) pretty please! I will definitely be back each time I'm in Portland! #worththedrive #perfection 
16421 3 Very nice for an "in hotel" restaurant.We had the breakfast buffet and shrimp omelette.Nice family breakfast and not too expensive. 
16422 4 Love love love the food and service here. The owners are the nicest people and it's always a great experience going here. 
16423 4 Great experience last night. Food was excellent as usual. Place was packed, but the service was still good. Had a filet with potatoes, crab cake, and bread pudding. Yes - leftovers today. 
16424 0 Service was absolutely miserable, worst dining experience in years. Waste of time and money, would never return. Terrible value for the amount of meat they use in the dishes. 
16425 3 The re-do of Earl's is super nice...more great food options....never had a bad meal at Earl's and have been eating regularly at Earl's since 2000 
16426 2 Really nice. Service and sangria were great. Shrimp in garlic oil was ok. Shrimp was overcooked or frozen. It's great for the area and adds a different option. 
16427 4 On vacation here, and was looking for something new (I'm from the west coast) my son myself and my mother all ate here on a afternoon and it was the most pleasant experience in a long time. Great music, amazing service and even better food. 
16428 3 Pretty good dim sum but it was not that different from Din Tai Fung. They didn't have the shrimp dumplings so I was disappointed in that. The service was ok. But I thought the prices were good 
16429 3 This place had a nice low-key atmosphere and reasonably priced food. I went there tonight and a jazz band was playing. All-in-all it was a very pleasant experience! I'd definitely go back. They have a small patio which is lovely on a summer evening. 
16430 4 She amazed me again. She really takes the time to listen to what I am asking for. FALLON IS THE BEST. She doesn't rush. 
16431 4 Visiting Boston on business this place is by far the best sandwich place in the world. And I'm picky about sandwiches. The beer selection is amazing. For steak sandwiches The Mistrol is off the hook amazing. Yes. It's expensive. But wow. 
16432 4 One of my favorite places in Richmond. These are a few things I have to order everytime I'm there. Spicy tuna roll, kani croquette, and their oyster motoyaki. 
16433 4 I love this place. The food is so good! I haven't had anything that I did not love. Oh and the cheesecake...... heavenly 
16434 3 Love this Belmont neighborhood cannabis retail outlet w very cool design, people, music, and info - not to mention the herb :) 
16435 3 Disclaimer: I'm not a Thai food snob. I know enough to order something other than Pad Thai. But that's about it. Good food. Quick service. Inexpensive. I would rate this a solid 4-star hole-in-the-wall type food experience. 
16436 4 Great service and relaxing environment! Americano's are great and the Chai Latte is exceptional! Great environment to meet up with a group or just lounge about. 
16437 4 The leasing office staff was so helpful we toured our new apartment and I absolutely fell in love with our 2/2 everything is fully renovated clean and quiet no complaints so far 
16438 4 We had a great experience here. The waiter was very attentive & knowledgeable about everything. He had wonderful suggestions as well. Their pizza is awesome! I'd have to say the best I've had around. Very authentic! We will definitely be back! 
16439 4 Great upper deck area in a cute neighborhood. Definitely plan on returning to try the food. The bartender was friendly and gave us some of the background on the new place. 
16440 4 One of the best brunch places in Portland! Everything I've tried on the menu is amazing and their spicy bloody is the best I've ever had. Never really liked them until I had one from here. Worth the drive if you live on the Westside! 
16441 4 Awesome place. Zach, our tour guide, was hilarious. Beer was great. Very informative, but most importantly, fun! 
16442 4 I really like this gym. Looked at several before joining here. Staff are friendly, nobody bugs you. I have the black card so I can have unlimited hydromassage, also comes with tanning & red light. Good deal. 
16443 3 They have done regular oil changes and some other maintenance on my wife's Honda Civic. Their pricing is well below the Honda dealership prices, and they do a solid job. I'll continue to use them for basic maintenance car care. 
16444 3 Great drinks and they value your feed back with an iPad on the door asking for a rating. The bathrooms were locked with a keypad. Over sized chairs and plenty of seating options. Drinks were great and well made. I only wished the scrabble board was functional. 
16445 4 Very clean & beautiful. With a certain design that helps keep the store plain but simple, the lavender ice cream I'm absolutely to die for 
16446 4 I drive from south downtown Orlando to Oviedo and have for almost 7 years. I love this place, they use top quality products, it is extremely clean and they treat me like family. Lynn is so sweet and when I leave I feel beautiful. 
16447 3 Only have had the buffet, which was wonderful - although perhaps a bit heavy on lentil dishes ( which were all very tasty- especially the ginger/cinnamon variety) Almost zero ambience, but the staff is very friendly and the food very fresh and delicious. 
16448 2 I actually didn't taste anything special in their chicken, which is all Gus's really offers. Crisp breading, but otherwise nothing special. 
16449 2 Baja shrimp ceviche should say bay shrimp ceviche Beef shank tender -cherry sauce too tart for me - distracted from flavor Crab cakes ok but expensive Service friendly View of river great 
16450 4 Veracruz is veragood. Consistently some of the best breakfast and fajita tacos that I've had in town. Love the salsa too. Reasonable prices. You will be verasatisfied if you went. 
16451 4 This spot was DELICIOUS. We got the chicken and veggie gryo and the chef's special salad. Cute, small spot with big portions and fresh ingredients. We loved it, definitely retuning soon. 
16452 3 Whether you're looking to pick up a six pack of Bud or you're looking for that certain special Pinot Noir, this place is worth a visit. You'll find the staff helpful and knowledgable and there's chances are, they've got what you're looking for. 
16453 4 Great fish tacos, and the best fish taco sauce I've ever tasted. The waitress told me it was a cream parfait sauce. Also a wonderful view if you sit outside. 
16454 2 Food was good but not great. The maple butter at the beginning was too sweet and would have been better for breakfast. My chicken was a little pink inside..I sent it to be recooked. Nice service and atmosphere. Parking was not a problem. 
16455 3 Best breakfast we'd had all vacation. Got the belgian with strawberries--perfect. My husband got french toast--perfect. Simple and good. Also, we noticed that the whole time we were there, several people (like over 4) came in ordering just the soup to go...must be good! 
16456 4 Awesome food, always fresh and tasty. Friendly staff and fast service. Lunch specials come with tasty soups. Different everyday 
16457 3 Amazing lunch. Split an order of wings and a Good Wolf burrito. 
16458 0 Worst experience period. Rude service. Great bartenders but rude service from the Friday management staff. We'll never be back. 
16459 4 Top notch pizza and pasta at unpretentious pricing. Highly recommended. Grab a beer at the microbrewery Notch across the street while you are waiting for a table! 
16460 3 I would give five stars, but the service is spotty! Nonetheless, the most bang for your buck! Unrivaled flavour! Love it! I don't normally use exclamation points! 
16461 3 This is a bit overpriced like most thrift stores are here in Austin. Although there are a few hidden items that are always a good deal. I was able to get weights for $5. 
16462 3 These guys are good. They changed my pump, fixed my compressor and even re-wired a junction box, all within a few hours. They guy they sent out was really professional and took the time to explain what was being done. Highly suggested :) 
16463 4 A sweet mom and pop shop. I'm always greeted with a hug from Lucy and get AMAZING foot massages from Jack and their son, Eric. Clean, kind, and relaxing. I've gone two times now in the past week since it's absolute bliss! A true treat! 
16464 4 Different set up, I like the way you can get your own sides and serving amount. The best BBQ I have had in a while. Sauce is a perfect balance. Will definitely be back! 
16465 4 Always wary of large conglomerates, I was apprehensive about patronizing this place. But I brought my old car in recently and was treated exceptionally well by everyone. No pressure, no BS. They're great bunch of guys. Thanks! 
16466 4 Quiet and low key but the food was great and the staff were friendly. The butter chicken wrap was unexpectedly delicious. Crepes were good too, and they have good chai if you ask for it (not on the menu). 
16467 3 Creative wine cocktails, delicious cheese plate, carpaccio is my fav. One problem is the patio...fire ants and smokers yuck. 
16468 1 Food was pretty good -- the portions were decent. Overall, not a place that I would go to again. 
16469 4 Had a bacon Berger there today, I have to say, did not expect the grate quality and big size of the Berger! Definitely coming back for more. I recommend this place to anyone looking to fill a big appetite. 
16470 4 Everyone knows how hard it is to find a reliable mechanic--I have struck gold. VERY affordable oil changes, unbelievable customer service, AND open on Saturdays!! 
16471 4 Great brunch (corned beef hash and shrimp and grits), friendly staff, not too long a wait, and still holding on to it's Austin charm: welcome to the Cherrywood Coffeehouse 
16472 2 If you live on the South Side this is a good mall for Macy's as it's never crowded and you can park a few spaces from the door, otherwise the mall is dead. They also have a GREAT (black) Santa and a DMV office that is super fast. 
16473 3 Went here once and the sweet potato pancakes were amazing. The place has a nice feel to it as well, cozy. 
16474 4 Young and friendly owners ! Positive atmosphere and gives good advice on fresh food and ingredients. Opened the shop for us even when they were closed. Positive and happy customer service ! 
16475 4 Best Italian restaurant in Clermont/ Winter Garden. I've been going there with friends for over 10 years and still think it's great. It's a local place that supports local causes and was started by local residents of the area. Plus it has the best pizza in town! 
16476 4 Absolutely amazing greek food in the middle of commercialism world, definitely worth a visit. Very well marinaded beef, great moussaka, just a really nice place. One of many reasons I love Yelp for finding good food in random places, this is top-5 best Greek places I've ever had. Good stuff 
16477 3 Favorite beer? Find it if you don't get lost on the way to the bathroom. Old/reworked warehouse can be cold but warms up quickly with excellent brew. Plenty of seating at pick if tables. Fun for large parties. 
16478 4 Close to a perfect tour of maple syrup making! The only thing missing was a trip to see how trees are tapped and sap is collected. Otherwise, all other aspects were fantastic! Completely agree with points made by previous reviewers - great fun and educational for kids and adults alike. 
16479 4 Great service! Needed a new battery for my Samsung, and they did it for a reasonable price. Huzzah! 
16480 3 Finally we found a good place to eat before seeing the rockets. Good, authentic, clean, good service. We will be back. Cuban sandwich was very good and large. Chili Pork relleno was very tasty. 
16481 0 Called for a pickup after waiting for over an hour called back to ask for the status of driver just to be told 'I don't have a driver in that area. I guess so much for customers service 
16482 4 Burgers and truffle fries are phenomenal! The grilled chicken burger though was a let down. I was expecting a grilled chicken breast, but it's ground chicken with all kinds of other stuff, made into a party. It was 'meh'. 
16483 4 I love the food here and you get a lot for a great price. I have only had it as takeout but intend to go in for a sit down meal very soon 
16484 3 I had the porchetta sandwich! The meat in the sandwich was juicy and crispy! It was perfect with the salsa verde and mustard. Personally, it was a bit bready for me but still good. The vibe of the place is great with communal tables! 
16485 3 Amazing food! Probably the best Tex mex in Columbus. Ambiance could be better. Lights were too bright for dinner. 
16486 3 Went out on a double date here. The food was very good, although we wanted more spice. Very high marks for their desserts - the best I've had so far. 
16487 0 Super friendly waitress, inexpensive lunch special, long wait at lunch, filthy table was not cleaned from previous patron. Because of the lack of personnel and lack of cleanliness I give only 1 star. 
16488 4 I love this restaurant. The service is not excellent, but the food is. The masitas is my favorite with the banana frita. 
16489 4 Cointreau Creme Brulee was amazing and worth every calorie...and I don't even like donuts (usually)! 
16490 4 As a self proclaimed traditionalist it's not often that I venture into "hip" seafood establishments, but I'm sure grateful I did. Outstanding! Most notable were the FINZ Wasabi-Stoli oysters - YUM! Tuna sashimi app over noodles was awesome as well. Service and hospitality top notch. 
16491 4 Great food and nice atmosphere. Third time I have been here and always have a good dinner. 
16492 4 This is now the only way to watch a movie. Splurge for the large recliner and server in the theater. Somehow I luck out and seem to get Erin as my server almost every time. She is awesome, just the right amount of attention and respectful of the movie. 
16493 4 Simply amazing! We've been dying to find a great seafood place to eat in Orlando and this is it. The atmosphere, service and food was awesome! The shrimp was to die for! 
16494 4 The food was outstanding with many selections!! The waffles??? To die for! The place was packed and still we were seated and served within a half hour!! I'll definitely be back!!! 
16495 4 Pizza is great/ beers cold/ plenty of tvs for sports and the bartender is a nice kid. What else can ya ask for? 
16496 3 Enjoyable lunch date with wife. Fish tacos were different but excellent :) 
16497 4 Great experience at AutoZone on Monday. Ray was very knowledgable and installed my car battery in no time. Thank you sir. 
16498 0 This place was awful. I was puking after I eat this bought 5 tacos and not one tasted good. Don't see how people like this place. 
16499 4 Vegan chicken sandwich is super yummy...it taste like real chicken. 
16500 3 Every time I go to LP to get my nails done - I get SNS - I am always so happy with the results. This time, Kayla did my nails and they turned out great. Highly recommend this salon! 
16501 0 I understand that he towed cars just as plaza asked. But talking to Nick (I guess ) was an awful experience. He didn't give us any proof, just asking us to pay or leave ‍ 
16502 4 Great customer service... Great neighborhood bar. Ever changing taps, but always keep some of the favorites!! Pipe wrench is a must have 
16503 0 I purchased a no iron white shirt. The sleeves on the shirt ripped along the crease I sent it back for replacement and it was refused do not buy any non iron shirt brooks bros does not stand behind their product 
16504 3 Very nice staff. Nothing fancy, Irish Pub..ish. Good food portions and inexpensive prices. This is a bar-not a "restaurant", but I would certainly recommend it. 
16505 4 From the moment we entered it was clear that we made the right choice for a delicious meal. Richie did an excellent job describing the menu and wine selection. The manager Eric is proud of this establishment and it shows as evidenced by the engaging staff. 
16506 2 the taco tuesday special is a great deal but at $1.59/each but the last 5 times we have been here our orders have come out wrong. My wife and I now order and pay seperately so our food doesnt get mixed up 
16507 1 Not really sure what the hype is about. Got the porchetta is literally meat and bread. Couldn't even taste the salsa verde. We got it to-go, so we didn't get the mustard in which I think they should have included that. 
16508 3 Cool Spot. It doesn't make sense that there's a cover to get in when it's essential a restaurant with live performance. Maybe they give something to the artist... Either way, The jerk wings were good and the vibe is nice and chill. 
16509 4 The best Irish sausages outside of Ireland. My Irish kids and husband will have me patronizing this place frequently. Much better than the frozen imported sausages elsewhere too. 
16510 4 Fantastic taco omelet this morning with my wife. Great service and the best fresh brewed iced tea in town. They actually serve it with ice, not something you can find just everywhere. Love everything about this place. 
16511 4 Have been to the Altamonte Springs diner a couple times now. Both times the portions have been large, food and service good and meal arrives quickly after order placed. It's usually packed, so expect a wait if you go at a common time. 
16512 3 This place was great! A fun and quite messy experience! The food was great, the service was attentive, the only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is that it's a tad expensive. 
16513 2 They make good coffee and offer almond milk which is a plus (oh trendy Boston) but the staff aren't very nice/friendly (perhaps just my experience) and for the location and ambience I much prefer other places at the same price for my latte. 
16514 4 Palio is the best coffee and sweet shop you're not going to. Library tables, great Wi-Fi, excellent coffee and teas and, my favorite, peanut butter sandwich cookie. Come here and bring your friends. A great neighborhood find, but worth a drive. 
16515 4 Really like the spot! Food is delicious and customer service was wonderful. Drinks are good but assuming costs for drinks are the way they are cause it is in Portland. Good vibe especially on a Sunny day. 
16516 4 First time experiencing virtual reality. Coolest thing ever. The zombie game was the best! Will be coming back again! 
16517 4 Steve is very knowledgeable, prompt on his response time and able to solve all kinds of problems. We had two nests of wasps-yellow jackets and he resolved our problem completely. I would highly recommend Biggins Exterminators. Ruth B 
16518 4 Best kept Thai secret in SS! Low key and quiet with delicious food and good service. Shhhh.....don't tell anyone :) 
16519 4 I would gladly wake up at the crack of dawn every day for their donuts! The Blueberry Basil Bourbon Donut has stolen my heart. 
16520 4 Very pleasant. I've been there once. I am going back. I also need my eyebrows cut. I'll write another review after. 
16521 0 THIS IS A HORRIBLE PLACE! The Service is horrible the waitress never comes over to the table and all the staff jokes around. The food took over an hour. The food was horrible and especially for that price. 
16522 3 Oh Cheer Ups, you win the most fun weird bar award. There's no one else like you, and I couldn't replace you if I tried. Your drinks are strong, your dancing is top notch, and your atmosphere has a certain jeu ne se quoi. Nice work keeping it weird. 
16523 3 Nice aquarium. Really enjoyed the exhibits. I still feel the Aquarium in Monterey Bay is a bit better. 
16524 4 This is one of the best restaurants in Orlando.... my first time dining was amazing!! Since then I have invite all friends and family to this location. I would highly recommend the shrimp and the crab cakes. I will revisit again very soon! 
16525 1 This place is small and very cool. Many reviews brag about breakfast. I'm on the fence. Wasn't horrible but I've had better. A lot of food doesn't equal good food. Potatoes were dry and hollandaise was bland. It might have been an off day?? 
16526 4 Been going to the Gallows for the past year. One of my favorite places in the city. Great service. Great people. Great food. Great atmosphere. I've never reviewed a place in the past. Couldn't keep it a secret any longer. 
16527 4 Clean, courteous and attentive staff, great location. Do not expect an early check in prior to 2PM. The MARTA and Lenox mall are less than 5 minutes away by foot. 
16528 1 Honestly, I don't get it. People wait in line for hours to have a mediocre burger at this place. Really, there are better out there. This place is SOOOOO not worth the hype. The burgers at Casino are much big, better and less expensive. 
16529 4 One of my favorite places! Delicious food, amazing service. And Karen, the bar manager, Head Chef Rodney and Bridget, the manager, are some of the most talented and welcoming people. Love this place!! 
16530 1 It's way overpriced for what it is. It's seafood. pretty bland and nothing special. Crab cakes are the worst I've ever had. The oysters are tiny. It pales in comparison to Legal, and is twice the price. 
16531 4 Amazing staff! The owner is very nice and she does your eyebrows exactly how you want it!! She gives out a card after your visit and she signs spots, if you get 10 spots signed by her your next visit is free! 
16532 3 It's my go to for chinese take out. I order the same food and I'm usually happy. On busy nights the food has a habit of not being cooked enough (not raw, just not crispy). 
16533 3 Chorizo and potato breakfast tacos? I'm in. That's something that is usually made at home, not found in a restaurant. Thanks, Macho Taco, for understanding the needs of this Mexican! The bean and chorizo taco was good, too. Muy buneo! 
16534 4 Wow loved the food here! The spring rolls were divine. The raspberry lychee drink was sweet and flavorful. The Vietnamese eggplant was delightful. Very lively friendly environment. The waitress was knowledgeable and helpful. Definitely visit again. 
16535 1 It has been forever since I have been here. The last time they didn't want to take my credit card as they closed the pos down early. I then got to wait 25 minutes for the waiter to return. Haven't been back. Poor service. mediocre food. 
16536 4 Selection is very good, food is hot, taste is perfect and pricing of $6.99 for lunch cannot be beat. Service is great. 
16537 4 Great food! Great service! The interior could use some improvement, maybe some paint. But the food makes up for it. Burgers are good. Love the chicken burrito. 
16538 0 Too expensive, too small dishes. But the quality is overall OK. It ask for fixed tips for group above four. 
16539 4 This place has the best Turkey sandwich with jerk sauce. It sweet and spicy, get it with a side salad. The owner Amita is very friendly and looks forward to having you come for wine tasting parties. 
16540 0 Over priced and customer no service. This place sucks and is not worth the money...this place isnt even worth the one star rating. Im betting me and my family will be sick in a few hours. 
16541 3 Almost always a wait of a half hour or more for a walk in. Staff has been courteous and helpful during my visits though. During my most recent visit, Davy was very friendly and helpful explaining how to port my phone number. He deserves 5 stars. 
16542 4 This is my favorite cafe in Atlanta!!! The kitties are always so sweet, just like the employees. It's $10 for an hour in the cat room, plus a coffee. All proceeds go to PAWS Atlanta, so it's definitely worth it. Make your reservation early for the weeknds too. 
16543 4 Love love love Desta! The food is always delicious, well-seasoned and a treat! Bring your appetites and a curious palate. Desta never disappoints! 
16544 4 I rented a house in Newton, MA through LBK Realty and it was a great experience from beginning to end. I was referred to the owner who asked insightful questions, was knowledgeable and was delightful to work with. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend LBK Realty. 
16545 3 We've been here 4 times and the food is ALWAYS AMAZING. The garlic bread is the best. The Mussels in white wine has fabulous flavor and their Chicken Francesca is awesome. Love this restaurant one of my favorites. Kevin our waiter was very attentive and sweet 
16546 4 Just ate here today!! Best soul food ever. RIBS off the chain. OXTAIL off the chain! YAMS off the chain! FRIED GREEN TOMATOES off the chain! Must eat here! 
16547 0 This tavern is like walking into 1960 Mississippi. To many drug addicts hanging around and I was scared when a group of bikers started staring at me and my husband in a very intimidating way. Stay clear of this place!! Unless a druggy scene is what you are looking for. 
16548 0 Good god this place should be destroyed. Gross walls gross chairs gross plates gross silverware. The food is nasty. The employees are worse. 
16549 4 excellent desserts. worth the calories. I desserts were rich and delicious not overly sweet. found the house hot chocolate yummy as well. 
16550 4 Great Prices, Great Locations, ... sometimes Great Service, but I'm still going with 5 Stars on this place. Try the Mahi Planks (fish & chips). Super Good. 
16551 4 Great place! Leia treated my lab like a princess!! I got the Furminator package and will definitely do so again! 
16552 3 pretty tasty. we went for the sunday brunch. there was a live band playing jazz at a perfect background level. the food was very good, used quality ingredients, and was moderately priced. the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. 
16553 4 Love this snap location! Food is always high quality and consistent. The staff is super nice as well. They are open to feedback and I always feel appreciated as a customer. 
16554 4 This restaurant and staff are awesome. The food was great and the service was spectacular. We went for our parents 50th Anniversary and we were treated like royalty by the management and staff. The prime rib was one of the best I have had and the prices are excellent. 
16555 4 This place Rocks. The Coffee is amazing, the people friendly and knowledgeable, the design is easy on the eyes (so is the staff) I've never been disappointed. If you want simply the best quality experience from talent to taste, it's a must. The BEST coffee shop in Austin. 
16556 4 great place. quality coffee: best on campus. speedy service. yummy food if you're hungry. nice atmosphere to study or just hang out. on the pricier side but worth it. 
16557 3 Really great coffee ! They also had a super nice atmosphere and I also liked the chocolate croisant I got. They make some of their own sparkling juices and they also looked delicious. I opted for a honey latte and it was really good. 
16558 4 Food, service, atmosphere are outstanding. Even my picky 11 year old son asks to eat here whenever we're in the area. Their bisque is heavenly. My new favorite eatery. Ohhh, did I mention the sinfully delicious dessert? 
16559 3 I see bunch of spoiled travelers here. First of all, this was the most inexpensive hotel on I-Drive. Great location, good service, awesome view to the lake and pool. It needs room renovation but it's a great place nonetheless. Will stay again. 
16560 4 AMAZING!!! Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and it was perfect. the atmosphere is very nice and elegant. the food is amazing, the calamari is on point! my new favorite place! 
16561 4 Delish. Love the corn chowder, the mashed potatoes and the salads. Everything is just great! 
16562 3 Hopdoddy is like a Texan Shake Shack. Loved the bison burger which featured an incredibly tender patty draped with pungent blue cheese. I wish there was more bacon but the overall construction of the burger was well done. Salads also feature some solid combinations and work well as appetizers. 
16563 4 Ordered a vegetarian pizza. Liked it a lot. Looking forward to my next trip to this place. 
16564 0 - Keeps beating around the bush on the price of vehicle. - Gimmicky sales tactics. - unprofessional sales manager. 
16565 4 Mmm, fresh bread. Pull it apart while it's hot and just stand in the street eating bread. Avoid the Hanover St. crowds and get it here. Young lady in picture is a fixture-as seen in exterior shot from "Fever Pitch". 
16566 3 Had a large party/private meal here for a group of 14. Price could not be beat for family style apps, entrees, and two choices of dessert. Service could have been a bit quicker on refilling drinks, but, we were very pleased overall! 
16567 3 Good stuff here You can sit next to the Hibatchi or sit in the dining room We have found you get bigger portions if you sit in the dining room Good stuff here ! 
16568 0 I had The worst latte ever, it tasted like burnt milk, and the pastries were stale not at all like pastries I remember from San Francisco... The pastries werent crispy and flakey.. Maybe their sandwiches and soups are better... Tous les jours in austin has authentic fresh, flakey pastries 
16569 1 Extremely rude. On top of it, the nail 'technician' doing my nails was not in a good mood and she was in a rush and caused my nail to bleed. I have tried to give this salon more than three chances, however it does not make the cut. 
16570 4 This is one of my favorite spots in Salem. It's cozy, personel is friendly, nice coffee/tea menu. The bubble tea is very good too! This place is great to study, (free wi-fi) or just to hang out with a friend or two. 
16571 4 Amazing ER. Staff was attentive, friendly, and professional. They got me in and out quickly, answered all my questions, and discussed my treatment thoroughly before beginning. As a nurse myself, it was great treatment for someone who is used to being "on the other side of the bed" 
16572 4 Man oh man. Been here a couple times and all the times I've ordered came out great. Agua de horchata is A1 and the Salsa Roja is the bomb, spicy and flavorful. 
16573 4 Really fine Italian food in a funky Beacon Hill basement space. Friendly, very professional staff, and casual atmosphere. If you're up for a solid feed, get the spaghetti and meatballs. Skip the N. End, and go to Grotto. You'll thank me later. Honest. 
16574 4 I am so glad there is a great place in Orlando to get perfect fried shrimp. They have great onion rings, fries, and the best macaroni and cheese ever. They have catfish, oysters, chicken , and crab cakes too but I have only tried the shrimp. 
16575 3 Everything I've had from this place is delicious! Some of the best thai food I have ever had! Especially their pad Thai....yum yum yum... 
16576 3 They have great burgers and lots of options. The burgers are cooked good and by far way better than 5 guys 
16577 3 Another great "hidden patio". A great place to kick back after a walk around the waterfront on a warm summer day. This spot is a bit off the beaten path but has excellent beers on tap. 
16578 3 Great place for lunch while out shopping. Everything is plant based but expect it to be delicious too. If you have any allergies or sensitivities, they are actually equipped to tell you what is in the food unlike most places out there. 
16579 4 Had a fine lunch with splendid Old Fashioned. Prime rib sandwich and fish taco were both very good but soft pretzel with fondue stole the show. 
16580 4 Very friendly owner and gave out all kinds of samples. They were pretty tasty too. We bought the toffee and the Carmel with cashews. Both are amazing and I could eat the whole bag in one sitting but I didn't. We will be back. 
16581 4 Had a great brunch buffet today. Super friendly wait staff. Excellent carving station. Omlet bar. Waffle bar. Generously poured bloody Mary's and coffee with bailey's. Cool fish tank. Awesome view. Best 20 bucks you can spend on a buffet. 
16582 4 everything is qaulity here! The best Chinese food ever, and the sevice is awesome will definitely come back with friends! 
16583 3 Great food and atmosphere. Such a cute little brunch place. Food was really good. Wait was a little crazy and their system to get you seated was unorganized. Loved my pomegranate mimosa! 
16584 4 This place was amazing! Their food was the best Thai food I have had. It's a small place so only about 10 tables. While I was there a lot if people came in for pick up orders. I will definitely go back again and again. 
16585 2 Bar seating is depressing. Texas roll and squid teriyaki are delicious. The prices wee reasonable. Lack of dessert was disappointing. Lack of miso soup was also dissappointing. Lack of seaweed was also disappointing. 
16586 4 Best hotel and service I've ever had and they are not penny Pinchers. Beds are on the firmer side but not hard and the views and rooms are stunning. 
16587 3 Went back today; was disappointed last visit; but today was a great experience; food perfect; service a wee bit slow, but it was noon on a holiday; waiter was very helpful with the beers; all in all, a great lunch, surrounded by millions of Millennials! 
16588 4 Proper Eats is a casual low key place where I like to go just about everyday. The staff are friendly, and the service is casual. I love Thursday night jazz, and shopping at the little grocery store. A place where you feel comfortable and at home. 
16589 3 Yummy and great atmosphere! Great eggs benedict. However, if you go on a Sunday prepare to wait 45 minutes outside. 
16590 4 Dr. Date (pronounced Dotty) is wonderful. She takes her time, is friendly and thorough. I really enjoy having her as my doc! 
16591 4 We had Brenda and she was awesome. Very thorough cleaning and she genuinely cared about doing a great job. 
16592 0 Worst service ever. the restaurant owners will yell at their customers. their food is incredibly mediocre. used to come here out of convenience, but after getting yelled at by the owner will never come back 
16593 4 Great Gyro. Fun staff there and one of the best stops in the hall. Great lunch! 
16594 3 Love the atmosphere. Great beer choices. Great music venue. Yummy coffee. Yummy veggie burger. 
16595 4 Love the service great customer care from the staff. Food had very good taste and it wasn't cold. I would definitely go back to eat there. 
16596 1 Wow when did bowling get so expensive?!?! Great place to go if you want to feel like you have a hole in your wallet. It's fun and all but a warning to parents - do you really want your children bowling to music videos featuring twerking? 
16597 4 The best Ethiopian I've ever had outside of Ethiopia! The owners are kind and service is so warm and welcoming. Get the Kitfo if you like steak tartar, its addictive! 
16598 2 the place is small and hard to navigate, the customers are rude, the staff is unfriendly - but the prices are great 
16599 4 Great spot for a quick lunch. Friendly staff. Plenty of food for a good value. Love coming here for my Brazilian food fix. Their managers always recognize me and take great care of me and my friends. 
16600 4 Great experience with this place. Showed up and they had no problem getting me in. Told me it would take about 30 minutes for screen repair, maybe took a little less. Then since I checked, I got 50% tempered glass. Awesome job guys, courteous and professional from the start. 
16601 4 Outstanding service and atmosphere!!!! I had the spinach lasagna and the wife had a pasta in creme sauce with chicken and walnuts = OUTSTANDING, DELICIOUS & MOUTHWATERING!!!!! We are from out of town but come to Austin often and we will be back!!!! May the Gusto be with you! 
16602 0 Hummus appetizer with feta cheese and on an English muffin...really ? Chef needs to discover spices. Hummus was bland. Like all pitcher beer choices. Burger over cooked, fries very greasy. If Alabama doesn't win day total lost. 
16603 4 Winner winner chocolate for dinner! Macaroons and the triple layer chocolate cake are 10s! Just try and you will know that Chef Thierry knows desserts. I am happy that I got to try the treats. Oh and the hot chocolate was just right! 
16604 3 Pretty good service, pretty dress shirt, pretty competitive cost. I'd give them a B+/A-. Perfectly content to wear shirt, though not stunned or amazed. Probably won't be back 
16605 4 Unagudon lunch special is served in a stone bowl so the rice gets crispy around the edges. Mega dank and worth the 12 bucks. Comes with salad and miso soup. Lunch rolls are also generously portioned. Will be back. 
16606 4 Unbelievably delicious! Would recommend the Pad Thai. Nearly as good as the top places I've been to in NYC! 
16607 3 Good food at a reasonable price. Friendly staff too. It is easy to miss it the first time you drive by. 
16608 4 Got the chicken burger with sweet potato fries and banana pudding milkshake. Everything was great and up quickly. 
16609 4 Amazing service and fantastic ambiance. We will be coming back time and time again. Very glad to help this place out and I will again 
16610 4 I love everything about this place. The food tastes amazing and the people who work here are even better! It's also the only place I know of that delivers burgers! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. 
16611 4 Do yourself a favor and eat at Gonzo! And you can even enjoy a beer at Base Camp Brewery while you wait! Amazing food and great service! 
16612 4 It's a really cool venue in a GREAT part of town. Amazingly delicious food truck and sometimes a movie. 
16613 1 The food is bar quality at best and the service is the same. Wouldn't recommend the food unless you have been drinking. 
16614 4 So great to have HD right around the corner. Had a flood in our home and the Depot is helping us get our house back in order. 
16615 3 Kind of pricey. There is a nice park across the street to enjoy your cone. 
16616 4 This place is perfect for gatherings and relaxing hangouts. They have games provided while you wait for food. They have the BEST chicken "nuggets" flavored and spiced so well. The environment is also perfect for chilling with a glass of beer and some fried foods 
16617 4 Excellent pizza, quick service, mellow vibe. If I'm not at this one, I'm at the one on Division. One of the top five best pizza joints in town. 
16618 3 Pretty bomb ass food and Margaritas 
16619 0 Poor quality wings, salad was not good and service was slow and neglectful. I keep forgetting that this place is not good and once food arrives, I remember. Also, weird place to be full of infants and small children. 
16620 1 虾、蟹腿等海鲜都不够入味，应该就是白水煮过之类的又浇上酱而已，玉米、香肠等还可以。另外服务人手不够，导致等待的时间很久，感觉还是有很多需要改进的地方。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。 
16621 0 Same Horrible treatment - Different UPS Store. I'm not quite sure why they feel the need to steal - but steal they do. So - as long as you don't care about money - go ahead and use them. 
16622 3 Not bad at all. ..:)......no crazy ass procedures .. bet simple basic pedi.......i had Ashley she speaks English perfect. .. ask for her. :) 
16623 1 overpriced. Food is ok and overall atmosphere is reflective of financial district type. lots of people in suits and looks like it is an after work hangout place. 
16624 0 Perhaps the worst burrito quality to price ratio in the United States. Much worse than Taco Bell (forget El Pelon, Boca, Anna's, and even Chipotle), but about 5 times as costly. Flavorless burrito that falls apart from the watery beans. 
16625 2 Heard good things about their drinks (especially the strong island), but didn't get to try it. The sandwiches were pretty good, but nothing spectacular (got the badonkadonk & the green turkey) 
16626 2 $1.80 for like 4 ounces of coffee in their small dine in cups. It wasn't even good. I had a savory corn muffin that was quite good though. 
16627 4 Food was extremely delicious! The customer service was unbelievable and the food was made to order to my specifications! Order was put within minutes. And I basically devoured my burger. A little expensive but worth every penny. 
16628 0 For some reason, I despise this place. Whether it's a poetry reading or a throbbing Friday night, it's overrated, overcrowded and I end up leaving within an hour. 
16629 2 My sister and her fiance loves it here, but seems like every other Pho restaurant. The service is always quick, however, it feels almost rushed. I am not too impressed. 
16630 0 Ordered their bacon fries and was very disappointed. There was no overflow of bacon and I was not driving back.... It will be a while before I return thanks Wendy's. 
16631 4 I had my first visit today with Dr. Gilbey. She was very kind, patient and thorough with me. Her staff was very friendly and helpful. Thank you for giving me hope for my breathing issues! 
16632 3 This was a quaint theater that serves alcohol (beer and wine). I came here w my bf and we had a good time drinking and watching a movie. I want to come back! 
16633 4 what can I say about it? nice employees , extremely tasty ice cream , it is a real shame baskin doesn't get way more recognition !!!!!!!111 
16634 4 Wow, finally a taco joint that knows what they are doing. Really cool patio and dining area. Try the Cajun Wahoo Taco. You won't be disappointed! 
16635 3 I like this Mcd's they are very friendly and pretty fast. I absolutely love their sweet tea but who doesn't lol. I don't have anything bad to say about this one. But some just depends on the workers. This one is nice but look at the location. ... Westerville. 
16636 1 Mediocre Cuban food in an icky setting. Not even close to what you can get in Tampa or Miami. 
16637 4 They told me I couldn't leave Boston without trying their lobster.....and I didn't. I had a 1.75oz Legal Premium Lobster with all the fixins!!! everything about this plase is great! 
16638 4 I added some pictures/video and a review for Lustre Pearl in my video on Austin: http://vimeo.com/8415029 It's really a great place, and a special nook for out of towners looking for something uniquely Austin. 
16639 3 Excellent location in Buckhead with a great atmosphere and crowd. The service was excellent and menu options were explained well. Especially liked the cheese and cured meat options paired with a great glass of Italian red wine. 
16640 4 Claudia was so nice and professional! It was painful but she made it as pleasant as can be. I will probably try again in the future. All the best! 
16641 4 I love Mandy's. I have been going for more than a year. What a blissful experience. She is very thorough, but not in an extreme fashion where you feel your face getting beat up :) The facial and shoulder massage are an added benefit. I highly recommend her! 
16642 4 The food was delicious and a good value for being in Disney. Our waitress Lisa was very attentive to our needs and should be commended for a job well done. We could use waitresses like her in New Jersey. 
16643 4 Excellent. Must try authentic Mediterranean food. Everything we got was wonderful and the service was perfect! Will recommend to friends and family. 
16644 4 really nice folks. Were really patient with our one month old who was decidely anti-pictures that day. Can't wait to get my photos! 
16645 3 Went in a party of 6. All were happy with their entrees, whether it was seared tuna, crusted salmon, surf and turf or what I ordered which was the shrimp and grits which was quite tasty. A little pricey but excellent food and service. 
16646 3 Good price, nice people who take time to explain things. Overall very pleased...was suppose to be in and out in about 1 hour but it actually took a couple hours but in the end 
16647 3 One of my fav Starbucks. I just love sitting on the patio. Especially for night time coffees. Beautiful things called trees....have you heard of them? 
16648 3 Had the best $5 whiskey and beer paring! Upscale interior re-did. Large outdoor patio, heated and covered for winter. Had French onion soup to die for. Perfect for the up and coming SE waterfront area. 
16649 4 I love this place! I always get take-out here. It is so delicious and affordable. The Pad Thai does not disappoint- It tastes so fresh and is consistently good. The portions are also large enough to have leftovers. The staff is also very friendly! 
16650 2 Good food, generally good staff. Sometimes its too loud to talk without shouting. Kid friendly till 9 or 10pm. Cash or check ONLY (atm inside). I like this place but sometimes I'm paranoid about eating in the dark. Great place to start or finish the evening. 
16651 4 Had the special french toast (white bread). Never thought it will be so amazing. They put strawberries, pineapple, kiwi, cheese and coconut on it. Couldn't have enough of that. Love their hazelnut-flavored coffee. Also their cherrywood bacon is well worth the extra $. 
16652 3 Cute diner. We went right when they opened at 9:30am. Burgers were delicious, fries were fresh & good! 
16653 1 Caveat: the restaurant was crowded so we ate at the outside cafe. The special Korean BBQ rib tips were not good. SUPER sweet, pretty tough & I ate most of the fries (which were really good!) instead. Should have waited to eat at the indoor restaurant. 
16654 4 Loved the 5-minute 3D pre-ride movie! Loved the slow ride as well ... plenty of time for selfies or photos with the family while enjoying the spectacular view of all of Orlando. Not cheap but so worth the money. I can now cross this off my bucket list. 
16655 4 Delicious. Delightful. We go back every time we fly through Atlanta. Staff and cuisine are fantastic. 
16656 2 Go for the happy hour. Big portions for your money. I would suggest splitting. Margarita pizza is delicious, same with the champagne salad. 
16657 4 Amazing pho ga. The chili oil is amazing! Too bad i can eat here on a daily basis, its a bit far from where i live. But i would go again because its worth it. 
16658 4 I love this place. It's like a hidden gem. They have these wonderful specialty martinis. I got a lemon raspberry tonight. They also have some good beer selections. The entrees were as good as the drinks. Very good atmosphere. They even have outside seating. I highly recommend this place. 
16659 4 hey octane boys, thanks for letting me look at your beards. 
16660 0 Very disappointed with the quality of the food. Been going there for over 15 years. And the food is just bad. It's a shame. It was so good. And it wasn't one bad meal. It's been a few lately. So I stopped visiting the restaurant. 
16661 4 Jose in the lighting department was a great salesman and helped me figure out what kind of lighting would work best for our kitchen. Thanks for the great customer service! 
16662 4 Definitely out of the way and definitely worth it! Food was great (especially the migas!) and so was the service. Very friendly and attentive staff. Will go again when in Boulder. 
16663 4 The chicken shawarma was yummy and the hummus was fantastic. The service was good and the portions are nice for the price. I'll definitely be back soon to try some other items. 
16664 4 Amazing collection of succulents, crystals, stones and pots. The woman working today was friendly and helpful. I spent over 40% so I got to 'spin the wheel' and won 15% off my next visit. Fun. 
16665 4 We loved this place. The food was great and the people wonderful. Rich and vibrant flavors in every selection on the sampler. 
16666 1 The food is not worth the huge wait. The wait was over an hour and the food was average. The service was awful from the waitress, however the chef was awesome and made up for the bad waitress. 
16667 4 Awesome addition to the neighborhood, great food and great prices. The gyros are big, and the lamb is tasty. I also recommend the chicken and lamb tikka. Amazing. 
16668 4 Above and beyond are the words I would use to describe my experience here always on top of their game thanks again service parts and sales staff 
16669 4 Greet food, big portion chef and the stuff always takeing care of me! Try it and you wont be disappointed 
16670 3 Enjoyed the atmosphere and the Plus Plus Jukebox. Cheap strong drinks and also seemed to be quite a few other SF Giants fans if that's your thing which it should be. Fear the Beard drink here. 
16671 0 Bad pours on drinks and a rude bar manger. Never had anyone talk to me like that at a bar/restaurant in my life. Never again! 
16672 2 Overlooked burgers , and diluted drinks Definitely not coming back here unless u want the view. 
16673 4 This resort was incredible. The decor was genuine, the zoo in the back of the lodge, the pool area and the restaurants were amazing. Money well spent. I would come here again, next time we would stay in the villas just to see what they are like. 
16674 3 Pretty good, but different. The crust is quite good. I enjoy the 4 cheese. 
16675 1 It's my 4th or 5th time here. I live 5 blocks away. Fish and chips, solid but today, looks like spent 3-4 minutes too long in the oil and that the oil isn't piping hot. I've been sitting here for 30 minutes with an empty beer. I am leaving. 
16676 4 The soy and ginger flavor is outstanding if you like spicy hot the other option will definitely light you up! The fried rice with the bulgogi was outstanding 
16677 4 Took my son and my pastor for breakfast this morning! Wow, awesome food & service, and perfect gathering spot! Please try it, you will not be disappointed! 
16678 3 Was very excited to try this spot; but then "the group" wanted to go elsewhere. Beer was killer, the menu was what I was looking forward to, particularly since it was restaurant week. Will be back, to try the tomahawk chop!!!! 
16679 4 Love it great variety and great sales and coupons. The employees are very helpful and pleasant and they greet you and remember you if you're a regular. There's also think we can try out all kinds of products. Very nice environment 
16680 0 Excited for the gluten free option so we ordered a "large" pepperoni. This large pizza came the size of a small plate, burnt, and 30 minutes later than the 30 minutes they predicted. Save your time and money. 
16681 2 Food is great but it is freezing in here. Everyone kept their coats on. Travel here every month but may have to wait for warmer weather before I return here. Soup came out Luke warm and sake cooled quick 
16682 3 Great food, attentive servers, and great for groups. The Hazel Dell Brew Pub is a great place to eat with friends and have a good time for a decent price. The onion rings and Salmon fish and chips are my favorite! 
16683 1 The salon itself was nice and clean. However, the lady who did my eyebrows made them very uneven and left a huge gap in the middle of one. Wouldn't venture to try them again for waxing. 
16684 2 This Red Robin loves to pile people in the waiting area and have waits for long periods when over half the restaurant is completely open. Food was okay for the value. Our server was great though. 
16685 0 The outside patio has smoking tables immediately beside non-smoking tables. Breathing cigarette smoke while I am eating Mexican food is the perfect dining experience. What a horrible experience! 
16686 4 Your salted Carmel ice cream is something out of this world! Absolutely delicious! My friend said on the way out of the dinning hall, "do your self a favor and get a togo of that ice cream" I'm so glad I listened. 
16687 1 While I love that they had vegan ramen, I must ask: why was there tomato in it and a ball of wilted spinach? Noodles were good but no real flavor elsewhere. Better ramen around town for sure. 
16688 4 The gangsta Pizzzza Was Gangsta!!!! Had delivery doe so might be better to eat there next time!! If you love meaty pizzas this place is dope! 
16689 1 Not impressed. Not a bad place, but with all the hype and hoopla (and a reality TV show) you expect more. Would have been three stars, but they lose one because of the let down. 
16690 4 Strong drinks, awesome service, and a very chill, hip atmosphere. The food isn't their strong suit-- it's slightly overpriced. If you go, go for the drinks, not for a meal. But the drinking at MuuMuu's is mighty fine! 
16691 3 Came during busy brunch hour. The food came out quickly. Very home style, we got soy milk with crullers and beef scallion wrap. 
16692 0 Don't bother. Go to the Tavern next door. We were ignored at our table, the entrees & pizza were gross. I was so excited to try this place b/c I liked Tavern so much, but was very disappointed. 
16693 3 Pretty cool little shop. I definitely would return to there given the opportunity. I finally got to try kvass!! 
16694 3 great food, not too too expensive. i liked everything about this place. the wine list was endurable and the food was very tastey. i would definately go there again. great place to go with friends or a date A+ 
16695 4 Their pasta and Chianti Classico is amazing! They also have one of the most amazing wine lists in the Vancouver area, it may be the biggest and best! 
16696 3 This place had really yummy food and has a large secluded area for bigger parties. I really enjoyed the pork, pork & crab dumplings, noodle dishes, and steamed buns. They also have the yummy green onion pancake! However, the service was just okay. 
16697 4 THE BEST!! Wonderful quality of meats, no matter what your preferences. Have never been disappointed in their selection of cuts. And the service is great--always friendly and patient. Everyone should have the joy of this great a meat market at some time in their life. 
16698 1 Good selection, pompous staff. I want to return the things I bought here just to support another business with more personable associates. When will charisma and charm to be cool again? Down with crotchety elitists! 
16699 4 Quick service. The Italian Omelette with provolone cheese was delicious! Also the coffee was fresh and addicting! 
16700 4 This was the best haircut & beard trim experience I've ever had. Chadwick was AWESOME and the entire staff was so nice and welcoming. I just found my new spot from now on. 
16701 3 Always the freshest tasting fish and sushi around. I would never go back to one of those rotating plate sushi places again. This is the real deal. I love the salad dressing on the appetizer salads as well, delicious! 
16702 4 Excellent customer service and a clean and well secured storage location. Prices were very reasonable. We are happy with our choice to store here. 
16703 4 Amazing Won Ton Soup! Most friendly and passionate food cart chef (Jeff) I have had pleasure to speak with in a while. Can't wait to try the lollipop chicken wings. 
16704 4 Found this gem on a walk on Pearl Street. Go with the cappuccino for a nice mid-day pick up. The location is also very serene and peaceful. 
16705 3 I love a good fritter, this place has the best. They mix it up with different fruits for some variety. The staff are friendly and great for some conversation. I took away a star because they could use a good "mom's touch" and tidy the place up a bit. 
16706 4 Love this place!! They have really good fried rice and a fried taro cake. Great service, everyone is very nice. 
16707 3 Pretty legit suan la dumplings. The sauce it comes with is what makes it though. It's not spicy at first but after two dumplings you begin to feel the heat and sheepishly sneak a sip of water. 
16708 4 Botched a drive upgrade on my wife's MBP and ended up not recognizing the touchpad and keyboard. They were able to quickly diagnose the problem and get it all squared away while we waited. They are the best. 
16709 4 Lamb dish very reasonable and very tasty lamb dish they only sold the skewers but this was simply the best lamb i have had in vancouver 
16710 4 If you had the opportunity to be struck by a good time lightning bolt, this would be the place where it could happen. 
16711 4 We were using this location for a photo shoot and as with any production things tend to change a lot. They were very accommodating to our changes and things went great! 
16712 1 WTH ... I actually wanted to say 'F' instead of 'H' ... Service is decent and ya their menu is awful except for soups ..... It's overrated ... 
16713 4 Best to go habachi EVER!!! The yum yum sauce is delicious. The portions are big and great for sharing. Love the udon noodles too. 
16714 3 Went here yesterday- the food was awesome and the service was good. Will be back again soon! 
16715 4 Framed is an awesome addition to the neighborhood! I recently went to Framed after neglecting to have my eyes examined for almost three years. Dr. H was awesome and super knowledgeable! Framed also has cool, unique frames. Many of my co-workers are jealous of my blue frames. 
16716 4 Shelby was the best server I've had there. Chicken was baller status as always. Xoxoxox 
16717 4 Really enjoy Yoi Yoi. High quality sushi - the Rock n Roll is my absolute fav. If you are feeling hibachi, the house fried rice is a great deal for the amount of food. The lady who runs it is really nice as well. 
16718 3 The meal was mediocre, but our appetizer, chorizo con queso fundido was stellar! Absolutely delicious! Our bartender, Sarah (I believe her name was) was on top of things and mixed some tasty drinks. Taffer would be proud. 
16719 4 I won't repeat the positive reviews--suffice it to say that this is the place for you if you like seafood, imaginative preparations, and personalized service. But--if management reads this review-I'm begging you, please put cushions on the hard wooden chairs. It's a long dinner. Have mercy! 
16720 4 This is a hidden gem! The outside looks like nothing special but the inside is beautiful. Awesome ambiance. Staff is alway super friendly and welcoming. The food is amazing!! Super fresh and full of flavor. Great variety! Our favorite spot! 
16721 4 Drive thru was super quick! My server was so sweet! Everything was wonderful! Love the chicken nuggets and happy sauce!!! Sweet tea is the best here.! 
16722 2 I came here on Dec. 30. I have been here many times. The food is usually good and this time was no different. It is disappointing to see that they have now added a tea fee. 
16723 1 The service was quite good but the food was absolutely terrible. My dog, who eats cat shit like Hershey's kisses when given the chance, turned her nose up at it. 
16724 3 Great coffee and nice place to relax! Outdoor tables and porch were a nice touch. The iced lattes and the variety of flavors always bring me back. Would highly recommend. 
16725 3 I stay here everytime I go to ATL. Beautiful rooms, great service, and if you're into star sighting - you'll definitely see a "somebody" here. Another bonus is that it's walking distance to a bunch of other restaurant and a shopping district. :) 
16726 3 Always enjoy the food here and have always had good service... Not getting some if the reviews. The sauces are amazing and very authentic dishes with large portions if ur a big eater:) 
16727 4 This place is really top-notch! I mean it! The prices are affordable, the dining experience is clean and crisp, service great! I will be coming back for sure! 
16728 3 Great service. They are very kind and friendly. The food was delicious and they even had my favorite caprese salad too! 
16729 4 Had the grilled avocado and the "Diablo" tacos. Really, really good. Nom nom nom! 
16730 1 Only average tasting food, not outstanding, so the higher than average price they charge means it's not worth it. 
16731 4 Cute queers, gluten free pumpkin bread, pretty encaustic wax paintings--total win. 
16732 4 Great fresh sushi and excellent soups. So happy we found this place after a long flight. Really hit the spot. 
16733 4 It was my cousin and I's first visit to the restaurant. I'm glad we choose this place. Great atmosphere, delicious food and great service by Kennervia!! 
16734 4 The food and the service were both great! The eggs Benny with short rib and the french toast were amazing. 
16735 4 Excellent all around... From the sushi to the General Gao's chicken, to the Shanghai Noodles, eggplant with garlic etc etc. I only wish I lived a little closer 
16736 3 This is our go to place for take out thai food. The order is always 100% correct, food amazing, and the service is quick. Any time I call, the food is always ready in 15 - 20 minutes. 
16737 4 Very yummy deli near Northside Hospital. The mushroom beef barley soup was amazing. Thick, lots of beef, and reminds me of my Aunt Margie's. Shared the Twin Tower sandwich. Delicious lean corned beef and pastrami with cole slaw. The knish was doughy, just ok. Can't wait to go back! 
16738 0 Terrible service. I didn't get waited on until after 15 minutes of waiting. The waiters are so rude!!!! Way too expensive for the quality they serve. Don't waste your time or money going here!!! Can't even give it a star... 
16739 1 Took 1 hour for 1 pizza with one topping to go 1 mile and it arrived cold... Are these the effects of legal weed??? Also $24 for that? Gtfoh 
16740 4 From friendly staff to great sandwich, I was impressed. First time in and had #16 with 1/2 sandwich & 1/2 salad combo. Herb mayo on the sandwich kicked the flavor up a notch. I would definitely eat here again. 
16741 2 Heard it was the best ramen in boston, so my expectations were high going there. After the meal, I must say I was not very impressed for what I got. Very thick soup, little amount, and fairly average price. I suggest pikaichi as a better alternative for ramen in Boston 
16742 3 You can find some cute stuff for a decent price here. Especially purses and tote bags. The clothes seemed overpriced though. I wish they had more simple jewelry, too many big ugly rhinestone earrings. Friendly and efficient cashier. I really wish they had a location by Cedar Park/Round Rock. 
16743 3 A3 golden yum melt c5 spicy cha cha c13 mongolian wonder c14 seaweed ocean. stray from these and who knows? 
16744 1 The food made me sick disgusting I would never recommend this resteraunt. But how ever this is not the staffs fault. 
16745 4 Excellent Nigerian food. The moi-moi is to die-for! Try the goat egusi and the fish stew. Plantains are also very good! 
16746 4 The food here was AMAZING! Visited on a weekday around 5pm and it was relatively empty. Our group of three all ordered different entrees and enjoyed them and the sides. The plaintsind were great. The food was so well seasoned and it truly did not disappoint! 
16747 4 Pizza was great, and the service was even better. Doesn't get much better around columbus. 
16748 4 This place is refreshingly LGBTQ friendly and a great resource for the NE to wrench in a supportive and productive environment! 
16749 3 Unfortunately, they've stopped serving the 6 for $6 oysters, and the menu seems to have gotten smaller, with fewer items. The food and wine are still good, and still expensive, but the overall trends seems to be downward. Hopefully, this won't be another institution that loses its way. 
16750 4 I go here at least twice a month. I've never had anything bad here! I am obsessed with the Tokyo ramen and the grilled squid. The tako yaki (not sure on the spelling) balls are really delicious too. Service is pretty good considering they are always packed. 
16751 4 I really love this place and lived in German Village on Beck St so I was there all the time. Flat brats, potato salad and cream puffs were my favorites. Bahama Mama is a destination. 
16752 0 Don't take advantage of their deals if using plastic. They are quick to take your money but it will be a few days before its returned. I called the main customer service number and got the most monotone lifeless operator who really didn't help me, offer anything ... 
16753 0 The food cart is gone and the lot is I under construction. Neither the phone message nor the website offer a new address. So it's adios. 
16754 2 Sweet italian as can be owner. He makes your pizza right in front of you, and has been in the bussines for many years. Delicious ingridients and tasty pizza. GREAT PRICES very affordable. 
16755 4 Good clean supermarket employees there are very helpful very satisfied shopping here by far the best stop shop I've been in 
16756 4 Love this place! Friendly staff and yummy food... Great nbor hood spot! The bowls and sushi are consistently good 
16757 4 Simply stated.... It was a fantastic experience!!! I will return often. The margaritas are amazing. Food is delicious!! Waitstaff is super friendly!! Look for their other locations!!! The one in Falmouth MA is just as fantastic!!! 
16758 4 Pleasant atmosphere, wonderful food ... a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Make sure you order several of the empanadas ... delicious. We'll be back the next time we're in Austin. 
16759 0 Before you eat here you need to watch the video about them on world star. Absolutely disgusting kitchen. Grease dripping onto food from grease catchers. Unsanitary food preparation stations. Insects, mold , and grime throughout the whole kitchen. 
16760 0 The service was bad, but I will say that it wasn't her fault because she was the only waitress. However all the food we got was terrible, so we won't be going back. 
16761 4 Tasty fast food!! You can try a variety of sizes so go for a bug one!! You can also refill your soda. 
16762 2 Very nice workers. However pedicure was horrible....polish has already started to come off and I just got the service done yesterday. As for my full set , I got the SNS nails.....so far , so good....let's see how long they last ... 
16763 2 The appetizers were good and naan was super fluffy, the curries were okay, super heavy on cardamom and ginger 
16764 4 Very friendly folks at Sky Ridge. They obviously care about each client and want them to be comfortable and happy during their visit. 
16765 3 Good healthy food, good selection, and good value. Tofu Bankok Curry was really good. Great location in the Pearl District. 
16766 2 I have been to the other pei wei around Dr Phillips and always order Pad Thai. I was really disappointed with todays order as is the first time it has tasted really bland. The other sweet and sour order was much better tasting. 
16767 4 Everyone was very nice and professional, Dr. To listened to and addressed all my concerns, and the staff made a point of making sure I knew what insurance would and would not cover. Happy I gave them a second chance :) 
16768 2 The food is great! Regular dinning service at atmosphere are great. Take out though doesn't work, the counter is there just for decoration I think, too bad because I'd love to be able to get take out from there. 
16769 4 Love the personal fittings to make sure each bra purchased fits properly 
16770 0 Food taste horrible , expensive, unprofessional, Service are horrible, waiting half an hours for the food. 
16771 3 Lots of space, I spend time here during NFL season. 2 for 1 drinks! Great food great service, and did I mention there's over a hundred tvs??!! 
16772 3 firepit, hubby, glass of Pinot and some spicy ceviche- Im in heaven! 
16773 4 As a Corvallis-raised Portland transplant, I love having the Satellite Dream close by. This is unique and delicious pizza. Plus, the Ranch is perfect. 
16774 4 Best price for gas and very capable mechanics to all your mechanical work at fair prices. 
16775 2 I went to the takeout storefront down the block , but same menu. Ate out on the sidewalk Pho was OK but also nothing special; I like a bit more variety in the choice of ingredients Noodles were fine. 
16776 1 Dear Costelos, Please renew your website so I can fantasize about the delicacies listed on your menu. Everyone is raving and we need to know what you are all about. Please renew, I will love you. Jessica 
16777 4 Great drinks. Great food. Good service. I like to have a few drinks and munch on unhealthy nachos but the market vegetable nachos here are the best nachos we have ever had. Hands down. And the Texas/Moscow mules are delicious! 
16778 4 This is hands down the best Indian food in the Columbus area! I so enjoyed our meal here and the friendly staff. Thank you for a really great evening...please stick around! 
16779 3 Great food! The battered fish is delish!!! I would totally come back and try new dishes for sure 
16780 3 My food was fresh and good I had The crunchy roll shrimp tempura roll and some dragon rolls ..Everything was excellent the best sushi Ove had so far in orlando 
16781 1 Went for drinks did not try the food. Shots were measured and seemed watered down. Overpriced. Maybe dinner is better judging by the reviews. 
16782 4 Ask for Nancy! She's so sweet and gentle.. And gives the best gel manicures and pedicures! 
16783 3 An ideal place to work or hang. Thoughtfully and stylishly designed with nice service and many food and drink choices. So smart and wonderful they also have alcohol! Great music, too. 
16784 3 Love me some Siam Square! Nice atmosphere, excellent food and reasonable price. A great place for a dinner date or a working lunch. I recommend the Masaman - yum! 
16785 4 Delicious and friendly! We stopped here when we had some time to kill on our way back to MCO. The staff was super friendly and food was delicious. 
16786 4 LOVE! Love! Love! Everything that we have ordered has been stellar. I am stoked to have another delivery option in the area. The pesto linguine has become a weekly staple in our house! 
16787 3 Fresh cheap produce Spices and grains galore Tons of incense scents Decent frozen selection Small Prepared food counter with Indian sweets and samosas And a somewhat sad downstairs food court 
16788 3 Well, I've only come here to drink. But I drink quite often, and this is by far my favorite bar in the North End. Some day I'll eat here, though, and I'll let you know how it turns out. 
16789 4 The best team for knowledge and service! You can have custom pieces made there, too! 
16790 2 It's a home improvement store with over priced products, not sure they deserve more than 3 stars. 
16791 4 This place is amazing. Service was great, food was delicious, reservations are a good idea or you can eat at the bar which we did and enjoyed thoroughly. We shared a small pasta, salad, and pizza and had a wonderfull meal. 
16792 4 Yes, the Porchetta is amazing, but i love the Grill Cheese and the Tomato Soup too. Just a great little spot. Simple and efficient. Love it. 
16793 0 Wouldn't let someone in with a green card because it wasn't an acceptable ID to their head bouncer. Unacceptable. 
16794 4 LOCAL gourmet sandwiches that are absolutely INCREDIBLE! Reasonable prices, good beer on tap, good service for a busy restaurant, and excellent location. The outside seating is great and the decor is simple but nice. 
16795 2 Great Location with excellent views of downtown (Great venue to watch Mexico soccer games too), but that is about it. Food is subpar and small-portioned, and $2 Mimosas are very watered down. Go to Gabrielas for the experience, not the food/drinks 
16796 3 Amazing pizza, very fresh as you can watch them makes it and you can see them make your pizza from start to finish! They serve thin crust and that's awesome:) whole wheat crust is awesome too. You can always do a half and half pizza 
16797 4 I signed up for unlimited several weeks ago and always get great service. Especially William who sign me up. The staff is friendly and Brooklyn is my favorite location thanks to the guys. Thanks guys keep up the good work. 
16798 4 This place is the shit. Just had the fish sandwich and house salad. Succulent. Dark wood vibe, too neat. Girlfriend had the veggie burg, also good. Heated seating on deck. Great service. Sweet 80s music. Grass-fed meats. Hipsters unite. 
16799 4 The Ahi burger is sushi grade tuna that has been consistent every time I go. Been going there for about 2 years, at different times of the day as well as on weekends and week days. Great stuff hands down! There is always a line and guess why! 
16800 4 Love this tapas bar! This was my first experience with tapas and I have loved it ever since. Very quick service and the drinks are great! Perfect ambiance a live band. I always suggest to make a reservation. Will be back regularly. 
16801 4 Small place, great owner, best lamb gyro in pdx all for $7. The seafood salad was also great with lots of fish and shrimp. I will come back and try the hummus and bacon wrapped dolmas. 
16802 4 They sure do know how to throw a New Years Eve party. Live music instead of that top 40 auto tuned crap and an exceptionally diverse crowd. Such a relief to be able to go somewhere that isn't filled with rowdy college kids 
16803 4 I was visiting from NY and went her to celebrate her 40th birthday. It was soooo fun!! Entertainment and music was great! Service was great even with 20 of us! Food was delicious! I highly recommend this place! 
16804 4 My family has trusted Lavista Animal Hospital forever. With a brand new puppy, the staff has been incredibly kind, helpful, and caring! We have had such a wonderful experience with this team and wouldn't trust anyone else with our puppy. 
16805 3 We went last Sunday.. very nice place.. I will return to try everything on the menu... The drinks were decent.. 
16806 4 Definitely family oriented, great food and great for big groups and families. If you are looking for a quite place to take a date, this isn't for you. But for EVERYONE else bring your friends and have a GREAT time. 
16807 4 Amazing Indian food with a twist! From the samosa chaat explosion, tandoori chicken sliders, and to the chicken tikka tacos and veggie pakoras.. So so good. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a delicious Indian food fix. 
16808 3 Really good wraps. Really good and not too pricey. I think parking can be tricky but I usually walk here so I don't have first hand experience. Good speedy service too. Appears to be a SC Gamecocks bar on football saturdays...poor bastards. haha Go Blue! Go Michigan! 
16809 3 I've been here many times in small and large groups and have always received great service and the food is solid. The wine list is small but priced well as is their food. 
16810 4 Delicious and cheap! The food is all fresh and seems like really authentic Venezuelan. They make fresh juices daily and have a great cocktail menu. They make Arepas which are small sandwiches in grilled corn pocket and are amazingly tasty. I can't wait to go back for dinner. 
16811 3 Quick, friendly service and great flame grilled chicken. Easy family meals. Fresh salads, slaw and veggies too. Restaurant is full service but you order and pay first before they bring the food. 
16812 0 Food here has no taste. Pistachio halva is good. Go somewhere else for good middle eastern food. 
16813 4 The Mighty Rib with bacon is probably the best grilled cheese sandwich you will ever eat. 10 dollars for a grilled cheese is a lot of money but it's worth it. Also their truffle fries are great to share with a few people. Highly recommend. 
16814 4 This is one of my favorite shops in Austin. Beautiful furnishings, home decor items and linens. I shop here any time I am looking for a unique gift. It's also a destination when guest come to town! 
16815 3 Huge portion! Tasty enchiladas and the salsa had a nice homemade flavor. Nothing too crazy, but well executed. 
16816 4 I love Genies!! Everything I had has been excellent. Their coffee is amazing, there's no way I can only have one cup! Try their bloody mary's too. Super yummy! 
16817 4 Best dentist in Atlanta. Super convenient location right off of 400 at exit 5. Great for adults and kids so it's one stop shopping. They will treat you right and your teeth will look and feel great!!! Your smile is everything. 
16818 2 Went twice on recommendation of a friend. I love Chinese buffet, but on both visits... was disappointed. Foods were to bland, not flavored as well as most Chinese buffets that I have been to. No plans to go back. 
16819 4 Absolute gem! Delicious breakfast, especially the chorizo. Nice, quiet small town feel. Not pretentious, but so good! Not to mention really reasonable pricing. 
16820 3 Just had to write a brief update and say... toasted garlic, olive oil, and spaghetti pasta. SO GOOD I DIED. That is all. 
16821 3 Good sushi. The sashimi was fresh and the kimchi salmon sashimi was quite tasty. The sushi rolls were quite good too. The price was quite reasonable / inexpensive as a Japanese restaurant. I would go again if I happen to be in the neighborhood again and need food. :) 
16822 3 Some yummy, warm chocolate chip cookies. They come warm even through delivery! So delicious with a cup of milk or coffee. They just melt in your mouth. 
16823 1 I got the veg bean option. It was mushy and I swear it tasted like a burger i.e. it had been cooked on the meat grill. Not impressed with this place. 
16824 3 Pricey, but the spinach calzone is to die for!!! My kids also love the cheese pizza and can we just talk about the salad dressing the use in the Greek salad!?! OMG - if they bottles it I would buy it by the gallon. Soooooooo good! 
16825 0 Office provides incorrect information on what is covered vs not-covered by insurance in order to upsell non essential additional services, which patients have to then pay out of their pocket. Examples are Floride application, mandatory deep cleaning and most deep cleaning maintenance etc. Not recommended. 
16826 4 Best donut I've ever had. The lemon poppyseed and the blueberry bourbon basil are to DIE FOR. So good!!! 
16827 3 if my company didn't send me to client sites every week...i will eat here everyday for lunch. fried osyters with my co-workers! the best! 
16828 1 The non-buffet items are too expensive when compared to similar Indian restaurants. Breads were good. Curries were just OK. 
16829 0 Food was good. Service was abysmal. Had to ask 4 WAITERS FOR SOY SAUCE TO GO WITH OUR SUSHI !!!! We were there after the lunch rush (small crowd) and they rushed to give us the bill but took another 15 minutes to bring it back. 
16830 3 The curry is fabulous, but the servers won't bother to help you if you don't speak their first language. 
16831 4 One of best veggie burgers I ever ate. Excellent service. Good drinks. Had a great time! Thanks. 
16832 3 I prefer their thick noodle...Price and quality is the reason I give them four stars... Good for budget eater... 
16833 4 Amazing! Philly is to die for!! Wings on point and everything was large portions. Atmosphere and service was perfect. 
16834 4 I love this place. It has very little class but a whole lot of sass, as I would say. Yes, it is slightly sketchy and yes there are a lot of bums and yes it is slightly over priced, but that just gives Libby's Liquors a whole bundle of personality. 
16835 3 Got the beef shawarma wrap and loved it! Causal interior and service was fairly quick 
16836 4 Had a blast as a pirate! Made it out with time to spare and were still stumped by a couple puzzles. Great place! Kez was an awesome gamekeeper! 
16837 1 It was fun but too pricey I did like the flavor rice item but all and all I would not make the trip back across town to shop. 
16838 4 Best in Atlanta, Bar none You can taste the crème cheese in many of the icings Walking distance , just North of Manuel's Tavern and that's a great sequence to follow Mike 
16839 4 I has a massage from Lisa- it was very good for my back. I usually need very deep work so this type of massage worked well since she was able to use her body weight. Also very good for spinal realignment. 
16840 1 Food is ehhh. I didnt like everything. The salad isn't fresh, taste old. The hot food is just ok, some are good, some are just cold. Not impressed overall and for the price is definitely not worth it. 
16841 4 This place is AMAZING!!!!!! If there were more stars it would have them. Great family Italian joint. Service is superb. Food is out of this world. Everything made to order. 
16842 4 Good paint matching ability. Much better than Home Depot paint cards or Sherwin Williams. 
16843 4 Wonderful yoga studio. I enjoy all the teachers and the workout that I get with all classes. Always hot in the room, and you get pushed physically as well as mentally. Yoga has changed my life for the better! Highly recommend Joe, Irina, and Leah's classes! 
16844 3 I came here for brunch on an overcast day, but the rooftop seating was perfect. The drinks were amazing, and I love the unlimited mimosa option! I wish the brunch menu had a few more Options though. 
16845 2 Over spiced and over priced. Good but not amazing. Wouldn't go again. Had vegetarian dishes, the fried rice came with a sunny side up egg(not a fan) and was so hot I could barely eat. And I eat a lot if spicey food. Lemongrass asparagus was good. 
16846 4 The food was absolutely delicious. I had the Patacon with shredded chicken and will definitely be back to try the Big Mexican burrito. The inside is a bit smaller than I had anticipated so we had to wait a bit but it was worth it! 
16847 4 Paul walked us through every step of the process ensuring that everything happened on time so that our closing went off easily. He even came to closing to ensure everything went well. We had no surprises other than the delicious pie he handed us on the way out. 
16848 4 Exemplary pizza. Crispy, crunchy, chewy, and packed full of flavor. Place to be in South Congress if you're in the mood for pizza. Prices are cheap and service is quick! Small inside but won't matter since the service is fast. 
16849 2 Overpriced for what is offered. It tastes like your standard fare westernized Chinese food but more expensive. There was no one there when I went even though it was dinner time, maybe it's because people order to go or pick up. 
16850 4 Bringing back house-calls. Modern medicine at it's finest 
16851 3 Their paneer tacos & velvet cake are my favourite. Totally love their decor. Good service. 
16852 4 Really fun place. I take visitors here to get a great dose of Boston. 
16853 0 Nasty. Dirty. Rude staff. Food was garbage from the local dumpster. Owner could have used a bath. 
16854 4 Yessssssssss!!! I am rarely enthusiastic about anything but the dense buttermilk donuts here are so good. I got the chocolate bergamot. I plan on getting another one and bringing a box home to people I love. 
16855 0 this is without a doubt the NASTIEST pizza i have EVER had. its soggy, the sauce is disgusting, and if you get a salad the croutons are stale. 
16856 4 I LOVE this place. Mother-in-law lives right around the corner, and every time im in PDX, I HAVE to stop here! Great coffee, tasty syrup options, and very cute local made goodies. I could hang out here all the time! 
16857 4 Authentic Mexican food! So yummy! Friendly bartenders and managers too! Portions are generous and place is clean! 
16858 3 The staff at Balckbird are very friendly and helpful. We came here for the wine tasting, it was great. They also have good selections of cheese. My even had my favorite (Humbodth Fog). I would come here again the next time we are in town. 
16859 0 Saw a review about the patrons of this place being lovely people? My friend was encouraged to leave simply for being a white male. Bunch of self important a-holes hanging at this place. 
16860 4 Food was amazing and it came out pretty quickly despite the crowd. The waitress was very helpful and really sweet. They all go out their way to ensure that you have a great experience. It was my 2nd time and it was so worth the 20min wait to get seated. 
16861 3 Dark and cozy inside with great food. The lobster tacos are amazing! The prices aren't too bad either, since you can get appetizers that can function as small dinners (if you're not too hungry) for under $15. 
16862 4 The lunch buffet was perfect. Fresh and warm, highly recommend for lunch. They bake their own bread which is included in the buffet and they also serve fresh black tea at the end. Love love love. 
16863 4 Got a fabulous pedicure here. Was impressed with the upscale environment! Will go back again for sure. 
16864 0 Went for notary.. charged me 10 dollars which i understand but charged me 3 dollars for 30 seconds computer use ? really?! should have went to the bank and did everything for free...i got rip off -.-... 
16865 4 I wish we had a place like this in the Bay Area. They have almost everything you can need while being vegan and more! 
16866 3 One of the most delicious kabob houses I have eaten at in a long time. I highly recommend the Chicken Barg, it's a grilled marinated piece of chicken breast cooked to perfection. Served with a light salad, rice and garlic mayo. Delicious! Hummus and Baklava are also amazing choices! 
16867 4 This is by far the best Italian place in Atlanta. The waiters are great the food is awesome. Its very cozy place to sit and have a meal. For authentic Italian food its a good value. 
16868 4 Best fried chicken you will ever have. Do not go for atmosphere. It's a total dive. But these places do have the best food! Get a 2 or 3 piece meal with double fries or fries and cole slaw. You will not be disappointed!!! 
16869 1 Service I must say is really incredible, especially considering what kind of service one receives at ATL airport. Food was meh. .over ripe fruit and vanilla steamer lacked luster. 
16870 4 Was taken here for the first time for my birthday and I have never been treat so special. The service by both waiters made me feel like a queen. The view was amazing not to mention the food was cooked to perfection. Staff here really are amazing. 
16871 4 Love love love this location! The staff are always friendly and everything is always clean and organized. I come in here at least once every two weeks if not more. Very large clearance selection as well. 
16872 4 Consistent, reliable quality paired with speedy, first-rate customer service. Prices are always fair and provided up front. Lane is great! Take your business here, not to the mall. You won't be disappointed. 
16873 4 Sad to see all the negative reviews here. This place is amazing. Service is always terrific, great selection of drafts, and the burger is one of the best I've ever had. 
16874 4 Maaaaaaaaaan this food is awesome lol......I have nothing else to say sorry. The philly cheese sandwich is 5 stars 
16875 4 Love it. I started listening to Wait Wait and Car Talk about 20 years ago without knowing what station they were being played on. While I hate the Sunday programming and dislike Radio Boston intensely for some odd reason, it is my go-to station for news. 
16876 1 The food is average quality with high prices. The service is ok, but they push expensive drinks on you. And they have very little that's vegetarian or even vaguely healthy. I also had to wait a very long time for a table. 
16877 4 In these parts of town this place reigns supreme in the Szechuan category! Great lunch specials too 
16878 0 I don't normally do reviews. However this was one of the worst meals I've had in a very long time crab was over cooked and lobster tasted like rubber! Won't be eating there again ever!!! 
16879 4 Stopped in this week and got two of their chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter in the middle. So awesome! I will be back! 
16880 1 It's new and hot, however not the best drink in town. Very pricey. You can find better tasting drink elsewhere. The environment is not bad. I would not recommend going to this place if you're just visiting. 
16881 2 Call me gehto but I would gladly trade this target for a walmart in lakeway. They are always small, limited selection of inventory. I super target would be nice as well. 
16882 4 The best pizza place I have visited till date, and I have been to some pretty good ones, including authentic pizza places in Venice and Rome, so I would highly recommend this one. 
16883 0 worst wing factory location! the wings suck! the staff is rude af! go to the buckhead location! 
16884 4 Best Mexican breakfast burritos in Portland. I used to live right by this little gem... talk about being hard to resist! I would peek my head out the window at 10...." Please be open" !!! 
16885 0 Specifically ordered a small Italian sub with everything EXCEPT for oil and wanted mayo instead and got a mess upon delivery. 40 minutes and $10 later I had to throw it away and have cereal instead. Thanks for nothing. Always a disappointment when I order. NEVER AGAIN! 
16886 0 The worst experience ever. The service was slow and the food orders were wrong. We waited an hour to receive the wrong order. 
16887 3 Takes time to get use to the parking otherwise I love Emory. I have not had a bad experience yet. 
16888 1 I was lied to by the finance guy who told me my warranty covered Every part of the car. Twice i have brought my car in for them to tell me it isnt covered. Won't be purchasing another car from this dealership. 
16889 4 I go here about once a week for the lunch special since it's a block away from my office. Delicious, fresh, healthy, and cheap. Good service and can call in your order ahead of time 
16890 1 Last time I went we waited for over an hour for appetizers and had to reminded the server multiple times for the foods. Entrees came two hours later and saw a lot of customers leave. Food wasn't the freshest and definitely did not worth the wait 
16891 4 David was super helpful in getting our tires installed and our car out the door. Thanks ! 
16892 0 Not impressed. Customer service leaves alot to be desired. Yellow mustard, means yellow mustard in the deli!! 
16893 4 This place is GREAT. Unique drinks and ALL the plates are delicious. Highly recommend! 
16894 0 You would think they'd have more than one slow person behind the register at 7AM and more than one barista .10 minutes in line (line to the door) 
16895 3 Love this chain and this location in particular. The multiple soups and extra-long salad bar are great. I always try 4 or 5 of the soups on each visit. The staff is friendly and the place is usually spotless, although their sanitation suffers a tad during busy peak times. 
16896 4 We Just found out about this place and they are open late which earns then super points. I really liked the flavors and toppings. The service,however, is what makes it great! The lady helping us was so nice and informative. Loved this place, definitely coming back 
16897 3 Rumor is there's new management and a new chef for this place. We ordered for delivery, and I'm happy to say our order had a lot of flavor! We've had trouble with thai delivery being bland. So we were really happy that our order was pretty good! Arrived quickly too 
16898 2 Good Burrito. The Saltena was new to me and I didn't love it, but what do I know. Thumbs up for Jarritos soda. I love orange. The people at the counter were super nice. Reasonable prices. 
16899 4 Best pizza in Kissimmee thus far, will definitely be back to try there other specialities 
16900 4 I've come here multiple times, and they are the best! So friendly and helpful! Angel and Kathy have both done my nails and they always come out looking great! Definitely recommend this place for a good manicure or pedicure! 
16901 4 Amazing food recommended by the owner and Chef himself! The meal was delicious. The service is simply outstanding! We were served by Patrick, their star bartender! We absolutely loved our experience me and my fiancé! I recommend to everyone to give it a try, you won't regret it! 
16902 4 Just started the weekend right with breakfast here. Excellent! The pumpkin chi latte ...... 
16903 3 I love this place. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the early closing time and lack of liquor license. Food is awesome. Recommend for pick-up and/or takeout. Best Pad Thai in the city if you ask me!!! Thumbs up for Thai Away Home 
16904 4 First Power Track class with Diallo....best instruction I've ever had.....#simplythebest 
16905 4 Best Clam Chowder in Boston. It was warn and delicious on a cold day I spent in Boston. The Crab Cake sliders are also excellent and come with delicious fries 
16906 4 Great food, great service, and overall great experience! The kids loved it they even had a kids play area with a chalkboard, dinosaurs, and other fun toys. Definitely coming back! 
16907 3 Great burgers, great beer, a fun place to hang out on a lazy afternoon and get a drink with some friends outside. It looks like they have a huge Irish whiskey menu, but I haven't tried it. 
16908 4 Halinka gave me a complementary consultation today to discuss a botched hair cut from another Stylist. SHE FIXED MY HAIR and It looks AMAZING. I didn't think it could be fixed because it was cut so short. Halinka is Very professional one in a million! Autumn 
16909 4 Very well-care for grounds. It was a relaxing and inexpensive way to spend the afternoon. Loved Japanese area and koi pond. A must-do in Austin. 
16910 4 Excellent, excellent , excellent , excellent tapas. Some of those are even better than what we had in famous Barcelona tapa bars. Love the octopus, the potato croquettes and the quail! 
16911 4 Great food! Menu can seem tricky to navigate at first but the food and atmosphere is well worth it. Very busy Saturday nights. 
16912 4 This is the new Dollar store in our neighbour hood... it has then become my GO-TO place. they have EVERYTHING... from my cravings of sweets, chips, baking items.. so the simple stuff like my daughters kinder surprise egg. this place 
16913 4 The wait can be long but so worth the food! My go to dish is the BBQ and stew combo. The seafood stew is the best. The price is reasonable. The service is average. 
16914 4 Delicious pizza and excellent service! A nice and cozy little restaurant , perfect for a nice date night! Can't wait to go back! 
16915 4 Order was correct, fries were amazing (ask for them to be crispy). Great per usual. 
16916 4 Such great food! It definitely gets pretty busy on weekends, but they offer free coffee and water for those who are waiting. We found this through Diner, Drive-ins and Dives :) 
16917 4 Friendly and fast service. Mel was awesome! Facility was very clean and new as well! This place is also super easy to get to right on Manchaca which is good to know there is something so close by in case of emergencies. 
16918 4 Split the lamb shank and lamb kebab with my wife. The food was incredible. Ambiance was great in the courtyard, and the staff were awesome and attentive. 
16919 4 The best Japanese restaurant in Boston. Even though there is a long wait during Friday night but the food here just make it worthy. I will go there regularly once every week. 
16920 2 I went back again and this time ordered curry, and the rice was way too smushy. Kinda ruined the curry for me, though the curry tasted good. Told the waitress about it but she didn't care too much. 
16921 3 Great place happened to stumble upon in Cambridge. Interesting drink menu... fantastic food menu... comfortable dining area... great service. Liked it all! Mussels where excellent as was the pork tenderloin and chicken schnitzle. Will go back for sure! 
16922 4 Wow best doughnut ever. !! Everyone try the orange pistachio olive oil puff not to sweet bit crispy and powdered 
16923 4 Just had a great experience at this shop! They were super helpful. I love my new bike! They took the extra time to fit my helmet, set my bike lock and get everything in my car for me. What great costumer service. I would recommend going here for sure. 
16924 3 Great customer service. I wish I knew the guy's name that sold us a mattress, but he was very helpful! The store is very clean too! 
16925 3 Great views of Austin! Would like to see it at sunset next time. Relaxing cool ambiance for hanging out with friends. They had food menu but didn't get to try since I arrived at almost closing time. Glad I got a chance to take satisfactory pictures. 
16926 4 Best tasting Indian food I remember having in Massachusetts, and the lunch buffet is possibly the best bang for your buck around. Buffet + 2 soft drinks, $10.25 (including tax after discount) Serious no-brainer 
16927 4 Love this place. Under new management, they never disappointed before and they don't now. Always a great choice ban mi is about $5 and so worth it. 
16928 3 These guys were totally great. We had a two-part complex move that required some finessing and they did it with no problems what-so-ever. I'd use them and recommend them to anyone. 
16929 2 I ordered delivery and the food was really cold by the time I got it. It tasted good but I don't suggest getting it delivered. 
16930 4 This place is awesome. The restaurant feel is kind of like stepping back in time, but it's delicious. Def. will go back! 
16931 4 Friendly service, relaxing vibe, good price. Ouida gave me the best massage I've ever experienced. Fluid, unique, therapeutic technique. She is amazing. I was with four friends and they also had great treatments. 
16932 0 Ya go in. Ya go out. We paid for it, and now we keep paying despite promises that we wouldn't.. What a great representation of the broken promises of government! 
16933 2 Great place to get young kids toys but this place has changed alot in years and they always keep moving stuff around. 
16934 1 Cool place to hang. Bland food in my opinion. Although I've only had the breakfast. Good service and nice atmosphere though 
16935 4 Best falafel... ever! Sandwiches are amazing. Everything I have tried is great, though I usually get the falafel sandwich. I have seen people buy bags of their pitas, too. We go back constantly, so I only have the best things to say about my experiences at Pita Hut. 
16936 3 Had the magic shroom burger and it was really tasty! I never thought pesto would taste so good with a burger! Parmesan fries were also really good and truffle sauce was amazing. Only bad thing is the wait to order was pretty long and moved very slow. 
16937 4 By far the best chicken sandwich I have ever eaten, and even better - it's inexpensive! The service is always quick and friendly. The food tastes fresh, well thought out, and extremely flavorful. The chicken sandwich, fries, and mac salad are to die for. I highly recommend! 
16938 4 Best coffee in Vancouver. I mean it. The pour over is very good, not acidic like the rest of West Coast coffee. Muscavado Latte has the creamiest foam and perfect amount of sweetness. I love working in their cute little upstairs nook. It's cozy and sunny. 
16939 4 Love this place! Good price, very delicious cookies, cakes and many kinds of bread. I stop by at least once a week to pick up my favorite cookies and red bean buns. 
16940 3 This place will do! Good food fast service and a big menu. Party of 6 called ahead and seated immediately 15 minutes before. Big portions, The El Patron fajita was great. 
16941 4 Great service and a great neighborhood ice cream shop! I'll definitely be back! The Shop is clean, bright and has a nice Houghs neck neighborhood feel! The ice cream is great quality and they offer a large variety! I had the chocolate peanut butter cup and it was great! 
16942 4 Can't remember the name of what I got but it had 3 huge scoops of ice cream, chocolate vanilla strawberry with hot fudge & whipped cream. To die for. 
16943 4 Small bites. Big flavor. The only downfall to this place is the seating is so limited. Still, the food is super delish! I recommend. 
16944 4 My buddy who lives in Boston swears by this place. Both times I've gone it was amazing great food, incredible sangria (coming from me that's a very high compliment) get the French onion soup 
16945 4 Great food, employees are very nice. They don't rush you out. We stayed chatted over coffee and a good breakfast. Menu has something for everyone. 
16946 0 Just tried to order from here. Was told that I couldn't order anything from the grill because they just cleaned it because they close at 10. It was 9:30. Shouldn't you clean the grill at 10? Just lost my business forever. 
16947 4 Got the spaghetti bolognese and flat noodle here was super good 5/5 portions are good and really flavourful! Would come back for the spaghetti 
16948 4 my absolute favourite brunch spot in vancouver. I always order the frittata and a waffle whenever I'm there 
16949 0 not ever coming here again. server totally screwed up our orders. she never said sorry, she had really bad attitude and then she said, 15% tip is included anyways. worst experience ever. food was ok. just like any other greek restaurant. i dont recommend this place. 
16950 4 best popcorn ive ever had at a movie theater, hands. down. i really enjoyed the experience. i wish they'd open one in houston! 
16951 4 The owner (or lady at the cash register) was SUPER sweet and even asked me if I wanted a student discount. Literally so sweet and nice and such yummy food 10/10 recommend This was my first time here btw and already love it 
16952 4 build your own poke bowl is my go-to weeknight dinner! fair price, great service, and excellent experience 
16953 1 Good food, pretty pricy, a little snobby, but eclectic. May return but not soon. The owner seemed friendly but the servers couldn't care less. 
16954 3 Ordered pad Thai and green curry chicken with eggplant. Portion is generous. Curry is a little bit sweet for me. 
16955 3 Got the skillet and rate the food 4/5. it was a little on the pricy side and the restaurant is always so busy it's hard to get amazing service, but definitely loved the place 
16956 4 Always splendid - especially outdoors on warm nights - a tea smoked duck was memorable- this last visit also four gay Men all broke our diets and ordered four desserts - my Creme Caramel made me cry it was so luscious 
16957 4 Stopped in this morning. Yes, it's good! I love the fresh cooking of cafes. Sure, I hit the chains sometimes, but the smaller cafes deliver the true Austin experience and where else but SOCO to get your meal on. Carrot Cake French Toast - can't go wrong! 
16958 1 Expensive and not too good. The customer service was good, but the food was off in flavor. I had the croque Monsieur. Too heavy and too much going on in the sandwich to enjoy it. Stick to something simple. 
16959 4 Are you kidding me!! This place is delicious! Great atmosphere..incredible service..amazing happy hour..and the food...the food!!! If you love French food...this is a must! 
16960 4 This place is amazing! It's reasonably priced, and I've never had my eyebrows look so good! The Brazilian was also great because she used high quality wax that is not near as painful as other places I've been! Jessica is great! 
16961 4 Tofu Pad Kee Mao, is super yummy, and those spinach dumplings are doubly delish! 
16962 3 Very very good food. Love love the noodle soups which are always served steaming hot. Cannot go wrong with the vermicelli either. 
16963 3 Great tavern in a wonderful area of Boston. We shared the turkey sandwich with sweet potato fries and lettuce wraps. The sandwich was thanksgiving on a sandwich served with a side of delicious gravy. Yum. Good draft menu including ciders. 
16964 4 I've taken many different kinds of shoes in various states of disrepair here and they've always come back looking spectacular. They don't just use glue, and you can tell that they take pride in their work. Look no further! 
16965 2 My family and stopped by for lunch. We had the lunch special, a piece and a salad for $9. Pizza had been sitting out for a while but still tasty and the salad was good. The college students down the street will love it. 
16966 3 Everything you'd expect from a Mexican tire shop. Matter of fact service, good prices, specialty experience without the salesman BS. Get got it. Cool ass mural too. Eat at Mr. Natural's across the street or Cafe Azul next door. 
16967 4 New hotel with a nice pool and pool bar restaurant. One mile from Disney property, but in a very quiet area. The staff is friendly. Many restaurants within two miles and no traffic. There's lots of parking. The free breakfast is good too. 
16968 4 Gourmet potato cakes were very delicious. I dined with a group of 6 ladies and everyone tried something different. Food was well prepared and served professional. The atmosphere was authentic highlighted with the live entertainment. I definitely recommend this German Restaurant. 
16969 2 Do not order the famous Jar Jar Duck. For what it is, it is very overpriced. The standouts of the night, for us, were the Bacon tataki and Olive gelato dessert. The service was amazing. 
16970 4 Best gluten free crust ever I have this pizza yummy! Nobody can make delicious gluten free better than this 
16971 4 Tim and Marcus thank you. These two gentlemen who work for the Avalon saw me struggling to take out an old rug and were there to help me in a second. I love it here. Maintenance and the entire staff are good people. Stephanie 
16972 4 Excellent food and really nice, friendly staff. Going to come back to get some Cuban coffee in the morning. 
16973 3 This place ... I LOVE! Very simple ingredients but absolutely delicious! The tali sauce...to.die.for. Definitely recommend it if you are looking for a quick healthy bite to eat! 
16974 3 Cozy ambiance and great comfort food! Had the pulled pork sandwich with leek and potato soup and it was the best pork to date! Also shared the gorgonzola poutine which was really good! Great service and fair prices made this a place I will return to again! 
16975 3 Great customer service. Nice people. Hilton honors check in didn't work so well with a longer stay and small convention onsite but they were very gracious to provide breakfast due to the inconvenience. Very clean. Huge fun. Nice warm outdoor pool. Great seating and area to socialize. 
16976 4 Excellent food for a great price! Try their Udon! 
16977 4 It's was my first time , I got a amazing massage ever I feel more energy inside my body than before. Great price for a massage place. 
16978 3 I give it four just because the food is amazing have yet to have a bad meal, chicken pot pie and Shepards pie unreal. The only downside is the red headed Irish waiter the guys an absolute miserable douchebag...bartenders are great to 
16979 4 I have always had great food and great service! They are super fast but most importantly delicious! Thank you Cafe Yumm for being so amazing. P.s I love that you can buy the yumm sauce to take home. Super good on vegies! 
16980 4 The suan la chow show is amazing. It is one of those dishes that doesn't seem that spicy on the first couple of bites, but as you eat it, it just keeps getting hotter. Absolutely delicious. 
16981 0 This was the worst experience ever at a doctors office and we didn't even see the doctor. The front staff was so shockingly terrible we are going to another city to get the procedure done. 
16982 4 Super! Que amabilidad la de los empleados, la habitación comodisima y una vista espectacular a la piscina que esta super divertida en un ambiente excelente! 
16983 4 After reading reviews we decide to go and try it. And And it was good i had Cheese steak Pizza and wow it was VERY GOOD services was good too our waitress was very Friendly her name was Chelsea. 
16984 0 I seriously don't know how this place is still open... The customer service is awful. They take for ever. The food is cold more times than not. 
16985 4 Driftwood Coffee is awesome. Every time i go in the owner makes me feel like I'm at home. The coffee, food, location, service and over all feel of the place is great! Hope this place is here to stay. 
16986 2 This is good place for last-minute sushi. Nothing too impressive, but not bad either. Service can vary depending on the day/server. 
16987 4 Hey, this place is no longer closed. And it is great. Great cocktails (try the Ron de Old Fashioned), great live music, and intimate setting. 
16988 3 The food here is very satisfying. Had the people's choice dumplings (filled w/scallop, pork & prawn). Fabulous but needed a bit more corn sauce. The Halibut sliders tasted excellent! The octopus skewers were great and also had the empanadas (vegetarian). I had the piano margarita and it was uniquely refreshing. 
16989 4 Our favorite brunch spot in Vancouver. It's our go to when in town, and it's never disappointing. The waffles with the various toppings are fantastic! Avocado toast, Paella, Roasted Potatoes...everything is just delicious! They're also kid friendly and we've enjoyed brunch with our baby, now toddler. 
16990 4 Warm service, affordable, quick, tasty... Everything I can ask when I am late and hungry! 
16991 0 Only good thing here is u can buy furniture other then that dont waist your money here 
16992 3 This is a really good Thai joint. It is a little too dark for my taste but, the service is great. The taste is spot on and the amount is sufficient for the price. 
16993 4 Best 'ice cream' in Vancouver. Love that they experiment with flavours. Gained 15 pounds in 3 months due a daily, yes, daily addiction. I'm all better now, but do sneak back for an occasional scoop...or container 
16994 3 Great meal, delicious creme brûlée and personal service from our waitress. Awesome view over the Columbia River at sunset. 
16995 3 I love hibachi places and frequent them often. Kezuki was our chef. The steak was tender and cooked medium (which is what I asked for) and my lobster was cooked just right. I will definitely check this out again next time I am in Orlando. 
16996 4 Wonderful dining experience! Sat immediately. Our waitress was very attentive! Good rec on wines. Less than generous pours on alcohol, but fair prices Had oysters, Caesar salad, crab and chorizo crusted char and salmon w maple glaze. The food was amazing and very creative 
16997 3 We had a great stay at this location! The staff was very attentive and welcoming! Although it is one of the older locations, it is just as pretty! The rooms are spacious and clean. It is located 15 to 20 from just about everything! 
16998 1 Got the three dish combo. Potatoes were lackluster, chick peas were cold, and the naan wasn't naan but some other flatbread. Lentils were good. 
16999 3 Possibly best breakfast in town. Also love their lunch menu. Tuna melt with onion pedals is to die for. 
17000 0 Terrible pizza, horrible delivery time. Almost took double the time we were told, and the pizza was cold and tasteless. 
17001 4 Great thiner crust style pizza with great flavor. I got a small Fenway and it was enough for dinner and lunch the next day. 
17002 4 Love their food... All kebabs are good. Especially Doner Kebab, Chicken kofte kebab and tandoori chicken kebab.. Love their Meze bar... lots of items... babaghanoush, bean salads, tabbouleh, eggplant with chicken, fish, lamb, beef & veggies... Their desserts seems are also very nice.. but seems small for the price... 
17003 4 Excellent customer service! My salesman was Ryan and he put up with me and my mother arguing back and forth about this and that. He was a real sport till the very end and was very attentive and informative! Very valuable employee! 
17004 4 Charles has a great store and stocks only the finest outdoor sporting apparel, guns, fly rods &amp; reels, flys, boots, jackets, flashlights, binoculars, and much much more. High end stuff only. Exceptional quality. Check their web site! 
17005 3 Old world charm reminiscent of the 80s complete with persnickety service that was somewhat irked over our groupon coupon. I say skip the coupon and go in for a tappa or two with a couple of sangrias on happy hour to get out on the cheap. 
17006 2 The food is great but wayyy overpriced! It cost me $21 for takeout of chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. This only lasted me one meal! While delicious, it was not worth it. The servers responded to me haphazardly. I would only go back with a groupon. 
17007 4 This is legit best oyster place of Boston. Great lesson for oyster starter. Compared to New York Boston oyster is the real thing ! 
17008 3 Locals would rate this as one of the best Italian restaurants in the area. Entrees are always piping hot and delicious. Broccoli/chicken/ziti is the signature dish...cioppino is wonderful since the pasta soaks up the broth. 
17009 4 This place has never let me down. Consistently great food and awesome service. If you haven't been here your missing a great experience! 
17010 3 Got a Chicken Salad sandwich today. It wasn't what I thought it would be but turned out to be pretty good. A little spicier then I usually eat but the flavored were well balanced. Definitely going back to try a few other sandwiches. 
17011 4 I've been coming here for 3 years now. Vicki, my stylist is awesome! They also take walk-ins. Errin, the owner is awesome too. It's like a family environment, where "every body knows your name"....you can also drink /bring wine while you're getting your hair done too. 
17012 0 Really rude manager and poor service. I woulnd't recommend the place unless you ´re a friend of the manager if which case they appear to be really nice with you... Less than average food. The guinness was a bit disappointing 
17013 4 Love, love this place. It's the best lash extension in town! Try them out, they are TERRIFIC!!! 
17014 4 Great donuts and a wonderful group of people. I get in there a few times a week and their apple fritters are the best I ever had. Thanks for being such a great addition to the downtown Portland area! 
17015 3 Good experience today getting an MRI. Three pages of paperwork that they explained clearly. Front desk guy was friendly and helpful. I only waited 5 minutes in the waiting room. The tech was friendly and made sure I was comfortable for the MRI. 
17016 0 Don't bother. A failed attempt with a few pathetic video games to attempt a recreation of an arcade atmosphere unfortunately it's just a bar with over priced drinks and barely functioning video games with a lot of attitude at the door as you attempt entry. 
17017 4 Super-fun way to learn about all sorts of things. How is sake made? Why do we lie? The evolution of Austin traffic. Bizarre linguistic rules. Robots! It's a great way to diversify oneself and meet some neat people! 
17018 2 I've been in this sushi place maybe three times. They have good portions and ok service. Nothing special for the food. The cuts are too big for me and my boyfriend. There are other cheap sushi places that are better in the area. 
17019 3 The food is amazing. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is that sometimes when I call to place an order I get no answer. I like to know that they are serving what I want before I take the 40 min drive. 
17020 4 Same owner as local "Pizza Bar" - great fried items - offers Kenny's pies so Im a fan!!! 
17021 3 Have been trying to love this location forever. Pete saved the day tonight. Perfect tini per order. Never better. 
17022 0 Terrible. Ordered the "Classic Grilled Cheese" as a takeout. Stale bread that had not been grilled or even heated. Some kind of spreadable cheese inside. Maybe it had been microwaved? Hard to tell when I opened the package ten minutes later. Classic? 
17023 3 You had me at brownie raspberry. I like that Staccato Gelato is open late and also within walking distance from my house--score! The staff was friendly, the flavors were delectable and even the music was on point. 
17024 3 Loved the gaucho bread, smoked bone marrow, and pear gorgonzola salad. Great cocktails and a good selection of beer on tap. Service is on point - all courses were perfectly timed. Classy decor/atmosphere and quiet enough to talk during dinner :) 
17025 0 Sat down and waited 1hr before a glass of water was served .Staff is non attentive and detached .Ordered Scallops all were overcooked. Terribly disappointed would definitely NOT recommend this restaurant 
17026 4 I had the build a bridge burger with ground beef, sharp cheddar and carmalized onion and it was tge best burger i have had in a very long time This is definitely a place i would return to and recommend to anyone 
17027 4 Such a great place to find amazing and cute plants! They have a beautiful variety and I saw a lot of succulents I've never seen before. They have some terrariums and pots already put together that you can buy or gain inspiration from. 
17028 3 Always love this place, especially the pan roasted lobster which I had last night. Messy to eat, but good. Always feel comfortable coming here for a drink and seafood. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. 
17029 3 great deal on sushi, although the rolls consist of a LOT of rice. STill, it's a great place to try a bunch of different rolls without rolling out your bank account 
17030 4 Amazing pizza, tons of options and so quick. The staff was super friendly and inviting. I crave pizza from here all the time now. Tried out Crush in downtown to see if it'd be similar but Blaze is WAY better and has many more options for toppings. 
17031 4 Such a variety of shots and a fun atmosphere! Greeted and tended to by friend staff and music to kick. Camp fire shot is one everyone must try! It's like a smore in a shot. 5/5 stars. 
17032 3 They remodeled the place decorations are more tasteful that the creepy masks before. One word -- BEIGNETS!!! Havent tried it with Gelato yet, next time. Great for breakfast with coffee. Other than that the food offerings are typical cafeteria style for a theme park resort. 
17033 4 Shari's hands down has the best pies around. Took our granddaughters there after seeing the lights on Peacock Lane and throughout Portland and before driving through the Winter Wonderland at the Portland International Raceway. Started an annual family event with the help if Shari's. 
17034 4 I had their Buffalo Chicken SW and loved it so much. Its a very cool place. Great rainy vancouver lunch! 
17035 2 I ordered the noddles as "standard" but they came relatively firm. If you like soft noddles, make sure you choose "soft" option. The soup was nice. I also ordered fried dumplings but they came sticky and not crispy. 
17036 4 This is, by far, the best Mexican place I've ever been. Everything I've ever had here (chimichanga, quesadilla, flautas) have been absolutely fantastic. Couldn't recommend it more. 
17037 3 Wonderful, charming family owned business. Food was excellent. Picky 10 year old loved it and so did we. Great Greek coffee, hummus, pita, combo and cheese plate. Would definitely go back again. Decor a bit diner-like but all else fab. 
17038 4 Awesome local spot! Live right down the road and just discovered this spot. Sit at the back bar with Paul and you're guaranteed a good time! 
17039 4 My wife and I stumbled on this gem and try to make it back regularly for the Saturday night special featuring Roberto singing while we enjoy the ambiance. The best to this #family and all their ventures. 
17040 1 I used to hang out here with all the Parker House regulars. It was fun back in the day...been back since, not the same. Kinda lame. 
17041 0 Restaurant is closed....Was planning to go there for dinner last night, a Saturday, as Open Table was accepting reservations for the restaurant...got there and there was a "closed-thank you" sign on the door.... 
17042 4 this is an awesome venue to see music in! I just saw Santigold play there last night and it was amazing! 
17043 3 I swear by the Nino's special. It is top five best Italian subs I have ever had, and as a lifelong resident of the North Shore, I have had my share. 
17044 3 Super friendly staff. We called ahead and the person on the phone didn't sound like a stoner. Nice selection. Charlie was super interested I. Helping us as we were look 
17045 4 BEST PLACE EVAH!!! 
17046 4 This place is a wonderland of notebooks, pens, art supplies, books and adorable gifts. Check it out! 
17047 4 Holy breakfast! Hot chocolate and raspberry croissant, straight from the oven. Incroyable! 
17048 4 Brandon was very welcoming and friendly. They did an excellent job washing the interior and exterior of my car. Car looked spotless afterward. 
17049 3 I had the fried duck/fried chicken entree and it was outstanding. What looked to not be much of a meal turned out to be an enormous portion. Very cool decor. Great staff. I recommend. 
17050 4 Best lunch in Bedford hands down. Quantity and quality of food can't be beat for the price. I hear everything is good but since I only ever get the Jack's Special I can't say for sure! 
17051 0 This place SUCKS. Big time. the service is slow and inattentive. they take forever to take your order, and even longer to serve food, then they make you wait donkey years for pepper. lastly, the food is like their service. sucks. fake japanese fusion crap. 
17052 0 I've called at least 10 times in the past 3 days (to only receive voicemail) and left multiple messages to confirm my appointment. No response. Horrible customer service! 
17053 3 Stopped in for a lunch but was more impressed by the drink menu. They offer a pretty extensive selection and their pricing appears to be a steal! If I go back, I would plan to enjoy the bar style meal, instead of a sit-down meal. 
17054 3 Wow...this place is like a Walmart on steroids!!! Groceries, sporting good, furniture, jewelry, clothing, electronic, etc. Good prices and no tax! Wish they had this in Hawaii. 
17055 3 Had a great dinner and great service! Felt like an old school Italian restaurant. Nothing fancy, just very warm and cozy place. Will definitely go back. 
17056 2 Not as good as I'd hoped. It was worth going once to check it out but I've had way better burgers for a much more affordable price. 
17057 3 Food was good, just like a Chipotle but better. The lime chicken was tasty. A little on the spendy side @ 8 bucks for a bowl of rice, beans a small scoop of chicken and some salsa with a sprinkle of veggies and lettuce. Priced comparatively to Chipotle. 
17058 4 Just had Bob's cater another party at my house. The guests couldn't stop raving--especially -about the chicken piccata and eggplant parm. I couldn't be more thrilled! I'll be back for more!! Thanks to the entire team! 
17059 4 Three different plates ordered and all were amazing. Pancakes were sweet but good. Really good. Country fried steak, you can't go wrong. All meat omelette is way yummy. Lol. Seriously, good food. Great service 
17060 4 The food was amazing. The BBQ sauces were amazing too. Great service as well. 
17061 4 We've been coming here for over a decade. There are new owners but the sushi is as good if not better than usual. Some great additions. Met the owner and he's very hands on. WINNER. 
17062 3 I've tried both locations & they both have great pizza and a friendly wait staff. In fact, Mangieri's is my wife's fave pizza place. I like it too: good food, reasonably prices & a great lunch deal! The kids like the Lakeway location for the kidscape. 
17063 4 Best coffee I have ever had. Really good breakfast tacos. Strongly suggest the Winter Moon. 
17064 4 OH MY TACO GOD! Favorite tacos in a town full of tacos. I love the Del Rey on corn best but have had several great tacos. Can not recommend highly enough! I suggest calling in the order first to reduce wait time. Staff are super nice, too! 
17065 1 I got seated right away the interior was nice my waitress was fantastic but the food was extremely Bland I was hoping for something better 
17066 4 Guillermo was excellent and explained the menu very well! He brought us a sample of the mole sauce and asked the chef for things that were not on the menu (tamales). Very authentic food, will visit next time for the lunch specials! 
17067 4 What great gluten-free options, and made with healthy ingredients. It's fast, the staff is knowledgeable, and they deliver. The flatbread pizza is wonderful. I like the "Goat" made with feta cheese. 
17068 4 Best Lebanese In town. Good prices, HUGE portions. Their tabbouleh and hummus are the best I've had. The restaurant itself is small and can sometimes get loud...but worth it for the food! 
17069 0 Bad custom services at meat section for butcher. Some food were spoiled like Bean curd, etc. I believe is not a good place to go rather than other. 
17070 3 Best in area for chicken wings n skewrz to take home with you after trip to beer store...Friendly cook...cheap prices...way better than fast food wings from same neighborhood. 
17071 4 They got rid of that guy I wasn't really a fan of and replaced him with Robert who had me sweating buckets by the end of the warm up. Try and catch his classes - they are great! 
17072 1 Charged me $75 just to take a look at my car. Recommended over $1400 worth of work so I took my car to Yost to get a second opinion. Yost looked at my car for FREE and then fixed the problem for $210. 
17073 4 I come here all the time. Carnitas Taco plate is delicious, employees are super friendly and the green salsa is the best around. 
17074 1 Stopped bi. It was just okay. Birger was salty. Fries weren't fresh. Staff fixed the fries. Same birgers at Steak n Shake for waaaaay less money. 
17075 4 N Lamar's gem of a Thai restaurant- upscale but casual enough and amazing food. Seriously, it's so good. Just go there right now. 
17076 4 Awesome atmosphere and staff. Really cool vibe! Fun place good food. Kings platter the best bang for the buck. 10 plus pound lobster , snow crab, king crab, Dungeness crab, 
17077 1 Not impressed in comparison with the other parks. Sea otter and dog show was cheesy. Dolphin show is the best. Shamu 2nd best. Food and service terrible park wide. Not worth the ticket cost. Skip it if you have a local aquarium. 
17078 3 Great Pho, even better chargrilled pork sandwiches. Cheap, quick, clean, and so tasty. 
17079 4 Really fun experience! Francesco (our instructor) was excellent. He was very outgoing and made sure everyone was comfortable. Overall, very happy I went! 
17080 0 Went there yesterday and spent 30.00 for 2 meals. For 30.00 I could have gone to many others that would have been cheaper and better. I have been going there since it opened many years ago, and regrettably, they will never see me again. 
17081 3 I've been traveling through Columbus for weeks and this is one of the best things i have eaten. I had the Thai Chicken Soup and the Chicken Veracruz Salad. Both were killer good. The soup was legit. I would go here again in a heartbeat. 
17082 4 Excellent food and service. I had Wonton soup and Szechuan Chicken, both tasted very good, and were presented well. Several nice touches in the service, and a friendly and welcoming staff. This is a hidden gem in Orlando. 
17083 4 I love their lunch time Four Seasons Deluxe Combo with Tuna Poke! 
17084 3 Good food, friendly staff, yummy sangria. Sometimes they have live music too, and it's nice. 
17085 3 You walk into a nice little market. Restaurant is to the left past the cashier. Both times I have been here I have ordered the arrachera and have been happy both times. My friend gets tacos and both times he has been happy. Knowing some Spanish does help. 
17086 4 My 1st time ever trying Ethiopian food and it didn't disappoint. They made us feel like family. So much love for Bahel! Food was amazing and the service was even better! Make sure you try the honey wine and the coffee. 
17087 4 This is my absolute favorite place to get ice cream! The staff are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and they have fantastic customer service. Not to mention their ice cream is delicious! Their matcha flavour is always my go to :) 
17088 4 Hasan was a great help. He went above and beyond to make our deal to get our Mom a new 4runner. He really made it easy for her since she lives out of the metro area. 
17089 1 Terrible handling of the delays and need for a new plane. We were told not to leave the area but the replacement staff who were called to come in were actually 2 hours away. Treated like cattle and staff was obnoxious and rude. 
17090 4 Great food and fabulous service! Toni is great. Loved Brunch and have been many times for dinner. 
17091 4 This place is AWESOME especially our server Paul! Good foods, drinks, and layback environment! Definitely will come back for more!!!! Pork belly tacos are the BEST! 
17092 4 I loved Aura when I was in Portland. It was like a baby grow up... one summer most nights there were only a couple of folks any given night..and suddenly that fall, the mad rush began. I guess Portlanders need some place to see themselves trendy. 
17093 1 The food menu here is disappointing. Very unappealing. The beer is interesting and well received but the food is so dated. Try harder! 
17094 3 I've never tried the actual food, but I'm a regular at this place for fro yo. it's the best in Boston! service can sometimes be slow, but it's well worth the wait. My personal favorite fro yo combination is vanilla with oreo and cookie dough. 
17095 0 Unless you have an hour to wait for food, I'd avoid this place until they figure out how to run a restaurant. 
17096 4 Pound cake French toast is superb! I haven't been in awhile but now that I live less than 5 minutes away I think my husband and I will be regulars. 
17097 4 PARFAIT pizzas excellentes, personnel souriant et efficace, pas cher... On en redemande ! 
17098 4 The waffles are fabulous! I managed to try all sauces - salted caramel was my favorite, but the others were very close. Didn't manage to get to the frites this time, but will definitely be back to try them. Overall, great space with great food and people! 
17099 3 Very good food.....mashed potatoes, gravy......but i think i can make it just as good. 
17100 3 Small parking lot connected to Travel lodge. The service was ok but the food was tasty. Portions are average just like the prices. 
17101 1 If you are Chinese, there is nothing worth coming for here. The dumplings are very americanized, their boba drinks are pitiful. At more than a dollar per dumpling, you can do better anywhere in Chinatown, or even buying a frozen bag at a grocery store for 1/4 of the cost. 
17102 3 A great little place to stop in for a coffee, sandwich, homemade soup or cookie. Or even stop in just for a candy bar. Friendly people and fast service. 
17103 4 I finally got a chance to try this place and was very happy I did! The food was delicious with big portions. Highly recommend the chicken bastilla appetizer. Service was quick and friendly. 
17104 3 Came here on a weekday! Our group bought some truffles and other items! The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially Zane! They sell novelty candies, fudge, truffles and I think ice cream too! 
17105 4 The best falafel pitas ever in the world. Ever. 20 falafel balls for $5! And delicious hummus. 
17106 1 Sub par diner. Greasy omelet, bland potatoes, dried out orange garnish and forgettable coffee. Service was pretty good. 
17107 4 Best pizza I have ever had and it was from here. The food tasted so fresh and there were lots of each topping. It is making my mouth water just thinking about it. If you go to the USA you must try one just to see how tasty they are. 
17108 1 The "professionals" are hit-or-miss. I had a cleaner who did a great job but if you are a single woman who ives alone just beware as I'm not sure how thorough a job they do on background checks. I like Taskrabbit a little better. But again, just beware. 
17109 4 Tea Chai Tea is one of my favourite places for bubble tea. My favourite go to is the coconut bubble tea. They also have a large variety of loose tea's to choose from. I love the Sellwood location. 
17110 4 Waiter was great. (Think his name was Josh) food was great, and good beer prices. Thumbs up from me. 
17111 4 Thankful for this place! So few Cuban restaurants in Austin, can't wait to go back!!! Yummy! 
17112 2 The food is good for dishes that are under 520 calories. However, be prepared to leave hungry. I left feeling like there was a void in my stomach. Maybe eating some ice cream after dinner will help fill that void :) 
17113 3 Macho Taco is by no means the best food I have ever had, but it is consistent and cheap. I eat there several times a week. The staff is also really awesome. 
17114 4 Kat went above and beyond to help us today. The rest of the staff was also very friendly and great at helping us find what we needed. Thank you so much!! 
17115 3 Went on a Saturday afternoon, and got seats at the bar. Had a cold Harpoon and a stuffie. It was a great appetizer. So good! Fries were good too. Fun atmosphere, friendly staff. 
17116 1 We liked it when we went for dinner. So we went for buffet. Not much choice for vegetarians. Biryani has gone bad and not so good curries for naans. So we could not have biryaniz and breadz even though buffet was very expensive! 
17117 3 Great food! Love there bread and hummus. Healthy foods full of color. Raw beet salad, red onions and carrots with the chicken Adonis. 
17118 3 Our waiter Esteban was outstanding. It's a great waterfront location and food was very good. 
17119 4 Great experience! One of the best pedicures I've ever had. We went as a party of five and they were very hospitable and did everything in a timely manner. Can't wait to go back! 
17120 2 I loved the look of the restaurant. Parking was a little tight. Staff were nice. Outdoor eating was nice (and they do have indoor as well). For the food, sides were great, chicken was moist but didn't actually have any flavor. Overall it was good. Sorry to say, not great. 
17121 4 Omg! Best bagels I've had since I lived in Miami! Loved the coffee. So glad I found This place! 
17122 3 Doughnuts are unique and very good. You won't want to get more than a few, as they may be small but very rich. 
17123 4 We visited portland and tried the turmeric noodles (sunday - mi quang). best vietnamese soup I've ever had... anywhere. amazing food, great service. i'll be back. in the meantime i gotta look for an equal in socal. nothing has come close! 
17124 3 Went on Wednesday for after work drinks. The vibe is nice, dark and warm. Service was good. Didn't eat. Heard they have live music on Friday and Saturday nights. I'll be back. 
17125 4 Awesome team here at Tech Ridge Dental. Very professional, friendly staff. The doctor was kind and gentle (dentist visits freak me out). I've been coming here for almost 2 years. They make me feel like family. 
17126 3 Uno dei pochi ristoranti nel quartiere aperti fino a tardi. Posto accogliente e piatti molto deliziosi. Si trova sempre posto anche di sabato sera. Ovviamente i camerieri sono gentili. Consiglio il meatloaf. Anche i dolci sono niente male. 
17127 3 FUN FUN FUN. Divey, karaoke, strong drinks, drunk people. Can't complain. 
17128 3 Awesome spot for beers and sushi. The best spot in the ATL airport. It's pretty pricey though. 
17129 4 Kiki did a amazing job on my hair! She was easy to talk with which made the time fly by! The price was extremely reasonable for balayage. I will definitely be going back to her! The salon is adorable as well. Overall I could not be happier with the experience. 
17130 2 I used to love going here with my sister on Sundays to recap our Saturday night craziness while drinking beers by the water. This is an excellent place to drink, but not so much to eat. 
17131 3 Good food, fun atmosphere. It's a great place to go in the summer time for food and drinks. Lots of times will have live entertainment as well. My recommendation is to try the fried clams and steamers. They are money! 
17132 0 Went to dinner there before and found fly in my Pad Thai. Let the waitress know and she just shrugged her shoulders. Nothing off tab and no apology. Place sucks! 
17133 4 Favorite Ramen House in Boston and I have been to all of them. Noodles, broth, and pork are all excellent. I get the miso ramen and I think the miso paste is special. The people who run Sapporo ramen are always very friendly. 
17134 3 Good Food, good service terrible parking as I had to park at the Church. Varied menu and family friendly. 
17135 4 This place deserves the ratings, great fresh sushi, very creative food, all "to go"!! Made the way from Concourse C to E where this is just to come here! Now the warning: Pricey, buy worth it! 
17136 4 Best and oldest restraunt in Austin. Amazing food and staff. 
17137 0 What a dump. The service was extremely rude and the food was awful. Avoid this place 
17138 3 Homemade salsa: Yes and good. Homemade tortillas: No. Brunch mimosas: Yes and big and $3. Chiliquiles: Yes but not good--way too much corn tortilla chips and it tasted like only tortilla chips. Crab omelette suiza: delish and STUFFED with crab. Definitely worth another visit! 
17139 2 Don't get the salmon patty breakfast it's horrible taste like a dry biscuit been going there for several times and now this year everything else is good service is great but that salmon patty breakfast needs to be taken off the menu Wake Up America 
17140 4 The cruise was excellent and the staff was courteous and on there game. We enjoyed the cruise and would recommend to all. Becca was our server and she attended to our needs and always made sure it was I great night 
17141 3 Very fun location. Wait times for bowling alleys are up to 2 hours on weekend but there are pick up games to pas time. Drinks are too weak for me. 
17142 3 Very authentic and the recently put in some new decor to make the dining room more appealing. We tend to get tacos and horchata, they also have a buffet that is worth trying. 
17143 2 We pick this place out of convenience. Even with reservations if they are busy- know they will seat you 20 minutes or more past your reservation time. Food is decent and they try to be innovative. We like the mini dessert sampler. 
17144 3 Great place to eat for all you can eat lobster crab legs and prime ribs. Ask for waitress Kim she is the best I don't see how she can remember all her customers names but she is wonderful. Best of all enjoy. 
17145 4 Amazing authentic Italian pizza, outstanding wines, and exceptional personable service. Wish this was our local!!! 
17146 0 Unbelievably rude hostess No respect to customers. Server, Dani was the only reason for us to stay... The level of unprofessionalism and unpleasant look that the two hostesses gave are just horrible. I have never experienced this low level of customer service... 
17147 2 Good wine, good service, and we enjoyed the salumi which are basically cured meats. Definitely needs more food options. Good for a glass of wine and a light snack. 
17148 2 Server is really friendly. Food is decent. Atmosphere is authentic Mexican. 
17149 4 Even though the place is full of Main St hipsters *shudder*, this place totally rocks. The Johnny-O and the tortilla soup are amazing and a half and I love the refried bean option instead of black beans. The service is great and the prices are right. 
17150 0 It's 3:26 pm in Lexington, TX, with a 3:00 pm reservation. 26 High School students, most seniors, about to experience their last hoorah of high school. And where's the cherry bomb? Who know's because they won't answer the phone. 
17151 0 Older guy at the bar was absolutely a terrible and unfriendly person to deal with. So mean and making guests uncomfortable that we immediately left. Poor attitude and treated us first time customers like shit. This definitely isn't the friendliest pub in the hub. 
17152 4 Great staff that really listens and takes their time to give you a perfect haircut. Never rushed. 
17153 4 My friend just brought me here the other day and I am hooked. They have cornmeal and apple pancakes that are to die for. Their prices are great, service was friendly, the atmosphere is definitely that of NE Portland (small, earthy, comfortable, retro...). Two thumbs up for sure. 
17154 1 Horrible service. Training 2 waitresses on opening night of nfl?! Didn't get a drink for an hr. No condiments or toppings on sandwiches. Wings are "meh" And blue cheese tastes like it has sugar in it 
17155 0 If you're a bakery, and I show up to your shop 30 minutes after you open and you have zero baked good...ZERO BAKED GOODS AT A BAKERY!! FOH!! 
17156 4 I love this place. Buffalo. Chicken. Dip!!! Many alcohol. Great variety of beer. Burgers are huge. Sandwiches are great. That taco one that comes in a big taco shell though, not my thing. 
17157 2 Nice artsy cafe looks like they have rotating local artists frequently l. Lots more food options than I thought. Not many coffee bean/ tea options. Free water is a plus. And I like that they recycle. Wish they had guest WiFi for being a coffee shop. 
17158 3 I love this place! The burgers are so good and juicy here and the buns are always soft. It gets pretty busy on the weekends. Sometimes the line is out the door but it moves quickly. The burgers are reasonably priced but I think the milkshakes are a bit pricey. 
17159 4 Wow! Visiting Portland for business I had not found a decent NORMAL place to eat until I found this place. The food is so good and truly tastes homemade! Highly recommend! I will be back tomorrow! 
17160 2 Pretty good god for Italian. I had the Carbonara. It was a little oily but - what Italian food isn't. I will eat there again. The ambiance isn't high end. But it's worth the money and a gem. 
17161 3 Can't beat the fish tacos, friendly service, & waterfront location. Children also get treated well here with a trip to the treasure box & ice cream station. 
17162 0 Horrible service, way overpriced, food took over an hour to reach my table after I ordered and it was cold. Restaurant wasn't busy at all, at the time I attended. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. 
17163 4 Love the brunch and the fun drinks food was good and environment was fun. Cool little bar and good people FIRTS time in Canada and the spot a local recommended. Check it out 
17164 4 Thoroughly enjoyed the experience at the bar. Had the bacon wrapped dates, broccoli and fig and chorizo. All wonderful. Would not hesitate to come back here again for a nice dinner. I like the set up and overall ambiance 
17165 4 Great baked pastries. SO fresh and delish. The two barista in the pm were so nice. There coffee is all you need in the morning. It will really give you the whole day of energy. Chill vibe!!! 
17166 4 In town from LA, and needed a late night spot -- ideally one that was healthy. This was exactly that. I got the veggie Pad See Yew and a side of the veggie rolls. Wow. So fresh. So filling. Everyone in my party enjoyed their dishes as well! 
17167 3 There balsamic Brussels sprouts are amazing!! I could each so much of them. I like their beer guy dog as well- it's full of flavor. Their faux philly is very salty so I stay away from that. 
17168 4 Great place and very helpful. Hard to find a dealership that has some heart left and they do! Very impressive show room as well! Bought my vehicle there and I WOULD recommend family and friends to do the same! 
17169 4 awesomeness!!!! Their oreo cakebatter ice cream was to DIE FOR!!! After my first visit I swallowed my pride and waltzed my ass back in there with my head held high and calorie counter back home the very next day lol. The workers are very friendly! 
17170 3 Cute little upscale bar that has out door seating. The food is good and reasonably priced. Check it out!! 
17171 4 This place is wonderful! They are so friendly, and the DELIVER! Not to mention the falafel, grape leaves and stuffed cabbage are basically the greatest things ever to exist in the area.. WOW! If you're looking for great middle eastern food, you wont go wrong here! 
17172 4 Love this place!! Really good service!! The portions are HUGE!! I get the sho gun and you get rice or noodles, steak, shrimp and chicken!! Plus soup and salad!! Yum!!! Always tip your cook!! 
17173 4 Meisner FFA Class has taught me so much about acting and living truthfully in scenes. Grant Mcgowen is a great leader and his aproach to Meisner will challenge you while making you feel at home in his theatre, that produces amazing plays and independent film productions simultaneously. 
17174 3 I can't say I've tried many dishes I typically order the spicy chicken shawarma plate and am always extremely satisfied. Fast and friendly service. 
17175 4 Sylvia and her husband are extremely friendly and provide solid service. As another review noted, you don't need your ticket, they'll know you, and you'll be greeted with a warm, sincere smile. Great for dry cleaning, but I'll give the tip to take your alterations and tailoring elsewhere. 
17176 3 Delicious bread and sandwiches. My boyfriend had the French onion soup and it was also very good. Only downside was the staff weren't especially friendly but maybe it was an off day. Will def go back! 
17177 4 What a turnaround! The new owners have gone above and beyond in restoring Volente Beach Waterpark to a first rate, 5 star, family friendly destination. I would highly recommend a trip out to see the new and improved Volente Beach Waterpark. You won't regret it. Bravo. 
17178 4 All-around excellent. Very pretty interior and good ambiance. The food is great (I got the pad thai) and I've never had spring rolls as delicious or presented with such class as at L'Thai. Each is served in an individual glass holder with sauce. Perfect. 
17179 3 Try the rustica calebrese for an excellent non tomatoe based pasta dish. Crumbled italian sausage punctuates dish. 
17180 1 Not a fan. The food is below average in Thai, and the place doesn't seem very clean, to be honest. We usually love Thai food, but wanted to run away once we got the food. The lady who was serving us however was very nice, albeit a bit slow. 
17181 4 Read the other reviews. What else can be said. I went there for lunch and the tofu soup was excellent. Great complex flavor. You'll end up filling up on the large assortment of free apps which they continually refill. 
17182 4 Great because I always want crepes and my son wants bubble tea... Comfy couches, pool tables, great service, awesome local art on the walls. They play great music.. I love it here!!!! 
17183 2 If you like your gelato slightly airy and your pastries posh-work of art-French-style, this is your place. Personally I like denser gelato and more rustic, less sugary sweet pastries. I guess I'm an Italian-style unrefined (sugar) country bumpkin... 
17184 4 Charming and great quality gelato and desserts! Wish there was a bit more seating but it really is a great spot, good service and a wide variety of top notch gelato! My fav: scoop of chocolate and scoop of hazelnut! 
17185 4 Woke up with a flat, went in this morning and they were terrific. Immediately got my car on a lift, pulled off the tire and found a nail, and patched it up. The whole thing took 15 minutes and was totally affordable. 
17186 3 Yummy skewers. Ramen was good. Noodles not as springy and "que que" as it should be. Service was good. Love the decor! I would recommend this place for drinks, skewers, sushi and ambience. Place to just relax and enjoy some good noshing. 
17187 4 The food was excellent! I was a little disappointed at first when they wouldn't seat our brunch party because two girls were missing. Paul at the check-in stand was very accommodating and friendly though! He worked with us to find a great table. Thanks Paul! 
17188 4 I've been a few times, most of the times just to send a package or two with the labels already printed. People who work here are super friendly and fast. I especially liked Kevin; he seemed the friendliest out of the friendly bunch. 
17189 3 Very tasty cupcakes, the chocolate peanut butter is awesome as is the red velvet, which, unfortunately, they were out of. We tried the "midnight snack," which has caramel and pretzel pieces for the sweet and salty flavor bomb combo, but it was actually too sweet. 
17190 3 clean, spacious, surprisingly well-appointed rooms for the price. unfortunately, somewhat thin walls and floor plates contribute to a noisy experience. but the low room rates more than make up for the noise. 
17191 2 Staff was very nice. The spicy chicken wontons weren't spicy but sweet. Overall a little pricey for what you get. 
17192 1 Meh. The meat (ribs) should not have been so tough and chewy. The flavor was really nice but I like my braised ribs less chewy. The atmosphere was a little high brow. Weird for east portland. Probably won't go back. Pricey. 
17193 4 Stumbled on this breakfast joint while walking around Portland. I loved that we were seated immediately since most Portland breakfast joints are extremely crowded (usually over 1 hour wait). My family and I enjoyed everything. The food and service were lovely! 
17194 3 A solid option for breakfast -- the wait was pretty short for a Saturday morning and peak brunch time, and there was coffee while you waited. My group all ordered different items and most were quite good -- the biscuit with jam, though, was especially worth getting. 
17195 2 Just your standard diner/breakfast place. The times that I've been here I usually order eggs, sausage, and pancakes. Service is prompt but not overly friendly. It's definitely outdated and not much in terms of atmosphere. But it's an okay place to stop by for a quick breakfast. 
17196 2 Great beer (Hammerhead), good food. The food is 'good.' Not bad, but not great. Tends to be on the greasy/oily side a lot of times. But the beer is outstanding. Worth going for the Hammerhead. 
17197 3 This place is normally busy bc of their Awesome food and drinks My boyfriend even likes this place lol. I wished I still stayed close so I could go often. 
17198 3 Really good sandwiches and fast service, in my opinion way better than other sub places. 
17199 4 I got in late to my hotel and walked in to get a light dinner. I got an amazing house salad topped with a chicken burger patty! It was fresh, delicious and the service was wonderful! 
17200 2 Good food. Slow service. Maybe Wednesday night isn't the best time to come. Maybe a heavier staff on nights when Magic is playing would be a good idea. 
17201 4 First things first, their dark chocolate mocha is the reason I go to Ava's. They have wonderful dessert choices, loose leaf teas, and sandwiches. Nice ambiance, free wifi, and they are a stones throw away from other things to do at Progress Ridge. 
17202 4 I had my car fixed at the Natick, MA location of Coach and Carriage. They did a great job! On time and on budget. I would definitely recommend using this place if you need body work done! 
17203 1 Typical college bar. Creepy guys, cheap booze, alcohol soaked floors. 
17204 4 Their vegan flatbread is amazing, and so are their brussel sprouts! Definitely a place worth going to. 
17205 3 This place is a hidden gem. The Indian food is great; tasty, nicely spiced, decently priced. This is my new go-do for delivery night! 
17206 4 Liz is the most helpful clerk in Orlando area. She is the only one who can find the handbag my wife is looking for. Her attitude of assistance and the knowledge of system operation explained what professionalism is. 
17207 3 Love this place! Get the habibi salad! You won't be disappointed! Out of the way a little bit from other restaurants but it's very worth the trip 
17208 3 Pretty good Chinese food in revere, second I would say Peter woos. I like that I can get orange chicken in my combination plate! Friendly people who work there. Good food and price... 
17209 3 Kids love this place but I am not sure they are any better than other donut shops and worth the line 
17210 4 This tour is amazing fun. Our tour guide was Scott. He shared a lot about the school, famous people who attended and wonderfully funny tidbits that no one would know unless you were a student. I would highly recommend this tour. 
17211 4 This place is phenominal.... Try the 2 combo for dinner (only $12), where you get two choices, along with salad and rice! The 3 combo is only $3 more!! The salmon terriyaki is amazing... as well as all the sushi on the menu! Atmosphere A+++ Great for dates! 
17212 3 A great place to go. Giant portions of quality good. Great Service. Med prices for what you get Breakfast my favorite inlets are awesome ! 
17213 4 Man, this place is so much better than Office Max! It's organized better, WAY cheaper and had everything I needed. 
17214 4 Awesome for brunch, great variety of good old fashioned home-cooked breakfasts with a fine-dining tweaks 
17215 2 Just a quick update to say we tried Greek Flame again and it was so much better and much better service! Will try to write more later but glad we went back. 
17216 4 I'm a huge fan now. Good atmosphere, great food, and great late night. A true gem in back bay / fenway. 
17217 4 Everything here is amazing. All of the meats come locally from Pono Farms. Come with a date and order many plates so you can share. Sushi, steak, cocktails, sake, it's all delicious!! Can't wait to come back 
17218 2 The food was really good. I like the ambiance of the place. The price point is a little bit too much for the amount of food. Friendly staff. 
17219 4 So great to leave the trail and tourists and find amazing food, great beer and fun vibe. Waffles are way worth the detour. 
17220 0 To each his own, I walked in here the staff looked at me like I had five heads. I told my lady-friend, "lets go." 
17221 4 My mom, my friend and I came here for a meal before heading over to the Keller Auditorium and I will be coming back! The food was very good prices were reasonable and the staff was very friendly. The view is also a plus. 
17222 3 When the chowder is good, it's likely the rest will follow suit. Big sandwiches, varied menu, casual atmosphere, something for everyone. A great find and a great start to a week in the Boston area. I recommend the colossal crab sandwich. 
17223 0 Unless you have hours on your hands for a basic dinner, go elsewhere instead of waiting 40 minutes for a simple kabob plate. Terrible service. 
17224 0 Awesome food and would get a higher rating, but terrible wait staff that has an attitude. Just stopped by and was refused by the host to put my name down because the wait is an hour long. 
17225 3 Classic Harvard Square. Profs and their peers. Alums with their kids. Great for upscale lunch or dinner. 
17226 4 Blue Star is hands down the best donut in Portland. Blueberry bourbon basil is a must try! 
17227 3 It was our first time in and everything was very good! Love the fresh chips! Shannon was a great server and made it an enjoyable lunch! Thank you! We will be back! 
17228 2 This is one of my favourite soup place but service always ruin the the reputation of the restaurant. Could use customer service training for staff. 
17229 4 Had The. Corned Beef and Cabbage it was delicious. You should try it if you love corned beef you could cut it with a fork so tender 
17230 4 I thought the guys here were excellent. I came in with specific needs for a couch and the guys quickly helped me find what I needed. No hassle or haggling, just friendly people. Will definitely go back! 
17231 4 Great burgers and peanut butter is right on it's place in PB and Bacon Burger. Fries are average, but their cream of brocolly soup is something to dine for :) 
17232 4 Absolutely phenomenal pizza. Service was excellent and the price was good for artisan pizza. I had the good pepperoni and it was covered in pepperoni. The taste was amazing as well. I'd have liked the crust a little crispier but it was incredible even as it was. 
17233 4 Truly amazing school. Wealth of classes available. They really work with you to fit what you want into your track. Everyone is so nice in Boston. Pleasantly surprised. Honor to attend! 
17234 4 I got my 2nd cut here not too long ago. She's consistent. I'll be back for a Trim in a few more days. 
17235 4 Best stuff your face Chinese food I have ever had. I used to go to the first location they had on Fourth Plain. Great customer service then and still is. It is a must if you are really hungry. 
17236 4 Place was just solid all around, was out in Austin on business swung by for a cocktails and food wasn't disappointed. Met Gabriela, she's awesome, cares about the guests and the food that comes out. Drink up, eat up and enjoy 
17237 1 The staff and venue is great. Will update to five stars if my beloved mozzarella sticks are added back on the menu. 
17238 3 Love the specialty sandwiches. Great to casual place and have a beer or wine. Nice place to hang with friends, eat and drink. Just like a neighborhood pub 
17239 0 Worst dealer I have ever experiencd.. Don't ever buy any car from this dealer. Sales and financial departments are just horrible. Even the general manager doesn't follow through.. Just horrible, but love the car, Hyundai sante fe!! 
17240 4 Super delicious crepes! This totally hit the spot for dessert. They also have great options on bubble tea and some cool Japanese hot dogs. The roaming area is huge with many games available. Perfect spot for a date or even just to hang with some friends. 
17241 3 I come here twice a month for a gel manicure and a pedicure and wouldn't go anywhere else. They also do a fantastic job, the shop is clean and tidy and everyone is really friendly. 
17242 4 Kappy's World of Liquors. This place is a virtual oasis of booze. The store is massive and the prices are great. If you can't find it here, it probably doesn't exist. This location is much larger than other Kappy's locations. Well worth the trip. 
17243 4 Great cocktails, great service, great ambiance! The host and servers are lovely and prompt in greeting the guests. They have a loft upstairs good for private party. *this is highly recommended and way better than the pretentious BB place next door! 
17244 4 Super nice !!! The food was excellent !!! Drinks were super !! The salad bar is 7 Stars as well as the service .. Simply awsome !! 
17245 2 The Jajangmyeon noodles entree is decent. The service is poor. I will not be returning. 
17246 4 My boss took me a few weeks back and I had the Beef Bahi mi. It was amazing. Upon his recommendation, I had the pork as well. Needless to say, I had it two days in a row. So amazing. Try this place!! 
17247 1 Once again, they tried but didn't fix the problem and once again, I fixed it myself after picking it up unfixed. And they're still nice people to work with. Although this time they told me this computer's time was up ... but I'm still using it happily. 
17248 4 My go to BBQ in Austin. Everything is fantastic...brisket, turkey, sausage with the beef rib the best I've ever had. They have 3 different BBQ sauces although not needed as the meat simply melts in your mouth. Top notch service as well. I highly recommend! 
17249 4 The Food and desserts are amazing. The only thing better than the food was our server Laura D. She made the experience so much better with her attentiveness and personality. I don't think I've ever had better service or food. 
17250 2 Service fine. Very Americanized taste. All sweat everything. If you want to try authentic Asian food, try somewhere else. 
17251 4 Super professional service, install and sale. I got their 850 cca battery for my f-150 that has lots of extra auxiliary power sources. 
17252 4 Indeed a 5 restaurant love this place. very good food, and very sweet friendly people. 
17253 2 Two big parking lots at the back! Dim sum is quite standard shrimp dumplings pork dumplings etc. Also mango dessert - a mango mousse vs a mango pudding really - is delicious!! Service is surprisingly very attentive (weekday not super full). Not bad at all! 
17254 4 Best marinated beef ribs money can buy. Love everything I buy there and they always have service with a smile. Whenever I visit Portland, Gartner's is on the top of the list to visit for our BBQs 
17255 4 Excellent dining experience. The wait staff are knowledgeable and classy. The food is exquisite! The raw bar menu has a high-quality, fresh, selection. I love the lobster gnocci! 
17256 3 Nice ambience and good drink deals during happy hour. The happy hour food menu was filled with yummy choices at good prices. The oyster shooter was the best ever and so was the soft baked pretzel with truffle aioli. My mouth is watering as I type! 
17257 4 Great steaks and crab cakes! Best carrot cake ever and I don't even like carrot cake! Have never had a bad experience here! 
17258 4 Great, cheap happy hour. I was floored many a night from 10+ $4 martinis, leaving me a wreck and asleep on our patio. Good times. 
17259 4 Fantastic! The best of all the Ethiopian restaurants in Atlanta in my opinion. 
17260 4 This was everything we could have hoped for. The friendliest of staff , portion just right and kawl jazz , what more could the urban eatery be ? The could use better signage though , a little gem of a find if you look in the right place ! 
17261 3 This is our go-to spot for movie viewing. Love this place. I always get the pizza and an IPA on tap. Can't imagine going to any other theatre now that I'm spoiled with eating and drinking at Alamo Drafthouse. 
17262 1 It's ok. Not a lot of meat to chose from. Majority of the choices are vegetables and salads. The price $28.30 for 2 ppl is slightly reasonable for a tourist area but doesn't align with the limited variety. Service was good and prompt. 
17263 4 This place is great for some quick and cheap take out. The food is flavorful and delicious, I got the small curry chicken meal and the portion was huge. The small size honestly looks the same or even bigger than the large size. 
17264 0 They don't wear gloves. I think that should be enough explanation. I don't understand how you can handle cash and then prep my food after. Absolutely gross. Not just that, but who knows if they're sick on top of that. Yeah no thanks. Coffee is good though. 
17265 4 Mandy's Beauty is fantastic! Such a great deal for a high quality facial experience. The treatment was super relaxing and very thorough, my skin felt and looked incredible afterward. Worth every dollar! 
17266 3 This place has the system down! The girls are awesome, they kept the rotation and the place was clean. You could comfortably sit at one table/stage and have all the ladies come to you. Thank you 205!! 
17267 4 This is a lovely place to eat outside when the weather is warm. The beer was excellent, my steak was ... phenomenal! The mashed potatoes and asparagus that came with it were delectable. It was pricey, but well worth it. 
17268 4 Incredible food. Fresh ingredients, great taste, excellent value for money. We sat outside on the picnic table (only 3 tables inside)...still nice and shady even at 1pm. Highly recommended! 
17269 2 Business hours are incorrect. Shop closes at 8pm on M - Sat and at 7pm on sundays. Food is average but my go to for quick Vietnamese food in Chinatown. 
17270 4 Been here twice. The dinners, appetizers and beers on tap are excellent. Recommend it. One of my favorite places being in florida. Owners are very nice and the whole crew. Chef Charlie is a excellent chef. Thanks for a good time 
17271 2 Dropped by on a chilly winter day for lunch - the veggie sandwich was healthy and hearty. Great ambience, great food. Looking forward to checking it out at night. 
17272 0 This place is not well taken care of. Our bathroom had mold on the ceiling and our room had mold on the ceiling where the meets the ceiling. Black mold to be exact. Very run down dirty motel. Beds are not comfortable we woke up feeling very sore. 
17273 1 I can't even describe the customer service here....WOW. The worst. Food is just ok. I'll be headed to Mangos next time. 
17274 4 Wow! A perfectly unpretentious room; sublime and sincere service; an exciting selection of interesting wines; adventurous food that stops short of being experimental; a superb selection of after dinner drinks...my kind of place. 
17275 0 Flies in my water, slow service and food tasted like frozen... Enough said! I had to take my parents to another tea place, it was THAT bad. 
17276 3 They started a little late. But definitely worth the wait! The scare zones were awesome! Honestly one of the best haunted houses! 
17277 4 Very fresh, simple, yummy. Their menu is limited but all really solid choices. I had the wonton soup and it was light and hearty. My roommate had pork dumplings and beef soup. Definitely will be back! The cafe is a great addition to the neighborhood. 
17278 4 Fantastic, organic and natural sandwiches and infused waters! Service was quick, friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely try the spicy macaroni salad! 
17279 2 Solid food, nothing spectacular, my burger was good but my fries were soggy from the juices from the burger. Mozzarella sticks were an awesome appetizer, very good, i def recommend them. 
17280 0 The worst buffet, you can imagine. Years back it was Stacey's Buffet, it was good. Management changed and it just went downhill. Don't waste your money. 
17281 3 Took advantage of Memorial Day evening since it is usually loud, crowded. Very laid back tonight with good selection of music playing. enjoyed the limted edition, Icarus, Sichuan Hibiscus and Mama mimi"s pizza. You can also bring in your own food. 
17282 2 Excellent location and Decor. Very good service and attentive staff. Food and drinks were average and the lamb was bit over priced. Good place to try for the first time if you are not used to Mediterranean food. 
17283 4 Fantastic! One of my favorite restaurants in Columbus. Wish there was a New Albany/ Westerville location. 
17284 4 Love Heidi and all the color work she does on my hair. Best balayage ever. Super friendly and accommodating and love the vibe at this place. 
17285 4 This place really produces quality seafood. If you are going to contribute to depleting our oceans resources it really should be with quality seafood. Good fish and chips are unfortunately rare. Great place! 
17286 2 Don't understand the hype! 45 minute wait for a burger that tasted more like meatloaf to me and my wife. Enjoyed the experience but the food was just so-so and pretty pricey. Take a drive-thru P-Terry's instead! 
17287 1 This place is not that great. Their stuff are more expensive compared to other bakery in chinatown. The service is not too good either. 
17288 0 Of course my feedback has noting to do with the food! I have not tried any because the sales man was so rude, and I decided to leave without order. 
17289 4 Such a homey little place near Tufts that serves as a quiet getaway for books or just catching up on email. Really enjoy their latte. 
17290 0 Brutally slow service. While waiting to get drinks I created an account and made this review. Only 1 bar tender on so it's impossible to get a drink. And 5 empty tables even though there is an hour wait for bruch. Don't waste your time 
17291 3 Excellent strudel!! Now get great coffee in that place , teach the kid in the front how to make it properly, and I'll be there everyday!! 4 stars for the strudel alone 
17292 4 Soft opening tomorrow, first location in Florida, one of my Good friends, opening this location. This is the salmon ball filled with crab meat and cucumber, yum 
17293 4 I really, really enjoyed this place. The service was pleasant, the food was tasty, and the margaritas were better than what I usually have. The bartender was super cool with adjusting to my taste, which is appreciated. Did I mention the hot Aussies too? Yeah, there were hot Aussies. 
17294 3 Pretty ok ramen, it was nice and hot, they had different sizes, wish they would have had better broth portions. 
17295 4 This five star is for the best damn drink ive ever had in my life. When you come here get a RED catus bowl to share with your lady. IF you two arent buttered up order another and get down! 
17296 4 Great place awesome pour overs, they self roast all there beans. I was worried about finding a good cup since I recently moved but they just opened up and they really know there stuff on par with counter culture. 
17297 2 Very basic bar food. Was expecting something a little more unique given the place's history. I had the mussels, which were completely dry, no sauce/juice to sop up (often the best part). I've never seen anyone mess mussels up that bad....Just an average bar in an old building. 
17298 3 Great bread and pastries. Lots of choices and a great spot to sit and read while sipping on some coffee or having lunch with a friend. 
17299 1 Great atmosphere and location. The service was great and the wait for the table reasonable. The food tasted fine. Unfortunately, spent the night writhing from food poisoning. 
17300 4 Looks like a nice little mom and pop place. Cash only, but there's an ATM at the smoke shop across the street. There are seats to enjoy out front if you like. Every time I go, I get the Dirty Pig!! So delicious!! But plenty to choose from 
17301 4 Delish vegan doughnuts! I had double chocolate and chocolate peanut butter. Drop coffee was perfect. Highly recommend! 
17302 4 Great service today my 3 year and I went to check this place out! I was greeted warmly. I ordered the soup which was beyond delicious and my daughter had a crepe. They were both really wonderful 
17303 4 Super cute & upscale, nice place for a drink with friends ! The menu is very diverse and the atmosphere is perfect! I stay around the corner so I think I've found a new late night spot! 
17304 2 Food was okay. Hummus was good. The grilled shrimp was way overcooked and the rice was nothing special. 
17305 3 Pretty good! Excellent choices for vegetarian. Fast service. Highly recommend it! Will definitely go again especially on a cold day. 
17306 4 i went there already severe time , lunch and dinner and i can tell this one of the sushi place that i want to hangout the restaurant atmosphere make you feel so welcome , all the staff so friendly and the sushi quality are very good with reasonable prices 
17307 1 What the &$?! is this low fat nonsense? Sigh I get it, I get it... It's low fat. But why you no taste good? Why? Lentil soup why did you scare the salt away? Why?? I'm sorry :( I really wanted to be friends. 
17308 3 DELICIOUS. This place is literally packed with mouthwatering food. Just go and check it out! You will NOT be disappointed. It's one of the best places on dumpy Kingsway. 
17309 0 From the moment you walk you feel like you are inconveniencing the staff. Don't bother wasting your money. 
17310 0 The pork flatbread sandwich had several-days-old pulled pork in it. The house soup had broth that was either vinegar-laden or several days old, too. It was sour and almost unedible. 
17311 3 This is an excellent Chick-fil-A location. It is very clean and the people are friendly. 
17312 1 Not impressed. The soup was very watery. It was okay to try but not a come-back place for sure. 
17313 4 I absolutely adore Bella and the service she provides. Always friendly, always smiling, and very knowledgeable! She helped me get thru my first tanning experience and now I prefer to come tan when she's working! Thanks Bella! Always be you, don't change bc you're awesome! 
17314 4 My girlfriend and I are regulars here. The food is just awesome. Have tried a number of things on their menu; Burgers, fish&chips, grill chicken breast, meatloaf, pot pie, etc. etc. They NEVER disappoint. I don't pass out 5 stars easily... 
17315 3 Good Quality Sushi and Decent Price! I went for a lunch fast and friendly Japanese couple. The place is well maintained and clean. Good quality Sushi. Professional service its hard to find sushi places like that. 
17316 3 Best food been going there since my son was born he and he and I love it. My entire family does actually Not only does it bring real Brazilian pastries to an american community its in a convinient spot. 
17317 0 Bourgeois coffee for the Cambridge elite. Don't know how to make an Americano. Too bright and clean to be trusted. Will need a ciggie after. 
17318 0 Got the club, meat was really processed. Got the steak teriyaki, meat was really fatty and i was sick for a few days! 
17319 4 Best casual sushi stop I've ever been to. Droppped by once after work on the skytrain and another time with the partner. Both times, I was not dissappointed and pleasantly surprised at the flavors offered and aburi options! 
17320 1 Skip the guac, unless you don't mind paying 1.95$ for a spritz ..everything else was pleasant. 
17321 4 Woods Hill Table hosted our small wedding and I could not have asked for better food, service, and atmosphere. Everything was perfect, including the best oysters I've ever had and phenomenal wine! Hope to stop by here in the future for an intimate dinner with my new husband. 
17322 3 Awesome experience. The fajitas for two was enough for three and tasted great. Margaritas are good, and happy hour every day from 11-7. Looked clean and classy too. 
17323 4 The barrelman has unbelievable food and service. It is one of my favorite places in Marblehead for a bite and a beer. Always feel welcome and have fun here. Chris the bartender is the best guy, so funny and welcoming and entertaining. Highly recommend it here. Burgers are amazing 
17324 3 Ordered special lasagna, one serve that take me two meals to finish! Huge but tastes good! Though I wish to be more sauces 
17325 0 Very bad experience, i have been there twice, i was sit there for almost half hour, nobody come to ask me order any drink and food. 
17326 3 Good Mexican food.... we had assorted tacos, kids had Mac and Cheese and burger. Margarita were good. Good place to go with family if you are in the resorts and don't want to pay the resort prices. I would go back. 
17327 3 Great place for brunch. I loved the little waffles and chocolate - yummy!! Looking forward to going again soon. 
17328 4 I was on a Segway tour in downtown Portland. The tour guide told us about this awesome donuts spot. Well guess what? It was amazing and I loved the recommendation so much that my tour guide also got donuts from me. 
17329 3 Good Hawaiian comfort food! Had the mix plate - kalbi ribs & Kalua pork with side of yakisoba noodles & curry macaroni salad. The ribs and noodles were the best part of the meal! Left feeling stuffed and brought home leftovers. 
17330 3 I sometimes try other sub shops but always end up back here. The California turkey sub, a specialty sub, cannot be competed with. It's AWESOME!! The chicken salad is delish, too. Just the right amount of salt which makes me happy. 
17331 1 Just had sesame chicken it was dry, and I didn't care for it. Had to ask several times for the eggroll I ordered. My friends said their roast pork was perfectly done. I will not be going back. 
17332 4 Had an AMAZING time. Harold Pierre was incredible. We stopped in towards the end of our time in Boston and our quick experience there was the highlight of our trip. Thank you Pierre for your kindness and hospitality. Can't wait to come back! 
17333 3 Always a breakfast treat. A staple when we are in Boulder. I wish there was a location in my town. Servers are excellent, personable, and chatty. 
17334 4 Great food: The decor is BEAUTIFUL and the live music really set the mood. The whole atmosphere is relaxing. The service was just a little slow, but not too bad. 
17335 4 Great cold brew coffee and vegetarian bagel sandwiches. The spicy bagel is really hot, but enjoyable if you're into that! 
17336 4 One of our favorites in the couv. Always delicious and reasonably priced. Staff if responsive and nice. Crowd is a bit older and yuppy. 
17337 4 Realize this is a small cafe local hang out. But wow the food was a big surprise. Lots of flavor and tons of quality and great value to boot. Everything is made from scratch. Simple awesome and a place I will run back to. 
17338 4 Muy buena atención excelentes servicios.muy recomendable para familias.detalles que te harán sentir bien y personal muy atento en los detalles 
17339 4 My favorite hangout, great music, unpretentious cool people and cheep PBR. Besides the concerts, The most fun nights are "Heroes"(80ies Party) and "xMortis"(Goth) 
17340 4 Booked conveniently online. Received a call to confirm the next day. And was all waxed by 6 pm the next night. Clean and Wonderful place. Waxing was so fast!!! Will go back for sure!!! 
17341 0 Terrible. Waited forever and then found out they lost my order. Remade it different than originally ordered. At best food is subpar. Coffee is tolerable. 
17342 2 Chaos with the kitchen staff and the kitchen floor was garbage everywhere. 25 mins waited for the food and the food was mediocre. 
17343 4 Awesome awesome awesome. Service is exceptional and friendly. I have never bought a bike from them but they do all my service work on my Norco that I bought at another shop. My next bike purchase will absolutely be from JRA. Keep up the good work 
17344 2 i had a burger. my wife had some kind of Mediterranean chicken wrap. it was good. 
17345 0 Terrible!!! Tried to sell me a pizza that had spinach thrown on top of it. Completely unacceptable. 
17346 4 Set#2 with Donkatsu Ramen. Perfect. Service is super nice. The food is awesome. Food comes out slow. Worth the wait. 
17347 4 If Santarpios isn't the best pizza in the area, its definitely in the top two or three. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! 
17348 0 Mississippi location. 7:50pm. Waiting a half hour while two staff leave to take their break. I normally love Bishops, but this is ridiculous. 
17349 4 Really good! I had the pork belly, falafel and veracruz fish with plantains. Fantastic! I'll definitely be going back! 
17350 3 Had a wonderful evening last night at Woods Hill Table from a great bottle of Pinot Blanc wine to delicious asparagus app to spaghetti, and gnocchi we shared! All tasty, but just a slight bit salty. We'll definitely be back soon! 
17351 3 Didn't like the marquee sign out front, looked cheap and appeared to be a strip club or something. However, the food was good and the beer was great! Outdoor seating was comfortable! Service was great! Wings were descent, jalapeño bacon wrapped skewers were good! 
17352 4 These people do their job well !!! I usually take a cafe macchiato. The shot is pulled just right, the milk is steamed not too hot and the proportions are perfect. 
17353 2 great pizza bagels when they're hot...all the bagels are good when they are hot and not sitting there for a while the red head behind the counter is sure to drive business away. he's an arrogant f*ck 
17354 2 Long ass wait and small portions. Good food and friendly staff. Just go once and call it good. 
17355 4 Excelente comida. Lo mejor que eh probado en Estados Unidos y el servicio de Fari excepcional. Totalmente recomendable 
17356 4 Great service, great people, great selection!! I was in need of some last min party favor ribbon and came here. It was such a neat experience! I would go back for so many more projects! They will help you find what you need at a GREAT price! 
17357 2 Food was OK. Ordered the Donnie burger medium, and received it well done. Once I picked it up it fell apart. The burger was good, but not great. The sweet potato tots were cold side. Disappointed thought it would be better. 
17358 0 A run-down shack where you have to go to two separate bars to get your $6+tip drink. If you want to donate to charity, just donate directly to them! There's a concept. 
17359 4 Come here every week! Great food. The service is always friendly and they always remember you. There chicken and waffles and wings are the best. A must stop!!! 
17360 4 Love that place! Have been going there for a year now. From food I only order sushi and it's really good. Service is very nice, once forgot my money and they told me to pay later! Great sushi, surrounding, and people:P 
17361 4 Lovely neighborhood cafe. I've done breakfast and lunch and both have been delicious. 
17362 2 I wan't very impressed. I ordered Curry Chicken without bell pepper because I'm allergic to them. I also ordered Crab Angle. The Curry was so bland and they put some sort of red sauce on it. Curry should be yellow and spicy!The Crab Angle was tough and chewy, not crisp. 
17363 4 Nice little neighborhood bar. Great location. No frills - it a dive bar but certainly not fancy either. Cash only. Has good food. 
17364 3 Food is great, we ordered Oyster Hash and Olympia Ham Sandwich. It's just the wait that makes the hungry ones even more hungry. We waited for 20 minutes for a table and half a hour for the dishes. So those come for brunches better bring some cookies with them. 
17365 2 Not the greatest Chinese although they have killer General Gau's, and not the best sushi although I love their spicy tuna rolls, it's the convenience of having both Japanese and Chinese food under one roof more than anything that makes this my go to take out place. 
17366 3 They have nice food and drinks. I know this place is a little bit pricy, but I don't really care about 1 extra dollar for crepes near my house. The lady is always nice, I like her. 
17367 4 Queso and breakfast tacos on a Saturday afternoon! Mmmmmmm.... I love that they have breakfast all day, not usually super packed. Awesome weekend breakfast option! Full bar if that's your thing too. And a patio! 
17368 3 Weekday bartenders are great. I like ordering sushi from next door while my boyfriend eats the cajun stuff. 
17369 4 Lunch specials are nice and include soda. We ordered delivery, food was delivered hot and fresh. Definitely ordering from here only in this area, as the bourbon chicken was excellent and chicken and broccoli was great! Portions are HUGE! Loved it! 
17370 3 Qdoba's often overshadowed by Anna's, but it definitely holds its own. The line is often long at lunch time, but it moves fast. The ingredients taste fresh-- the burritos are great. Get a annoyingly named "Q Card" and get pretty good rewards--a free chips and salsa just for signing up. 
17371 3 They have a really great fake meat BBQ rib sandwich. It makes me really pleased. 
17372 4 Have ordered the lasagna and chicken Parmesan both times I've eaten here. Absolutely wonderful food. I would like to try something else but can't resist my favorites. 
17373 4 Needed carpeting cleaned before holiday. Based on yelp rating Peace Frog was the best. They did not disappoint. James was great. Did an excellent job getting staircase clean and getting pet stains out. Will definitely use again! 
17374 4 Sushi Karis is amazing, and the people who run it are the kindest individuals ever. I have nothing but love for the entire experience at Sushi Karis =) 
17375 4 Great frittatas, chorizo is my favorite. Coffee is a diner brew. Service was slow on the shoulder season. Cozy atmosphere. Def going back. 
17376 4 I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly the owner replied and understood my concerns. Thank you and if I need plumbing services in the future I will give you a call. 
17377 0 Too long of a wait for chicken bites. This is NOT the place to go if in a rush - learned the hard way!! 
17378 4 Best donuts in the city... esp the basil one ! Sometimes they run out though so you have to go in the morning 
17379 4 Tried and true! I had lunch here yesterday and it was great. I have been going here for years and it's always fresh and delicious. The staff is always super friendly too. 
17380 4 I love this place. I've tried tons of different things and liked all of it. The people are very friendly, and it's great to have a family-owned business on my street. 
17381 4 This store is very nice. Has everything! The staff are very friendly and helpful! Will go back again for future home/hardware needs 
17382 2 Friendly and clean establishment. I ordered my usual thai ice tea with boba. The tea was a little weak and boba pearls seemed smaller. 
17383 3 Perfect dive bar meets hamburger joint. Stiff drinks, low price, and delicious burgers and tots. Oh yeah, they've got tots. Great place to meet with friends for happy hour. 
17384 3 Decent buffet for chinese. Alot of choices for food. Service was good and hibachi grill was good. 
17385 3 Food and service is awesome ! Cumin lamb is the best here :) also look out for manny- great friendly waiter there :) 
17386 4 These guys are very knowledgeable, professional and have reasonable prices. I have used them multiple times. 
17387 4 always buy my beans from Luck Bros. was in the area and had time for came away with new wall hanging. great friendly staff. thank you, andy. owe you a cuppa sometime. 
17388 3 Wow! Girlfriend drug me here for breakfast and I was expecting the worst. Shockingly delightful it turns out! Delicious fluffy feta omelet and buttermilk pancakes just the right texture. a little pricey. 
17389 4 These guys are awesome!!! They're really nice and polite and they patched my tire for no charge. 
17390 4 The aburi combo are the best rolls I have ever tasted. OMG! The place to go for excellent sushi in Vancouver. 
17391 4 Best coffee in town! Awesome staff, conveniently close to my office - 5 stars indeed 
17392 3 Not a fan of order at counter but food was excellent and atmosphere was casual cool. Pernil sandwhich is crazy good 
17393 1 The dinning room is a mess. Employees just standing around... I even said something about it, and still nothing was done. The place is a mess. Check out the photos! I give it two stars because the drinks are good, but not always consistent. 
17394 4 I have been to over 20 planet fitness' across USA, this is probably the best. 3 Squat Racks, dumbbells goes up to 75lb, over 20000 sq ft, nice bathrooms... C'mon Man Best PF in Mass hands down. 
17395 4 Shake shack is bae. Always so delicious, glad they finally opened one in OTP. Definitely a little pricey for a fast food lunch, but I can't resist the milkshakes... I always ask for a salted caramel chocolate combo. And the secret shack sauce in the burgers is divine. 
17396 4 Amazing food and an awesome bartender we met named Evan. His only flaw is being a KC Royals fan, but other than that, Lucca is a great restaurant, especially if you are looking for a great wood fired pizza. 
17397 4 Great store. Helpful staff and fun products. Had a great experience shopping here. Quick service, no high pressure commission salespeople. Really enjoy the ever changing inventory 
17398 3 "This thing is huge, loved every moment of it. Views of the city were unreal." - Ansel Ponce Diama 
17399 4 Helpful service and huge portions - not only did I find everything yummy my Venezuelan friend did too! Definitely try a mojito with passion fruit 
17400 3 Great Burgers and amazing service. Had a great burger and the wait was not that bad. Fri night to Sunday it gets busy, so expect longer wait times to get in. Very cool patio and interior 
17401 0 Known to not the employees! Very unprofessional cars are not cleaned. Not a good honest company!!! Look for another way of transportation. 
17402 4 Unbelievably delicious pizza...it blows donatos away!! Their subs are excellent too.. Definitely give them a try the next time you crave some pizza! 
17403 3 It's nice place to have quick bite. I was there late but they were open till 12 midnight. Nice service. Thank you 
17404 4 It was not Remedys fault but Samsungs. Sorry about that review. Should of changed it sooner. 
17405 3 Delicious but the wait was way too long... Service was friendly and very helpful as far as selections and things to do while in town. Cute area and a good community vibe... 
17406 3 Went for a walk in this neighborhood because we wanted something different than 23rd. Didn't try the coffee here but tried the pies which were great and the ginger lemonade which was also great. The atmosphere was a nice relaxing place to stop in for a rest and refreshment. 
17407 4 FUN..FUN..FUN... Went two weeks in a row. Looking forward to next visit. Party trolly to Doyle's for lunch/dinner...A MUST. 
17408 4 Probably the best Indian restaurant in surrey. Service is fast but not very friendly. Food is fabulous.. 
17409 4 Any bar that has the periodic table of elements on the wall and board games is pretty fuckin' rad if you ask me. Not to mention the fabulous high octane beers. 
17410 3 We waited 45 min on a Monday afternoon. the food was delish. We had their paella, not like the typical Spanish ones but the flavour and type of rice hard was really good together. Also had their short rib dish and waffles which was really good as well. 
17411 4 I will appreciate that if Dapper & Wise can change their music into some relaxing music. The coffee and setting are very good. But people cannot hear each other or focus on studying. 
17412 4 These guys have been around for quite some time, and for a great reason! Thanks for helping my commercial customers, you are all just so wonderful. 
17413 2 Good pizza but when you order online make sure to double check what you pick up. Ordered one pizza and got something similar but not what I ordered. Good for the price when you get what you pay for. 
17414 3 Great tap list and great selection in the bottle shop. We make sure to stop here every time we are in town. 
17415 4 I had the best croissant I've ever had here. I lived in France for half a year, so I've eaten a ridiculous amount of croissants and pastries. Also their buttermilk breakfast sandwich is out of this world. 
17416 2 Good food, but not the best service. I went about a month ago and they were pretty understaffed. I think they just need to hire some more servers in order to attend to their customers on a busy evening! 
17417 4 I love this place. Cute decor! Love the food and the staff! Good smoothies too 
17418 4 The empanadas and arepa are amazing. Family owned and great service (shout out to Shane). The spicy cilantro sauce will blow your mind. A unique and friendly experience. 
17419 3 Fun place, especially during happy hour or "smiley" hour as they call it. Cute seating arrangements. Pretty good selection of beer and some different mixed drinks. The wings are delicious. not sure if good for takeout, but definitely worth a try. 
17420 4 I grant thee 5 Ho-Mans. Braised short rib benny? That'll win me over any day especially when it's done so well. 2 Ho-Mans. Yukon nugget hash? Succulent and crispy and flavourful. Perfect brunch mode. 2 more Ho-Mans. Awesome drink selection? Yes sirree! Add another Ho-Man! Ding ding ding ding ding 
17421 4 Had the tiramisu and a cappuccino. The coffee was average and the dessert tasted moist and had coffee flavor. It's right across the street from the pizza place. You can sit outside here and eat your pizza too. 
17422 3 I liked this hotel. It was clean and fairly cheap. The breakfast had lots of selection, but the usual hotel fare. The hotel is big, there are tons of rooms. Also, they accept pets. 
17423 3 Reed the reviews on Yelp and stopped in and got a pie to go. Did not disappoint. Very tasty thin crust pizza. Value was good as well. Nice friendly owners. 
17424 4 Excellent service. Relaxing atmosphere. Modern decor. Esquisite meals. Can't say enough good things about this place. 
17425 4 Ate here for a business meeting at the recommendation of my local contact; tried the Patacon - amazing! It was an interesting meld of flavors, the base of which with the plantain definitely was somewhere between a potato and a banana. Very very tasty! 
17426 3 First time here, will be back. Efficient and fast! Great location near a lot of restaurants. Free WiFi. 
17427 4 A big yes to Budgies! Why do I love thee so? Cheap, yummy vegetarian grub that washes down nicely with a $4 pint. Always refried beans over black and they throw in guac when you order vegan. So, wade past the hungry hungry hipsters and dig in! 
17428 4 Edmond, the guy with the long tied back hair is gone now. He and a friend opened a store next to Alleluia Cafe close to Price Smart in richmond, cutting hair. lots of people have been looking for him - so if you need him - he's there!! 
17429 0 Called to ask for information on a part was on hold with service team and never got an answer so guess they lost business now I have to call somewhere else to get a part for my vehicle. 
17430 3 Food is always great and the portions are huge. It would be a 5 star review if they had better egg rolls. We do love there egg flower soup, crab puffs and everything else we have tried. 
17431 3 1st time at a Hooters. Had a nice meal. Wasn't as much to look as would have liked, but it was the middle of the day and there were women and children present. 
17432 4 Everything about this place is pure greatness. The food. The drinks. The customer service. The hip atmosphere. My family and I love coming here. 
17433 4 Very nice place in the plaza by the Walmart market. It's very clean and the servers are friendly. Service is quick and we went at lunch. So good to have a great coffee house where you can get good food with friendly smiles. 
17434 3 The Tabernacle, in my opinion, is one of the best places in Atlanta to see a show. Have been here multiple times and have never had a bad experience. 
17435 3 Excellent meal. We ordered takeout. The staff was kind enough to label everything. We will be returning soon. 
17436 4 I have had a few events at this venue and I can't express the professionalism from the event coordinators and wait staff. We had a very positive experience and would recommend this place. 
17437 4 This was the best government office experience I've ever had, and I didn't even have to set foot in the office. I called, and in 10 minutes, my problem was solved. The customer service representative was helpful and polite. 
17438 4 The entire menu is incredible and very friendly wait staff. I'll always stop for a cocktail and food if I can while flying through ATL. 
17439 4 Yummy breakfast tacos!! They are larger than what I am used to and I was stuffed after eating two of them. Coffee with horchata instead of creamer: you gotta try it! 
17440 4 Never had any issues at this restaurant. Food has always been fantastic. Service is great! 
17441 4 The Vineyards is Orlando's best wine secret. The sommelier is super knowledgeable and the atmosphere is warm, inviting and hospitable. Food is incredible and the service is impeccable. 
17442 4 Wow!!! Absolutely the BEST donuts I've EVER had!!! Tried old fashion glazed, Mexican hot chocolate (favorite!!!) & apple fritters...and no kidding...BEST EVER!!! Dense, moist & DEEEEE-lightful!!! A must if you're in the area!!! Yummmmmmm!!! 
17443 3 Had a really outstanding New Year's Eve dinner here. Elegant atmosphere with the waitstaff all glammed up (Bond theme?). Food was delicious and well-priced. Service was excellent. A lovely space and a memorable meal. 
17444 4 Fresh, clean, helpful, and wheat grass and ginger shots. Smoothies made with fruit and great ingredients Artwork and nice music. Best juice bar in Orlando. 
17445 2 I love the toasted pork bun more than the ramen! But ramen is also very good! I will go and try some other ramen next time. 
17446 3 Last winter I bought a set of Bridgestone Blizzak studless winter tires. They have performed very well in snow and ice and wet roads. The store manager Chuck is a great person to deal with. 
17447 4 Excellent local farm to table style restaurant. The smoked beet salad is amazing. The boiled peanuts are also tasty. 
17448 0 Just terrible. As if this store has just been forgotten by corporate. Flies in the dining area, absolute chaos behind the counter. 
17449 4 Definitely a "must bring your visiting to Portland friends spot"! Seriously the donuts here are out of this world. Great creative flavors, you'll want to try every one! 
17450 4 Great location and bar. And Jenny is a fantastic server who takes good care of everyone. Well done place. 
17451 2 Interesting place to go to. Lot's of Paper Products, great to browse and look. I like the location and if you want some to be specialize, go to this place. 
17452 4 cute, homey atmosphere, gracious and generous service, and delicious food the pie was to die for 
17453 0 Pathetic service , spent $100 on food, but neither the food nor the service was worth it !! Will never visit or recommend. 
17454 3 We stopped by here after a few drinks, and were happy we did. Cool little place for some good snacks. We just got take-out treats, but they did have a little side room where they bring you plated desserts that looked good too. 
17455 4 I can not say enough about this place. Everything from the food, the atmosphere, the waitstaff, and the owner...all amazing. A-MAZ-ING. Do not be fooled by the address. Check it out for a casual but classy evening that is sure to knock your socks off! 
17456 4 Food is awesome. Coffee is a craft. Owner is an awesome dude. Great place overall. Go here on a sunny day and enjoy the sun patio in the back. It's covered and happens to be a great spot for reading or writing emails. 
17457 4 My friend and I came to Austin in July. We both needed a little pampering and boy did we get it! Wonderful spa and a great massage! I can't wait to go back and visit again! 
17458 4 Worth the short wait outside, small place, big flavor broth, satisfying amount of ramen per serving. 
17459 3 The waiter was hilarious and so attentive. Enjoyed the wine list with descriptions on the iPad. Lobster Mac and cheese had ZERO lobster. Tuna tartare was good. Rib eye was perfection. 
17460 4 This has become our "go to" place in Gahanna. The food is tasty, healthy and very affordable. Love the outdoor seating. It does get loud inside when they are really busy. That would be my only complaint. 
17461 4 Went for weekday lunch, cost 8.49 Amazing value. Hibachi was amazing with around 15 toppings, the buffet had both American and Chinese cuisine that tasted pretty good, and dessert selection is fair. For the price, can't beat the deal. 
17462 0 Horrible customer service. They have 2 floors and yet no open register in the lower dept. Told us to walk up the stairs if we wanted to buy something. So we put everything back and walked out. They lost the business of 5 people today. 
17463 4 The sliders are bomb.com! Literally every, single slider is absolutely delicious and wouldn't hesitate to order like 4-6 next time I go, even though they're a decent size! 
17464 3 Well-executed motoyaki and maki sushi from what looks like the Ebisu group. I personally liked the buck-a-shuck oysters. Standard lovely Japanese service in a loud, spacious izakaya setting. Happy hour menu available mid-afternoon and after 9:30pm, 7 days a week. 
17465 2 We have been here lots of times, Always have great service and food. Love the variety and the salad bar is always fresh! Great for small groups, or large groups. 
17466 4 Lynsey was very thorough and pleasant to talk to. She was methodical and efficient - our place looks great! 
17467 4 A few friends and I decided to order from here the other night. We ended up getting a whole bunch of different dishes to share. Everything we ordered was phenomenal. Definitely ordering from here again. 
17468 1 Three people waiting for the store to open. Hours say 10am on Saturday and it's 10:10am and store is still dark. 10:11am and an employee finally showed up. Although this store is definitely more convenient than the UPS drop off points at convenience stores. 
17469 4 Love this place. I could tell right away the guys here knew what they were talking about. Very honest & upfront. I'll look to Lucky for all my moped related needs & you should too! Support local businesses!! 
17470 4 James and crew are fantastic. My daughters piano instructor, Todd, is so patient, kind and very, very talented. She loves going to class in such a cool place. Highly recommend these ladies and gentlemen over at Don't Stop Rockin'! 
17471 4 The 'Asian Noodlle Salad' is a m a z i n g. That is really it. For those that comment on the service, there is no service. Its over the counter. Que!? 
17472 4 This is a wonderful addition to Downtown Worthington. The beverages are awesome. The service is fantastic. We will be back. 
17473 4 Great authentic Brazilian food at an affordable price. The location is small and has limited seating, but it is great for take out. 
17474 4 Came here on a recommendation and thoroughly enjoyed it. Promptly devoured my donut with a delicious cubano. Wish we had one of these in UA. Will absolutely be back... was perfect for a cool rainy day. 
17475 2 Food is good restaurant is a MESS! They aren't that just at lunch; however, there is misc garbage all over the floor. Plenty of employees....no one is cleaning. 
17476 4 We went on Black Friday - the first day it was open in Buckhead. It wasn't crowded but they didn't have the bar stuff together yet. We did get a small comp. to compensate. Still a great feature for the holidays. 
17477 4 I recently switched from 'solar' acrylic nails to gel nails and I absolutely LOVE them. I went to Michele and she is fantastic! I highly recommend both her salon and gel nails! 
17478 4 Excellent products & great customer service. My experience working with them helped us "DIY"ers do a fantastic custom tile project. George was very helpful, his knowledge surpassed our expectations and is always a pleasure to deal with. 
17479 4 Great breakfast waffles. We went on a Thursday morning, and it was busy. Good orange juice, and an awesome atmosphere. Would definitely go back next time I'm in Vancouver. 
17480 4 Excellent service. Good communication. Drivers we had were friendly and efficient. Took great care with our luggage. Would use again next time in Vancouver 
17481 2 Crabfest. Good food not great. 
17482 3 We ducked in here to escape a downpour. We had just eaten, so we tucked in at the bar and enjoyed a few local brews. The bartender and staff were super friendly and did not mind that we lingered for almost 2 hours to avoid the rain. True southern hospitality. 
17483 4 ( Best hemp latte in town! ) I ADORE this place!! Fantastic employees and a friendly owner that knows quality. Tasty drinks and creative gelato flavors to keep the curious and adventurous content without being too weird for the vanilla types.. ;) 
17484 2 This location makes an OK latte, but it's nothing to write home about. I think the barista has a lot to do with how good your coffee will be, and at this location, it was a miss for me. That being said, Artigiano is still better than Starbucks! 
17485 0 WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! This crappy store does not honor warranties and sells a scam of an extended warranty. Furniture is horrible. Customer service is even worse!!! Go to Goodwill for better products and services! 
17486 3 The food here is great The service is great. I love the atmosphere they created. Also had an outdoor patio which you don't find downtown that often anymore. Also has a great bar with very nice and attentive bar tenders. 
17487 4 Great sauce, perfect crust, and friendly people. Get the Old Fashioned it is the best! 
17488 3 Fun experience. The croque madame sandwich was excellent. Even the plain grilled cheese that my wife and daughter ordered with havarti on sourdough was tasty. 
17489 4 One of the best BBQ places in Austin! Loved everything here! The only thing was parking is limited but it won't stop me from coming back here again! 
17490 4 Chris was so much fun. He is such an asset to Chilis and we will definitely be back again, and we will absolutely ask for Chris again and again. 
17491 4 Seriously the best food in town right now. Chicken is delicious. Bread addicting. The potatoes are crazy amazing. The staff is courteous. Service prompt. 
17492 4 I have eaten tacos here multiple times a week since moving to the area. Everything I have tried is very tasty, well packaged, has just the right amount of grease, fresh, and hot. Try everything, but my favorite is the Three Amigos taco. 
17493 4 This place was absolutely fantastic. Great service, very knowledgeable and timely. Outstanding food, particularly the swordfish. One of our desserts truly missed the mark but the other desserts were great. 
17494 3 I wanted to update my review as I feel that the company has gone above and beyond to make right what I get had gone wrong. I appreciate the manager, Stephanie, working with me to resolve my issues. 
17495 4 Hands down best authentic fresh Japanese food I have found in Portland since I moved from Los Angeles four years ago! 
17496 0 Never go here on a fight/big sports night. Poorly managed, no control over people waiting to get seated and very apathetic employees. People standing everywhere around tables and then just taking them instead of putting their names on the wait list. 
17497 4 Their crazy pancake combinations completely justify a trip to Framingham. The Reece's peanut butter pancakes are unique and incredible. The BBQ Pulled Pork Omelette was also one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Remember, they only take cash! 
17498 2 Very good pizza, crust is soft and crunchy. Sauce is decent. They have a nice little deck with umbrellas and plastic chairs. The buffalo pizza I'ls good too. Good amount of chicken on there. The price is about 12.00 for s large pizza. 
17499 2 Met the family here again, and had a better experience. The food is still fabulous, the service has improved a bit. Drink orders were bungled, but other than that we had a fantastic meal. 
17500 3 Really enjoyed this French bistro in a very unassuming location. Food and service were both excellent - comparable for example to Bistro Bistrot, with slightly lower prices. 
17501 4 Amazing burgers !!! Johnny is the man! Anytime your in the area check this new spot out. Best burger I've had in Portland!! 
17502 2 Food takes way too long to get ready and it's not that good. Too greasy for my taste. Not coming back. 
17503 0 I felt like throwing up after Being there for 2 seconds! Never had a sushi restaurant smell that foul before! Had to walk out 
17504 3 Such an amazing, cozy little lunch place right in the heart of downtown Beverly! All the food is extremely fresh and delicious. I've been by a few times now and leave happy and delighted with my experience every time. 
17505 4 This was my first time visiting this restaurant. I ordered the chicken tempura roll and the Yammy Yammy. Both where delicious. The yammy yammy was my favorite. They offer an extensive menu including hibachi. I can't wait to explore more. Great food, good price. 
17506 3 I have been here a few times. Prices are great, food is terrific, service is slow. It might be a Cape Verde thing. Sit back and relax I guess? The live music Thrusday thru Sunday is amazing as well. Pies are actually made by the owners grand ma! 
17507 3 So far the shortest wait I've had at any Bird's location. As usual, same friendly service accompanied by ice cold beer and reasonable prices. Can't go wrong at Bird's. Highly recommend Kelly, she did an awesome job! 
17508 4 It's awesome My birthday and the Bloody Marys are amazing The oysters were fabulous and I can not recommend this place enough Staff friendly and cool 
17509 4 I LOVE This place. They're super close to my work, so they're perfect for lunch time procedures. They've also got great deals all the time. I'm seriously obsessed with this place and love finding new things they can do for me! 
17510 4 I came here for dinner one night and service is top notch! These waiters are Grade A professionals. I indulged in the salmon, lobster mac and cheese and finished it off with a creme brulee. Absolutely indulgent! 
17511 4 Patty Chen's Dumpling Room rocks! I hosted an event near Central Square and Patty catered. She personally delivered, mingled with guests, spoke about the unique fillings. Both Patty herself and her dumplings were a huge hit! I haven't been in the shop, but I can't wait to try more. 
17512 4 New owner is raising the bar with designer womens clothing. 
17513 4 Excellent food and nice place to enjoy drinks/ a good meal and then practice your swing on the driving range. My favorite entrée is the steak frites - but all items on the menu are excellent. Nice bar to watch a game and a drink. 
17514 4 This place is legit. Loved the oxtail. Sooo good. Bonus for those with allergies: it's all made without gluten 
17515 2 Wasn't that impressed. Donuts were donuts nothing that special to write home about. 
17516 0 Bad service, but good latte. Instead of playing on your phone, you might want to help the customers that are patiently waiting in line. 
17517 3 We went here the other night with some friends and I got the Vegetable Biryani and it was great!! We also got an excellent bread assortment. I sampled some of my friend's food as well and it was pretty good. I would go here again. 
17518 4 Pizza was delicious! Waiter was very kind and offered a complimentary glass of champagne since the one I wanted wasn't chilled enough until that bottle was ready. Will be back there for sure. 
17519 4 Great selections: lots of toppings for salads, yummy hot soups and delicious desserts. Good for all 
17520 4 This place was great! The atmosphere is incredible and it's supposedly haunted. The decor is creepy and unique. The Cafe Borgia was delicious as was the cobbler. Service is slow, but it's a part of the experience. 
17521 4 Excellent food and atmosphere. Definitely worth trying out this place. Ordered the noble broccoli and sweet n sour divine. Both very good, along with golden yum and wonton soup. Owner very nice and always kept our water cup full. 
17522 4 Delicious! Came here for a chicken burrito at lunch but they were out of chicken. Shredded beef burrito was well seasoned, not greasy, and super filling! The salsa bar was also great - it's nice to have options! Will be back for a chicken burrito for sure. 
17523 4 One of the best burgers ever. I usually go for the Diablo w/ parmesan fries. They also have a terrific selection of beer on tap. The only down side is that the wait is usually 45-90 minutes, BUT at least they serve alcohol while you are waiting! 
17524 4 Wings, fries, onion rings.....can't go wrong! Favorite wing spot in Atlanta Lemon Pepper wings are the best of any place in ATL. Hot and medium wings are also great. The best blue cheese I have had thus far. Can't get enough of this place. 
17525 1 Years ago their food used to be good. Don't know what it's like now since we stopped eating there, nowadays I only drop by to get a kulfi or a box of sweets. Their mithai is really good, always tastes fresh. The gobi manchurian and schezwan noodles are good. 
17526 3 I am always amazed at how they can make this taste so good without a bucketload of sugar and carbs. But they do. I've always had some kind of chocolate variety, but recently had plain jane vanilla, and it is awesome too. And their service is delightful and helpful. 
17527 4 I liked the biryani there and the desert was outstanding and one of the best I ever had outside of India. The staff was very courteous and helpful. Will go there again very soon. 
17528 1 Very mediocre. Way too much food, overpriced, cheap ingredients. Be ready to wait in line for way too long. 'nuff said. 
17529 4 I always have such good food here and bring anyone I can to try this place. Tonight we had the duck wings, sea beans, gaucho bread, empanadas, mussels, forest mushrooms, and the branzini. Sooo good. 
17530 3 Good for lunch. Food taste was okay. If I could give it a 3.5 I would. The bubble tea was really good though (green tea). The only lace is tiny and there's no seating so plan to take your food to go 
17531 4 Lauren gave me very useful and healing insight into issues I've been dealing with. Her reading was very detailed and comprehensive, but also a lot of fun. Her style is warm, relational, and very accurate. I have already recommended her to other people who are looking for astrology readings! 
17532 3 One of the better Godiva locations. Staff are always friendly and helpful. We come once a month or so for hot chocolate and a few pieces of chocolate. 
17533 2 Saltiest chicken sandwich I have had in a long time. Extremely small portions for price. Looked really nice. 
17534 4 So good!! Been years since we moved away from Vancouver and have been missing a good black bean sauce. This place nailed it. The salt and pepper tofu was awesome too. Great food. 
17535 4 I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I always leave oh so relaxed after my service. Liz is a wiz with my facials, and the massages are fantastic. 
17536 4 I had the chicken pita wrap and it was awesome...so yummy...I will definitely tell others to try it...never had one like it before. 
17537 3 Fast service in a great atmosphere. Wide variety of food choices. You won't be disappointed! 
17538 3 Went with some friends, good food and drinks. Would easily go again. Had reservations, but still had to wait about an hour. 
17539 4 Awesome cafe. This is my office when I'm in Boulder. Friendly staff. Cool customers. Free and reliable wi-fi and great coffee and tea. Great live music too. They should stay open later. 
17540 2 Front office people were very friendly. Room was decent. Bed was AWEFULLLL!!!!! I have a early morning flight and I am still awake. Have stayed in other Howard Johnsons and they were so much better!! 
17541 4 nice place, clean, friendly efficient and fast. Half the price of a mani pedi in our hotel spa! 
17542 0 Have been waiting for 2 hours an still have been seen an I have something in my eye an I should have gone to st davis 
17543 3 I had a great experience! The empanadas (especially the chicken) are amazing, and the best part is the music and customer service. We love this place! 
17544 2 Attended the Afrocentric Orlando event for Black History Month there. The set up was basic with vendors, a stage, and chairs for seating. I enjoyed the event, but it was quite a drive from 32714. 
17545 4 The mussels appetizer is awesome! Paired with crispy grilled bread on the side, I love soaking up the broth. I never leave anything left and ordered it as a main course for myself. love the avocado toast as well and the tuna tar tar. 
17546 4 Easy lady to talk to. Very friendly and informative. I used her for 2 funerals and her wreaths were the best looking. Modern designer look. I recommended her shop to others and they were so impresswd they will use her shop again. Very reasonably priced. 
17547 4 Very very fresh food. I'm not Cuban but this is my favorite Cuban joint in Boston area so far. 
17548 4 got my android fixed here, i dropped it and the screen went black. they were really fast, friendly, and reasonably priced. 
17549 4 I tried one of the #froyo recipes, the "I love chocolate". It was beyond delicious. The restaurant was very clean and is decorated in a very bright and inviting way. I highly recommend this establishment. 
17550 4 A classic diner experience: great food, fast service, and good prices. The coffee is better than your average cafe as well, which is a plus. The seating is fairly limited, but even at busy times there shouldn't be too much of a wait. Great meal 
17551 2 Ahhhhh...fresh/local ingredients. Some of the best fried chicken in town. Brunch left something to be desired. Those indigo girls got a good thing going here. 
17552 0 they are not open until 11 on mondays. fyi, you wont get a smoothie. go to danes dessert cafe, they are open. 
17553 0 Extremely unprofessional, mediocre/cold food, horrible service. My waffle came out burnt twice. The French toast was burnt as well. Not worth $37! 
17554 3 Bright and lively atmosphere. Awe inspiring fish tank above the bar. I prefer the Woodbury's fresh catch roll and it comes with a small poke salad. However the house salad is a great value. Big portions and at $5 its a cant miss 
17555 4 HOLY CRAP MEXICAN DELIVERY!?!?!?!?! $20 minimum, but MEXICAN DELIVERY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IN SALEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! still 5 stars, wish I could give it 6 now that they deliver. 
17556 3 Great hummus served with olive oil and fresh pita was delightful. Lamb kibby roll up was full of flavor and grilled to a perfect light crust dinner for 2 $ 21.00 how can you go wrong. A very loyal following. Great food at a great price. 
17557 4 We LOVE Uptown Eyecare!!!!!!!! The staff is fabulous; super friendly and personable. And, they have great frames that stay current to trends. This place has remained constant in quality and efficiency over the four years we've been to them and highly recommend them. 
17558 3 Try tonight, food is very delicious. I will try different one next time. The lemonade is too sour to me 
17559 4 Had a birthday dinner here and it was phenomenal. The gnocchi was unreal. The seafood was fresh as could be, the atmosphere felt like a dive on the cape in the best way possible, and the service was prompt and friendly. 10/10 would recommend. 
17560 2 Good sandwich but unfriendly service: borderline rude! Definitely won't come back to this location. 
17561 3 Good little local spot with nice choices. The Baked Brie & Charcuterie were nice. Beef Bourguignon was really good and flavorful. Overall good choice. 
17562 4 Such a great place, excellent service I was just waiting for my to go order and the guy brought me soup free of charge what an amazing place. I've been meaning to comeback!! 
17563 4 Great tap selection! And as should be the case at any beer bar, the bartenders are happy to let you sample anything you like before ordering. We also had a couple apps, the Reuben egg rolls and the cheese curds, both were delicious if greasy pub food. 
17564 4 Turmeric fish rice bowl is incredible! The fish and rice were seasoned perfectly and the roasted vegetables were cooked just right. I might add a little spice next time just to see, but it's a pretty great as is. Great value and extremely friendly staff. I'll be back! 
17565 4 It was snowing and we were cold. We stumbled upon this wonderful restaurant. The food is delicious, especially the Thai Red Curry. The pho is also quite good and service was great. Overall, a wonderful meal. We will definitely come again. 
17566 3 I love this place for breakfast. Friendly staff and hearty portion sizes make it an easy win. 
17567 4 I had a massage with Dylan on 4/27 and it was the best one I've ever had....and I get massages on a constant basis. Definitely recommend him! 
17568 0 Ugh this place. .. if you want mediocre food and service, and long lines... this is your place! 
17569 4 Tried the eyelash extensions. I am getting tons of compliments. 
17570 2 The good is still good however tonight was the second time I've come and they are closed before the posted closing time.. Who wants to waste time and gas patronizing an establishment with unpredictable hours!!!! Why post if you don't honor them???? I'm hungry and pissed! 
17571 4 Tasty food! I got the fried chicken salad. The food came out quickly. Our waitress was nice. We sat out on the back patio since the weather was nice. Cute place! 
17572 4 Nice couples message. I got a deep tissue and the therapist really worked out the knots. One of best I've had. My wife was also really pleased. 
17573 4 Great chili dogs! Good grilled chicken sandwich also. Definately be back. Nice to kick back and enjoy the oldies they play. 
17574 4 Always a great experience when I visit. The food is always delicious. I was greeted and seated in a very professional way. I had the fillet mignon and it was exquisite. The waitress was friendly and very knowledgable. Overall experience was five stars. 
17575 3 Great spot a bit off the beaten path in the South End. Very interesting food if you are looking for something with a bit of flare. 
17576 4 The food was amazing and the staff is super friendly. The fried chicken taco was my favorite, however the shredded chicken soft taco is a close 2nd. 
17577 4 They did a great job. Very happy with results. This is my new spot for a great wash. Employees were friendly and knowledgeable 
17578 3 Food and service is not that bad. Ordered the salmon maki roll and duck. Nothing spectacular though except the interior. 
17579 4 My day is always improved with one of their white chocolate raspberry, or lemon, or red velvet, or carrot, or any flavor bundtlets. 
17580 4 Best Prime Rib in town. I enjoy going here every Saturday Night. Martinis are a great price all the time and are wonderful. The service here is great. Have never had a bad experience. Plus the location is close to where I live. 
17581 4 "I have always respected this restaurant not only for its ambience, reasonable pricing, and free pickles." But, This place serves bison in a welcoming manner. Bison is one of the healthiest red meats in the world with less cholesterol than turkey. Love this place." - Ansel Ponce Diama 
17582 4 Love it! Cute little bakery tucked back near the water fountain. You can enjoy your food/drinks inside or outside on a nice day. Great prices for amazing treats. Try the breakfast sandwich! 
17583 1 Food was average at best and the service was terrible. I've heard great things about this place and was highly disappointed. No one in my family will eat there again. 
17584 3 I like the fresh soy milk with fried dough, which is a traditional breakfast in China. the pork chops with sticky rice is very good. jiucai hezi is very fresh, I like small dishes stuff, I will recommend it to others too 
17585 4 You not only delighted our senses, but inspire us with your passion for sharing your decadent art! A real treat! 
17586 4 Wonderful fresh breakfast. Cozy and cheery atmosphere. Fresh squeezed juice. Open early. Wonderful service. Jason made us feel welcome as soon as we arrived. He took our order promptly and we never had to ask for extra coffee or sides--he anticipated our needs and went the extra mile. Highly recommend. 
17587 4 Tony is best!! I could almost fly after massage. The perfection with which he was massaging trigger point was simply amazing. This is my go to place for massage henceforth. 
17588 2 It's not one of my favorite but I go there with a group of friends ,it's good for groop we can get loud a they have a nice bar the food is ok but the service can get slow and the wait staff forgetfull when it get crouded. 
17589 4 I would give them 10 stars if I could. Had windows tinted on a new car. Fastest service I've experienced from such a vendor. Also, BEST customer service. 
17590 4 Gotcha is a fantastic place to spend $10. They have melee, Tr4sh, various Nippon delights, and prize-distributing arcade games that are super duper easy to beat. 10/10, would bang. 
17591 1 Skip Laudisio. While the atmosphere and decor were nice, the hostesses were rude, our waitress did the absolute bare minimum, the food was nothing special and for such a hyped up happy hour, the drink menu was pathetic. This place was a serious disappointment. 
17592 4 Holy Moly is this place amazing. Words cannot describe, so I'm not even going to try. 
17593 2 Good bbq beef sandwich but I think the size has shrunk. My friends like the bbq chicken rice which was about 4.5 dollars with good amount of rice. 
17594 0 Very rude wait staff. Talking and laughing among themselves. Don't eat there. She didn't have a pen so she said, "can you hand me a pen" I said "please". She didn't like being corrected. Will never spend my money there. 
17595 3 Really great food at a good price. Only downside is the set up- it's quite tight and the servers expect you to know where they are going and to get out of their way. 
17596 4 Today was my first time at Black Bear Diner and I had a great experience! Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Also the food was delicious and added bonus that the theming of this restaurant is awesome. I would definitely recommend and I will definitely be going there again! 
17597 4 excellent restaurant ! very very nice Staff , and very good food quality. the ham is very good in particular ! definitively recommended 
17598 3 For a local coffee shop, this is one place that pretty much has it all. Good sandwiches, great local flavor and really creative coffee drinks (iced and hot). Worth a try anytime. 
17599 4 Great burgers! The ambience is fun and the staff is super friendly! I had the Americana, it's like an classic burger. It was tasty and very juicy. The lines are extra long but worth wait! Try the Parmesan fries, delish!! 
17600 4 This is a top notch hair salon. Rachel gives fabulous cuts and I highly recommend her! 
17601 2 Service was good. Food was mediocre. Best was guacamole made at table. The Coronita margaritas looked good but we didn't try one. With so many other great restaurants in the area, probably won't return. 
17602 4 What a neat concept, but don't try italy unless you want to regret something for the day 
17603 3 Food is wonderful, coffee is great, and prices are amazing (how do they do it?). Service can be very hit or miss, depending on who you get! Wish they were open for dinner! 
17604 3 Yum, the look of the waffle speaks for itself.. I've only tried the chocolate banana waffle and the honey milk tea for now but both do not disappoint. Service was excellent and the space is quite nice for roomy, quiet studying. 
17605 0 Went back and had the worse service ever. After ordering wings and waiting for 45 minutes they never arrived. Worst taco mac around and i live in the neighborhood. 
17606 3 The place has $6 deals on all dosas on Mondays. Enough said!! Location 5 / 5 Quality 4 / 5 Value 5 / 5 Service 3 / 5 Overall 4 / 5 PS : These ratings are for Mondays only. YMMV!! 
17607 3 Awesome, community centered place! 
17608 3 Definitely Austin unique ... just look at the menu! Enjoyed the Fillet Mignon & Quail. The Herbed Cheese Mashed Potatoes and the Spicy Thai Green Beans with Bleu Cheese Crumbles were especially wonderful and flavorful. I'll go back. 
17609 3 Great food. But for God's sake, don't get the Greek coffee. It's horrible. 
17610 1 The Old Fashioned was $12. My drink was $13. Definitely overpriced. 
17611 2 Love the food but your delivery drivers have alligator arms and say they dont have any change with is rediculous. and they lie about how they just started there shift when i got the delivery at 6 and you guys close at 9. BS 
17612 4 This is my favorite barbecue in town they have an incredibly good sweet mustard sauce and their Char is amazing. The wet brisket is by far the best in town! And it's nice to find a barbecue place that doesn't taste the same as all the others! 
17613 0 They put buckets of Mochi on the floor and not sure how long it has been there We had mango ice and drink. Was extremely ill and end up throwing up all night. 
17614 4 Sara P. was excellent! She arrived on time, was courteous, followed the priorities we discussed and added extra touches all the way. We certainly hope to work with her again. 
17615 4 Outstanding dentist office in every way. Excellent Intro service. Extremely nice fast and efficient staff. 
17616 3 The food is unbelievable! We ordered a few items and they're all good. If you don't know what to order. Just ask the server and they'll make good recommendation. 
17617 2 The prices are okay, but their selection always changes for the worse at times. Their customer service skills are horrible. 
17618 4 Just brought earrings here for repair- not only were they able to fix them while I waited they didn't even charge me for the service. Great place will definitely be back! 
17619 4 Seriously the best Gluten Free breakfast in Atlanta! Their GF menu is huge! The staff wasn't that attentive but they were very nice :). Bacon came out extra crispy as requested and if you love cinnamon rolls, get a gluten free one. Heavenly! 
17620 3 Actually quite delighted at this recommendation. A bit pricier than I expected, but everything was delicious! Interesting rolls and the deluxe chirashi was impressive. We will be back! Late hours a bonus! 
17621 3 5/29/13: Received a message from B.B.B. that they will soon be closing and relocating to another state. My service here was great.... perhaps another gifted therapist will take it over 
17622 3 Food is really good. Service is average due to young people serving. But it's an overall good place to grab something quick. 
17623 1 The two stars are for the staff, each staff deserves a star. Unfortunately, they have a limited selection on their menu available daily and it was below average. Their specialty chicken tasted mediocre. 
17624 0 ALWAYS a 30-40 minute wait, and you can't make an appointment. Ridiculous. Maybe the haircuts are great. I dunno. I've tried at least five times and they have either a staffing problem or a management problem. 
17625 4 I love everything here. The lavash bread and Turkish tea are my favorite. The entrées are a bit pricey but very flavorful. 
17626 4 Favorite hole in the wall!! Love the fresh fish, oysters and atmosphere! Don't be fooled by the modest appearance outside, this place is the best fish house in the Port! 
17627 0 Ordered 2 entrees pot stickers and 2 egg rolls from a delivery service. Paid $45 and didn't even receive rice with the entrees. Won't be ordering from Yau's again 
17628 3 Great neighborhood dive bar. Everyone was super friendly, beers are at a good price point. I would like to see some maintenance done in certain areas but all in all its a fun hangout. Some things to look for: dog friendly outdoor patio, big buck hunter, super inviting crowd 
17629 3 Well its Ruths Chris. Very good location, with no alcohal you can get away with -$60. I frequent RS around the US and use this strategy 
17630 4 Awesome place and the food is AMAZING! They a great selection of raw appetizers. Very happy to have a place this modern in the neighborhood. Their drinks are also great. 
17631 4 Love this place, especially the patio in the summer. Very enjoyable "fizzy wine" (I call it citrus cider) and nice folks. The connection with Tamale Boy helps set the scene. Justin is the nicest bartender in Portland. 
17632 0 Walked in for a polish change. Employees friendly but quality was awful. Polish was left all over my hands. Paid $25, never going back. 
17633 4 Make sure to beat the Saturday rush for brunch. The service and food was amazing. Definitely will be adding to my favorite brunch spots in Atlanta. The service is fast and friendly. 
17634 2 Good food, warm and friendly service and great cozy vibe. Agedashi tofu and beef tongue stand out in particular. Prices skew high and portions are on the small side however. 
17635 4 Cracked my phone on a Sunday morning bike ride to the gym. Went in at 12:15, ate lunch, and picked up my iPhone 6 at 1:30. Good as new, fair price and couldn't be happier. Great service! 
17636 3 Great food - really yummy. No complaints about the food or the service. I love the location, but it's a doomed location. Not sure why no one can make it stick here. The patio is awesome! We enjoy this place and hope it sticks around. 
17637 3 Perfect location, near downtown, clubs and beach. Will stay there again for sure 
17638 4 Excellent food for reasonable prices, and great staff. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience. They've got gelato too! 
17639 4 This place has the best $2 salsa verde and amazing and very inexpensive tacos in the eating area. Kind of like a South Austin secret. 
17640 3 This is a great little place. I like the feel, they prices aren't too high. It's gotten pretty popular through, so try to go early. Order with your heart, not your mind, and your ass will forgive you later. It's not health food, but it is good food ^_^ 
17641 2 After 4.5 stars and 302 reviews I was VERY disappointed. The food wasn't too bad, but it wasn't great. The meat was so bland. I tried a torta, the "Famous" Chicago burrito, flan, and tacos. It was a C overall. Weird smell too. Sorry. Not coming back. 
17642 3 Came here with a craving for crepes awhile back. It was excellent, but very messy. Unfortunately, they didn't have a lot of options without some nut product, so my friend who is deathly allergic to nuts had to settle. Otherwise great place for dessert 
17643 4 Very clean rooms, nice facility. Friendly staff. Great breakfast. 
17644 3 Nice location with tons of good looking leathers if that's what you're in for. Only draw back that it's a bit pricey but the quality looks like it's something that will last for a while. 
17645 3 Really tasty pizza, I couldn't give 5 stars because there is no delivery and it's not wood fired. 
17646 4 This is the 2nd time I've been placed in a job within a week. Stephanie and Josh are great and remembered me from last year. I've been fortunate in sticking with them. Hopefully this time I found my work home. 
17647 4 One main factor that separates a hairdresser from the rest isn't only being good at your craft but also having a good attitude. And these two qualities definitely exemplifies Amber. She takes her time to make sure that you get that achieved look. 
17648 2 I've been here three times with varying degrees of quality. The specials seem to be the best, though one order of fish tacos went from excellent to very salty on the same plate. Service has always been great though. 
17649 4 This place has everything-I finally found Dogfish 120m IPA! If they don't have it the store, ask if they have it in the back. 
17650 4 Went in for my yearly skin check (4 years late) and was lucky enough to get an appointment with Dr. Julie Jackson and Melissa. They were very kind, proficient and pleasant. 
17651 4 I had my birthday party here and it was absolutely delectable. I had been here before a couple of times and really dug the small, intimate atmosphere, it's a great spot for a party and they are never really too packed out. Wonderful raspberry mojitos, you must go now. 
17652 4 Really great ramen place. They have a good menu with combo options. Great experience and i was able to enjoy my food 
17653 3 Great little hole in the wall. Ate the chicken/chinese sausage clay pot rice which was delicious. Place is small but reassuring that the tables were full. It's always nice to see a place that serves food like this which you can't find in most Chinese restaurants. 
17654 3 Consistent performance - very trustworthy- good employees - typically very punctual. We use them for every 2 week cleaning of our home 
17655 4 Great menu, simple atmosphere. I crave the waffle fried chicken and the sauerkraut balls appetizers. Kids loved the Mac and cheese stuffed burger. I love the brussel sprouts. Wife likes the salmon BLT. Service is really friendly. They are definitely off to a good start. 
17656 4 I am VERY surprised to have a ice cream that is healthy and TASTES SO GOOD! I came back two times after. It helps me satisfy my craving for an ice cream but knowing it is much better than a regular ice cream! I love it here! 
17657 4 I have to say that after a response from management, I truly believe that there is a sincere effort to value customers opinions! For that reason, I will be giving Pier 6 another try! 
17658 4 Love Whole Bowl! The secret sauce is out of this world. Wonderful service as well. She even knows us by name and remembers our orders! Will continue to back again and again. 
17659 4 Love love love this cute little juice bar in canton. I've had green juice and loved it and a dessert coffee smoothie and loved that too. The crepes are delicious as well. and it's adorable inside. Great find. 
17660 0 The new chicken is horrible. I literally just threw away a entire burrito bowl. Moe's was my favorite restaurant and now with the changes they have lost a customer. I'm so sad 
17661 4 So yummy don't waste your time elsewhere this is seriously amazing !light fluffy delicious I dislike cakey donuts and prefer the airy soft kind. Lots of great flavors 
17662 1 FISH SAUCE!, way to much of it from start to end, every dish, still taste in my mouth the day after. Overpowering! 
17663 4 Always excellent service! I've been a very happy customer for 30 years and will keep coming back to Beaverton Toyota for all of our service needs. 
17664 3 Took good care of my car and were quick to retrieve when I needed it. Very polite crew as well 
17665 3 Although the facility is great and having an indoor pool is a huge plus, the student staff is often ill-equipped to handle basic customer service needs. 
17666 4 My fav place to go for Ha Noi traditional Viet Namese food. Good services and good food. 5 star for this place 
17667 4 Whether you live a mile away or 100 you need to eat here. Come to Winter Park , Fl to enjoy a southern affair at the Coop They have MAPLE BACON!! 
17668 4 Just order the 10-course chef's tasting menu. All those rolls make you look like an asshat. 
17669 4 Authentic no-frills Tex-Mex doesn't get better than this. Great prices, too! Friend and I shared the nachos and I had the beef quesadillas. They were spectacular. There's a bar AND a bakery, as well. Service was excellent. I will definitely be back. 
17670 0 Light drinks, ridiculous veggie sushi, clueless service, overpriced. Never again. 
17671 4 FANTASTIC!!! I love Seaworld - loads to see and the Shamu show is amazing. It's got a really happy feeling about the place.wish I was there now x 
17672 2 I met some friends here for brunch, I ordered chicken and waffles which I wasn't sure about but they turned out to be amazing. Pretty cool place, good atmosphere, loved the decor. The parking sucks so I had to valet. I would definitely go again. 
17673 3 Love the sunrail, it just needs to start running weekends as well. Always on time, very clean and nice. Hopefully stays this way 
17674 4 Best breakfast or lunch in town great food for a fair price. Wonderful service staff The girl at the front desk knows my name whenever I go there 
17675 3 i love this place ----only one in town bang of th ebuck-- oh yeah worth it!!!! 
17676 4 Im in a transition stage and stretching my relaxer and was in desperate need of a blow out. Sabrina took her time to tame my puffy hair for a nice sleek blow out and a perfect undercut! 
17677 3 Flip Burger was awesome but you got to have the tuna burger plus the choco milkshake 
17678 2 Not terrible. The hot and sour soup was okay but disappointing - it was neither hot nor sour. I'll give them another try for a larger meal but so far I'm inclined to go next door to Golden Horse. 
17679 4 Our families have used them many times and we always so grateful for their service. They have always been extremely professional, listened and provided great medical care for what we have needed. 
17680 3 溫哥華雖然不及美國拉斯維加斯是個賭城，但這裡的合法賭埸也相當活躍，幾乎每個市鎮都有一間賭場設立。賭場為求吸引更多顧客，經常會推出各種飲食和自助餐優惠。鄰近溫哥華又設有自助餐廳的賭場有四間，包括位於本拿比市的The Buffet@Grand Villa、位於二埠的The Buffet@Starlight、位於高貴林市的The Buffet @Hard Rock Casino 和我今天光顧位於列治文市的The Buffet@River Rock。以我個人體驗所得，這幾家賭場自助餐廳之中以River Rock最為優勝，包括餐房環境、員工服務以至餐點品質和款式都比其餘三家好很多，雖然價錢稍高但CP值亦相對提升，物有所值。 這家位於溫哥華列治文市River Rock Casino河石賭場內的"The Buffet"自助餐廳七天營業，每天提供早午晚自助餐及週六/日的「Brunch Buffet」。自助餐廳位於娛樂度假酒店三樓，可容納260人，兩間貴賓房可供私人宴會或活動使用。餐房寬敞舒適，接近落地窗的座位更可欣賞菲沙河景 
17681 3 Just around the corner from my house. Love it, good service and clean. The food?? Just perfect! 
17682 4 Absolutely phenomenal food! Tapas with a lot of vegetarian and vegan options. It's great to go with friends - affordable and while the portions are tapas size, it's still shareable. Would definitely go again. 
17683 4 My rather spoiled cat just spent a week at Cats in the City. They took great care of him. I've never boarded a cat before and was extremely pleased with the service. 
17684 3 Really enjoy dining here. Great staff. Great food. The truffle fries are so YUMMMM!!! 
17685 3 Well organized and clean. Helpful store personnel. The wait times for the drive-through pharmacy is not as bad as the other Walgreen Pharmacy store on Cornell Rd. 
17686 3 Finally some good Mexican food downtown. Chicken burrito was really good. The watermelon margarita was on point, and the salsa is awesome! 
17687 4 The gentleman who owns this makes shipping pleasant!! Always nice and helpful! I would recommend this store to all! 
17688 4 This place was delicious The rolls are served on a fun boat and filled with wonderful flavors. Our waitress Sera was fantastic She was filled with knowledge and recommended the top dishes The longhorn roll and Austin rolls were succulent We definitely will return !!! 
17689 4 I go to Capital University so I love that Aladdin's is practically right across the street! It's student friendly and the meals fill you up. The Baba and the Hummus are delicious, I get them every time. I recommend the Turkey Pita Roll but everything I've tried here is amazing. 
17690 0 Slow to no service. I would not recommend it. Asked me if I needed anything and I said ranch dressing. Never came back. That not something that will make me want to come back especially because they're not busy. 
17691 3 Great food, great service, great location after Lenox mall. As far as ramen however, would recommend jinya or umaido. Only reason why we come to this location is because it's closer then the other two. 
17692 2 Came for lunch today after reading the great reviews but closed 12/22. A sign said they will open 4 PM for dinner so the lunch buffet may have ended. 
17693 4 I found my desk here as well as some super cool depression era glassware. Always friendly staff and air conditioning works well. 
17694 2 I spoke to the manager who was very apologetic about the miscommunication and about the online appointment falling through, he had personally gone on Saturday to get the tires. 
17695 4 Glad to finally get a great Japanese restaurant that is not the usual sushi or hibachi. This place has great quality food at a great price point. This is traditional izakaya food... Love it 
17696 4 I completely agree. I have been seeing Dr. Orr for over 10 years and he is awesome. Never misses. 
17697 4 Had two tree stumps in front of yard. Andrew took care of it pomptly at a very reasonable price. Highly recommend Lobel Tree Service 
17698 3 Love the ramen, especially the options you can add on for fair prices. Fast, good ramen, and great flat noodles. 
17699 4 I love the food here, especially the potstickers and the barbecue pork. I would definitely come back here again!! 
17700 1 Lost their food mojo - not like other joes - really tired - crab was mushy - tacos had sat for a while. Not my best Joes food experience. Staff was really nice! 
17701 4 Awesome food. Great staff I should have gotten the sampler meat plate, but my wrap was great. This was the restaurant I've been waiting for Excellent Turkish Mediterranean food 
17702 1 Price was right. Ambiance was perfect. The food was just average to me. I have had better in the past. 
17703 4 Great food. Best fried chicken in town and try the IBC Root Beer. Awesome food and staff was friendly. You may have a small wait time due to the high popularity of restaurant but it is definitely worth it. 
17704 1 Vegetarian perspective: Had high hopes but not very impressed. It doesn't come close to Taco Deli/ Bouldin Creek Cafe/ Torchy's. For the omnivores, the experience may be very different though. 
17705 4 I have been to Brooklyn twice and loved the creative menu. The owner was engaging and proud of his place. Attentive staff. Great Panther coffee. Only criticism is the paper plates. Please change ASAP!!!!! 
17706 2 Let's say you have 10 minutes for dinner. What are your options? If you are in close proximity to Chinatown, 163 offers reasonably priced banh mi. This no frills establishment has added BBQ and grilled pork to their sandwich menu recently. 
17707 4 Been here at least a dozen times. Consistent, delicious and fast service. Pho and the bun with short ribs are the best in PDX. Lots of seating and rarely a wait. Decor is a bit like a cafeteria. Don't come for ambience, come for good food. $22 for two, bargain! 
17708 4 Chicken based broth is a lighter and less fatty broth vs Pork based. That being said a very delightful taste and the thinner noodles go very well. The seasoned soft boiled egg may be the best tasting I've ever had. Be sure to add garlic chips! 
17709 4 santarpios is the balls. double lamb, cheese pizza, cl smoothie. 
17710 3 It's Cracker Barrel. Good food for an okay price. Service was really slow at this location but can't complain much it was a Sunday at noon. I went for the "healthier" option as I watched everyone devour their pancakes and biscuits. Just a whatever experience, nothing memorable. 
17711 3 I love the discounts I get with my Barnes and Noble membership. This is a good place to come with the kids to pass the time on a rainy day. 
17712 4 Always a wonderful dining experience. Great sushi, great atmosphere and great wait staff. The food is awesome. My favorite thing is the sunday lunch buffet, 
17713 3 The Swedish crepes are mind-blowing, I have never had such good crepes. The german pancake is also worth trying. You will receive great service here, The waitresses are nice and helpful, and hour coffee cup is never empty. 
17714 3 Excellent service! The textured protein was a bit bland but their house-made hot sauce was a great addition. I wish they had a few more menu items that weren't meat-specific substitutes; just pure vegetable dishes. 
17715 1 Not worth the price..... Too salty, not fresh, I was sitting in front of the cooking area and saw pre cooked noodles thrown in the wok. 
17716 4 This is a good Mac's It has parking in front. Cashier very friendly. not to mention the place is very clean and has almost everything you expect in a convenience store. I sometimes grab my bus ticket from here. 
17717 0 This is rare and I prefer to blog about greatness....but not today,not here. 'appy Noshin' Brianm Foodie@Large.yelp.ca 
17718 4 The manager at this store is fantastic. She is so kind and helpful and she provided outstanding customer service. I will shop here again soon! Thanks :) 
17719 4 Excellent and quality service, display their pride and confidence in result of their work. Appreciate for paid so much attentions to quality, detail cleaning was something unexpected. We are highly recommending Heitzman Body and Paint. 
17720 4 An absolutely amazing experience. John & Doug pull out all the stops. From the warm welcome, to the thorough explanation of each dish, to the superb food itself! We will be back! 
17721 1 Went here a couple of years ago for dinner. It's not good for dinner. The service was good, but the food wasn't. Maybe it's just good for breakfast. Unfortunately, the dinner scarred my vision of this place. 
17722 3 I love this place. Their wraps are awesome! Their curry platter is awesome! Their customer service is awesome! Their wait time is NOT so awesome! Overall, if you want to feel good about what you just stuffed into your mouth for lunch. This place is a good deal. 
17723 3 The chicken wings were really nicely marinated with a little hint of spicy. The chicken breast also was good. Waiters were meh/alright. Mac and cheese was really good. The serving size is good. Salad was very good as well. 
17724 3 The food is really good here and the staff is really friendly here too. Certain items are not that great.. #4 is the best and dumplings are amazing also. 4 star on the border of 5! 
17725 4 They did a great job getting us in & out on a crowded morning! Customer service was great & the ambiance was perfect. 
17726 2 Yeah, not a bad spot for a summer baseball game. You'll see the Vancouver Giants play until dusk and usually there is a fireworks show that follows. This is one of the best hangout spots in Vancouver during the summer. Date rating: 3 out of 5. 
17727 4 Great place to relax, unwind, and be creative! I stopped in here to get some work done and enjoyed the "Starbucks Evenings" menu. The moscato was great. The wine glass says "permission to relax".... It's very true. 
17728 0 The food was great .. we had breakfast... the service needs some work... we had to ask for everything ... hopefully the waitress was just new Gave it a second try. Service is crap. Will not go back 
17729 4 Ordered off door dash and it was amazing!!! Definitely will order again. I used to work in Dearborn Mi where u get authentic Arabic food....this is the closest I've gotten in Texas. Really really good!!! 
17730 4 Very nice and relaxing environment; delicious food. I had the calamari which was amazing; the pad Thai and sushi were very tasty. Friendly staff! Will come back. 
17731 4 Best service. Our waiter was very nice. Food was very good and the prices were perfect. Will be coming back soon. 
17732 4 This place is crazy good. A bit slow but worth the wait. The pork Torta and the Chicken Torta are out of this world. Grab a beer from the cart right next door and you've got a terrific lunch or dinner 
17733 1 I agree with everyone else on this place. The breakfast was mediocre. I could've made a better breakfast than what they gave me. Service was good and the place is nice but the food wasn't great. I will not come here again 
17734 3 Not much to say here. the place was pretty great. The food was delicious and I was craving falafel. For some reason the Diet Coke tasted like root beer though. 
17735 4 I've been going to Joe for years. The prices are relatively low and reasonable. The service is great plus you get 10% off if you prepay. Would definitely recommend coming here. 
17736 3 Friendly staff, 100% gluten-free and very cosy interior. Had the salmon nori rolls with an almond milk latte and both were really good! Definitely coming back for more healthy fast food! 
17737 0 Their customer service SUCKS! The pharmacy is a total joke. Prescriptions never ready and always an excuse of how they "couldn't find the patient/customer." REALLY? How about call the prescribing Doctor back for more information NO common sense AT ALL. And not a one-time event, 90% of the time. 
17738 3 Good old voodoo donuts. just like you'd fins in Portland. Simple delicious treat after a night on 6th. While ur here. Must try the voodoo donut 
17739 4 Quaint restaurant with very friendly, helpful service. We had classic Khachapuri, potato leek Khinkali Dumplings, and the beet Pkhali. All were very good, and we will be back to try more off the menu. 
17740 4 Outstanding/ service was exceptional sat at the "bar table" and my sever was knowledgeable about the menu and local beers. Interesting menu , great charcuterie, had a mortadella mouse with a pistachio macaroon. It was amazing. Buffalo quail was cooked perfectly. Will be back 
17741 4 Saturday for brunch is my favorite. Morgan's the only reason why I come here and the food is always amazing and fresh.. 
17742 4 We have ordered from here twice now, and they arrive far earlier than estimated. Hot and fresh, perfectly prepared to order, with just enough of those high quality toppings. Our new delivery favorite! 
17743 4 I'm sold! This place is awesome. Classic. Authentic. Flavorful. The salsa is amazing. I've had the quesadillas, chimichanga, all the tacos and burritos. They're all good. And even better, they deliver!! Super fast. Super fresh. Order now!! 
17744 4 Great pizza, I ordered an oven roasted veggie pizza, fantastic combination of fresh ingredients ..hot, crisp, flavorful vegetables. The real better ingredients .. best pizza. 
17745 4 Great place to have dinner before a long flight. One of the best bars in the city of Atlanta. The open faced meatloaf sandwich and Kobe beef burger are great. Not your typical airport food. Make sure you have extra time and visit Terminal E. 
17746 4 I came here for notary services. Barely waited 3 min and everything was quick and professional. This location is great because of all the stores in this plaza, including HEB. 
17747 4 The best museum around. Can't even count how many times I've been.And I'm planning on going back as often as possible. The staff is great the exhibits are fantastic 
17748 4 So happy we came to this neighborhood restaurant! Great homemade pasta. My kids loved everything we ordered and the service was perfect! We will be back! 
17749 3 This place was very entertaining for my kids. The food was also amazing, Especially the Barbecue sauce. And the unbelievable Pretzel, and the great waitress Chris! 
17750 4 They have amazing drinks! A really good selection. Excellent bartenders that are really respectful. I will definitely be back here again!! And their burgers are to die for. 
17751 4 Came for drinks on a Saturday afternoon... don't ever write reviews but felt this was worthy! Staff was amazing and so helpful, especially Anjha that went out of her way to help us. Everything was perfect. Super impressed. I would Recommend to anyone. 
17752 3 $5 Guiness Drafts and $6 Ketel Ones and soda. Didn't have any food but bar service was attentive and fast. 
17753 4 Very nice Ambience, Service was great and Food is Delicious! My husband and I love Indian food and this is our first time here and what a great first impression for this place! Love it and would definitely recommend! 
17754 1 Extremely overpriced. Food mediocre at best. Lousy service. Do yourself a favor, drive another mile down the road and go to spaghetti warehouse. 
17755 4 I'd written off fast food until I tasted their food. Always fresh, cooked to perfection, served up quick and hot, goes down great. Their all chicken menu is great for those who don't like dark meat. Be sure to get fries with your order....it completes the experience. 
17756 4 Quality Italian food at a great price. This is an amazing addition to Park Ave! The prices are better than the area encourages. 
17757 4 Dr Jackson , and her staff, have been wonderful. I appreciate the time and concern they show towards patients. Dr Jackson takes the time to explain, as do her techs and nurses. I would highly recommend this practice 
17758 4 good food! good service! family friendly and cozy atmosphere! I am so happy with this place every time I visit! 
17759 4 Incredible pizza!!! I went here out of the blue and I'm sure glad I did. I now have a new destination to signature Pizza! Great fast service with a smile! See you soon! 
17760 1 The service is so terrible I don't feel comfortable coming back. It's a shame because the juices and soups are actually quite good 
17761 4 These guys were great from start to finish! It was a seamless process and I am going to recommend them to all my friends and family. They showed up when they said they would and cleaned up before they left. I love my new fence! 
17762 3 Two words: Lobster Ravioli! Plenty of fresh lobster to justify the price and the taste was amazing. The service was also great but our table was one of the only ones in the restaurant. the bar area seemed to be the happening place. I would recommend this restaurant any day! 
17763 4 Excellent service! The driver Adam was very respectful and nice. He even got there earlier than expected and towed my vehicle fast. I will def be using this company again. Thanks a lot! 
17764 1 The course was dirty and the old lady behind the counter seemed irritated that I was using a Groupon, and she followed me outside telling me not to leave the property with the golf club which I wasn't doing. I do not recommended mostly because of customer service. 
17765 2 It's a Wendy's....same food, same service, same as everywhere. Horrible exit and entrance to this location. 
17766 2 Corn chowder is the bomb...all veggies are perfectly chopped and great balance between broth and veggies...also a nice wedge of French bread compliments perfectly...did rapid pick up with my co worker for lunch and worked like a charm 
17767 3 Paul cuts my hair, he does exactly what I ask for! Its such a nice relief to have a hair stylist who listens and takes their time. Can't wait to go back! 
17768 4 Saw "Muscle Shoals" this afternoon at the BOE, and it was fantastic. I highly recommend film "oh sweet home"! What a great venue. WOW is all I can say. 
17769 0 Used to be our favorite place in all of Portland, but the took our favorite beef tenderloin OFF the menu, replacing it with sirloin served with duck fat!!!! YUCK! We'll never go back. 
17770 0 The food here was less than acceptable. The burger was barely a patty. And the mac&cheese my son ordered was cold in the middle. I discourage eating here until something drastic is changed. 
17771 4 Great shop, good times. Rolando, Michelle, Leigh & Lila are a fun bunch that give great cuts and take their profession seriously. 
17772 1 Why can't burgerville get food hot?? New location in Tigard. This is like the one in Canby. Same cold food and seems like smaller burgers?? Anyone else? The place is clean and folks were nice. Lots of competitors close by. 
17773 4 I haven't had a technological problem (yet) (fingers crossed) but when going in to purchase a new charger, the staff were super friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. Great customer service! 
17774 2 This is a great place to go if you choose a cool night and make it just in time for there sunset. The view is gorgeous but the food is ok. It gets packed so service can be a little slow 
17775 4 comfortable ambience, appetizing food. Most of all, clean kitchen with friendly staff - rare case for a chinese restaurant. It's a great place for a casual dining. 
17776 3 This place is fantastic. It's all board games but I love coming here and getting random swag. Literally ceiling to floor boardgames (mostly indie!) also a great place for pokemon cards and card protectors! 
17777 4 Yes, yes, and more yes. The food here is excellent, the service fast and friendly (in fact, our waitress even wrote us a list of her favorite restaurants to try later on), and the location is within walking distance of all of Vancouver's most impressive sights. 
17778 4 Excellent service. We saved thousands in commission on the sale of our condo in Midtown. Danielle was fantastic and super knowledgeable about the market. Highly recommend Redefy to anyone looking to sell. 
17779 3 Friendly service, and great coffee. The food was good, and survice was quick. I would definately reccomned this place for out of towners. 
17780 3 Da Gabi is a great choice in a town with many good dining experiences. Tuesday happy hour runs all night. The tapas and margaritas were very good, service excellent, and priced very reasonably. You need a reservation to sit outside. I would definitely recommend Da Gabi for a good meal. 
17781 4 Sooo good! I've never had ice cream taste this good! The rolled ice cream is cold and tasty. I got pina colada and they put pineapple and blended it before mixing on cold table. New owner is very nice and is working out the kinks! 
17782 4 Seriously addicted to Protein Bar! The salads and barritos are fantastic. It is a little pricey but it's a nice treat every once in a while. 
17783 4 Literally everything in this bakery is a-m-a-z-i-n-g! Their coxinha is the best I've ever had, and the cappuccino is delicious. Such a cozy place and the employees are very friendly. Definitely coming back every time I visit Orlando! 
17784 4 First class service and prooducts. Very knowledgable staff. I was served quickly even without an appoimtment. The people and products are first class. 
17785 4 Great Pizza and they will even make you a special pizza of your choice. Has desert pizza even a chocolate s'mores pizza. Salad Bar has good selections Good pricing too. Its new on the block. Come try for yourself. Great for birthdays and get togethers. 
17786 1 Overpriced pizzas lacking anything interesting. Food was extremely slow to come out. Crust tasted like totinos frozen pizza and it was just overall bland and nothing exciting. The 2 stars is purely for the baked wings which were quite juicy and delicious. 
17787 4 Dim Sum was great! Our waitress was very good her name was Jennifer! The staff was great none of them were rude! 
17788 1 The former restaurant (Sky) was a step above. Food is inconsistent (the potential is there) and overpriced. Redeeming feature of the establishment is the bar. The bartenders are friendly and extremely accommodating. The management and ownership, as stated in other reviews, are unwelcoming and abrasive. 
17789 2 The food is good, but I think the curtains are weird. Kind of pricey, but you probably already know that. 
17790 4 Excellent experience. Service was top notch and food is excellent. A family friendly restaurant that deliveries quality dishes at a reasonable price. 
17791 2 The food is ok! The staff are a bit rude! Have a huge room for improvement in their service and food! 
17792 4 Love this place! The chicken tenders, chili, meatloaf, and bacon wrapped dates are my 4 favorite things. Lots of flavor and I never leave hungry, and you get a good amount of food for the money. Also, their dipping sauces for the chicken tenders and meatloaf are delicious! 
17793 2 Tacos were ok. I get it's authentic and all, but doesn't taste very good. Very popular; there's always a lineup. Prime location. 
17794 4 A good spot to grab a beer and snack at SeaWorld. Just your typical theme park grab and go, but they do have some craft beers which is nice. The line was quick and the staff was friendly. No complaints! 
17795 2 Good service good food!! Nothing original basically to me just the same as every other frozen yogurt place out there. Nothing special but no complaints. 
17796 3 Ridiculously good food! Had the Ron Burgandy burger here... nothing short of amazing. 
17797 0 If I could give zero, I would. I got food poisoning from their cheese pizza. Spent a day throwing up and felt like crap for another 2 days. What a bummer. 
17798 4 These are fabulous tacos - I had one of each!!!! The Fake Pastor Cauliflower is innovative and outstanding and I don't go veggie often. The staff was friendly and helpful!!! They also do uber eats and postmates too. We will be back! Homemade tortillas out of sight. 
17799 1 Ha bajado mucho la calidad de comidas.los sushi son muy simples. Las frituras son pura masa no se siente que tiene dentro .. ya no es como años atras, que si era para repetir varias veces Y bueno .. en busca de otro sitio mejor 
17800 3 I used my groupon today and everyone was super nice. The young lady with short hair did an amazing job on my mani/pedi. Aside from the wax did being too hot on my feet, I would go back. 
17801 0 Came in for lunch and was interrupted by a roach that I had to kill. Asked to speak to the manager but he was MIA and was only offered a $2 off discount. 
17802 3 The cha cha cha was delicious as always. The crispy chicken was just alright. Jennifer was a great waitress! Will definitely be back! 
17803 3 We had fish & chips, a Tiki cocktail and a peannutbutter/chocolate cake dessert. Food was good, service was good, so yay! 
17804 1 Heard alot about this chicken shack, so I decided to travel from Duluth for this so caled best chicken in ATL......The chicken was ok, but not the best by far... 
17805 4 Damn good chicken menu here. The food cart pod is a month old but there are many choices. I had the Clucken Hot Chicken Sandwich and it was very good. 
17806 4 Mary Ellen is fantastic! If I didn't move out of state, I would be here regularly. She made my tense muscles feel so much better- highly recommend. The spa itself is very clean, relaxing, and a great way to spend a weekend morning. 
17807 4 Love this place! The staff is very polite and considerate the young redheaded salesman made my day and that little kid Matt is the hardest worker I have ever seen I need to hire this kid!! 
17808 2 Great atmosphere, big bar area. food is good but portions are very small for the price. EXPENSIVE! nothing for kids to choose from. Waitstaff is impersonal and sometimes rude. 
17809 2 Ate here for a quick breakfast one morning. I got a standard plate with some eggs, bacon, coffee. My dad got oatmeal. All of it was pretty standard. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it isn't a bad choice for the convenience factor. 
17810 4 This place is great. They did a great job cleaning my truck. It's a little far from where I live but it's worth the drive. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get their car cleaned. 
17811 3 Great sushi. We eat here quite often. My gf loves the Mars roll. I usually stick with the basics. Tuna, salmon, yellowtail. Always fresh and satisfying. 
17812 4 My favorites are the chicken Parmesan, lasagna and the grilled chicken salad with their homemade dressing! Great family friendly spot with consistently good food and pleasant servers. If you want simple, delicious Italian this place is a must! 
17813 4 Awesome people all around. From the office staff to the drivers. On time, careful with my belonging and accommodating! I had a time crunch and a very low budget. They listened to my instructions and just made everything so easy. Thank you Move Drs, LLC. 
17814 4 If you have curly hair and need a blow out I suggest seeing Amy. She is amazing! Perfect blow out with no frizz! I also got my eye brows done and they came out great! 
17815 3 The food is great as per usual. I'm a big fan of the tikin xic so I'm glad it's permanently on the menu. This location is particularly nice because it seems to have more seating. It also doesn't get quite as crowded as the Lamar location. 
17816 4 LOVE this place! It has a fantastic spin schedule. They are very welcoming and have people participating at all skill levels. 
17817 0 Horrible!! After almost 2 hours and 4 phone calls waiting for my order it still did not arrive! Do yourself a favor and pick another late night pizza delivery because you won't get what you want from them 
17818 4 Delicious pizza and huge slices! Came late at night for a snack and one slice had me stuffed. 
17819 4 This is an amazing Chinese based restaurant they have several other Asian varieties of food and so far it has been spot on the portions are hearty and the flavor is very good 
17820 3 I would definitely recommend this place. It's soo cheap for Boston and a really decent haircut. She gave me nice layers and bangs, and she encouraged me to ask questions at any point. I will go back! 
17821 4 We moved from the area a few years ago, but this is still my favorite diner. Breakfast at this place can't be beat. Love the scrambles and the service is top notch. Never been for other meals, but looks like standard diner fare. 
17822 0 Hah! They shut down! SCORE: Jane: 7000000 Jasmine Sola: 0 
17823 4 This is my favorite nail place in Austin! They're always busy but manage to get people in and out... I've never had to long of a wait. Very clean and professional. Would highly recommend to friends and family! 
17824 4 Wow, absolutely incredible food. Had the crunchy pad thai and some seafood puffs (crab rangoon) and they were delicious. Really good, quick service nice restaurant and great prices. Will definitely return soon. 
17825 4 Great food, great service, and a relaxing atmosphere. Came for brunch on the weekend and it wasn't overpriced and my bloody Mary is huge! 
17826 0 5 donuts (the 6th was free) was $15.00. They were not $3.00 donuts. We did buy late in the day but I would have still been unsatisfied with my purchase. 
17827 2 One of the yummiest Chinese food restos in Orlando. Proportions r good for the price. Service wasn't too bad. I only wish they had lunch specials. They could use a bit of cleanliness too, but i guess the dirty corner bistros are the good ones. 
17828 4 Everything you would expect and more. Custard is always 100% better than regular ice cream. Even though they are 45 minutes from us, I would visit here again! 
17829 4 This park is lovely. Very nice with updated play thingy's that kids like. 
17830 1 Over the service was amazing but the food was not worth it, I got the Popcorn and I could barley taste the shrimp 
17831 4 l really want to recommend the kimchi soup to people. It tastes so nice but it's quite spicy people Couldn't eat spicy food should be careful hhh It is such a good feeling when it is raining outside and you are having a small pot of warm soup 
17832 2 My wife and I both liked it here. Food is good. Place is bright and clean. Prices are higher than most burger joints. If it didnt have the hype behind the Wahlberg name, it wouldn't be very popular in my opinion. 
17833 2 It is a little pricey here. House Margarita is very good! Their salsa sauce is really good- not very salty. 
17834 4 Pricey but definitely worth it! Love their tuna burger and buffalo burger. The truffle fries are amazing! Great, friendly service too! Also, thank god they validate for free parking in the garage. 
17835 4 Wow Boston's best little north end B&B This place is 1 block from everything The management was 5 star on service. I will defiantly be back The place you stay really determines how the rest of your stay will be. Perfect 
17836 4 Great ramen. The miso broth was perfect for us but slightly too spicy for the kids. Definitely want to go again. 
17837 0 Not impressed at all. Waiters are over energized as you walk in, but very unattentive when you actually need them. Food is bland and seems to be sitting on heat lamps for a while. 
17838 4 We stumbled on this gem and I'm SO happy we went inside! The food here is delicious - the flavors were rich, the portions were generous, and the veggie samosas were maybe the best I've ever had. We will definitely be back to sample the rest of the menu! 
17839 4 I have never visited this location of legal seafood it was a fantastic location, services fantastic I especially like the decor of the restaurant and the way they had it decorated. Had a very nice feel to it! I would visit this location again. 
17840 0 I just left. I just wanted my nails filed after working and breaking two without a file to do it myself. They laughed when translating the request to the nail tech. So rude! In this climate, where I spend my money has meaning. I won't be back 
17841 4 Free WiFi. Extremely friendly staff. Clean and well-maintained. The team was actively keeping all of the store clean. I ate lunch there and noticed that they always had someone either mopping or, cleaning and stocking the fresh food and drink areas. 
17842 4 What a lovely little gem of an Italian restaurant. I'm not normally in this part of town, but I needed a place to eat and wandered in. Smiling, happy service, quick on he food, and delicious. I had the Piadina flatbread and it was great. 
17843 0 By far my worst manicure experience! $30 for mani and pedi - price was good. As for service, the lady was very impatient and rude with my hands and feet. Also very poor work - friends said they thought I painted my own nails. I'll never ever go again. 
17844 1 I know they aren't trying to be Texas de Brazil, but that is the standard. The service was GREAT!!! However, the meats were dry and sometimes inedible. Dinner may be better, but we went for lunch. 
17845 0 Long wait. Refused to serve us drinks despite being presented with TWO out of state identifications. You don't want our business, that's fine by me. Clowns. 
17846 3 Delicious noodle house with a nice vibe. More likely to return if the prices were slightly lower. 
17847 4 Brian (don't know last name), the cashier is a truly wonderful human being. He should get a raise, a paid vacation, or hopefully win the next lottery. you rock, man! 
17848 3 Waitress was so nice and friendly. She told is the fries were rated the 15th best by people magazine in May. They actually had no flavor whatsoever but..the hot dog was awesome. Ice tea was as good as it gets. 
17849 4 Best sushi restaurant in town! I always get tempura rolls, always made to perfection with a golden batter. 
17850 4 Ordered 20 pizzas for a Visiting HS athletic team. Picked them up and every pizza was hot and amazing!! Kids loved the style of pizza and the flavor!! Been there personally many times but to handle a bulk order so well is incredible. Can not recommend enough!!! 
17851 3 As an Australian looking fire good coffee this place was a pleasant surprise. Especially when I asked for a flat white. Nice coffee and staff. 
17852 3 Consistent quality Chinese Takeout. I have been happy every time and I have gone a lot. Super sweet girl at the front. Appears to be family run. So lucky to have it nearby. 
17853 3 I would recommend this place ! I got the Benedict with veggies option and it was amazing! The service was good, they frequently checked up on us. Only thing was that there is a wait here. 
17854 4 I was in Columbus for a few days and loved this place. The food was amazing! I still think about it all the way here from California. Wish they can open a restaurant down here! 
17855 4 Best Kennel in Austin, my dogs love this place. Affordable rate, exceptional service, wish there were many places like this in Austin where boarding price were kept affordable without impacting the service. (Don't rely on GPS to get here, took me to the wrong place, look for Canine Hotel instead) 
17856 4 The wet brisket was amazing! Melts in your mouth. We stood in line for 2 hours at La Barbecue and I have to say, I would've rather have had Terry Black's again. 
17857 4 I've been to gratzi twice now since it opened and both experiences have been great. We went with a group of 20 people for lunch and they were fast and the food was very good. Everyone liked what they got! The spinach salad add chicken is my favorite. 
17858 4 Really friendly staff! The service is always so fast! My favorite place to get a treat! The mint chip is delicious and the root beer floats are amazing with the fresh custard!! 
17859 4 The second season is just as great if not better than the first. The coffee toffee rivals the chocolate BOMB. There's a new gal behind the counter that ROCKS (sorry I didn't catch your name darlin)! 
17860 3 Excellent food, great coffee and welcomes people from all walks of life. This place is one of Portland's vegan gems. Highly recommended. Get the nihilist, amazing... 
17861 4 I've never had issues here, they've always been relatively on time, and I don't ever feel like the dentists are recommending unnecessary work. Oh, and it doesn't hurt that Dr. Silvertooth was on Kimmel! 
17862 4 My wife and I came in for the first time and we were in for a grand surprise. The food was awesome and very fresh. The decor is very warm and our server Emna was fantastic. If you want a true middle eastern meal this is your spot 
17863 3 This little taco shack rocks! I've enjoyed plenty of delicious, soft, meaty, spicy tacos here. Grab five tacos of your choosing, load them up with toppings and salsas, order a flavored fruit drink and enjoy the lovely Beaverton-Hillsdale traffic. Bliss! * Ok, parking can get a little funky* 
17864 4 Love the lentil soup I also ordered a quinoa salad with chicken to go and it was so good. The service was great and quick. 
17865 3 The food here is surprisingly good! My husband order the ham and cheese sandwich on rye and it was ! Simple menu but good. 
17866 0 I ate at this restaurant years ago, and the one thing I remember is that they charged me for every single Refill that I ordered and Coke. Hopefully they've taken care of that type of practice 
17867 0 I came there yesterday 12 pm since on the Yelp, they saying they open @ 12 pm. However, when I get there it closed. There is only one note on the inside window showing they open @ 5pm. So disappointed with this, they even didn't change the open hours online. 
17868 4 Within an easy walk, this is a neighborhood treat. The smoothies are amazing and made with fresh ingredients. The food is good too. Worth the price. Glad to have them close by. 
17869 0 Ewww, this place is horrible. Staff acts like they couldn't care less about their customers. Happened to run into this place for some shoes but after the experience I had, I will never step foot in there ever again and I advise you not to also!! 
17870 4 Bandeja Paisa!!! The best around. Large portions and not expensive at all. I also love their mango de leche...mmm delish! 
17871 4 Great place! Quality food, clean, and the staff is very friendly. Family run and they make you feel at home. J,M & S your parents should be proud!! 
17872 4 Food was great. Service was bomb. Definitely will be back. I got the All American Bacon Double Cheesburgooshi and was thoroughly impressed. My sister/homie/friend got The Prime Time Filet and Lobster Roll and loved it! Miss Rose was super knowledgeable and friendly! Love this place. 
17873 0 Cash only and does not pay taxes to government. Dark and dirty. Raised prices immediately after HST w dropped. The Pho Ann Nam half a block is much nicer and way better prices and take credit cards. 
17874 4 Exceptional service and even better food! All wine is house made and divine! Our server was Cody and he was awesome!!! 
17875 1 a minute ago It's a great space, but the train cars desperately need air conditioning, and the guy working the order counter desperately needs a welcoming and friendly personality. Nearly walked out just based on not being made to feel welcomed by that dark cloud of depression with a beard. 
17876 4 Filets were spot on as usual. The service was great! The accommodations for our little one kept her busy and engaged. This is why we always come back when it's time for a steak. 
17877 4 It's one of the best social place restaurant and dance bar is good for birthday party restaurant and even if you go with a lot of people the food come fast I'm good 
17878 4 Can not wait to go back. The food in Amsterdam was not this good. Sausages all the way. The pancake is hands down - best ever. Friendly service, all though they were very busy and we waited a while for the food. 
17879 4 Very good food, perfect amount of spice, so filled and content with my lunch... Eat Til you can't eat anymore...super friendly staff, owner is very nice and accommodating! 
17880 3 Awesome food!! If your headed to the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, this is right around the corner! 
17881 4 Such a cool spot, great beers and delicious snacks! Very laid back, a nice outside option. 
17882 0 Went to grab some food for my son tonight - the fries were cold & the burgers were too - unimpressed.... 
17883 0 Our server Margaret was great. The salads were okay, but there was a piece of plastic in our food. The entrees were not impressive at all. Very bland. We won't go back. 
17884 4 I love the creative flavors! No guilt here. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere and plenty of choices. Life is great at D'lites! 
17885 4 I ran into this place while taking a walk. It was my first experience and I wasn't sure what to get. He gave me a list of the most popular donuts and I ultimately chose the brown butter hazelnut crunch. It was a bit messy but absolutely yummy! 
17886 4 Fabulous and elegant. Food was superb, especially with the wine parings. The chef even came around to ask how we liked our meals. Exceptional service! View of the sun set well worth the price of the meal...The dessert sampler plate was scrummy! 
17887 2 Just to update: Unfortunately they seem to have gone downhill recently and a pizza delivery took 2 hrs. Such a shame. 
17888 3 Solid four - great service, good beer selection and great local -I can't give it a five based on the Shepards pie - it was rather boring. Next time I'm through I'll stop in for a pint but likely won't eat there. 
17889 0 This used to be our favorite burger in Atlanta. Today it has officially become the worst burger in Atlanta. After horrible service and an unnecessary long wait for our food, the burgers were inedible! Dry and flavorless, completely ruined our lunch with the kids. Never again. 
17890 4 I've gone twice, bought the T-shirt, and probably gained several pounds. 
17891 3 their lunch deal is great with lots of side items like a spring roll and soup. my favorite dishes are winter shrimp and pad jay. all their curries are tasty and they use good quality jazzmin rice 
17892 2 This small shop has a really great selection of quality beers, from the regulars you see at the supermarket to special ones that are imported directly from overseas. A delicious and unique variety. 
17893 3 Cute ambiance, very tight seating. It is more of a restaurant with a lounge feel than a lounge that serves food. Upstairs is SUPER smoky..burned my eyes and had to go downstairs. Food was REALLY good for a lounge. Drinks were cute looking.. 
17894 4 Our most favorite place for dinner. Food is fantastic! Best meal in Orlando! Love the wine tasting! The barrel is very good! Always ask for a sample when you get seated. The Mexican Drunken Shrimp and the Brussel Sprout Slaw is fabulous! 
17895 4 Delicious cheese steak and Great service. Will def go back. Calorie explosion though, so expect to be FULL and would recommend for hangover. 
17896 4 Amazing fish taco and steak taco. The trio chips with the gaca, cheese and salsa very good. The service was very pleasant Will returned 
17897 4 Can't make a trip to the area without making a stop here for one of their amazing breakfasts. Had the "Good Dog" and the "Goat Boy" this time. Don't forget your homemade biscuit nor the bacon-infused Vodka Bloody Mary! 
17898 3 Pour overs, intelligentsia coffee, coffee supplies, baked goods. Great spot. Lots of tables inside and a huge outdoor patio. 
17899 4 Love this place! The choice in flavors is excellent, it is very clean, the staff always great me with a smile and my kids love the free arcade games and board games. 
17900 4 Love this place, love the food, love the prices and good service. Very busy on the weekends but it's definitely worth the wait. I will say that is one of the best diners in town. Amazing Brunch! You must try it out! :) 
17901 4 Simply amazing. Enjoyed the chefs tasting with 6 friends had a great time and was really happy with the service, the waitress and the food. If I lived in the area this would be a non stop spot to hit up. 
17902 4 Great new bar with a laid back atmosphere. 
17903 4 I eat here once to twice a month.Friendly clean environment best steak tips in the northshore!! They have keno and lottery... 
17904 0 Horrid. Without a doubt, the worst flowers I've ever seen. Customer service is disempowered from resolving disputes with a refund. Result: I have filed a complaint with the BBB. ***UPDATE: 2/24: After a week of followups, I have been given a confirmation code for what should be a refund. 
17905 3 This place overall was pretty satisfactory good ambiance service was good and quick. Servers are really friendly and the food was really good their salmon oishi is a must have so good 
17906 2 Good quality of staff, good deals, no frills, place isn't exactly spotless. A short walk to decent restaurants nearby. 
17907 4 They absolutely made the amores tacos so perfect they were divine. Service is pretty good. A lot of good food. 
17908 3 It's really nice a lot of food there has to be something for everyone best Chinese buffet in Orlando 
17909 4 Boozehound has an incredible concept. Yummy treats made with local spirits and beer?! Owned by a bad ass women who is passionate in every baked good created. These bourbon butterscotch chocolate chip cookies with sea salt are to die for. Try it today!! 
17910 3 Went for lunch and food was very good! Service solid and food came in good time. It's a good place to bring families or hang out and watch sports. The atmosphere is very good and it's a big place. Good menu and just a solid place overall. 
17911 1 Waited 30 minutes over the promise time for a carry out order. 3 people asked have I been helped and no one bothered to actually help until I flagged down the manager again who was the second person who asked if I was being helped. Bad service. 
17912 2 Uncle Charlie's is typical diner food. I've had the breakfast quite a few times with no complaints. Best to go during the week since the weekends have a line out the door all morning. 
17913 4 Great local Atlanta theater, I've had a chance to see a number of their shows and also attend their short film festivals. The shows are either original plays or a great selection of Atlanta firsts, the theater attracts some great actors and their productions are always worth checking out. 
17914 3 Katherine was our server on a busy saturday at happy hour. She did a great job with a smile. We ordered the special, blackend shrimp quesidillas and grilled shrimp. Both very good. Wonderful weather and view. Great for people watching. We will be back. 
17915 3 A little small, but fun to go with your friends, or your brother... whichever. Strategically located next to some fun dive bars and of course, Blue Moon... 
17916 4 Solid. Had the steelhead beni and ya, the kitchen certainly knows what's up! Friendly staff rad atmosphere, "I'll be back"! 
17917 4 Since going vegan I have been in search for the perfect fish-less taco, and I finally found it here!! I only wish I wasn't from Kansas City or I'd come all the time!!! 
17918 4 This is our favorite, trend, upscale but not pretentious restaurant in Atlanta. It offers great food, intimate seating and the wait staff is phenomenal! I highly recommend this place! 
17919 3 Stopped in here today by myself around lunchtime. I was seated and had my drink order taken immediately. When the waiter came back with my drink, I placed an order for chicken fajitas. Everything tasted very good and the service was excellent. Would definitely recommend. 
17920 1 Food was ok, well appetizers were ok, bartender was terrible. Left and went elsewhere for dinner, no need for snobby rude service on a quiet night... 
17921 4 Nice cozy spot to watch the game during football season. Buffalo chicken dip is the best! Good beer selection and staff is always friendly. 
17922 4 My perfect storm of negative events finally came to an end. I received a call from the Director of Guest Services, Peggy, who informed me that she would like help turn my experience around. My stay has improved tremendously. Thanks you for the great customer service! 
17923 3 I don't know why I waited so long to try Brasserie Ten Ten! Today I ordered a take -out & my wife & I were so pleased with our order. It was delicious. We'll definitely go there for a meal or we'll order take-out again. 
17924 4 I have typical Asian hair, straight, black, and thick. They certainly do know how to deal with it. Ernie the owner does a great job. Joe B. is also great. 
17925 4 Always good and great to bring our baby to. Great beers on tap and the food is tasty. 
17926 2 The dragon noodles are pretty amazing. I love the community aspect. There is a urine smell that is undesirable. 
17927 4 Amazing service, and even better gelato! Was a regular at salt and straw but got sick of the lines! This place is way better! 4 scoops for 4.50 can't beat that! 
17928 4 The falafel here is great! The best I've ever had. Everything tastes so fresh and the staff is great! 
17929 4 So wha'd you have for lunch today? Yogurt? That's cool. I just ate a freaking rattle snake shoved into a bratwurst. Spoiler alert: i win. 
17930 4 Walked in and asked to be directed to the best cab/cab-blend for $20 and was spared the snobbery I have come to dread when walking into a wine store with a budget. Helpful and friendly with lots of info on coming events. I'll be back soon and highly recommend. 
17931 3 Not the best sushi in the world but it is a great system with the conveyor belt. It makes it real easy to eat a lot real quick. 
17932 4 This "hole in the wall" has the best Sicilian pizza in the world! I have pizza once a year...for breakfast on Christmas Eve. I'm lactose intolerant so I stay away but I just can't help it for this place. The breads are all great too! 
17933 4 Ok. How CUTE is this coffee shop? Little details in the store makes anyone and everyone feel all fancy and stuff. The service is great and the coffee is wonderful as well! This is the perfect place to take your girls for a coffee date. Kudos to you, pressing coffee! 
17934 3 great atmoshere, great staff, and great food all at a price anyone can afford. The regulars add that much more to the ambiance, very smart and interesting folk tend to gather there. Good times every time. 
17935 4 Awesome store, always clean and neat. The employees are wonderful especially the baggers! 
17936 0 Worst meal ever!!! An hour plus from ordering and I was served raw pasta. Pleeeese! The room looks nice, but no chef should have let my meal past the line, nor allow it to take so long. 
17937 4 This place is amazing! The service is awesome and you feel like family eating here with guaranteed "on the house" dessert when you stop by! I had the salad with chicken and pita , everything here is literally the best! 
17938 4 fantastic burgers. great ingredients, great execution. extremely efficient operation for such a busy place. their milkshakes are stupid good. llano poblano burger is my fave, but there's not a bad thing on the menu. 
17939 4 Such a quick, easy and professional experience. Katrina was so easy to work with. She was very knowledgeable and made getting my auto/renters insurance a breeze! 
17940 3 Great service and solid comfort food choices. Got the steak BLT salad and bread pudding. Both really good size portions and great flavors. 
17941 3 Got the extra large pho noodle bowl and was good! When it first came out, it looked pretty big but it's not HUGE. When I finished I was still a little hungry. The broth tasted really good. There's a decent amount of meat as well. 
17942 3 Pretty legit. Staff is accommodating. Food is always tasty. Spice level is appropriate. When I ask them to make it burn, they oblige. 
17943 3 Order take out from here often. Good is good and service is quick. Crab rangoon are awesome! I like a spiced general tso chicken so I usually ask them to add more chili pepper to mine. Lo mein is also great. 
17944 4 We had my son's birthday party there. Awesome food! Awesome service! The wait staff were so friendly and helpful! We loved it! 
17945 4 Great service and great food. Def worth the price for dinner all you can eat They also have really good cocktails. They just overwhelm you with everything lol 
17946 4 It's wonderful for our neighborhood to finally have a local studio within a few short blocks walk or ride. Great instructors, comfortable surroundings, and people who help make you feel like family - whether it's your first class or your fiftieth. I'll be back for more 
17947 3 You can sit by the open air window, people watch, and enjoy a good meal. Finding a place that takes reservations is a big plus. Our meal was italian and not too spicey. We loved it. 
17948 4 Brigham and women's is the best er and best care in house. Nurses are 10 out of 10!! If you want the best care and comfort while in the hospital, look no further 
17949 1 Seniors come here during weeknights to be social. The place is just what you would expect. Bland and uninspiring food. Old folks home decor. Just Meh! 
17950 0 Food had plastic shavings in it. Waitress felt bad because the manager was taking forever on the phone and wouldn't help. Finally they just offered to take it off and we just left. Went somewhere else for breakfast. 
17951 4 Daily pasta specials...delish! Pizza....terrific! Sandwiches....tasty on fresh bread! Prices....reasonable for the Financial District! 
17952 4 Great food, great drinks, great environment. Can't complain, if you live in Buckhead and have never been, then you have to go. The food is amazing! 
17953 4 Great place to get a haircut. The individuals are professional and friendly! Have been getting my haircut with Bailey and he rocks! 
17954 4 Kristin rocks! She has been cutting my hair for years since I moved to Watertown and I highly recommend her! The whole staff at Salon Sama are super talented and incredibly friendly. You can't beat the prices either! Love this place! 
17955 3 Awesome atmosphere - flavor is yummy on spicy chicken. My only upset was that my fries were cold and soggy and they forgot one of my sauces. I'll give it another try. 
17956 4 Good stop for coffee. Water Ave beans and some good quick lunch options. Super nice people. The set up is better for a visit than a long stay (no camping out with a laptop for example). 
17957 4 Victoria was great on my follow-up. She made sure I left 110% happy. She's so professional and passionate about her job. She truly cares and it shows. I would highly recommend her and the establishment as a natural look vs the Hollywood made-up faces. They are truly talented! 
17958 4 Orchid Thai Cuisine - had the Yellow tofu curry. Simply amazing. Love this place. It's worth the drive a little farther down Park Avenue. 
17959 0 Steer clear late-nite on Sunday. Got to be gone by 12:30. They start badgering you at 11:45, reciting Fulton County laws and reminding you their stopwatch is on if you hint at ordering food. Thanks for making us feel so welcome! 
17960 3 I think their lunch specials (7 days a week!) are a great deal! The food is delicious and Banzai offer other choices than sushi that are as just as tasty (especially helpful for people who aren't as excited for sushi). Great for veggie friend too! 
17961 2 Thought it was ok but nothing special. I had the blueberry bourbon glazed doughnut and honestly it was "ok" nothing special yet I hear raves about that specific doughnut..Why? 
17962 1 We went in after golf today as we have for weeks. It's the same every week, very slow getting food out; and it's not busy. Food is so-so. Today the fries were room temperature and last week the wings were like rubber. Really need to find some place else. 
17963 4 Brandon and the team at Americas Tire is AWESOME!! He helped fill my low tire (happened to be my spare) and get back on the road in under ten minutes. THANK you for your attention to detail and outstanding customer service (BTW he ran to and from my car!) 
17964 4 The best Icecream and amazing staff! Must try the pumpkin Oreo available during the fa/winter!!! Amazing! Peanut butter froyo is the best hard froyo I've ever had! 
17965 4 Best Indian restaurant in Boston. So glad I found this place. 
17966 4 Beyond great food We went for the combo basket special. Tasty and great service as the owner came out to great us The staff very attentive It does get noisy and pack very fast 
17967 3 This location is very clean. The staff were polite and professional even to a wide variety of eclectic characters. Bread was fresh and soft, but the customer svc is what will keep me coming back! 
17968 4 don't let your eyes deceive you, the food is amazing and the staff is friendly!! great and timely service and the food will knock your socks off! i recommend the crab puffs and the chicken! overall a 10/10 experience!! 
17969 4 Had a Panuchos and a Salbute, both with the roast pork. Delicious! The pork was juicy and the pickled onions helped to cut through the richness of the fried tortillas and the pork itself. 2 items and a can of coke = $4.20. Great food and great prices! Highly recommended! 
17970 4 First time here and it was excellent! Food was delicious, I had the Spicy Chicken Ramen and I've never tasted anything like it. Our server was amazing at taking care of us. I'll definitely be back in the future. 
17971 2 During the warmer months you should definitely go to The Local and have a beer on the patio. It is reasonably priced and the laminated menus add that special "je ne sais quoi." Get the french fries, but skip the nachos. 
17972 1 A JP standby, but in the year plus I've been going to Bukhara its fallen from acceptable neighborhood spot to just plain bad. 
17973 4 Thank you David!! Your food was excellent and the help you and Amy provided planning how much and what to get was invaluable!! Everyone raved about the food and the party was a huge success in part because of your food. Thanks again for everything Keith A Torrisi Wilmington, MA 
17974 4 Best place around to get your eyebrows threaded. Fast and pain free :) 
17975 2 Came across this "night market" on my random visit. Saw a lot of people walking to the venue so of course I wanted to try it out. There were a bunch of vendors and others giving free samples. Cool people, great music and tasty food! 
17976 4 Would you like a taste of Boston? Here's a great place to start. Try something new while feeling a little bit like a local. 
17977 3 Why 4 stars? Because legit New Orleans cuisine straight outta the city itself is better. But Lucile's comes as a close second place. We had beignets, cheesy grits, huge biscuits, and eggs Benedict over creamed spinach. So delicious. Will come again. 
17978 4 I am willing to go out of my way for a good cupcake. Great assortment and you won't feel guilty for having more then one because they're tiny! This place delivered all the way around! 
17979 3 The food was amazing and the service was excellent. It was a little loud in the room where we were dining and difficult to hold a conversation. But, all in all, a good spot for our birthday party. 
17980 3 Reviews on this place are pretty spot on. Good food, I generally have the fried chicken or get an all veggie plate. A staple in the West End. 
17981 3 The happy hour was amazing!!! Came here before going to the Amway and I'm glad I did. We ordered steamed dumplings, avocado roll, dragon roll (yum), Rock and Roll was the best! The cajun roll was great. I will definitely be back! 
17982 4 Looks good so far. Fresh cut veggies and well kept looking I'll post back with more after I get my food. So far this spot is great. Lots of different food trucks to choose from that are all around this huge indoor seating area. 
17983 4 Lots of local products and food. Great selection and fun to shop. Excellent to go meals and desserts. 
17984 2 Good quality sushi. Primarily a Asian fusion restaurant so more pad Thai and the like than sushi. 
17985 3 Venue is great. Cool air conditioner for the hot summer months. Don't buy floor tickets. Can't see people on the stage. Go for the first balcony instead. Plenty of bars inside but no snacks 
17986 4 Can't wait to go back to Koy! Delicious, unique food with a great atmosphere! Our server was so friendly and the sangria was amazing! 
17987 4 I just love this place. They fixed my car and gave me excellent service at a reasonable price. 
17988 4 One of the best authentic Mexican joints in the Orlando area. You won't find any lettuce on your tacos here. Service can be challenging at times because it's so busy and kinda small, but it's well worth the wait. Their pork is to die for. 
17989 3 I love the food here , especially the Hot and cold chicken salad MmmmmmMmmmmm And the wait staff is great BUT the Bl Bl bartender is HOT HOT! hahah LOVE that they are near my house, and they serve late 
17990 4 I absolutely LOVE this place! The food is excellent and Bridgette is AWESOME!! They have a number of daily specials and the portions are fantastic. Highly recommend you check them out, you won't be disappointed. 
17991 3 This place is great, I'll be back for more. The restaurant is much bigger than what I expected and the food was delicious as well. I'll take Lechon over Ox any-day of the week. 
17992 1 Drinks were good but I wouldn't recommend the seafood. Got the seafood casserole and the scallops tasted horrible like they weren't fresh. The dressing that came with my salad was also horrible. My friend got the seafood piaya which also had the horrible scallops. 
17993 4 Omg!!! Hands down to this place!!! Their breakfast are the best in town!!! And awesome customer services. I love their benefit eggs and orange juice! 
17994 4 Excellent americano, tons of sugar free syrup flavors, friendly service. Good prices and their pastries looked good although we didn't have any. Delicious and convenient as this is a drive up/cart only. 
17995 4 This was our favorite breakfast Migas taco in Austin on our trip. Has the perfect ratio of egg, tortilla strips and cheese and the avocado on top adds the perfect touch of flavor as well. They also have fantastic salsas. 
17996 4 Food is so fresh, obviously homemade, and delicious! Great vegan options too :D 
17997 4 Best Mongolian beef in the town! Nice service, neat environment~ friendly staff! They also have tasty Boston cream cake, I like that one a lot! I ordered masama curry shrimp, and it's surprisingly good, the sauce is mild, with cashew nuts and avocado*^_^* 
17998 4 This place seems "ok" but overrated. They play records "LP's" and have a superficial crowd of "I wanna be hipsters!" 
17999 4 The lunch special here is one of the best in area. Soup, salad, two roles and a drink for close to $10 
18000 0 It says on yelp that the food truck opens at 12pm. We arrived at 12:10 and the guys tells us it will be another 20 minutes. So we left and went to Zenbu sushi 0.4 miles away. The funky tuna roll was da bomb. I highly recommend it. 
18001 4 The spicy veggie is so good! The servers are very friendly too! The restaurant is clean and has a great vibe you'd want in an authentic ramen restaurant. Highly recommend :) 
18002 4 Love both offices and all the providers! Dripping is clean and not nearly as crowded as Beecave. We were able to walk in with no wait this AM. Thank you Beansprout for excellent care and friendly providers. A+ all around. 
18003 4 I loved the place. First of all the atmosphere was very welcoming and enjoyable. Colorful place with a view. Background music volume was loud enough to be heard but low enough to be able to pleasantly talk. Prices were very reasonable and food was delicious. I would recommend to anybody. 
18004 4 Sarah Ann is absolutely phenomenal! She always does a fabulous job with color and cut. I've never walked away less than ecstatic with my hair. She's always great with recommendations and very helpful about products and care. 
18005 4 5 stars for Happy hour! $5 Monkey Brain $4 for a good selection of good rolls $2 Sapporo What more do you want for happy hour? It isn't Boxer or Hokusei but for a more informal sushi it is great! Friendly efficient service and great fish. 
18006 4 This is a small, cozy coffee house with a delicious menu. Also serving smoothies and fresh sweet breads. The owners are mellow and enthusiastic about keeping this historic establishment functioning at the highest and healthiest level. I highly recommend! In a great neighborhood too! 
18007 0 Consistent food quality and extremely bad service. I always have to wait for chicken to be fried for my order. When the order is wrong, there is no apology, only excuses. Frustrating! 
18008 3 Serving authentic Lebanese food very clean and friendly. Food is deliciously prepared 
18009 4 I got the prime burger-amazing. My sister got the shroom burger and she loved it. The truffle fries were fantastic. Interesting concept for seating people but it works and was quick and delicious. 
18010 4 Authentic. Delicious. Quaint. I come to Troy often for lunch and am never disappointed. It has a nice, quiet vibe which is great to get some work done while eating. 
18011 3 Great food, extensive beer list, and fantastic staff. Less crowded than the Boylston location and has more of a neighborhood bar feel. 
18012 1 One sushi chef didn't even wear gloves!!! When we paid in cash to get 10% discount but also added 18% gratuity which we would 18% no matter what. This was a a month ago. 
18013 3 loved the service loved the food. The wait staff was very attentive with refills and helped with cooking so we could talk and enjoy ourselves. Loved that Korean families were the predominant customer. Didn't like the smoking directly in front of the entrance, so disgusting. 
18014 2 Yump. Love the cuban sammy here all warm & melty. 
18015 2 Nice place for a quick lunch, server was great I don't remember her name. Food was ok, I would have liked to see some dark beer though. 
18016 4 The BEST hotel in Boston!!! Excellent service, the Spa is incredible! Great place to stay, host an event or simply dine in any of their fabulous restaurants! I wish I could give them SEVEN stars!!! 
18017 4 Delicious and cute. Tintin wallpaper! Also, rarely ever a line, so a great alternative to Salt&Straw. 
18018 4 Absolutely a wonderful experience. The crepes are divine and they offer $3 mimosas. You can't go wrong! 
18019 3 This place has the best authentic double fried wings I have had. 
18020 4 The truffle fries...the truffle fries are what dream dreams are made of. The south congress location wasn't as busy on a Saturday as usual but no complaints here. Always amazing service and always quality when I come here. And did I mention the fries? 
18021 3 Good vegetarian banh mi, nice spice, excellent bread. I kinda wish the veggie had faux ham slices as I have seen in other shops instead of shredded bean curd, but will return for sure. 
18022 4 This shop embodies what I love about Austin. In one word: original. There is a pleasant variety of very unique items. I've purchased jewelry, candles, cards and even a stuffed cat (not real) for my son. Three cheers for Take Heart! 
18023 3 Great food... fun atmosphere.... The menu has some creative variations on traditional italian fare. I recommend the caesar salad, it may well be the best one I've ever had! Stop by for drinks at the bar while you're waiting! If the weather ever improves, have a relaxing meal outside! 
18024 4 To Jessica for wowing us on our 5th year anniversary! We will be back for the red carpet affair. 
18025 3 This place is awesome service is great...great place to hang out with friends...so much to do...pool, darts, shuffle board, juke box, pin ball, arcades...plus drink and eat all you want (for a decent price)...I loved it... 
18026 4 Fantastic! So glad I stopped by. Tacos are so flavorful and you can't beat the price...only $2.50! Owners are sweet too :-) 
18027 4 I enjoy eating cupcakes and I have been to many throughout Atlanta and New York City and this takes the CAKE! Best Period!! I'm glad I live right around the corner. 
18028 3 Drank Bell's Two Hearted and fell in love. I'd come back here if I had the time. 
18029 4 Had a lovely Saturday on the patio enjoying a bite to eat and refreshing drink. Ambience was great. Not overly crowded. Music was on point - CJ's Hot Hits!! Thanks Chris and Jess!! 
18030 1 Okay, my first review of this place was a little harsh. If your going to spend mon-ay on getting your hair cut, make sure you like your stylists hair, or get a recommendation. S'all I'm gonna say. 
18031 4 Outstanding food for a great price. Shared the seafood platter for 2 best $28 spent for fish dinner, big variety. Can wait to go back. 
18032 2 Bought a groupon for mink eyelash extension but the eyelashes I got weren't mink; they weren't soft at all :( 
18033 2 I am new in the area found Twisted Tap in Debary very nice, clean, and my server Kate was very nice and kept coming back to check on me. It was very fun I enjoyed the food and Karoke , 
18034 4 I had a great experience here getting my couch cushions redone. Sean was very helpful and friendly. There are two parking spots off the alley in the back! 
18035 4 Oh my goodness, wow wow. Jerk chicken, oh yes. BBQ chicken, oh yes. Everything, ohhhhh yes! If you're looking for some Jamaican food, the real deal Jamaican food then put this in your mouth and eat it cause it's soooooooo good! 
18036 4 Here you can find healthier,affordable place to eat in the heart of citywalk! Alot lot cheaper than any other place! 
18037 1 The Chipotle on Ponce is so much worse than any of the Chipotle's I have been too.....seems maybe they have a manager issue....Lets clean this place up and get better attitudes towards your guests! 
18038 1 Staff is friendly, in my opinion they should not be advertising cosmetic dentistry as they are not great at it. The office is very nice and clean. 
18039 0 They've missed the mark. The food is overpriced, tasted frozen, and took forever to come out. And to top it off, you'll get ants in the sugar and in the salt. Delicious...NOT. 
18040 4 Absolutely, positively, one of the best restaurants in Atlanta. Everything was good and the service was great. Healthy, but seasoned well, upscale yet casual somehow. I will definitely be back. 
18041 4 This place is the best vegetarian place I have ever eaten at. Sometime the customer service can be a little uninviting,however it is #1 on my list 
18042 4 I am only rating this on the bar area. I visit most all mixology and craft bars. They make their own house made limoncello. It was amazing and I have been to Italy.... 
18043 2 The noodles we're good but I feel the pork was very bland and the broth was not rich and well rounded as people discribe it. 
18044 3 Great burgers, great fries! I love the option of getting sliders so you can try more than one menu option. Worth the drive. Yumm! 
18045 4 This place has some amazing pizza ! The pizza margarite was delish,crust was crisp moist, and the cheese was true mozzarella! Loved the sauce too. Cute atmosphere and waitress was hard working and very pleasant! I will come back here next time when I visit the North End! 
18046 1 Was very mediocre. The broth wasn't anything special, and the ingredients weren't great either. On the plus side, the noodles were pretty chewy, the price was reasonable, and the wait was short. Not bad for a cold winter night, and I guess you can't really get much better in Boston... 
18047 4 Great food! Lundon was an excellent waitress with suggestions on popular items on the menu. We ate fried goat cheese, Spanish ribs, lamb chops, hangar steak kabob special, avocado salad, brussel sprouts, scallops, and tres le he's cake. Everything was delicious! Great ambience with guitar player in background. 
18048 2 The Good - Macaroni and cheese!!!! Very nice service over the phone when placing the delivery order. Kid friendly menu. The Bad - Took a little over an hour to get order delivered. 
18049 4 A small place assuming shopping plaza. Very nice service excellence foods and I stress excellent excellent. Vegetarian is out of this world. Very nice people I would highly recommend. 
18050 4 A colleague gave me a gift card for this donut place and that was my first introduction to the wonderful world of Blue Star Donuts. The Hard apple cider fritters were heavenly and so were the blueberry bourbon Basil My favorite donut place in the city ! 
18051 3 Two words, "Kobe Burger." Honestly, order one and you'll definitely leave satisfied. 
18052 4 This place is perfect, right across from Beta Lukas so it makes the night complete after scarfing down spice laden dishes. All I will say is get the salted caramel ice cream, awesome!!! 
18053 3 Lack of variety in choices kept this rating from a 5. Only 4 beers on Tap but overall great staff very friendly and accommodating. Enjoyed the tour even though had to pay more for special event. Sample sizes are generous. 
18054 3 The unlimited steak fries - yummy. The BBQ Chicken Wrap is great. 
18055 4 I loved the jujeh kabob with zereshk rice. I've had this combo before at other Iranian restaurants, and this was as good as any of them. 
18056 2 Ok. Well maintained. VERY hilly and packed into a small area. Bring a helmet. 
18057 4 took my car in after someone hit me. they did the work fast and very well. i was very happy to see how clean they got my car too! the guys were nice and very helpful. their tinting guy is really good too! 
18058 4 Tried this place for the first time today. The food was fresh and delicious. I had the steak fajita taco, corn chowder, chips and salsa. It was very filling. I'll definitely be going back soon. 
18059 3 One of the sushi bars I've enjoyed the most! The place is small and cozy, and the menu options are intriguing. The fish is tasty and the bill does not empty the pocket. Look forward to going back soon! Great for couples and solo eaters. 
18060 3 This place has really good dimsum. Not much else to say--even good egg tarts! 
18061 4 Super great ramen, perfect if you don't want pork broth. The chicken broth is cooked to perfection!! 
18062 3 Great deal on bibimbap with generous portions. Exceptional service. Store front is tucked away behind the starbucks, but worth finding. 
18063 0 Avocado veggie wrap was nasty. Lettuce, carrots, no avocado, no tomato...at $7. Getting a veggie wrap from the regular cafeteria for Piedmont. A mess. Don't waste time coming to this over priced mess. 
18064 1 Foods alright but not for the price...the price was food poisoning! I've had to worst food poisoning for 3 days now! 
18065 4 Best cappuccino in Portland, hands down. 
18066 3 PROS: - Friendly staff - Membership rewards program - WEDDING CAKE CUPCAKES CONS: - Tons of frosting - Cake itself can be dry - Not very flavorful 
18067 3 Senior Patron does normal, not fru fru mexican and it does it well. Good service- good drink specials and consistent american style Mexican at an affordable price. In a neighborhood with $25 Mexican combo platters it is a refreshing simplicity. 
18068 0 Ordered take out from here for office lunch. All the dishes were disgustingly greasy and much too salty. Panda Express items tasted way better than any of the dishes delivered from PFC. 
18069 4 I like this place more than menchies. Lots of unique flavors to choose from, fresh fruit and toppings. The green matcha tea and lychee combo was so interesting. The self serve is a bit pricy but overall worth it. 
18070 4 Superb restaurant and service. We love Korean and are vegetarian - and all dishes we had were excellent. I grew up eating Korean with a close friend who is Korean, and this food was excellent. Highly recommend. 
18071 4 Girlfriend asked for the pear salad that wasn't on the Happy Hour menu and the bartender made it for her. Everyone should try this salad at least once in their lives. Bill 
18072 2 It was just average. The lady was nice but the service wasn't extraordinary so I wasn't too impressed. May or may not return. We'll see 
18073 4 Very thorough, relaxed and informative examination and consultation. I would highly recommend this business. 
18074 0 Horrible location ghetto rude staff nothing is ever correct... Leave out chili for taco salad dressing sauces completely wrong sandwiches..... Sad really 
18075 2 Weak customer service. Room was hot and musty when I got there. Place was dirty. Below par for a Hilton. 
18076 3 Yum... just don't get used to eating it,unless you can afford the smallest amount of chicken ONLY..8 PIECES..$14 
18077 4 Excellent breakfast place. Recommend - waffles. raspberry caramel, dark chocolate sauce. Lavender latte. Be there at opening or be prepared to wait. 
18078 2 So I only gave it a 3 because I didn't like my sandwich that was made with Jackfruit but the staff was very friendly and I appreciate this type of business being in the west end area. 
18079 4 Probably the best raw-vegan place ever...EVER!! I haven't met it's match. Flavorful food, yummmyyy! And I feel great about what I've eaten afterwards! The wait...is on another level. But I think they are making efforts to get better. I almost gave them a 3 because of the wait but alas. 
18080 3 Good food, excellent service, a lovely warm place on a cold winter night. Try the almond drink. 
18081 4 Dumpling Daughter can get away with murder. Cause this place is insane. You guys need to open shop in Manhattan. 
18082 4 Coming from Massachusetts, eaten a lot of oysters in my life. This is absolutely the best place in Atlanta for the freshest oysters. Truly a diamond in the rough. If you like oysters, you need to give this a go of it. 
18083 3 Ordered here since the restaurant had an hour wait, got our food in 5min, same quality. I don't understand complaints about the price. 
18084 2 We checked this out hoping they had one of those vermicelli dishes but they didn't have it. Ended up getting g the mango salad. It was good, but small portions for an appetizer. 
18085 2 Food is decent. Service is decent. Nothing spectacular. I do recommend coming on a Friday or Saturday to suit back and watch the cougars prey on young guys. Truly entertaining since there's not much going on at night in Lake Mary. 
18086 3 I really love Big Town Hero. They have the best bread, sprouts, double the cheese and fresh products. This location was out of quite a few things when I went but they were fast and nice. 
18087 4 Came to try the waffles. Had raspberry caramel and passion fruit cream. Omg so good. Highly recommend. Came on Thursday about 10am and got a place at the bar immediately. No waiting. 
18088 4 I love this place. The food is delicious. I ordered the mini chicken and red velvet sandwiches. The drinks were good too. My friend ordered french toast and bacon. The service was excellent. 
18089 0 Service was slow. Food was cold and was the worse experience in the park. This is the only place I will never eat again in the Universal parks. 
18090 0 Lines so long.... At 930 and had to wait 40 minutes to watch 100 ppl on various lists get in. Then you got to pay $8+ to get weak drinks or 3/4 plastic cups filled with beer. Not worth it! 
18091 0 35 minute wait for tacos?! Plus they were out of chips! How does a tex-mex joint run out of chicks. El Milagro Totilla company is 5 minutes away... 
18092 4 Awesome sandwiches. Great rolls, lots of meat and very tasty. I make it a point to east here any time I am in the area and craving a stub. Their cheese steak in delicious!! Well worth a visit. 
18093 2 Tried their original dog - very thick (that's what she said), like unnaturally big, but good. Enjoyed the complimentary peppers, onions and kraut (optional) to go with the big dog. A bit pricey for one hot dog ($4.50) but you have to think of it more as a hearty sausage. 
18094 0 This place is TERRIBLE!!! The food is just average and cold just waited an hour and a half for our delivery!!! NEVER EVER EVER ordering from here again 
18095 4 Amazing tour, free beers flight, and super funny tour girl. I recommend this as a must to do thing in Boston. 
18096 4 Went for lunch today. Great service from Lydia. The popcorn shrimp salad was delicious. Hot and mild wings quite tasty not to mention the stomboli was well worth the wait. Pleasant and welcoming hostess as well, Sarah. 
18097 2 Tried this pizza for the first time, I live in Vancouver so I went to pick it up. Prices were above average, pizza was pretty good but overall I wouldn't drive there for their pizza, not worth the drive. 
18098 4 always take good care of me. whatever i ask they provide. always are able to service me as fast as they can. i have been coming here for years 
18099 0 Been living here for about 2 yrs to long. Prices r decent considering your going to be expected to deal with the German roach infestation. Defiantly the worst apartment I ever lived in. 
18100 4 It is the best Authentic Thai restaurant that I have taken. The price is reasonable and A food is fantastic. I recommend to anyone who want to take Thai cuisine to be here. Awesome Thai Food :) 
18101 4 Such a fun bar to go to with friends, especially if you love beer. The table taps are a fun, cheap way to drink and the food is surprisingly AMAZING! Please check it out! 
18102 3 My server was friendly and was absolutely fine , a bit on the slow side but still great. Food wasn't bad, and contrary to belief no raw food. 
18103 4 I love this place I got a wide selection of beer and it has all been good. Most of all I love the atmosphere the decor is great and they even have food on site. The staff is friendly as well. 
18104 4 Don't be deceived by the outside, that was the best pedicure I have ever had. Make sure you have enough time, $35 buys an hour and a half long foot and leg spa spree. Thank you Tina, I will definitely be back! 
18105 4 Great people at this dealership. I could go there every day. I feel like they are right next door. 
18106 2 Decent food, fun atmosphere, good service... and a belly dancer. The belly dancer was the best part of the whole experience. That's not meant to denigrate the food or the service. The belly dancer was just that good. 
18107 3 pretty goddamn good, the only complaint i had was the portions were a little too big. which may not seem like a complaint, but both my brother and i both got 3 courses and by the time we got to our entree we were both pretty full. 
18108 4 I had the pan friend noodles with beef today for lunch. The noodles are made in house and are so delicious! $7.95 special for lunch and you get a huge bowl of noodles. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed! 
18109 4 Love eating at kyoto! Pretty good food for the price. Lobster, beef, and fried rice were all cooked perfectly. Everything was well seasoned and the sushi was decent. Our orders came out pretty quickly and I love that theres a drive by. Would return again. 
18110 1 As a noob boulder-er (Level B - 2), this place was kind of small compared to The Circuit in NE, so it didn't take a very long time to try all of the easier routes. If you're a newbie, go to the NE one instead! 
18111 2 Very disappointing. The chicken tofu soup and the seafood tofu soup didn't taste. The octopus clay pot is better. But the octopus is kind of too hard. 
18112 0 I came here out of desperation and I have to say that I ended up vomiting the pizza. I've had bad pizza, however, there was something off (fake tasting). Even the $ slice places around town are better. The deep dish pizza is the most disgusting. 
18113 3 I enjoy the food! Great affordable Fusion food! The fried chicken + waffle was awesome! Will come back soon : ) 
18114 4 The parking sucks so I had to move into the neighborhood close by, to get my queso fix. The queso, avocado margarita, breakfast tacos, and oaxacan coffee are amazing enough that it's worth dealing with all the Oltorf-construction-bs. 
18115 4 Fantastic. Friendly. Conveniently located. Cool vibe. Reasonably priced. Great place to stay. 
18116 2 A very nice, clean restaurant with great service. Bottomless steak fries and root beer floats are a plus. The burgers I found a bit lacking. My tavern double tasted like something I could have gotten across the street at Burger King for a dollar or two. 
18117 3 Pizza and breadsticks were hot. And it had garlic butter and a pepper with it.Ordered online And came to my door in less than 50 minutes. 
18118 2 For all the hype not that good. Warm chocolate chip and the vanilla fudge cake food. Chocolate cupcake dry. 
18119 3 Great little pub. The food keeps getting better and better. Awesome wings, some of the best in Waltham!! We can't wait for the new location to open on Waverly Oaks road. Great beer selection and fair prices on everything. 
18120 4 Great food, great staff. Every one was friendly and worked well together. I agree with the other recent yelpers. Can't wait to go back! 
18121 3 Very high quality atmosphere, food and service. For the reasonable price and long history of great service, this is (continues to be) the best Italian restaurant in Boulder. 
18122 3 Nice place to hang out We love bears here and food is awesome what else very friendly crowd. 
18123 4 Great!!!! Place to chill with friends, have a drink and bite to eat. Great service. Very nice people. 
18124 4 Always good. Consistently pleasing food, served hot, and very clean. I have eaten here over 15 times, and never been disappointed. 
18125 0 I don't enjoy the food here. Not native Chinese food. And most disappointing is that they only receive cash without notifying us at first.... 
18126 4 They offer free use of computers Free printing Free wifi Free work space Dvd rentals for cheap. Free Recycling stickers Quiet place to get some work and printing done. 
18127 3 Good food and good service...and anyone who says it took 1.5 hours for food is a liar...period. What idiot sits and waits that long? But we know waiting time is always tripled. Go there...it is always good...trust me, I'm a local 
18128 3 Huge fan. Great pies (had the chipotle pork recently, awesome), good coffee, and adult beverages. Bloody Mary was very good, spicy and interesting. Good seating, and great people watching. Really a perfect Alberta St. joint. 
18129 4 A very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Food was good. Recommend the beat salad and with crab cake. Will go back again for sure. 
18130 4 Brittany was our server and she did amazing, even saw another server ask her for help so she clearly knows what she's doing. If she's not in charge already she should be ;) thanks for selling us our first passports McMenamins!!!! 
18131 0 Was very disappointed with our sushi rolls that were ordered outside of the happy hour menu. Took about 45 minute to receive our super tiny rolls. Unfortunately not the hot spot for sushi. 
18132 4 Was having a blah day --- until this guy cruised by! Thank you, Unipiper. 
18133 4 Beautiful clean salon! Lots of gel colors to choose from! Get the hot stone massage with the pedicure it's totally worth it :) 
18134 3 Awesome place for the coin. Large, clean and comfortable rooms. Hot tub, pool, and gym are also nice. If you're stuck near the airport, this place is as good as any. 
18135 0 Service was less than par. The new bone in wings are a sad excuse for wings, my fiancé said he has had gas station wings better. We have tried this place multiple times lately hoping it was just a bad day...unfortunately it's not. Don't think we will be coming back. 
18136 4 Always good!!! Consistent good food and service, never been disappointed! I live close to this location and though the wait may be long on weekends, it's worth it:) 
18137 4 These guys are fantastic from the front desk, to the hygienist and onto Dr. Lohmann himself. Very kind, considerate and caring. 
18138 3 This is a nice surprise in powerhouse sq. The volume of food is a great value, the Bao bao's are amazing and you get like 10 dumplings in an order! 
18139 4 What made it great was how the team offered to let us try the grilled terayaki chicken before order for our 18 month old. 
18140 1 What is with the BLASTING music?. What is with all the emps doing everything but cashiering when 10 people in line. Bizarre. 
18141 4 Delicious!! The sandwiches are amazing, the salads are amazing, and the pizzas....YUM!! I am a vegetarian and I always have a hard time with sandwiches because they tend to be boring and not have much taste, but at Modmarket I could eat their sandwiches everyday!!! 
18142 2 Great little spot for cheap Chinese. Not greasy like typical fast food Chinese. Cheap price for an enormous portion. 
18143 2 Extremely limited menu but the service and location are good. Nothing to write home about, but not a terrible place. Best item was the mussels with saffron cream. 
18144 3 Decent drinks, good food, excellent service. I would rate it 3 stars, but the service brings it to a 4 for me. I recommend: Seared ahi tuna salad I do not recommend: French onion soup 
18145 4 Great naija food. Had the catfish pepper soup, then rice and stew with dodo and mixed meat. True naija buka taste. Environment could really use a facelift though ...and oh, they get NTA on tv! 
18146 3 Love the acoustic live music and the service is great. Full bar, comfortable atmosphere. Have a sandwich before your flight, enjoy a cocktail. 
18147 4 Great food (happy hour is one of the best), great drinks, great service...perfect spot for a girl's night, date night, brunch on Sunday...I just keep going back and keep leaving a satisfied customer... 
18148 3 Only good bar in the walkable area. I think its run by same people who do Roscoe's. Quality beer, good food (german styled), clean inside (did a good job of renovating) and it's a decent spot to catch a sports game while shooting pool (1 table). 
18149 4 Awesome beers on tap....I've heard they have good food, but I have not yet tried it....very chill and inviting atmosphere. 
18150 4 There is a lot of excellent ice cream in Portland these days, but there is something about Fifty Licks that put it a cut above the others. This is serious ice cream for discerning palettes. You won't be disappointed, there's not a weak flavor in the lineup! 
18151 4 One of the best breakfast options in Boston especially when other brunch options are only available Sunday mornings. The eggs were delicious and the portion sizes were large, the french toast was excellent. 
18152 4 Excellent quality, taste and service. Some very interesting and unique flavor a. Great spot! Highly recommended. 
18153 0 I purchased a Groupon. I have left messages twice and booked a reservation online. It has been over a week, and I not received any confirmation or talked to a human being. I will request a credit from Groupon. It is not worth the aggravation or the risk 
18154 4 It's super tasty!!! I loved the empanadas and lomito. But beware of the prices they charge for everything even a side olive oil. Coke was 4 dollars for a can, this place has theme park prices ridiculous. 
18155 4 Authentic bubble tea and desserts! Love the tofu dessert. The portion is so generous as well. They have more variety and flavors compared to others. 
18156 3 I love the FLiP concept AND I love their food. The burgers are consistent and VERY flavorful. Their fries are truly epic and of course, those shakes are a must. 
18157 4 The restaurant was very clean and very nice food and tasty very good value price I love it's the place 
18158 3 We come here all the time for lunch. You can pretty much get full off the soup/appetizer's bar meaning you won't be itching for more food past the main course. 
18159 4 Lily did my nails and pedicure she is amazing. I will recommend anyone to come here. The service is awesome and the energy in this place is peaceful. 
18160 3 Tiny but cozy Candler Park location is best for a 2-top or 4-top max. Fantastic paella and anything on the parilla. Heads-up: this place is not about the service but the food. Just come, get cozy and eat. 
18161 4 Great food!!! Amazing burgers, the truffle fries are amazing, amazing shakes/ especially the Nutella shake. I come again and again. 
18162 3 Absolutely great place with great quality food! Also had a number of TVs to watch your favorite games. I would definitely go back to this place! 
18163 4 This place is a forgotten gem in Midtown. Rooftop patio is a one of its best kept secrets. Service was fast, friendly and thoughtful. Food was delicious and drinks were even better. 
18164 4 Place is outstanding. Had the Kona Coffee rubbed New York, Brussels Sprouts w Bacon, Lobster Mac n Cheese with a few Martini's...one word, OUTSTANDING! To be clear, service matched the quality of food. If you want to impress, this is your place. 
18165 4 The prices, selection, and quality are all so right here. Tons of great salads served in overstuffed containers. Delicious sandwiches. Friendly staff. Small, so seating is limited. Only a block from Schiller Park. 
18166 4 This place is totally worth the hype. If you visit only a small number of carts in PDX, make sure this is one of them. Lollipop chicken and garlic noodles are excellent. Dumplings were surprisingly good, too. Lots of great choices. 
18167 3 This place is cute inside. .. The sushi was decent the one solid was the Robins nest roll. Our waitress was on something.She messed up our requests multiple times even after she said she had a good memory. 
18168 4 Very good concept at an affordable fast casual place! Everything is organic and fresh, the place is very clean and contributes to the fresh vibe and nice ambiance. We had the Sabroso Mexicano wrap and the Real Salad.... Both were delicious! Coming back for sure! 
18169 3 Nice that there are many nail technicians and quite a few stations..,especially if you are in a a hurry! Professional staff and the work was great. Will come back again :) 
18170 0 Try using your movie pass here they will just f with you. What a total rip off. No ticket and by the time I gave up no seats. Another example of ausyin going to shit. 
18171 0 Long delivery times. Rude customer service. Orders wrong. Pizza smashed in box with very little toppings. Menu in trash. This location is horrible! 
18172 4 Great customer service. We did not have a reservation but they found us a great car and very quickly. The car was brand new and rode great. Turning the car in was very quick also, and hassle free. Excellent experience. Thank you! 
18173 0 everything is overpriced, personally, I would like to say that there wthe worst food I have ever had! all the desserts are tasteless and the fruit lost its original flavour. what I tasted was only sweet! I mean, lots of surgar.......and no service at all. 
18174 4 Very satisfied with everything. The skewers here are the best! Shishito peppers are my favorite. Very good place to go to for japanese food. Nice traditional atmosphere. Yumm! 
18175 3 Tex is a good place for an excellent quick lunch. Try the Founder's Favoritie (with or without the jalapenos as you like), the Pizza Tex, the queso is good. It's a touch expensive for lunch. But I've found it to be very consistently good, regardless of location. 
18176 4 I like them. I have been to Hopdoddy numerous times, I am happy everytime. great burger and milkshakes. Definitely comin back! 
18177 4 New Delhi chicken pita is amazing! Their sauce is outstanding. I would search them out to have their pitas again. Want to try their falafel pita next. Thanks Pitabilities! 
18178 4 Best selection I've ever seen for boardgames. Helpful staff, nice atmosphere and fair prices. 
18179 3 They're nice. I like that it's locally own it looks like where the employees have been there for a while and they know they customers. The food is reasonable and they hooked me up b/c I'm pregnant which was nice. 
18180 4 This place is phenomenal. Delicious food, substantial portions, great prices and fast delivery. Also, offer a great customer-centric approach in house. My favorite Indian cuisine in all of Boston! 
18181 4 So excited to find this place. Best gyros in Austin. Cute place and friendly service. Will be back. 
18182 4 I feel like all if a sudden the warranty on my body parts expired. I went into Outback with horrible back pain, but alas! Do the exercises and you'll feel better. Ithamar does a great job getting you back to normal. 
18183 3 Def a fan! Haven't been disappointed every time I come here just takes a little longer get seated without reso If you like your Cesar, should def try the Cesar drink here! 
18184 0 Panang is horrible. 5 total pieces of chicken inside. The sauce is a watery mess and tasteless. More watered down sauce then rice. This was a huge disappointment and definitely not a recommended dish here. 
18185 2 I think since we first started going to Zab-E-Lee Thai and Sushi the quality is not as good. Fish not as fresh as I recall in the beginning seems in was frozen this last dinning experience with Sharla. 
18186 3 What is not to like about large portions of greasy molten cheese, and the pizza is not that bad either. The sausage apps are the bomb, these guys have something special. Venture out if you are from out of town and give this joint a try. 
18187 0 This place used to be so good! Now it is just awful. Food is tasteless. Bums me out- they have taken all the tasty items off the menu. Tonight was the last straw- I will never be back.... 
18188 4 Great favor and awesome bubble tea! Fast service and reasonable price Highly recommended.. 
18189 3 You get what you pay for. Quality flavors. Been a few times now: they get it right. You pay for it and it's worth it. I enjoyed the sandwiches and pastas. Service is pretty people with nice smiles and good. 
18190 3 Great food. Fun atmosphere. The service tends to be a bit slow depending on who you get. Authentic Brazilian food and drink. I watched the world cups games here for the high energy and atmosphere! 
18191 3 Quick, convenient, clean. Bathrooms updated & flowers were a nice touch. Radio playing mellow & softly. Very pleasant place to pit stop. They have your typical convenience store items, but also chilled cheeses & meat snacks, even have candles & other fun items to browse. 
18192 4 30 Minutes.. $100.. and my iPhone 5 has been given a new lease on life! It was mangled.. screen shattered.. non-functional... Now.. good as new! 
18193 0 The service is terrible. The bread is low quality. The food is nothing special. They are called Il Panino but they do not serve the typical flat sandwiches referred by most as "paninis". I would go back only if I am starving and it's the only restaurant open. 
18194 4 Fish tacos rock! Fed the whole family of five for under $60 with platters for all w beers, chips and salsa and we were stuffed!!! 
18195 4 this is my favorite donut shop in Boston, and I have tried most of them. the donuts are good prices, and a million times tastier than what everyone has gotten used to (dunkins) 
18196 4 Great frozen custard..... loved it. Had the pretzel caramel crunch concrete. So delicious salt and sweet. Perfect treat on a warm day 
18197 4 This place is solid. There are twenty taps and the food I've had is solid. The bartenders are hit or miss. Their happy hour specials are really good - try to get there before 6. They also have $2 drinks on Tuesdays. 
18198 3 Good selection of beer, wine and liquor packed into a tiny space. Decent prices. 
18199 3 Expensive for what it is, but large portions. So you be the judge. Great lunch spot. Recently added a bar area. 
18200 4 Real butter! Real sausage! (The patties are delicious, thin with just the right amount of spice, and cooked perfectly) but OMG, the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes are outstanding! Probably the best pancakes we have had in years. Attentive wait staff, kind and friendly management, good coffee.... our new favorite breakfast place. 
18201 0 We were very disappointed. Used to be so good. Sausage was burnt. Spaghetti was bland. Pizza was soggy. 
18202 4 Never had a bad meal here. Miss the meatloaf sandwich that got taken off the menu. That was awesome. Great place to watch sports. Friendly staff even though I tend to be one of the few minorities to be here. They treat me well. Definitely recommend. 
18203 2 Prepare to wait in line if you plan to come here for dinner. Soup is great and creamy. 
18204 4 Great burgers. The taste is phenomenal. Not sure what they do to them, but keep it up. 
18205 0 Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Food was horrible, service wasn't much better. 
18206 4 Amazing food. Every time I go there I am always pleased. I'm originally from Florida where I have yet to experience a place that serves an authentic southern cuisine such as this place. Busy Bee is definitely a fav 
18207 0 Worst rental location ever. Made reservations in advance, shuttle took 45 minutes, no one answered the phones while we waited, 1 person working the week of thanksgiving. Not worth saving a few bucks. 
18208 4 The Swiss mushroom burger with bottomless garlic butter Parmesan french fries. The shit!! 
18209 3 Food is great! I love the place but it made my date a bit sick. If you have a gluten intolerance then maybe hold off. There seems to be something akin to gluten in their food. 
18210 4 Bomb selection, bomb location, bomb pricing and lovely service make this my only go to spot for my beading needs 
18211 4 We called to get the Bona Traffic hardwood floor finish while in the midst of a move. David offered to pick up the finish in our stead from the distributor to save us a drive during rush hour. 
18212 0 Do they serve crack in their burgers because that is the only explanation why people would wait 50 deep to be treated horribly. 
18213 4 We use Enterprise whenever we have the opportunity to do so. We have been pleased with their awesome customer service. Our vehicle is always available when we arrive, the staff is professional and courteous. I highly recommend Enterprise! 
18214 4 Zen has the two most important things that a Japanese restaurant should have: quality and quantity. Who can resist a BIG piece of FRESH sashimi? 
18215 4 Store is clean, nice and cool, and well stocked. I noticed that they have alot of great deals more often. Be sure to get on their mailing or email list, 40% off coupons come in handy! 
18216 4 The most beautiful thing that happened to me in my first 30 years on Planet Earth happened in the maternity ward of this hospital. Thank you. 
18217 4 Staying here at the Doubletree for work! The food was great and the room was very clean. The bartender J was fantastic. She was so friendly and personable! I would definitely come back to see J. 
18218 2 Food is ok. Not the best. No other Thai restaurant in Needham results in higher traffic to this place. If you are in mood of Thai food, live in Needham and don't want to drive to Cambridge / Boston for better Thai food, try the rice barn. 
18219 3 I actually ate here a while back with the lady. We had an excellent prefix dinner. Service was great-very friendly staff. No Cointreu at the time for a Corpse Reviver No. 2-no big deal. It's cash only, but they have an ATM inside. Will def be back! 
18220 4 This restaurant is one of the Best Mediterranean restaurants in the Austin Area. Every time I go there, I have a great experience. The food is sooooooooo delicious and the service is exceptional. Keep up the great work and visit their website at www.pharas.com 
18221 1 One word - salt. Everything was way too salty. Three cup chicken has bone shards in almost every bite. Got tired of pulling small sharp pieces of bones out of my mouth with every bite. Mini juicy crabmeat dumplings looked great, but just way too much salt. 
18222 4 Get one "pancake of the day" as an appetizer. The Bella Bella Benny was my favorite Benedict. Great service, appreciated the hostess remembered my name. Wait wasn't bad and they offered complimentary coffee while you wait. Only complaint: I wish they were open to serve breakfast all day! 
18223 0 Sushi here is great! Service not so much. Last two times I have been here they have completely forgotten part or all of an order. Really to bad because they have great Sushi (when you can get it). 
18224 4 Salt & Straw soft serve? Yes, please! Try the cone with a hard shell. Reminds me of my childhood. 
18225 4 The best sushi at Orlando. Excellent service and great ambience to enjoy the food and relax. 
18226 4 Awesome restaurant with awesome food from start to finish! Would definitely go back when we visit Vancouver BC. 
18227 3 I like how open the space is. Definitely try the seared ahi salad! Best rare tuna I've ever had. Lots of beer options. Sometimes they have live music as well which is always neat. 
18228 4 My husband goes to this restaurant for breakfast twice a week. He loves the service and feels that the food is a great value. It also helps that it is the only sit down restaurant that serves breakfast in Poinciana! 
18229 3 Nice staff. Good burger, juicy. You can order without a bun too. Excellent Bloody Mary. Clean rest rooms. Overall would go back for Tasty burger. 
18230 0 SO SLOW I'm hungry and this took45 Minutes for minimal service and a glass of water. Crepes are nowhere to be seen. 
18231 3 Super tasty drunken noodles, pad Thai and Masaman curry. Friendly staff and lower prices than others. Interior lacks some ambience but is fine. Great for take-out! 
18232 1 Spicy seafood stir fry, not spicy at all. Bland and disappointing. Scallops were soft and lacked a sear. There's an extra charge for brown rice. App platter was very good, ribs spring rolls, rangoon. 
18233 4 Ive had the chicken and beef shawerma and both have been outstanding. The garlic sauce is fantastic. Great ingredients and great people. Definitely recommend Noor. 
18234 4 I just found this place next to the Copper Rocket Pub. It was quick and my hair cut looks great. Easy in, easy out...hospitable and efficient. My hair looks great and it didn't cost a lot. 
18235 2 Yeah, it's a pretty solid 3 stars. It's better if you know what to order. The beef noodle soup is good, and the braised pork belly rice. The salt pepper chicken is not bad. Milk teas are good. I'd probably avoid just about everything else. 
18236 4 Two words...five stars CRAB BUTTER! Do yourself a solid and get it. Nice ambience. Creative cocktails. Charming and accommodating GM, helping to workout early opening kinks. Nicely done SNH. 
18237 4 Great place. Highly recommend. Clean, upbeat friendly staff and a ton of selection. You can also you your credit card which is a bonus:) 
18238 4 Customer service is great, the girl at the register was super nice and Informative of the menu since it was as our first time there. And the burger was exceptional. Columbine burger completely blew my mind! 
18239 3 It was a chill environment but their salad was delicious!! I didn't expect too much- quite a good surprise. 
18240 3 Food was very good, the garlic shrimp and the Kobe empanadas are amazing. The best part of this restaurant though was the staff. They were all helpful and cheerful. Having never done taps before they explained it great and had great recommendations. Definetly would go back again. 
18241 0 Been waiting for my food to come out for 1 hour...still had not come out yet. My stomach is eating itself. Chicken may be good, but the wait is horrendous. 
18242 4 This is probably the best Qdoba I've been to. Love to get their taco salad in the taco shell They can get busy at certain times of the day, but the line moves decently quickly and the food is well worth the wait. 
18243 4 I mean, best burger I've had. The El Diablo is so spicy I cried and I LOVED it. There's something on this menu for everyone! 10/10 go for the fries, (truffle or with green Chile queso) and DONT forget the milkshake! 
18244 4 Hungry , only a few dollars , this is the place , good food , large amount, low prices 
18245 1 Walmart:Ross::Target:Marshalls Marshalls is next door so it's easy to compare. Ross is like a warehouse and Marshalls is a much more pleasant place to shop. Since they are so close it's easy to shop at both. I prefer Marshalls but every now and then find something good at Ross. 
18246 0 It said they were open until 10pm, got there at 9:15am and said they were closed. That is horrible customer service if I've ever seen it! Would recommend never coming here, drove across town to get denied service. 
18247 4 All time favorite spot in the neighborhood. Inexpensive and great quality food. Its evident how fresh the ingredients are. Family-owned and they are so accomadating. They really make you feel like part of their family! 
18248 4 I really enjoyed working with Rita for my bridesmaid dress. She is a talented professional and does not cut corners. Thank you for your expert work!! 
18249 4 We had a wonderful meal. Food came fast, everything was delicious. I had the chicken fajitas, 10/10 would recommend again. After eating at multiple restaurants in Disney world and the Universal Studio park this was by far our favorite restaurant as far as food goes. Highly recommend 
18250 4 My son likes the library very much. the building is new and clean, the librarians are nice and friendly. btw: the 3rd floor is for kids. 
18251 3 Good atmosphere. I would take a picky eater here. Its' a safe bet anyone will enjoy this restaurant. Dishes are well prepared, the gnocchi is exquisite. However, I don't frequent this restaurant any longer since they took the steak tartare off the menu. 
18252 3 So I really love this place but it is a bit pricey depending on how much and what you get. The only issue I have is that the price is so high. The staff are really cool and helpful. I recommend the coconut! It is never too sweet or bitter. 
18253 0 This location is the closest to where I live & unfortunately the food service sucks because they never have veggies available every time I visit. Once they did not have veggies AND lettuce available. 
18254 4 The food is always amazing and service is always great. Be prepared to wait to get a seat because of its popularity. Their curry dishes are delicious! Favorite eats in town! 
18255 0 This place was not worth it, the tortillas were paper like and hard to pull apart, the crispy taco shells were out of a box. There was no flavor, lots of reviews keep referring to price but if its not worth eating its not worth buying. 
18256 4 I have never tried NE Clam Chowder before... And this was the place to try it! So good! They have a great Gluten Free menu (just ask for it). Pretty much anything you order will be fresh and delicious! 
18257 4 Great food. Reasonably priced in a high price area. Server was very freindly. If I return to Bean town, I will definitely ear at The Point again. 
18258 4 I went to the Copper Canyon Grill this past weekend in Orlando. I went with some friends and the food was excellent and the service was excellent I would highly recommend this restaurant. I had the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection. 
18259 0 they suck so bad so patchy and one of my eyes came out awful so they look uneven. lashes on one eye are waaay too short and the other eye are way too long. they suck and were awful 
18260 3 The bagel sandwiches are delish; the place is huge and airy. Coffee is really tasty and they offer free refills. May become my fav coffee shop. 
18261 2 I came in and saw abuse line and asked the lady in the store how long it would take- she said 15 minutes. I ended up waiting for 67 minutes. Definitely the best BBT in Vancouver 
18262 4 Excellent food and a wonderful server. And the Mango spiced lemonade was perfect! Thanks for a great experience. 
18263 4 I'm Turkish. I've eaten at all of the Turkish restaurants in the area. This one is the best. The menu is not as extensive as the Winter Park or Lake Mary one but as they say, less is more. The food tastes better here, period. 
18264 3 Great place to go for Happy Hour and enjoy meeting friends there. Food is delicious! 
18265 0 Staff moves slow took a half an hour to get a carry out of a salad that had already been prepared , place was filthy it was disgusting I'm never going back to this Wendy's ever again. Half of the people in line inside just got frustrated and left 
18266 3 First visit! Have tried several salons in the area. This one I will return to. Great hot stone foot massage. Nice neck massage to end the visit 
18267 0 Tip for VEGETARIANS: The vegetarian burrito uses refried beans, which according to the cashier contains lard! I don't know how they can list it as vegetarian... Ask for whole beans!! (They sometimes have it... In the morning/afternoon according to the cashier) 
18268 4 Friendly service, nice environment and great food, we tried the home-made bread, humos, cheken adnana kabeb and speciality meat cooked in bread with yogurt. All were super great except for the humos. 
18269 1 They get 4 stars for the food being good, however they have yet to get an order correct, so they get 2. Will not be returning. Such a shame. 
18270 3 The beer selection is amazing of course, and now that they serve food it's an especially great late evening stop. The staff has always been great and the atmosphere is fun if a bit loud. 
18271 4 The folks working at this location provide a perfect customer experience. From the way the food is plated in the in-car-dining box, to the way the napkins are thoughtfully draped over the sides, to the friendly, smiling faces, this is one place that gets my 5 stars! 
18272 2 Great after work place to hang out with friends and get cheap beer and eats. Lotsa TVs to watch sports on too. Foodwise, it's all right, you get what you pay for. 
18273 3 A fantastic deal for the money. Nice and clean and plenty of room. The perfect place if you want to spend a day at the parks and just come and crash at the end of the day. 
18274 1 Have been planning to eat here from a long time. And curing myself for finally doing so. Tried 2-3 varieties of kabobs. All were pretty bland. They didn't had their famous ice cream. And they took the liberty of including $12 tip in my check. F*ck off. Never again. 
18275 4 Kind of small but fun to stop by. The tour was great but over packed, would love to redo the tour with a smaller group 
18276 1 After checking the reviews on yelp, we went here. But we had a disappointing experience. We ordered malai kabab which was dry. The biryani is equivalent to chicken pulav. Mirch masala chicken was ok! 
18277 1 No carry out. In 2016. Are you kidding me? It's not like they are bones or star provisions 
18278 3 Delicious froyo!! Other froyo places just taste like they decided to make froyo because it's popular and they can make money. The flavors are unique...definitely not some that you can find elsewhere. My favorites are coconut amaretto cookie. 
18279 3 Tried the quinoa bowl and the veggie burger. Was good food. Good ambience for a bar and a place to hang out and relax with friends. 
18280 4 I had the absolute most beautiful, and delicious, Tuna Poki tonight at The Big Kahuna food truck at 5000 Burnet. Holy cow. It was fantastic! The owners are this super sweet Hawaiian couple. It was fresh, tasty, and the portion was unbelievably generous. FULL MARKS! 
18281 3 Cool vibe. Got a salad, and the chicken was chewy/kind of rubbery. Nice location and great service though. I would go back and just order something different. 
18282 3 This TJ-Max is okay.. I have been to better ones. The staff is okay too, the person in the fitting rooms could be nicer though! I have trouble finding the things I need here sometimes. 
18283 4 I've been to many middle eastern markets that serve food and groceries. But I'll tell you what, I've been coming here since I was 15 years old and no other can compare to her food. The shawermas are just so fresh and delicious. They have fantastic service! 
18284 4 The service was awesome! All the employees are super nice and accommodating. The place is very clean and the prices are great! I am a happy customer! 
18285 4 My wife and I went for the first time yesterday and the food was amazing. The waitress was extremely friendly and the service was great. Portions were good and the food was fresh. I had an Italian Pinot noir with my meal which was perfect. 
18286 1 Our server was like, reaaaally spacey. Food tasted fine but it looked kinda like it was heated up instead of actually prepared. Way too expensive to have a spacey server ignore us and then eat mediocre food. Save yourself the trouble. 
18287 4 I LOVE THIS PLACE! Truly the best selection of beer in the Boston area, and the folks that work here are knowledgeable, friendly and FUN. Make sure you check it out, and take your dog if you've got one, they're pet friendly! 
18288 2 Good atmosphere and friendly help. Ordered one of the specials, Posole Rojo. It was very flavorful, but served almost at room temperature. That's why I knocked off some stars. I'll be back some time to try a torta. 
18289 3 This has been a go-to for me and some friends for the past year or so, seems at least once a weekend I end up here with a #20 and a salad roll. Good pricing, quality food and quick service. 
18290 4 This place is the best!!! The staff was so attentive, nice, and helpful. I had the hockey and waffles which were really good! A little sweet for my liking but delicious nonetheless. Awesome bottomless coffee and free wifi! Would recommend and will return! 
18291 3 The Chinese food scene is underwhelming in Smyrna. Chef Chen for me has been a solid and CONSISTENT choice for Chinese in this area for the last 2 years. The owners are very friendly and like to engage in conversation. The Mongolian Beef is excellent. The prices are fantastic. 
18292 1 Don't order extra dressing for your salad and if you order a Greek salad shouldn't it have olives and not big chunks of lettuce. Wait staff is the saving grace. Kudos to them. 
18293 4 I've been waiting for one to open in Austin. I always stop by one every time I go to New York Chinatown. The staff are nice. I drive all the way from Round Rock for the treat. Great selection and love they only add sugar by request. 
18294 4 Really enjoy eating here every time. Love the harvest cakes. So hearty, and the servers are very welcoming and friendly too. 
18295 3 Fantastic little spot, try the spicy wontons and spicy beef noodle soup. Very good in price $. I will be back! 
18296 0 Zombie Apocalypse!!! Do not call this place!!! I literally have been calling for a week straight through out the day and I never get through. Nobody is there, they all got eaten. 
18297 4 My favourite sandwich place in the area. They dont have theBig sandwich I've seen in Austin, but the Wreck is as good, the staff very friendly, and the prices very low! Any day prefered over other chains. Only problem for me is the timing.. they close a bit early. 
18298 4 As always, great food and service (even for a cart). I think it's the best cart in Portland. And it's probably better than most restaurants. I get a craving every few weeks -- always leave very satisfied. 
18299 0 Food def not worth the price and usually Asian restaurants specialize in one Asian cuisine, not 3 which tells you right off food is not as authentic as you hope. 
18300 4 Delicious coffee and other drinks. The staff are very friendly. There is great live music every night. A bit pricey but competitive with other Boulder coffee shops. 
18301 3 Great cocktails and food. A diverse menu with great atmosphere and service. Always satisfying my Mexican cravings. 
18302 4 Out of all the Papa Gino's, this location has the best pizza. Sure, it's on the turnpike, but it's good -- better than the others in Framingham for sure!!! 
18303 1 Stayed there one night, woke up with dozens of bedbug bites. You might want to check beds before sleeping. 
18304 4 Fantastic! Best spicy salmon roll I've ever had. Ramen noodle soup was great too. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu, it all looks so good. 
18305 4 It's food truck Tuesday time of year again. It gets really packed and hard to find parking sometimes depending on the time you come. But great for the family. Bring your blankets and let the kids play at the park. 
18306 3 Great service even on a busy day like Valentines Day. I wish I was offered flower food because I completely forgot about that! 
18307 3 I am coming back here! I am very impressed and love tonkatsu and japanese curry. I have been looking for a place that served katsu curry, and I was very happy to find it here. I highly recommend this place for it if you're downtown! 
18308 4 Stopped for lunch and everything was perfect. The Taco salad and Big Dawg burger was fantastic. Surprisingly cheap to! Good food and drinks and our server was a riot! 
18309 0 Getting through to these people to ask a question is like calling the White House, trying to talk to the president. Customer NO SERVICE at it's best. 
18310 0 This is the worse place to watch a movie in austin. All the thing to hate about a chain theatre. No student discount and higher priced tickets all signs of a bad theatre. 
18311 3 Went here for a late lunch, the food was great and the staff was helpful. Wish we could have stayed for drinks. 
18312 4 I grew up in Miami eating Cuban food so I am very picky. This place does a great job of recreating that great food. 
18313 0 Still just as bad as before. Dreadfully slow service. The red sauce still has a weird bitter flavor. Let's not mention that they microwave their food.... disgusting. 
18314 4 Love this place! Very fresh and tasty. Cool decor. Friendly staff. Inexpensive too! 
18315 0 Just don't. There are plenty other Thai restaurants and places in Somerville to spend your money. Terrible pad thai. 
18316 4 Classy, refined and you can always tell the food is prepared with care and pride. I love the atmosphere here for whether its for afternoon brunch or a nice evening dinner. 
18317 4 I love this place. The staff is friendly, and I love the coffee they make. My favorite, no sugar added ice mocha! 
18318 4 Ahhhhhmazing. This little vapor shop has tons of flavors and a knowledgeable staff. Not the cheapest place in town, but definitely the best-- and I've been to all of them. This new vapor shop is a gem! 
18319 4 brought the family - Wife, daughter and son-in-law for their first experience at this resteruant. Had a Sunday lunch. The ladies had salad bar and the guys had "MEAT". Great meal, great service. worth every penny. It was a great way to finish our vacation...... 
18320 3 Great burgers, good cocktails, nice place to grab a bite but be prepared to wait. They are always busy. 
18321 3 I'll keep this one simple.. Servings great. Food Ok, Saganaki excellent. Service Excellent. Managers... NO presence at all... I hate that. ALL MANAGERS should be on the floor! Love this place and its way better than Stephos! 
18322 4 I love the moon milk!! I get the iced 1/4 moon, and it's plenty sweet for me. service is always polite, fast and the drinks are consistent - not a ton of seating, but a decent place to work in south austin. 
18323 4 We had a wonderful experience Saturday night! We had the swordfish and pork chop! So delicious!! The atmosphere was delightful and our server was so professional! The crème brule was out of this world!! 
18324 2 We ordered the Zeus and added some Pepperoni. The pizza was mediocre. I probably wouldn't order it again. We were close by so we decided to give it a try. It's good for a quick and convenient pizza fix. 
18325 4 The best BC and Deep fried Cali rolls in Vancouver! This place is so friendly and delicious! 
18326 0 After a long day at work and waiting for almost an hour for delivery, the last thing I wanted was to get something completely different than what I ordered. Awesome. 
18327 4 This is the coziest spot and they make perfect drinks. Doesn't get any better on Stark. :) 
18328 4 Was looking for a pizza place in Harvard square and stumbled upon the Just Crust. Had a regular pizza and it was fantastic. The exact right amount of everything. More importantly, the staff was so helpful and friendly. Will be back very soon. 
18329 4 When I lived in Brighton, I lived coming here for a $10 or $11 plate of linguine con calamari, finished off with some Lavazza after. The calamari was tender and wonderful, and the atmosphere intimate and friendly. I live in Cambridge now bit will be back. 
18330 4 The combo saj is amazing. I want to go back just for that. We also tried the lamb gyro and it was delicious too. Excellent cart, if you're not sure, go for it! 
18331 0 Blake's is one of the grossest bar I have ever been to. It is smoky, dark, crowded, and sticky. 
18332 4 Use these people....it's an outstanding experience. I now ONLY use Enterprise, they are tops and I travel constantly. Braintree operation very efficient, friendly and professional. I'll be back. 
18333 4 The shrimp and steak burrito is amazing especially with the grilled option 
18334 4 My favorite place in Portland. Nice people, handy location, clean and well maintained throughout. Excellent breakfast with good options. I will stay here again and again. 
18335 4 It is impossible to have "high" expectation of this place because whatever you imagine, it's way beyond. Seriously this is easily the most delicious japanese restaurant ever in my life. See you soon, my love... I will miss you back home. 
18336 0 Just watched sausage party .the most disgusting perverted downright pathetic waste of trash movie i think ive ever watched .a firing line would be to good for these lowlife scum that created this movie ....smh 
18337 4 We had the potato cakes and a farmers omelette. Everything was very good, and the service we got was even better. Erika was our waitress, and she was quick, helpful and friendly. While there we witnessed the manager (assumed) help customers and work tables. Great experience! 
18338 3 Decent food with a nice view for a steep price. Nothing too special about the food but the service was excellent and the restaurant had a pleasant atmosphere. We sat inside but the outside seating looked very nice on a summer day with a live band outside. 
18339 3 Went here on my bday and they were so great! Free dessert! The sake was amazing and so was the food- definitely different though, don't come here if you're not an adventurous eater! Gets pretty busy, so try to show up early like we did! 
18340 0 It was a grimmy look on the inside like last night party had just ended. Then we ordered and waited over an hour for our food before we left. While we waited there was alot of coughing and sneezing in the kitchen area. I won't go back. 
18341 0 The appetizers had too much MSG! We had to wait over a hour for our entrees! The fish was over deep fried. The walnut shrimp had no flavor. We won't be back again. 
18342 1 The food was good, but there is no way to rationalize the price. For a party of four, It was $170 with one bottle of Wine - we were all still very hungry afterwards. 
18343 3 Love the steamed chicken dumplings and the singapore rice noodles. Sushi is good quality and tastes great! Their hot oil is too good! 
18344 4 I've spent five years searching for quality, boiled bagels in Portland, and finally found them at Henry Higgins Boiled Bagels. They come to the Beaverton Saturday market, which is where I pick mine up. They will do special orders for pick-up at the market if you call ahead of time. 
18345 1 The chicken was so dry and tough! :( Sauce was delicious though. 
18346 4 I'm a big dumpling fan. Been many great places in HK and Shanghai. This a great little place with really good dumplings. I always make it a point to stop by when I'm in Vancouver. Cozy, small, good service. 
18347 3 One of the best fried wings. It was crispy till the end and i enjoyed it with fried rice and a diet coke. You can't beat the price and the hospitality of the old couple from Korea. So stop by and get your grub on 
18348 4 Amazing food, beautiful atmosphere!! The server was super awesome and totally accommodated our large group! 
18349 3 I think the food here is great. I've had the salads and the burgers. The appetizers are really good as well. Who doesn't like totchoes? I do wish the seating was a little more comfortable. 
18350 2 Okay food. Go there for the drinks and environment. First time we went our waiter told us we had to pay for water. Second time our waiter was like "no that is unheard of". Definitely get the butter beer. It's amazing. 
18351 2 You wouldn't go here if you weren't looking to be a part of the DTES grittiness..... it doesn't disappoint. Gritty gritty gritty 
18352 4 I've been here a few times and have been really happy. The owner even remembered me from a few years earlier! They do good work, are quick, the price is good, and they're easy to work with. Enough said! I highly recommend them. 
18353 3 A welcome addition to the neighborhood. Was sad when the previous place closed. The coffee is good, cinnamon roll not bad, and a very clean, trendy feel and setup. I look forward to returning soon. 
18354 0 SHAME on you jcp! INSULTING larger women by putting their clothing upstairs away from all others except children and lingerie. Why don't you put the size 42 and up men'department separate floors as well? However, kudos to Emy for taking my rant in stride! 
18355 4 Awesome. Great authentic food for a great price. Don't let the building fool you. It is well worth the wait time 
18356 4 This is a great place to find inexpensive boxes! The customer service is fabulous and we appreciated his expertise in packing ideas 
18357 4 First time to Orlando and try to find a good place for sushi. This restaurant is nice and everything we had was good. Highly recommended! 
18358 4 Great portions with great flavor! Spicy Basil Fried Rice was delicious and am about to eat my leftovers right now. 
18359 4 The guys here are super nice and helpful. We are newbies and brought our toddler for a morning on the lake. They helped us get outfitted with a double kayak (with a spot for our son in the middle), AND he got his own paddle which made him very happy. 
18360 4 I visited this bar last weekend with some co-workers and the bartender Jennie provided excellent customer service. 
18361 4 This is our favorite hidden gem. We've started to visit a couple times a week because it's affordable, delicious, quick, and the staff are super friendly. Best Ethiopian restaurant in Austin! If you don't know what to get, try the Everything Veggie platter. It's the best of all the things! 
18362 3 The place is very relaxing. It's not very crazy like the Backstage next door. The happy hour is everyday from 4-6 and 10-12. The outside seating is pleasant with the propane heaters. 
18363 3 Delicious frozen custard stand that offers a variety of flavors. The prices were reasonable and the staff friendly. 
18364 4 Delicious food and drinks. Signature Cesar, butternut squash ravioli, tuna tataki are among my favorites. 
18365 3 I enjoyed a bloody mary and the chicken and waffles. What a great staff and space. I'm looking forward to coming in the warmer weather and enjoying the patio! 
18366 4 Just went to Harvest the first time last week. As a European, I really appreciate the nice bread selection! Keep it up and I look forward to future purchases! 
18367 4 It's been almost two years since moving to SW and I'm still traveling across town for the wonderful service and attention to detail. 
18368 1 VERY slow service, and I was one of the only people in the place. This location is close to my house so I go there, and almost always I walk away asking myself why didn't I go to another location. Wonderful renovation though... 
18369 4 Been coming here for over a year. They move a little slow, but are super hospitable, nice and charming. Food is consistently good with wide variety. Desserts are crazy good and so is the basil lemonade... 
18370 3 The host who took my order excellent down fall only be careful when you pay and they ask for tip it goes to the cashier and they don't do nothing but just check you out. That's a scam in my book. 
18371 3 very cute, european-sized restaurant :) i had a veggie crepe that made me go "mmm..." after each bite. my fiance had a linguine with seafood that had the sweetest, freshest mussels -- i almost wanted to steal his dish instead! 
18372 3 Quick stop after brunch. I got coconut cookies with coconut ice cream. The coconut cookies were amazing. The ice cream was normal. I wish they had more variety. They let you sample. I wish they had red velvet cookies. I would go back. 
18373 3 Agreed.... The Grilled Octopus is amazing. Our waiter was outstanding and very attentive. His knowledge of the menu was second to none. His name was Nick. That's probably not going to help you much. For fresh mediterrenian food, you canning go wrong here. Have the Loukemades for dessert.. 
18374 0 The actual lunch menu at Parish is drastically different from that shown online and includes a single vegetarian sandwich- eggplant. I will not be spending my money here. 
18375 4 A great childhood memory. I will never forget when a demonstrator during the dolphin show told a younger performer that he forgot to take off his socks before entering the water. Super talented Dolphins and an amazing place for kids. 
18376 4 This little place has great food and excellent service. The jerk chicken sandwich is really good. I would recommend Mami's LA Cubana to anyone who enjoys real Cuban food. 
18377 3 Quick, efficient service.... awesome that it is within walking distance and they are open late-ish (6pm?) cluttered, but hey, they got boxes, packing supplies, and friendly staff to help you with your packing/shipping needs. ( | ) 
18378 3 Went here after going to the St. Patty's Day Parade. Was pretty decent. I expected a better beer list. Though to be fair it WAS St. Patrick's Day. Food was tasty, atmosphere was fun. Everything I was looking for when walking home from a parade :-D 
18379 4 Love this place! I got a lychee juice and the vegetable pho. The pho has a great amount of broth and noodle proportion and is priced well. 
18380 3 The first time I went here they would have gotten one star. Their food and service quality has gone up. They have really good pizza, really good wings and good burgers. And really yummy alcohol. Sometimes it gets crowded. 
18381 4 So fabulous!!!! OMG!!!! I found my favorite restaurant!!! Very Clean! Friendly staff! GREAT FOOD!!!! Amazzzzzing!!! 
18382 2 Good place to come and watch a game. Cheap beers, good atmosphere. Food is your typical bar fare, but priced well. I wish they had a better craft beer selection, but I can't complain. 
18383 4 Jen Lyons, phenomenal nails and care! She's great and precise work, you'll be glad you went! 
18384 4 This place has the best service! The food is great and the servers are exceptional. The martinis are great and the pretzel bites are the bomb. 
18385 0 By far the worst dealership I've been too! The service advisors are unhelpful and pushy and full of attitude. Came to get my car serviced twice and will never come back again. 
18386 2 Sold me expired(not best before) product and would not return it. Not happy about that. Update: store called me and states they would give me a credit for the expired product. So I am happier. Updates stars from 1 to 3. 
18387 4 The avacado toast and the sandwich du porv were both awesome. The eggs were cooked to perfection. Loved this place. 
18388 4 Come early... they get crowded quickly. The Reuben was recommended. Well worth the trip. 
18389 1 Not a good place to eat, food doesnt have good taste, and I dont like places where they want to charge you for the chips and salsa, if you white you may like it, but if you mexican you would know the difference. Service was bad and food expensive. 
18390 3 Hot Hush Puppy's and honey! Need i say more! 
18391 2 Cheap lunch and typical fast food sushi quality. Really fast service. Salmon in rolls are kind of slimey and seaweed is too chewey. 
18392 2 The food is so good!!!!!! I brought my family here and the girls that work there are rude and have attitude problem no service with a smile no nothing it just made me feel really embarrassed that I brought family after I just raved about how wonderful this places 
18393 2 I got a strawberry creme frappacino, which tasted okay. The service was SO SLOW that I almost missed my bus. 
18394 4 Great coffee shop, delicious fresh food and great ambiance, specially during the warm weather time, where you can sit in their beautiful terrace. 
18395 0 I loved this restaurant so much- BACK WHEN IT ACTUALLY SERVED KEBAPS. First you take away the corn, then the garlic sauce, and now the sandwich itself. I hope you go out of business since that obviously seems to be your goal. 
18396 4 A hassle-free, quality haircut, friendly staff and a super clean environment. I'm happy to have this place in our neighborhood now! 
18397 3 Always bubbling with Irish alcoholism and glee, this place is one of the few in Atlanta you can find a good scotch egg, and a wall of whiskey to keep you satisfied for a year. 
18398 0 I wanted to like this place, but I just can't. The chorizo taco was gross, the pastor failed me too. The steak in the taco/burrito was not the quality I expected. The catfish taco was ok and the salsa dips were probably my favorite part. Disappointed :( 
18399 4 I had Donut Express do a custom cake for the grand opening of my dog grooming salon. Not only was the cake itself delicious, but the artwork that was done was amazing. She captured my dogs perfectly! LOVE this place. 
18400 4 Great food! Cochinita pibil is my favorite dish in town hands down! Strawberry swirl marg is great on a hot atfernoon. 
18401 3 TOP 5 reasons why this place is amazing.. 1. old school arcade games....check 2. $4 pitcher's....check 3. pizza that should be illegal......check 4. condiments for the food are in a LUNCH BOX....check 5. food w/ friends in a uber cool atmosphere....check ........that is all. 
18402 0 Always excessive wait times (over an hour). You shouldn't have to take a day off of work to see a dentist but do if you go here. 
18403 3 I eat here pretty frequently when I'm working. They have good food and delivery quickly! Thumbs up! 
18404 4 Love that it is open til midnight, has wifi and takes cards :) I'm glad I found this place to use until the ones in my place are fixed. The laundromat near me is the same price but quarters only, too much hassle. 
18405 4 Delicious sauce & crust... And everything! Used GPS to find from Petsmart. Wandered around in residential area nearby. Almost gave up. Back where we started. There it was two doors down (next building) from the pet store!!! So glad we found it!! Yummmmmm! 
18406 3 Very good, fresh food. Best long Island I've had in a long time. Our server was a bit novice but the food and bar long island made up for it. Happy hour margarita not so great, but what do you expect for that price. 
18407 3 This all-you-can-eat is $21.95 and it's DELICIOUS. Also it's TWENTY TWO DOLLARS. Yes the service may be a little slow and yes they limit how much you order each time but it's TWENTY TWO DOLLARS. 
18408 4 The best pedicure I have ever had from Ms. Zoe. My feet are very smooth and silky. The prices are good and the pedicure is worth every penny. 
18409 4 Great location, clean, organized, and Kim is awesome. My shoulders and back are always so tight and tense, but definitely felt way better after visiting this place. Will be coming back. 
18410 3 I have been to the Colonial House a few times. This is a homely restaurant with quality portions and food. They have a good size menu from fish to Italian. The restaurant is tucked in the middle of a neighborhood with a parking lot on the premises. 
18411 4 so totally dope. just finished a box... my brain is melting. 
18412 4 It's about time. It's a pretty good place for breakfast. I haven't tried lunch. It's clean and the hostess and waitstaff is great too, experienced. We'll definitely be back. 
18413 4 Top notch professional services, give a lot of details on all my questions and explained everything during the home inspection process. 
18414 3 The best Thai in the area, which isn't saying much IMO. My favorite dish here (not Thai of course) is the Singapore rice noodles. 
18415 4 Very impressed. Excellent beer selection, but if you're looking for generic beer then lonestar and PBR is all you'll get (thank god they're not selling out!). Food is great, service is great...a definite must to try! 
18416 4 Great coffee, good place to work, nice patio, and nice live music at night. Really nice to see the place go from a coffee shop to a small music venue at nights (breaks up all the people on their laptops a bit). 
18417 4 Rustic and Romantic. Huge blazing fireplace. We celebrate all birthdays here and have enjoyed each one. They bring our Personalized menus for the birthday person. The food and service are always amazing. Cheers!!! 
18418 4 Delicious donuts and awesome caramel latte! Coffee isn't made quickly but it's damn good! 
18419 3 Solidly good, always. Perennial faves: falafel, eggplant salad, and cauliflower salad. Pro tip: get your meal as a platter (sandwich, hummus/baba ghanoush, and two sides). Then you'll have plenty for two meals! 
18420 1 Padaria Brazil is a brazilian bakery in allston, that's always got portuguese-speakers hanging out in it, and you'll probably be addressed by the staff in portuguese at first. they have very dense cakes and meat-filled savory pastries. its worth a try for variety, but I'll probably never go back 
18421 4 I just had my car serviced at Beaverton Nissan along with some other repairs that were covered under warranty. They were very helpful, and professional and had the work completed when they said they would. I will definitely take my car back there for service! 
18422 4 Best shop for adorable japanese and japanese-inspired gifts for the home and a darling card and jewelry selection, too! The owner has a great eye for the shop. Affordable enough even for me! I want to move in and live there. Sigh. 
18423 4 Great sushi restaurant located off 51st near Berkman in near the H-E-B. And everything we ordered was on point. Highly recommended. 
18424 4 I love this place when I was living in Brighton. Very good attitude and give you pretty nail. 
18425 3 Great food. We had the NY style pizza and enjoyed it a lot. Our server Victor was very nice and friendly,he even opened the door for us when leaving (so sweet)!! Recommend this place ! 
18426 0 Smelled bad, had flies everywhere, workers were rude, and the food was way too salty and thrown together. 
18427 1 Friendly service and great food, however the atmosphere was a little slow. 
18428 4 Pizza is always awesome!!! Ask for the Big Johns BBQ Pizza! Insane good! The cheese steak is very good. And the wifey says the chicken parm is to die for! 
18429 4 Always a good meal here. The burritos are enormous and delicious; they have rice and beans inside, but the meat portion is still fairly generous. I particularly enjoy the wet burrito and the viva-mexico burrito. The nachos are also pretty great. It's hard to go wrong here. 
18430 4 Skyline chili!!!!!!! I didn't even know I could get this in Portland and now I need it on the reg. My mouth is like yay but my waist is like aw naw! Oh well as they say at Fat Albert's "A waist is a terrible thing to mind." 
18431 0 I lost my phone. I didn't have insurance. I shouldn't be shamed for it. I felt that I wasn't being listen too and as though I wasn't even there. I did not have a good experience. Ended up not getting a phone and walking out. 
18432 4 Really good quality food at a reasonable price would definitely come back again soon 
18433 3 Super fun! Guarantee you'll find something there for yourself that you didn't know you needed. Also, terrific for gifts of all ages. LOVE this place! 
18434 1 Quite mediocre. The service was bland and the food was boring. And who makes pad thai with sweet and sour sauce? They had a nice selection of rolls, but unfortunately the ones we ordered were less than stellar. I will not be going back. 
18435 4 My family and I love this place. Food is great and inexpensive. I just wish they were open on Sundays. 
18436 4 These guys are AMAZING! The Staff is super Friendly and makes some of the best drinks in town. Stubs BBQ right there, a great laid back feel, and great prices. I come here to unwind and enjoy the patio and atmosphere all the time. 
18437 2 Clean, busy, and friendly. The fire chicken w/ veggies was okay. At $7.95+$1.00 for veggies, I expected a little more. The non-battered meat is a nice healthier alternative to other local Chinese restaurants but the flavor was a bit bland for my taste. 
18438 4 Fabulous Happy Hour! Fun French 75 and delicious tapas plus great service, interesting interior design, and comfortable private booths. Convenient location in the Galleria with plenty of parking and great shopping. Try the pumpkin appetizer. 
18439 4 This place is just simply awesome. Service is outstanding. Food is top notch. The breakfast platter I had was great. Full of flavor, and cooked perfectly. Go here. Go here now! 
18440 4 The absolute best burger & fry place in Portland! The ingredients are always high quality and the finished products always taste amazing. The service is also pretty quick, even on busier times/days. The staff is very attentive to your needs. 
18441 3 Love this place, right next to a lake and a fun fountain. However warning.. Shawna who works there is unfriendly and has the customer service skills of a shy slug.. Avoid her! 
18442 3 Nice place for taking the family to the movies. Nothing fancy, but still comfortable. Inexpensive tickets and treats. They are remodeling the bathrooms so it can be a long wait if you need to use it. In general it was a nice experience. 
18443 4 This is my son and my favorite toy store and play area. They have such high quality toys, great events, and a fun play area. Plus the owner is really friendly and a mom herself. 
18444 4 AMAZING!!! had the shawarma wrap!! Wanted to order a second one.. Might just go back for lunch tomorrow! Awesome service!!! Amazing food! 
18445 4 Came in here for a quick drink with a buddy. Great local bar with friendly service. Only had the avocado+corn fritters and they were good. Nice selection of beer. 
18446 4 5 Stars and then some... if I could leave more, I would! Haven't had service like this in years... they definitely made sure our first time wouldn't be our last. Kudos to Nia, our server who was friendly, bubbly, attentive, and delivered kick butt food! See you soon Marlow's! 
18447 4 Taking a break from the park. Upscale yet laid back. Great drink menu, can't wait for dinner :) 
18448 4 Great service,good food, and reasonably priced. Ample parking. Vegan options. This I presuming pho hut consistently provides some of the best Vietnamese food 
18449 4 I go here probably every other week.......the are the ABSOLUTE BEST CUPCAKES The toffee and red velvet are my FAVORITE! Thankyou for being the best ladies!!!!!! 
18450 3 Just got our new couch delivered this weekend and we are loving it! Delivery came earlier than initially expected and the we got a great deal on our sectional. Thanks All! 
18451 3 A good experience. Clean hotel. Nice staff. Went above and beyond to accommodate. Definitely one of my go to hotels in the central Florida area. 
18452 4 Received a beautiful, unique arrangement with fast, friendly service at a great price. 
18453 0 I got 3 treatments did absolutely nothing, no results, talk about wasting my time and money. The hype is all about nothing, I am in my sixties, retired, and should have known better "sounds to good to be true usually is not" 
18454 4 Best damn burgers on South Congress! They're quite pricey but you get what you pay for. 
18455 3 Great Chicago style hot dogs. This definitely filled a void in Columbus as we've been without a Chicago style restaurant here for a while. There used to be a place in Hilliard called Windy City Grill that was basically the same concept minus the pizza and beer. 
18456 4 One of my new favorite spots. They have a really amazing happy hour (6$ for grilled cheese, soup and salad) their nachos are pretty cheap/yum and the bartenders are always nice and usually super hot. Most importantly, you can smoke outside with your drinks and be warm. 
18457 3 Great burgers! Everything is fresh and tasty. The only down side is the long wait, but the line does move pretty quickly. We will definitely return! 
18458 3 Good solid tasty Chinese cuisine. I've been in Cedar Park for the last year and struggled to find quality Chinese. So I'm extremely happy! Not too expensive and good food. 
18459 4 For the price...this is as good as it gets! For $6 you can get chips and salsa plus a delicious meal that is easily enough to be two meals. My husband and I are addicted and go almost once a week. It is sooooo good!!! 
18460 4 I ate for 2 hours and had to roll out. This place is the meaning of life. Its too good to be true and definitely worth a try. I do recommend going there hungry 
18461 0 Would not and will not recommend this place. I ordered crab stuffed prawns for $29 and received prawns which where basically stuffed with cream cheese and could not taste any crab. The meal was low quality overall; however, the server was decent. 
18462 4 Just had a fantastic outing to Riot Theater with a group of 10. Hilarious show, very intimate setting, and a super night all around. Its so nice to have something like this in JP! Highly recommend!!! 
18463 3 Not being a burger fan, I wasn't terribly excited when a colleague I was meeting for a business lunch suggested this place. I can honestly say that Hopdoddy changed my impression on burgers overall--the diablo was AMAZING. Definitely will go here again! 
18464 4 Awesome food! Being from Southern California I'm so excited to have found one out here in CO. If you need a recommendation, I really enjoy the bonsai bowl here. 
18465 1 We've been to Sympatica many times in the past and it was always a good experience. This last time though it was terrible. We were a group of 4 and all 4 dishes were bad. Big dissapointment, it felt like we were at a completely different place. 
18466 4 Had a great experience. Kristen was so efficient and friendly. Food was great. Will come back. 
18467 4 This place is great! Friendly employees, nice clean cars and they even give you a ride if needed. 
18468 3 Titaya's is the best Thai I've had in Austin. It's consistently good, the staff is unbelievably friendly, and it's the only Thai restaurant that has never made my insides angry. Please go here a lot. 
18469 3 True Grounds would be my favorite place to hang out and do work if I lived closer. Food is good, coffee is solid, and they have cushy seating and free internet! yay! There are way too few coffeehouses in Boston with couches. Staff are super nice. 
18470 3 Love that you can get a half pint of beer and shot of whiskey. Lots of choices. Happy hour is great. Ordered Mac and cheese special for five bucks which had mushrooms and roasted chicken. 
18471 3 Amazing ride but the queue is horrible. 2.5 hours trapped within the building with no visible toilets or water fountains. 
18472 4 Huge portions of delicious food for brunch. For $15 I was absolutely stuffed with an omelet and pancakes. It had a very lively atmosphere that seems like a lot of fun at night. 
18473 3 Great expansion and renovation. New equipment. New Studios. Great friendly staff and instructores. 
18474 4 Terrific beer and food. The pumpkin pedaler is terrific and the burger of the day with bbq, cheddar and a fried egg was amazing. Staff were terrific as well! 
18475 4 Wow, the pizza here is excellent! And the service was outstanding! Our server even offered to fill up my empty water bottle and kept it cool in the fridge until we left. I highly recommend this place! 
18476 4 Ordered the dark chocolate mouse coconut praline. Very soft rich and just the right amount of sweetness. Cost was $5. Would come again! 
18477 3 My father and I ate here last week. The cold weather was perfect for soup, so we both ordered that (Lemon Calamari for him and Tom Yum for me). We were both impressed. We shall definitely return to sample their noodle and curry dishes. 
18478 3 A veritable wonderland of hooch. The wine selection is vast, almost daunting to navigate. Good quality sale wines & lots of beer choices. Nice teas, spices and little snacky-things as well. Although the variety of port, sherry and desert wines is a bit skimpy. 
18479 3 Great beer and food. Got the grilled teriyaki chicken plate with potatoes and a side of chips. Delicious and classic Portland venue with beautiful outdoor balcony area. Service could be quicker but not complaining 
18480 1 Good coffee but slowest and rudest service. Took over 15 minutes to get a single latte. It was mildly busy but not that busy. Joke. 
18481 0 This Burger King gets a big fat zero. Bathrooms are filthy! The franchise need to inspect his place and close it down for deplorable sanitary conditions. 
18482 4 El patrons is an Orlando gem that is easy to miss. They make everything by hand and you will find yourself craving it after you leave. 
18483 4 We eat lots of pizza in austin, but this place is freaking great! Frost mug for my beer, and the Athena (add pepperoni), the best. Just the best. Also, the place is super clean and friendly. Worth the try and good prices. 
18484 0 Long wait in 35 degree weather for no reason place wasn't even at capacity they just wanted to look busy, sticky floor and light barely dimmed. Only good thing is $1 teriyaki sticks that the walk around with while your drinking 
18485 4 Enjoyed a very delicious bowl of homemade chicken and veggie soup. Employees were super friendly too. 
18486 2 Food was very tasty, and service was fast. But I'm not too impressed with miso. Not the best Japanese food. When it said grill, I was expecting the food to be cooked in front of us like most Japanese. 
18487 4 Love this place! Fresh sashimi and delicious rolls,plus Good service. I live in the nearby apartment. Will definitely come here again. 
18488 4 Great customer service! I left without my car mats and when I returned for them, they rewashed my car for my troubles. That's how you keep a customer for life! 
18489 4 Wow great family Italian restaurant. I love the food here and I can't wait to eat there again. 
18490 2 Copious convention space with some shops. Concession stands are available in some of the spaces too. Galleria is immediately across Cobb Parkway from Cumberland Mall and there is a convenient elevated walkway over the busy roadway. 
18491 3 Menù gluten free!!! very friendly, ottimo il dessert banana (anche questo gluten free) bell'ambiente personale simpatico e disponibile, molto american! 
18492 4 My favorite thing about Juniors is their cups! I love the big cup. I also love their toast, and if they have the muffins they are fantastic. I love the 60's decor, and the casual atmosphere. 
18493 4 This is probably my new favorite place in town! Went during happy hour which is 4pm-6pm every day, perfect for after work. Everything is made from scratch in house, and everything was delicious. Great atmosphere. Super friendly staff. We will definitely be regulars! 
18494 0 Long, slow line, lackadaisical bordering on rude service, pain in the ass parking for what's not even as good as Costco frozen yogurt at 5x the price. We tossed it because it wasn't worth the calories. Ugh. 
18495 3 When you want top quality bikes and equipment, together with the best bike techs around, head here! They support Northwest Trail Alliance too! 
18496 4 Soooo good! Amazing biscuits, awesome jelly and perfect for a quick breakfast. I'll try the donuts next time. The biscuits are large, thick and not too salty. Up there on the best biscuit list in Austin. 
18497 0 Horrible food. I make better chicken. Don't understand the hype. Overpriced and seasoning is iffy. Fried okra was frozen not fresh. Service was very slow. I waited 30 minutes for takeout. Won't be back. 
18498 4 Everyone is so pleasant and caring. It is very very clean. There are a lot of pedicure options. I go and relax for an hour, best part of the month! Thank you to all of the wonderful staff at Angel. See you soon! 
18499 4 Here in Portland for a conference and found this place. What a gem. Healthy food that even my husband loved. Tried the Original Bowl and the BBQ Tofu skewer. Both delish! 
18500 4 Couldn't say better things about this dealership. Amazing people, didn't feel pressured in the slightest, and felt super comfortable. The gentleman in finance, the sales manager, and salesman Sam,made my car buying experience really great. If you're looking to buy a car, I would recommend coming here, 100%. 
18501 0 No flavor at all!! Their milk tea is like water. Paying $5 for a cup of water is not worth it. Don't come here. 
18502 4 Very positive experience. Guil and Istum showed up exactly on time and were very efficient and professional. Made the whole move from a bedroom to a studio in less than two hours. It helped that they knew exactly how to disassemble and reassemble my Ikea furniture! Would definitely use again. 
18503 1 Beers subpar but the lack of a service area to order drinks at the bar really left a lot to be desired for anyone not in one of the few seats. 
18504 3 Good Vietnamese restaurant. More extensive menu than at your average Vietnamese joint. I think it is family run? No matter what the place is good. 
18505 2 I like thin crust pizza, but this crust is too thin - like paper, and sometimes burnt on the edges. Good variety of pizza toppings/combos. Salads are nothing special either, though. Small, quite busy. 
18506 4 This is the best hair salon I have been to in a long time. My hair looks amazing , I called this morning freaking out to get my hair done before my wedding Monday. They sure blew my mind away!!!! I look amazing!!! Thanks Tasia!!!! 
18507 2 Really impressive food and an awesome location right outside Austin, but a very pretentious and unwelcoming staff. I would recommend it based on the venue and food only. 
18508 4 Saw a Groupon special and figured we would try a new sushi restaurant. Great place, the sushi was fantastic. The crab meat wasn't imitation and everything taste fresh. We Wil definitely be coming back! Also try the torched salmon and scallop & sea urchin appetizers 
18509 3 Great little shop. Coffee is good. Baristas are friendly. There is very little seating, but it's still a great place for studying, working alone, or meeting 1-on-1 with someone. 
18510 3 $22 for a pedicure. The establishment was clean and the staff was friendly. I would definitely return. 
18511 1 Pizza wasn't bad, particularly as the cheese had aged so nicely during the 1 hour and 45 minute ride it took to get to our door. Won't do that again. 
18512 3 Great family owned restaurant. Loved the Bocci Balls!!! 
18513 4 This place is incredible. Best affordable pedicure I've had--very thoughtful technicians who did an excellent job. Also really nice, calm atmosphere, complimentary beverages, and great color options. Highly recommended! 
18514 4 Great staff. Great ambiance. The food was awesome and priced fairly. This will be my new go to when I'm craving Chinese food. 
18515 3 Terry is a cool guy his company catered SX when I owned the Scoot Inn he kept the Thrasher, thrashers well fueled and was very generous with portions. His iced tea rocks too !!! 
18516 4 Love this place! It's nice and has a rotating stick of wines from small vineyards around the world. Great customer service! 
18517 3 I've been twice with my wife. Service is great, nice and effective. I should come more often. 
18518 3 4 stars for the food and service. 2 star for the atmosphere. The place doesn't look nor smell clean, but the food is yummy and the service is fine. I'd eat here again. The Pho is pretty good. 
18519 3 Awesome burritos! My favorite is the Picadillo. we always buy 5 or 6 bottles of the salsa when we leave so we can eat it at home :) so good.... 
18520 4 Excellent espresso sundae! And they gave a 10% discount for DVC members! Fast service and enough tables when we visited. 
18521 1 Look I know the Dook game is a busy night, but please staff up so that our food doesn't arrive cold and so that we don't have to wait 30 minutes for a drink. Your wait staff are hard working and diligent but you need more of them. 
18522 0 Got a take out pizza 2 topping could hardy see the toppings. Heated it slightly at home the crust was burnt hard as a rock, the rest of the pizza just slid off the soggy crust. sorry for the bad review but very honest. 
18523 4 BEST COFFEE, EVER. Seriously it's so fresh and delicious plus the people that work there are so nice. Love this place- total gem. 
18524 4 My wife and I ate there recently and it was a delicious Italian meal. We started with the wild mushroom strudel which was as awesome as it sounds. The pasta was obviously homemade and left us 110% satisfied. 
18525 4 This place is perfect traditional comfort breakfast. You aren't going to have fancy or on trend dishes. What the do have is great service and really good food. My egg breakfast was perfect with hash-browns and toast. Service was great and you can tell there are a lot of regulars. 
18526 4 Authentic New England fish house recommended by a salty New Englander. Love this place! 
18527 4 You cannot go wrong with this place! Anything you order from here will be AMAZING and FRESH! I've tried everything from their stuffed trout to the salmon salad! Everything thing is absolutely amazing and very reasonable. With an outstanding ambiance! 
18528 3 Finz is Finz. Good food and good service the bar is iffy. Fruit flies around which means cleaning is not great. Wait staff is awesome. Good drink selection. The view is great. I feel they are resting on their laurels a bit. 
18529 2 Ok. Pride... I see, but no hour on a pitcher. Had wings and was the best but nothing to soak 
18530 0 Double check your orders before you give them out! Nothing makes me more mad I get home and be missing half my food! Come on get it together 
18531 4 This place is located in close proximity to six other pizza places (no joke), and I have to say that this is by far my favorite. The staff is friendly and the pizza sauce has a nice sweetness to it. 
18532 3 great bar with fresh food, my wife said her coffee was better than most restaurants, & my Sam was in a mug, Food could be seasoned more. But on a saturday what could be nicer. the bartender was one of a kind. 
18533 0 Ordered prime rib sandwich and was not good. Very soggy with awful sauce and grissly meat. Fries were gross, couldn't even eat them. Chocolate cake for dessert and it was only OK, very cold cake that had been in fridge for days. Don't think we will be back. 
18534 4 The Former Peabody Hotel is Now Owned & Operated By the Hyatt Regency, and It Is Still A Fabulous Facility! Look Enough to Have to Visit A Few Times For Annual Convention & They Provided Top Shelf Hospitality Start to Finish with Close Awards Banquet Dinner & Fun 
18535 3 A family style Italian restaurant located right in Arlington. They offer great portions so definitely go with a group. I recommend the fried mozzarella as an appetizer, it's great. Parking is tough so taking the T is recommended, Arlington stop on the Green line. 
18536 4 Every experience have been great. My favorite thing on the menu is the lamb tibs with rice and cabbage. Delicious!!! 
18537 4 Absolutely loved this place. The atmosphere was great for lunch, the service was great. My waitress Sydney was adorable and very sweet! Very attentive and they always make my day so much better. Also lots of great beer to select from as well as great food! 
18538 4 Excellent service, lots of good beer and yummy food. I'd go back. 
18539 4 Stinsons breakfast tacos are awesome. Great service Tip if you order corn tortilla ask for two and to have the cool make them crispy She did that for me and they were awesome. 
18540 1 Get the burrito to go. It's awesome. But don't stay for a drink. The "martini" they gave me was eXACTly 2 oz in the bottom of a glass. Not even shaken with ice. More like a shot. They charge for chips and salsa. 
18541 3 Great place for breakfast and super nice family that runs the place. Would recommend the eggs benedict. Even better that it was locally owned which means 2x more money will recirculate in the Boston economy than if we had breakfast at a national chain. 
18542 2 Grabbed a few oysters and a couple of beers on the way back home. Service was good and the oysters were very fresh. 
18543 3 The chips were our favorite! They reminded me of my abuela's home made tortilla chips. Although members of my party complained about only having one bathroom, the outdoor view was absolutely stunning. I liked the kick in Gabby's margarita! Will come again. 
18544 3 這裡找的到金門高粱，也找的到中國的五糧液跟白酒，日本的梅子酒跟 sake，韓國的燒酒，更別提本地，美國，法國，西班牙，義大利，阿根廷的紅白葡萄酒。 這間店並不定時提供品酒鑑賞會與課程，你若是個喜歡品酒的行家，應該來看看。 
18545 3 they picked up where penny lane left off, only a bit more, well, 'picked up' (not that there's anything wrong with that) i just love the the artsy little foam flourish on top of the cappuccinos a good comfortable vibe to hang out 
18546 4 Well...crap. I've now discovered the Summermoon Latte and coffee will never be the same again. Drove past so many times and finally decided to try it out. Staff was very friendly and helped decipher what to expect from their tasty concoctions. Im hooked. Crap. 
18547 3 Hands down the best authentic chinese food in Austin. Get the dinner for 3 or 4 with the crispy pork option. 
18548 4 Supposed bucket list item... Carrot Cake French Toast... Yumm!!! Great service with friendly and inviting staff! 
18549 2 Pho: Overcooked noodles, fresh herbs (includes sawgrass!), average broth. Only white meat on the Pho Ga. Very nice people running it.... 
18550 4 Nice small hidden treasure. Gets crowded around 12 noon on sat but this can be a long or short hike. Not a lot out there but great for a nature walk. Check out the Tiny house and the small waterfall. 
18551 0 Waited 7 minutes for teriyaki sauce when it was right in front of the employee. Nope, not going there again. 
18552 4 Great breakfast- great (yet eclectic!!!) staff! This place is definitely Portland weird, but it's a Must!!! 
18553 1 Chicken chow mein is big portion but its too salty and just tastes off today. I'm going to switch to Leung Kee if I happen to be at Aberdeen Foodcourt and need a quick HK cafe fix. 
18554 4 Excellent service, excellent meals (the scallops all always delicious and tender). Will definitely come back! 
18555 1 They serve cold burritos! But if u request it they will warm it up. Kind of like ordering a drink and saying - hey put it in a glass this time don't just pour it on the floor. 
18556 4 I am addicted to this place! Hands down the best most authentic Ethiopian food I've had and I've had Ethiopian food from the west coast to the south. Great friendly service too! I would give more than 5 stars if I could! 
18557 4 Quality pizza keeps me going back regularly since the 1970s. Fresh, flavorful and simply awesome. Love it! 
18558 4 Love this place but Mi Le left and I'm on a search for her! If anyone knows where she went email me please ! Dianna2424@gmail.com 
18559 4 I absolutely love going here! I have been going to Ann for years, and am so thrilled she has purchased this salon. She gives the best pedicures and massages! I highly recommend! 
18560 3 The food is pretty good And they have a pretty big selection of sake and beer ... the waiters are so friendly and are always smiling. The best part is they are open until 2am! 
18561 2 We had the all-you-can-eat dinner when we went. The sushi and rolls were decent for the price (it was $22 when we went). However, the sashimi was absolutely horrible. Avoid ordering it. 
18562 4 My husband and I ate here last night. We decided just to have wine and appetizers. Everything was excellent! The Brussels sprouts are off the hook! The owner is very nice, and served us our food. 
18563 0 Good crepe and vietnemeesecoffee. Sadly, first time there from LA and my friends purse was stolen from this location. Keep your belongings next to you at all times. Some shady individuals roll through there. 
18564 4 I love this place! The staff is always so friendly! I especially like Netta! She is so sweet and supportive of my training goals. 
18565 3 Great little bagel shop. Very reasonable and friendly. I got the egg and cheese on toasted cinnamon bagel and it was less than $3.00. Almost couldn't finish it. Lots of egg on it. Very tasty and the coffee was good, too. Only has 6 places to sit inside, though. 
18566 3 Good wings and beer place. Great value. Lots of TVs everywhere 
18567 1 Food was ok but service sucked!! Server was rude and didn't want to be bothered by our questions. Word to the wise....you make a living on tips so here's a tip honey "be nice!". Snobs irritate me! 
18568 3 The dance floor is kind of small, but this place is great to go to if you feel like getting a little dressed up and mingling with good looking people. Sometimes the DJ spins house, which is the best. 
18569 4 Timely, professional, and amiable; fantastic experience! Katie was awesome to talk to, and you can see her years of experience in how great my cut looks. Looking forward to making this my regular shop! 
18570 4 Excellent front-office service, good prices, and convenient location. All in all, this place is great. 
18571 4 A perfect night is Wine, pizza, and burrata. All found in this nook. 
18572 4 We have visited Billy Rays twice now and both times were great. We love the PBR on tap and the bartender with glasses and shorter curly hair is always so friendly! 
18573 4 I enjoy coming to this nail shop...have not been disappointed. They give you a quick neck massage when you go to dry your nails! 
18574 4 Coming from CA and eating many burger joints, nothing beats this place. Definitely the best sliders in town! Their garlic aioli is a game changer. Must try!!! 
18575 4 Ate here on a Sunday night with a larger group. The restaurant accommodated us with ease. Our waitress Jay was incredibly helpful with recommendations and descriptions of the meals. Everyone in our group loved their choices. Everything was tasty, a hearty size, and a fair price. 
18576 3 Twice eaten here, two different locations. You're paying a premium not only for a great burger, but for ambiance and the experience itself, so it's better to enjoy a dinner meal (including an outrageous line) than a hurried lunch. I'll definitely be back 
18577 3 Place was packed and expected slow service... was not the case at all! Staff VERY attentive. I had a black bean burrito... it was perfect. Wow generous with the avocado. I prefer a more chunky salsa but flavor was good. 
18578 3 Yummy espresso and fresh chai. I'll ask for less sweetness in the chai next time, but I'd definitely come back. 
18579 1 The food was salty and the fries were cold and the service was slow and gave wrong orders and wasnt that good we ate at another hooter is s.c and was better than this one 
18580 3 Best Migas ever. It's the only thing I get here. The Agua Frescas are really good, too. The customer service is kind of lacking but it doesn't stop me from going. The wait here is always super long so call your order in ahead of time. 
18581 3 I rate it 4 because the smoothie was quite satisfactory I thoroughly enjoyed it!!!!!! 
18582 4 We are visiting from Hawaii and staying at the Embassy Suites. Proccolinos had an advertisement there, so we decided to try it. Loved the atmosphere, and the food was delicious! Took some time, but worth the wait for fresh homemade Italian food! 
18583 4 one of the best Thai restaurants I've been. Must have Thai ice tea. All the appetizers were great. Tom Yum soup in fire pot is very creative and hot. Entrée I got T3 from their specialties- yummy!! 
18584 4 Soooo, this is the location inside the Perimeter. Massages and service is wonderful. Can't say enough wonderful things about Treat Your Feet. 
18585 0 Wow. This place is gross. Pretty sure cheese whiz is used on the enchiladas. All other food was bland. Taco Bell even beats this place. Very processed foods all around. 
18586 4 Yes! 20/10 now! so awesome! and now I barely use drops! Thank you Dr. Wong! 
18587 4 Great facial! Marywynn knows her craft. She's not judgmental, she listens to your concerns and helps address them appropriately. 
18588 4 This is my goto BBQ Place in Austin. Consistently good food. They used to have a 2meat combo deal that they got rid of which sucks, but still my fav place to goto for brisket. 
18589 4 Delicious. Absolutely amazing. Definitely stop by if you're in the area and looking for authentic Mexican grub. 
18590 2 Typical McMenamins fare, not bad, not great. Tater tots are damn good. Beautiful view of the river. 
18591 4 The people that work here are extremely nice and answered all my questions about the menu, I ordered the Thai Iced Tea and Pad see ew with chicken and they both were very delicious. Will come back 
18592 4 Great location, near the train station, mall and great food locations. People were so kind and understanding, very accommodating. I would highly recommend your stay at Atlanta here. They also have a shuttle that will take you anywhere within 3 mile radius. 
18593 4 This is a classic experience! Real drug store, real drug store burgers! Welcome to the 1950s! Thank goodness not all of Austin has been torn down and rebuilt! 
18594 4 I love J&M diner. A very warm and welcoming place, and the food has generous portions and tastes amazing! 
18595 3 This multi-purpose establishment has it all. Fun bands, yummy food, cold beers and an ample dance floor. Brunch was fantastic - the best grits! Don't worry - they serve plenty of "northern" food to enjoy. 
18596 2 Selection falls short... same for taste. We had the shrimp shumai, a couple of the noodle soups and other plates. For the price, there are better options in the area. Decor and service are good though. 
18597 4 I just tried a pizza from here and I have to say it was one of the best pizzas I have had. It was the Greenbelt pizza and they do not scrimp on the goodies on it. Thank you very much I will be back! 
18598 4 Just stopped in for coffee and had an amazing cappuccino with a beautiful swan decorating the foam. Amazing and smooth flavor in the coffee not to mention the creative barista! Thanks!! Sat at the bar and it has a great vibe in here. 
18599 4 Oh my gosh, best sandwich place I think I've ever been too! They have about a million sandwiches to choose from and tons of salads too! Very creative menu as well. Ps. They have skinny margaritas and they're really good! 
18600 4 Best spicy chicken wings around and the pickled ginger is a great side. Service is always friendly and plenty of seating along with some draft beer choices. Prices are very reasonable 
18601 3 Food is pretty tasty. Love the carne con queso but just watch out for the spiciness of some of the dishes which can be deceiving 
18602 3 Still a fan of this place. Had the 16 oz. Rib-Eye and WOW what a piece of steak. The mashed potatoes were hot all the way through the meal. 
18603 4 Great food and service. French toast with strawberries and cream hit the spot. Good vibe and convenient to Northside hospital in Sandy Springs. 
18604 3 Great gourmet donuts. Very greasy but very tasteful felt like I was eating something from Netflix's Chefs Table! Glad I got to experience it even if 4 donuts was $16. Again. Greasy. 
18605 4 Best Moco Loco in town! Good food and prices. The owner is friendly and helpful. The food tastes fresh and not like it just rolled off of the Sysco truck. I am looking to trying the rest of the menu soon. 
18606 0 LONG WAIT!!!! Very difficult to check out even though we already had a reservation. Hidden and added fee. I WILL NEVER USE BUDGET AGAIN!!! 
18607 4 Great food, definitely recommend. The inside is cute, cozy, nice and clean. Staff is definitely awesome. Everything I have tried is really delicious. You will get better quality compared to many other Turkish restaurants and at an affordable price. We are definitely going back. 
18608 4 There is no better Pizza than Masseys!!!!! The crust is perfect and those pepperoni are magical!!!! 
18609 1 I don't recommend , made me sick to my stomach for the next day after. Kind of bland with no flavor, will not be returning 
18610 4 Molana's "Joojeh Kabob" is the best... 
18611 4 I always get the tuna and salmon sashimi. Very large portions at the lowest price I've seen for sashimi. Furthermore, prompt service. 
18612 4 We have used Frankie's on several occasions for garbage disposal repair and replacement, dishwasher repair and appliance installation and they have been quick to respond, reasonable and honest in all of our dealings with them. 
18613 3 Very solid. Drinks were super tasty, fried chicken & pork shank all well executed. The onion rings are best of breed. Worth putting into regular rotation. 
18614 4 Fast service. Great quality. Very nice atmosphere. The family comes here every year and this year did not dissapoint. Pro tip: Ask for extra ginger dressing on the side. Goes well with everything else! 
18615 4 Endoscopy department is awesome! Nurses are wonderful and caring. Thanks to the whole staff that took care of my mom. 
18616 2 Food was amazing but you have to go alone to get full. Smallest small plates I have ever seen. The price for 3 bites for insane. But the 3 bites were awesome. 
18617 4 I love Arch Orthodontics! Everyone is so friendly -- it makes the appointment pleasant despite having to have dental work! My teeth were straightened really quickly. Process was totally painless. 
18618 4 Please go check out Smoothie King you won't regret it lots of variety of different favors of smoothie and the servers is extremely great vert nice and helpful. 
18619 0 We had an awful experience with Daniel. He made a chain of mistakes while setting up our new accounts, and for fix them we had to come back to the store and re-do everything from scratch. Fortunately, the other guys at the store were very kind and helpful. 
18620 4 This place has a great selection of East Coast beer and even West Coast and some in between. IPAs to stouts and porters, whatever you are in to. What's great is that Jeff there knows his beer and made some good recommendations. Worth stopping in to see what they have! 
18621 0 Used to work here. Cooks have dropped food on the floor and picked it back up to serve to customers. Roaches and rats per every city restaurant-they just don't do anything about it. STAY AWAY. 
18622 4 Fun lessons and recitals for the kids. Brian is a really nice guy to talk with and you can tell he really believes in the importance of music and wants everyone to have a great opportunity to learn. 
18623 1 This place is over rated and unnecessarily expensive. The only fun is put put and the view isnt that great. 
18624 3 Super nice staff, and decent selection of vape juices. However it is a little more expensive here than at other shops. 
18625 4 I stayed there for 2 nights and had a great experience. the rooms are spacious & comfortable and come with lots of amenities. This place has one of the best complimentary breakfast bars I have seen including made-to-order omelets. Bonus: the staff is incredibly friendly! 
18626 4 Nice little place. Many beers to choose from and the outdoor seating is great. We came with family and ate at the Italian food truck on the property. Service was friendly and helpful and quick to clean the tables. 
18627 3 Good selection of beer, and they have poutine, which is a personal weak spot of mine. I really like the atmosphere of the location--modern and casual vibes. One thing that needs correcting is that one cook consistently decided to play painful heavy metal music, and it's really distracting and irritating. 
18628 4 Never disappointed. Cheese bomb calzone with chicken rocks. Grilled Caesar awsome. Delivery is super quick! 
18629 4 Excellent food. Great vibes. Be patient it's family owned and small but worth it every time. 
18630 4 Delicious! Great German atmosphere and the food was really enjoyable. I'd highly recommend the pickle soup too! 
18631 4 Good food, good service, and the prices are actually pretty reasonable. Overall, I think this this place is worth going to if you want to find a place right in the middle of midtown to try. Their wine list is quite extensive. 
18632 4 Favourite fast food I prefer to drive through for late night cravings and never disappoints! 
18633 2 AND they deliver! Great North End style Italian food without trekking into the city. Watch for daily specials - oh my the lasagne on Thursdays is fantastic - plus pizza, sandwiches, calzones, salads and a huge variety of pasta dishes. Veal saltimbocca, gnocchi, etc. Great garlic bread, too. 
18634 0 No hello, when I walked in, practically ignored. Then they started working on someone else's pick up order before mine. 
18635 3 A pretty good selection of craft beers and its proximity to Ten Ten and other craft beer bars make for a good bar crawl. They don't have food, except popcorn. Pretty good atmosphere and plenty of seating. 
18636 0 nope never ever again service good, but burger sucks sorry not going to wait again to be disappointed 
18637 4 My go to grocery store for organic raw milk, butter and eggs! Go organic and support local farmers! 
18638 3 Great service, Car looks brand naw. Nothing taken from my car. James kept me posted every step of the way. The only problem was that they placed the wind shield wipers on backwards. 
18639 4 Awesome patio, delicious carnitas, yummy avocado margaritas and all at a great price & with a lovely server. If I came back to Austin, I would come back! 
18640 1 Ok Thai food but the service was at best mediocre. The location is a bit sketchy although this never stops me. But I can do other Thai options with better service and better food. 
18641 3 We had a great chef. Same corny jokes that you'll find at any hibachi style restaurant. Someone mentioned the watered down soy sauce. I'd agree, however I've eaten places that over did it on the soy, so I was happy. Perfect steak. 
18642 3 Visited here for the first time and loved it! A friend and I enjoyed a bubble tea and the flavors were excellent. The tapioca could be improved upon but I am very picky about that. The vibe is cool, very Portland! I will definitely be back to try more! 
18643 0 Yet again, ignored by this company, after being told I would get a check mailed to me. 
18644 4 If you like ice cream/coffee F**KING GO HERE!! 
18645 3 Not the best Thai I've ever had but the best I've had in Austin. Great section of veggie stuff and meat stuff and they'll mix it up however you like. Make the trip out there. 
18646 1 Not so good. Stopped in to watch the game. Not very welcoming. Had the mediocre nachos and some uneventful drinks. Seems barstaff to cool to be in the service industry. 
18647 4 Great spot for lunch downtown! It is a cafeteria-style restaurant, so the service is quick. The portions are large enough to share or you can have leftovers. 
18648 4 The best chicken!! Outstanding in Memphis and outstanding in Austin. Just enough kick. Perfect every time! 
18649 3 Excellent for fruits and veggies or little grocery items you need in a hurry. Grocery items are overpriced compared to a supermarket, so I usually only buy fruit here as its cheaper and better than you will find at a supermarket. 
18650 1 So freaky fast they forget to put mayonnaise on the bread when you're the only customer in the building. 
18651 4 I found these guys on Yelp and they truly deserve the good reviews they get. I brought my car in to fix a crumpled bumper and Richard pushed it out and cleaned it up in less than an hour. And the price was very reasonable. I'd use them again! 
18652 4 Came with my family, 6 of us, we had a great time! Saw 3 alligators, tons of birds, cattle, horses, and some other cool stuff! Boat operator did a great job, informative, and entertaining! Very pleased! 
18653 1 Food not bad but expensive, the problem is the place is dirty trash all over ,restroom Disgusting.... not worth it to come back 
18654 4 Very clean, nice people, there have very good pizza and Greek Salad. I would say it is the best pizza you can get in this location of Everett. I have tried all of the other pizza shops in Everett Square and Kipos has the best taste. 
18655 3 Cool little place. Sort of an Asian fusion-y (with Korean, Japanese influences). I came here for dinner and I ordered the braised short rib. So flavorful (but not too salty) and juicy, but not too fatty like short ribs often are. Would definitely recommend. 
18656 4 We had a wonderful time with our birthday party visit, with the well cared for animals. The owner is very kind and knows the animals so well. 
18657 0 The salmon & tuna is gross. It was not fresh and had a goey texture to them. Don't eat the fish here - you will be sick. 
18658 0 Very bad service... waited 1 hour for my meal horrible service... will never come here again!!!!!!!!! Hate it absolutely hate it 
18659 4 Super succinct beer bar & bottle shop with best cheese plate I've had in Portland 
18660 4 The mangoanada and chamoyada are incredible! Almost exactly like the ones in Ciudad de Mexico! Definitely making this a regular weekend spot. Both drinks are absolutely huge as well, so definitely worth the price. Super easy to find off East 7th, with a little parking lot to boot. ¡Perfectó! 
18661 4 Great trail run!!!! Trails are very well marked and maintained. Definitely a must do hike/run. 
18662 2 I won't spend any time ranting about the 1 bus. Can somebody PLEASE tell me WHY ON EARTH the bus stops on the railroad tracks and opens its doors at Albany Street?? I've been meaning to ask one of the drivers... 
18663 2 Great sports bar at the Battery with 1/2 price appetizers from 3-6 pm Monday - Friday. Good value with large portions. Worth a visit before the game or drinks with Friends after work. 
18664 4 Now this is disney's flagship hotel it's WOW. Great hotel but I like the beach club better. To many kids and to far away from things. And hope you like KIDS because that's all who is here. 
18665 3 Loved the banh mi and spring rolls. I felt the pho was ok. Will def go back for more sandwiches! 
18666 4 Jhon is a little ray of sunshine. I wanted to put him in my pocket and take him home with me. What a gem. 
18667 4 Nice view, interior is beautiful, sushi is delicious and the service was just right. What else can you ask for? 
18668 1 This place has gone so far downhill... Always understaffed when we come here. Tons of open tables and long waits. Ridiculous. 
18669 4 Horchata!!! Fresh juices and they boil the chickens homemade style and shred it. The guacamole is soo good and the fresh plaintains. Best find!!! 
18670 4 Best food I've ever eaten, period. The service was excellent. We came to celebrate my friends birthday and it was all you could wish for. Quiet, classic atmosphere. 
18671 0 How hard is it to make an order that's chicken and Bread. That's it. Wrote in online ordering comments no veggies no cheese no toppings. And they screwed up. Will not return 
18672 4 This was the most amazing food I have had in the longest time!!!! I can't wait to go back for another Country Clucker. The candied jalapeños were out of this world!!!! Nutty Valentine has my But I plan to try the other sweets. 
18673 0 If you have car problems do not come here. I went and got the car in worse shape. Went driving back and forth with them four different times. I went to a different place after I had enough and they fixed it. Save yourself the trouble. 
18674 0 In order to manage the line ups, smoothie making crews don't run the blenders long enough. The resulting smoothies are chunky and flavourless. 
18675 4 Always great service no matter what day, time or how busy! The food is consistently beyond delicious!! I love this place!! 
18676 4 I'm not sure why this place received bad reviews for customer service, because when my girlfriend and I went we were well taken care of. This place was great. Great food, great ambiance and great service. If you like Thai food, come here. We will be back. 
18677 3 1.5 Waiting time. Once seated, service was prompt. All meals were en pointe. Cannot go wrong with the spiked coffee and any of the specialty drinks. Almond toast was very yummy. Fricasses, frittatas and paellas--oh my. 
18678 0 Terrible food. I am Korean and this place does not serve authentic Korean food. I had spicy dakdoritang and the chicken was too gamey (what kind of meat do they use?!) so I only had potatoes. I never write reviews but had to leave one because it was so gross. 
18679 4 Great lunch !!! Great Price ! Great atmosphere ! My Philly was great and so was the fries ! We will go back!!! 
18680 0 Called to get a car towed out of my assigned parking spot....2 hours and 15 mins later, the tow man calls as the person was getting into their car to leave. 
18681 2 I went against best judgment and ordered a sandwich rather than the fries, and it was good, but not something I would go out of my way for! The fries at the next table looked heavenly though! 
18682 4 Great experience. Leo is awesome, in and out quick. Definitely purchase my next vehicle here. 
18683 4 blew a tire on the way from California to Washington and happen to be staying close to this place. They were friendly, made a few extra calls to get the tire I needed, and I had a great experience. Worked with David - friendly, honest guy. Would recommend. 
18684 3 Very nice place. The lamb kebabs were flavorful and tender. The staff was courteous. Sizable portions so U won't leave hungry! 
18685 1 Chewy stale bread and horrifically salty tofu banh mi. How an banh mi be bland? Not the best option in a neighborhood where there are better choices. Tried once and won't be back. 
18686 4 Incredible ambiance, fantastic cocktails, and even more amazing food! Matt and Clarissa have truly outdone themselves this time! 
18687 2 food is what youd expect. bartenders are good. out of the 7 times ive been here, the waiters/waitresses have sucked 5 times. take that as you will--could be bad days or what have you. 
18688 1 Great food. Wait staff excellent. But STILL very Westside. Expect to see the Point Grey types, jags partied out front. A very pretentious vibe. Live in the hood? Good luck getting a reservation for that special occasion....Would love to give a higher rating. 
18689 0 Used to be a huge fan, but received some of the worst service and food I can remember. Very disappointed, won't go back 
18690 3 Great service. Food was better than average, but not fantastic. I really like the fact that it's local. Keep supporting local or they'll go away and our only choices here in Vancouver will be Olive Garden. One suggestion, improve the toasted bread that comes with the Gorgonzola cheesecake 
18691 4 This is my go to place every time I'm in Orlando and craving Cajun food. Seasoning for the garlic blue crabs is on point every time. Crawl fish is excellent as well. Highly recommended. 
18692 1 I liked their beer selection. Cobbler is alright. BBQ Was a disappointment. Heard a lot about the food but I was let down. Great location in south Austin, it's just sad the food can't match. 
18693 4 Everything is delicious! The salad bar is great, everything tastes fresh. But don't fill up too much because the meat is the best part. My favorites are the flank steak and the house sirloin. And they have my favorite dessert in the world; the bananas foster pie! Soooo good!!! 
18694 3 Stopped in the downtown location today to take a break from the muggy heat. I stayed for quite a while, putting my grubby paws all over their neat merch. All the stuff in there is so cute that it begs to be picked up and handled! 
18695 4 My boyfriend had the Red Velvet cake sent to me twice now and it was out of this world delicious both times. The frosting was so light and melted in your mouth and the cake extremely moist. They packaged it really well for delivery. Thank you JaCiva! 
18696 0 Don't bother. Over prices. Portions too small. Bread just average. Go somewhere else. 
18697 4 I absolutely love this place. The staff is always so friendly and their sandwiches are great! 
18698 2 I like the Villageoise. It is my fave. I don't care for the dryness of the crepe part but the goodness of the insides far outweigh the dry outside. Service is pleasant enough. I will go back. 
18699 3 The food was great! The servers/staff were very nice and attentive. Food to table times were a bit below average. Beverages are a bit pricey but not too unusual. Go during the day/night when there's NOT a game! We had a great time and will definitely come back! 
18700 2 I want to rate businesses without writing a review. Most chain stores are already well known 
18701 4 Consistently the best dining experience in town. From service to preparation, perfection. The star of the table was the beef cheek dumplings and tuna tartare. We also loved our wine selection- Marcus Goodfellow Chardonay and Domaine Drouhin Pinot noir. Can't wait to go back. 
18702 0 American Airlines completely and totally STINKS! They are so very terribly awful. Horrible customer service. Horrible website. Horrible planes. Avoid them! 
18703 4 Amazing!!!! My dogs were poisoned with rat poison by a neighbor and everyone was very helpful and fast acting. The Vet's know what they're doing and are also very friendly! 
18704 4 What a find in Vancouver. Very nice place. Great food and wine list. Being from San Francisco we are accustomed to good food. So nice to find this place. The bar is amazing, cool surf memorabilia. Good job Tommy. 
18705 4 Milkshakes are off the chain! I enjoyed sitting at the bar and interacting with the bartenders. Cool people. 
18706 4 Exceptional Sushi tiles , great wine , great service My only grumble is that our delightful server assured us two tiles would not be too much for a light lunch & they were .. but delicious & worth it 
18707 4 Efficient, professional and pleasant to deal with. Very helpful with notarizing documents on a drop-in basis. Association with an insurance business provides really good availability and convenience. 
18708 4 Omg nutella and Krispy Kreme milkshakes? Count me in! This is a cute lil burger boutique with a full bar and cool vibe. The service was awesome and the staff was super friendly. 
18709 4 Wow. Best service I have ever had. Slight wait on our reservation so the waitress gave us cocktails and an app on the house. Devin our server was very attentive. Totally a must do in boulder. 
18710 4 Love my new hairstyle!! Also we had such a GOOD TIME chatting with the owner. She is super nice and funny. Highly recommend. 
18711 4 Great food and margaritas. The absolute best steak tacos in the city. The Asada steak is always succulent and tender. 
18712 0 Zero stars. Terrible. Slow. There was literally no other customers around and it took me an hour to get in a car. Agents didn't explain charges to me. Not happy. I would have gladly paid more money to get on the road earlier. Time is valuable. 
18713 0 Like others have said, this place is always closed. At like 6:30 pm on a Tuesday, for example. 
18714 4 This food is and was so freaking delicious. I got the traditional Gyro (lamb and beef) with a grilled shrimp on the side. Omg it was so good I called them and told them will always order from this place when I don't wanna cook 
18715 2 Pretty good food (pretty greasy) but less than par beer with the exception of double ipa. First time in years I couldnt finish a flight Beautiful location and view though 
18716 3 Cool, small little coffee house right off Valmont & 30th. I had a latte, it was great, good beans. I think they had wifi, but I'm not 100% sure, but the couch was comfy, and the barista was rockin it w/ the latte art. 
18717 2 The galbi is good but we didn't get free sides, unusual for a korean restaurant. I'll think twice if I want to come back. 
18718 2 Overall a good bakery for a quick asian pastry craving. The cakes I tried were underwhelming. However I found the sun pastries to be delightful. They are definitely worth giving a try if you are not enticed to try a bun. 
18719 0 The food was great the service was horrible. Starts from the manager down. Horrible manner and hostess was so rude! 
18720 4 Wasn't sure what to order. I like noodles, veggies and spicy so I asked the hostess/cashier and she helped me with my decision. I would definitely revisit this place. 
18721 4 Great service and assistance with choosing our new vacuum! Super friendly and helpful! 
18722 2 I can't say I've tried the cupcakes, but I have sampled the frosting shots, which are phenomenal and cheap. A perfect way to satisfy that sweet tooth craving. 
18723 4 Great casual atmosphere, and attractive staff. I ordered enchiladas, which came with an amazing salad! Definitely coming here again. 
18724 4 I heard good things I am gonna take my dog there soon. 
18725 4 I love this place, the flow classes are so calm and soothing, the instructors are amazing and very helpful. The grounds are beautiful and very different from other yoga studios. Every class feels different and it makes for a great experience! 
18726 0 Worst service ever!!!!!!!!!! Just pray you don't sit with Bri, worst attitude I ever encountered from a server 
18727 1 Horrible espresso. Awful taste and no kick. Don't carry whipped cream for your mochas and at their prices, they should! 
18728 4 Been breakfast tacos since as long as I could eat whole food. Everything is compared to this and nothing compares. 
18729 3 The only eatery I could find that was open at 9pm on a Friday. Not really my first choice, more like the only choice. Standard Subway-fare. $13 for two sandwiches and drinks. Can't really ask for more. 
18730 4 This little joint has an amazing barista who made me the best americano of my trip...great crema! Went back the next morning and wish I'd have found it sooner before I left town! 
18731 3 Great spot for a quick delicious lunch or light dinner. All the pickles are superb! I'll be a regular going forward. 
18732 4 I really love Westlake Auto Care. They are honest and do a very fast, super job on everything I've shown up with. The front desk folks are personable and warm and knowledgeable, and the mechanics are competent and kind. I go there for everything I need!! 
18733 4 Modern, careful, eclectic detour from your standard house of pizza type food. I hope it stays that way. Not a fan however of the common "crispy" fries, but for the price + everything else, my plate was awesome. 
18734 3 Went here for drinks and apps. The service was great and I was happy they had Blue Moon on tap. The apps (spinach dip and chicken quesadillas) were OK, nothing spectacular. 
18735 3 Really pretty stuff. Some of the items don't look that sturdy. The sales girls were very nice. 
18736 0 I got food poisoning here. Will never go back. Stay away from the Arugala salad. It had the funk. 
18737 4 This place is my go to spot for Thai. I've tried all the top Thai places in and around Boston but I feel Little Duck edges them all out 
18738 1 Don't bother trying to call in your order to save time. It stays off the line or unplugged. Server said not even sure if they have a phone at all. 
18739 3 Although Verrill has great produce and groceries, their pies are the highlight. Don't miss 'em. The festivals (strawberry, blueberry, and the tomato & corn) are also a lot of fun, especially for kids. 
18740 0 Was reviewed to be open on Sunday went with friends because it was the closest Thai spot in proximity to us. Drove all the way there and they were closed. They need to update information. 
18741 4 While they don't have their full menu during the soft opening, the tonkotsu ramen served on Sunday was delicious! And so was the karaage/chicken. I will definitely back for more. 
18742 4 Jill Gott, my longtime most-amazing stylist is at Barbes in Sellwood. It is a nice little salon, super clean and organized. Jill is a whizz with color and I recommend her to everyone! 
18743 0 18 dollar burgers served by miserable staff. No thanks. Staff stands in the corner with their manager eating and talking trash about customers. Weaksauce. 
18744 2 Great Sandwiches! The Ruben is my favorite, but all the sandwiches are pretty good. Gelato is not that great, but it is gelato in America, so what can you expect? 
18745 3 I like the garden patio. Waited 30 minutes to get my food Flounder Imperial. The food is good. 
18746 4 Don't waste your time going somewhere else. Rolando and the gang do it the right. Down to earth people, a hot towel, razor trim, all the good stuff. Worth the price and you leave feeling good about yourself. 
18747 1 ALWAYS LATE. Make an appointment and they are never on time. I waited over 45min for an appt yesterday.Never again. Its too bad cause the girls are wonderful and do a great job 
18748 3 Feasted on raw oysters and fried clam strips. All delicious. Beer list was solid. Nice outside seating on the second floor for a good view of the harbor. 
18749 4 Best Italian food I have ever had. This is the best place to eat lunch with its convenience being down the street from my work. 
18750 0 Very disappointed, the old Tony Roma's was awesome, this new concept does not work. The food sucked and the service was no better.. 
18751 4 Amazing fried chicken! The seasoning is perfect and really addicting. The lines are pretty long, but they move and you can always order ahead. 
18752 4 Rumors is great! I hadn't had my hair cut in a long time, and it was so nice get get pampered by these folks! I'll definitely go back! 
18753 4 Wonderland of desserts. Most anything you can imagine. I bought one everything. They are delicious. Nice customer service. 
18754 4 Solisa, the aesthetician was on time, extremely professional and knowledgeable. She was confident and caring. I enjoyed my visit with her. 
18755 0 Have had food poisoning two times from this place, its popular for it. Soup Dumplings? More like soup dumps! The food is good but not worth getting sick for it. 
18756 3 Got the fried rice and a kid's meal for my child (meat, rice, veggies). Thought it was very good. Quality ingredients, good flavor and got quite a large serving. Will definitely go back. 
18757 3 excellent nopo burritto. huge portion for 6.50. friendly staff. fast service. i will be back to try other stuff. 
18758 1 I was underwhelmed. Chicken carbonara served over very plain spaghetti. Not fettuccini. Not alfredo. Apparently just the kind of spaghetti I could have brought dry at the store, with the kind of sauce I could have bought in a can. Other entree was steak, which was VERY salty. 
18759 4 This place really rocks. The service was even better than the last time. The owner stopped by our table and asking how things were going. How many owners of super busy brunch restaurants do that in Portland? 
18760 3 Ordered an iced coffee, and since it was a hot day they gave me a styrofoam cup to put the iced coffee in to keep it cold! Great idea! Never thought of this before. 
18761 4 We went for breakfast and loved it. My wife had the waffle, and I had the "Spartan," which was eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries, and pancakes. Everything was excellent and clearly fresh. We will return. 
18762 3 +Comfortable, clean beds +Decently priced for being downtown +Good Location +LCD screen tv +Nice shower +/- The room was on the small side...but no biggie since it was just two of us -Paying for hotel parking lot $$ 
18763 3 I really like the open feeling atmosphere of this restaurant. Good selection of wine, very attentive service. Food was very good for the neighborhood. I would go again when I am in the area. 
18764 2 i dont know why people rave about this place - i mean i think its decent but i dont know about yum delish - i would still go back - dont hate it but dont love it 
18765 0 We had a horrible experience here. Our server was extremely rude and very short with us. There must of been something contaminated throughout the food. My fiancé and I have been sick for days since we ate there this past Friday night. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! 
18766 4 Banh mi bulgogi sandwich is great at a great price. This is THE lunch choice in the area. 
18767 0 I love their wings and blue cheese but always disappointed in their service. Guess I'm here to eat and not make friends but if the person you're sitting with is automatically brought a re-fill and my glass is empty, why would you not ask if I wanted a another? 
18768 4 An appliance repair man who comes over on time, fixes my washing machine and charges a decent rate- hey, I'll recommend him! James is great- give him a call the next time you need someone to fix a major appliance. 
18769 3 Had periodonial work done by Dr. Bingham and was very pleased with the result. He and his staff were very helpful and made what could have been a stressful situation a calm one. I had no problem with the office processing my insurance claim. 
18770 3 Candace at the front desk was very sweet and accommodating at 1 in the morning. The room was nice but there was a faint smell of smoke. Didn't know that they still had smoking rooms. TGIF's is connected to the hotel and has a nice breakfast buffet 
18771 2 Close to the skytrain station. I came here to get a basic avocado and cucumber roll. Nothing fancy. Cheap and the service was well paced. I took everything to go. 
18772 4 Small menu but the food is great. Dough doughs were very moist and delicious. The place was packed with customers but we received our food within 10-15 minutes which i thought was reasonable. Prices were cheaper than expected. 
18773 3 This grand old theater is the venue of generations of theatrical experiences. The place remains in good repair, the staff are competent and diligent and performances inspired. 
18774 3 Late lunch with my husband and in laws. I got the Porklandia, good, but swapped half for the pastrami and liked it much better. The atmosphere is laid back. The paintings of this part of Portland are amazing. I'll be back to try some other dishes. 
18775 4 Sooooo good! Great ambiance, delicious food, yummy drinks! What's not to love? Came on my lunch break with some coworkers who've never heard of them before and they were so impressed. 
18776 3 Was a bit surprised at the quality of the food here.... very tasty. The decor isn't much to write home about, but all the food was yummy. The tortilla soup is fantastic!!!! Reasonably priced too. Note to owner: turn down the volume on the hockey game. Not everybody cares. 
18777 4 This is a hidden gem in Lake Nona. The service is excellent and the ambience is very causal. My favorite is breakfast with the amazing biscuits and gravy. Definitely a must visit. 
18778 4 Great pastries period. Not overly priced and I will be back. This is a great little food truck stop. 
18779 3 DANK! Sundays are off the hook for happy hour. Half priced wine, screaming gnocchi, cheese fondue, mmmmm.... a Must on Sunday Funday. 
18780 3 I can easily say the best fried chicken I've ever had! Crispy flavorful skin, moist chicken! Good service for a busy time of day. Okay sides. 
18781 4 Extremely good tapas, backed up by some great cocktail choices. A number of interesting, unusual options on the menu, all of which are well crafted and well presented. Friendly staff and great food. Good downstairs and upstairs seating (with an elevator). 
18782 3 Nice new brewery! Love the outdoor space--wish it were dog friendly. 12 beer options, 1 cider, and 1 root beer. No real food options--just chips and hard pretzels. You can bring outside food. 
18783 2 I like the tacos here. Cheap and good, and love the cheese! The margaritas are really strong too! 
18784 4 This place is a hidden gem! Best fish tacos I've ever had :) 
18785 4 The cheese & meat tray was a great appetizer. We really loved the Gnocci! Lindsey provided exceptional service and we are very picky. We look forward to dining here again. 
18786 2 Love the food and the price here.... But the waitress service was horrible that's why I give 3 star... 
18787 1 It is not good in Chinese standard, and the choices of the buffet is just 1/3 of the other Chinese buffet. 
18788 4 I always get the Caramel cake, recently have tasted the red velvet cake and white chocolate cake. All of these cakes have been very good and tasty 
18789 4 Extremely unique food. Good vegetarian choices and amazing Red Velvet cake. Especially like their paneer tacos and it has a very nice location. 
18790 3 Very crowded during rush hour. Recently turned into vegetarian, so ordered the C5 off the menu which is tofu with rice and veg. The dish did not disappoint. It was saucy and spicy and hot. Very pleased! 
18791 4 I love it! Great pizza place in salem. The pizza here is very tasty, the service is good and it has quite a few tables if you want to dine in. 
18792 3 Good biscuits, GREAT waffles. My wife said best she'd ever had. (Granted, she's pregnant and a lot of food is the best she's ever had right now). 
18793 4 This place is so so so good!!!!! I when there with my friend for lunch. Not only The food is so delicious and tasty, The staffs there is really really friendly. Best place ever !!!!! Definitely gonna come back again ! 
18794 2 Not bad, owner is funny, good stories if he shows up, I've walked over & he is either on coffee break or decided to close early. 
18795 4 Update - thanks again Xuan for the real estate agent referral in Dallas. I didn't have much time to look for a house but your referral made it happen. Super Thanks for the assist! :) 
18796 4 I have been working with Wade on several projects and have found him to be very helpful and knowledgeable. As a general contractor I appreciate the quality and service. CRC Construction Richard Martin 
18797 3 One of the good Indian restaurants in the downtown area. Loved the food the last 3 times I had been here. All the curries were very tasty and the portions were great. Ambience is wonderful. Would definitely recommend and visit pretty soon. 
18798 3 Convenient and reasonably priced. Clean room with modern decor and great view. 
18799 3 Loved it. We arrived shortly before 5 and had to wait to get in, but I'm glad we did. Split the Tres Ceviche, Plantain Chips, Atun Causa, Lomo Saltado and Picarone between three people. Along with happy hour cocktails. Left very full and very happy. 
18800 4 YUM!!! The best waffles in town. I would eat the waffle without any toppings or powdered sugar all day, every day! 
18801 2 Wish I could give this place 3 1/2 stars. This place has the potential to be more upscale but just doesn't cut it with the clueless waitstaff, coupons and flyers... However the the food and place settings were nicely done. A decent but not fantastic place to eat. 
18802 4 tried to share the porchetta to save our stomache for other food. we ended up eating two halves. great sandwiche! 
18803 4 Love it! Brought my mother here a few times. The spring rolls and sauce are perfect. I've only ordered the vegetable red curry because it so good. Make sure to grab yourself a Thai iced tea! 
18804 4 Love this place! Whenever i'm in Portland I always try and stop here. Very cozy. They have a wide variety menu so there's something for everyone and they have the most amazing freshly baked pies! Nice Portland Vibe and friendly people. 
18805 3 First time visiting and we will be back. We had a nice lunch a pita with cous cous. They were very tasty and satisfying. The food was delivered quick and hot. Cous cous is vey popular for lunch and I can see why. 
18806 4 The ahi tuna nachos were to die for and I would highly recommend them! They are big enough to share with 3-4 people! So crash and tasty! 
18807 4 This company is so great to work with Tim the GM will exceed your expectations! Even after the floors are finished he still gibes you VIP service ! A must try! Tanya 
18808 3 Excellent mojitos AND they come in lots of different flavors (including cucumber and mango!). We had tapas at the bar and they were very tasty. Didn't pay too much attention to the prices because I wasn't paying but I would probably go back again regardless of the cost. 
18809 2 Very good breakfast place. Ordered pancakes which were huge and choice of maple or marionberry syrup. 
18810 3 Really good food and large portions. Good vegetarian options. Kid friendly atmosphere (it is JP after all) 
18811 4 It's a small restaurant but offers selection of food. All the food are always great and the quality is consistent. It's a hidden gem and I love it! 
18812 4 Authentic and delicious! The fajitas for two is plenty of food. Be sure to order fresh lemonade. 
18813 3 Good burger, I'm not a huge fan of shoestring fries or whatever they are called but overall good food especially since I'm new to the area and don't know much of what is around. This was an easy walk away and it caught my attention. 
18814 4 It was awesome! I came thirty minutes late, and Mary still gave me 45 minutes. It wasn't the full 60, but it was my fault to show up late. 
18815 4 Everything is awesome here. A must stop. Food is top notch. Jealous yet Hollis Hackman. LOL 
18816 4 I have been many times. It's a good place to have lunch. The store is small but you can find almost all mediterrian foods. I think they should this have bigger place. Guys are nice and kind. I liked them. 
18817 4 The Plantain Omlete was excellent! That and the traditional Cuban sandwich are reasons I've become a regular here. Give it a try! 
18818 3 Austin's best gourmet North Indian restaurant is housed in the historic old Bertram Building. Very elegant and stylish for an indian place; thoughtfully prepared, heavily spiced dishes. 
18819 3 We came in and drooled over all the high end espresso machines, they have a full line of coffee addict appliances from grinders to an aeropress...the latter was priced the same as Amazon and anywhere else I've looked. Lots of gadgets for cooking and they even do cooking classes. 
18820 3 The chicken salad was phenomenal. Great service. Great vibe. Good prices. I will definitely be back. 
18821 1 Extremely overpriced for the quality of food you're getting. They do have a good location but I honestly didn't want to finish my lobster BLT. The lobster had a weird texture. However, I loved the crab appetizer. Overall I wish I went somewhere else. Their Mac cheese was sub par. 
18822 2 Not bad. Had a burger and fries and a beer. Burger was good and the fries were good(but not many of them on the plate-kinda cheap) Servers were friendly and attentive. Typical bar/burger place. 
18823 4 Tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good！！！！ authentic middle eastern style food with big plate and not costly 
18824 0 Started out some p.t. here because it was convenient to my home. Nothing helped and I even had a spasm while there, so I stopped going. Months later I started up somewhere different and within minutes had a diagnosis and relief. Based on personal experience, I would proceed with caution. 
18825 4 Love coming here and getting the steak tibs! They are consistently great every time and everyone I've taken here loves it. Will always stop by when I'm in the area. 
18826 4 Have ordered a couple of times and the food is fantastic. The yellow curry tofu is simply amazing!!! 
18827 3 I really enjoyed my dinner tonight! I had a steak medium rare, which was made perfectly. My two sides were green beans and lobster Mac & cheese. I do wish the Mac would've been creamier, and actually cheesy, but the lobster tasted wonderful. 
18828 4 I love the way Alli B cuts and colors my hair. She has tons of experience and it shows. She tames my thick hair and the color is rich and shiny. Also love her setup with a private room. Very relaxing. 
18829 3 Visit Date: 11.15.2008 I had the penang (red) curry, and it tasted good, and had a nice kick to it. The dish was overpriced for me, but probably moderately priced in terms of the area it's located in. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere with good lighting. 
18830 4 I come here everyday! Really love the GroupX classes here! We really like the Zumba instructor Jackie who sub for Chissy today. Will she teach here later? Her class was so fun and we enjoyed a lot! Really hope she can come back and teach. 
18831 2 The dinner entree was enough food for a four year old. Probably not five. Seriously small amount of gnocchi - and that stuff is cheap! The server was also a touch on the air headed side. But great venue with cool ambiance. Just don't go hungry. 
18832 4 Came here for dinner while visiting Atlanta. We got seated right away for a party of 3. I loved the rural, rustic decor. Our waiter was nice and helpful. The food came fast. We ordered mussels, stone fruit salad, tortellini, and lobster room and they were all AMAZING. 
18833 3 Love this place. Drinks are a little expensive but damn...it's a basement jazz room! 
18834 0 Disappointing! This place looks so nasty, everything is dirty and unkept. The line is long for hard old overpriced donuts. Don't waist your time! The restroom are a mess too. Sorry but its true. 
18835 4 GREAT Joint! Paddy O's have The best French Fries on Union st. They also provide top notch Live Bands almost every night of the week. Highly Recommend! 
18836 2 Cool but menu is limited and portions are overpriced. Reduce cheese selections and increase food options and portions if you can't afford to carry that much cheese inventory (my guess). 
18837 4 Wow, what amazing service! I recently came in to purchase my mothers birthday gift of the new Note3 and was treated like a queen.No wait, no hassle! Exceptional manager, knowledgable staff, and great prices.They also had a great selection for cellphone covers. Thank you TMobile! 
18838 4 Such cute, hip stuff at such reasonable prices! I've gone in here one too many times "just to look" and end up coming out with a new, fun dress. Service is friendly, but not overbearing. 
18839 4 Oh my gawd this place is too too too awesome. The coffee is fabulous and the food is too! 
18840 3 Food is delicious and service is decent. Very happy. Was surprised it only got about 3.5 stars on Yelp. It is totally worth trying. 
18841 3 Bombay Bistro is good Indian food with no surprises. I tried Desi hot food once and I was literally firing off my tongue, but in all honesty manager did warn me. Do try their Malai Kofta, pretty awesome 
18842 3 Very fancy. Very clean. Very expensive. Good if you're looking for something upscale like a Rolex, Roberto Coin, Henri Daussi, Roberto Demeglio, or Hearts On Fire, to name a few. 
18843 4 Excellent!!! Tried Stromboli deluxe for the first time here. It is delicious! A lot of flavor and just really good!! I'm impressed. The owner is friendly too. 
18844 4 Very good service, Garbro ( my dog) always looks his best after a visit with Jeana !! 
18845 4 I've had work done on my boat shoes twice now and both times the cobblers have been great people. Must be an industry thing. The proprietor at this one is no exception. He won't try to upsell you on anything, only suggests what your shoes actually need to stay functional. 
18846 3 Very, VERY good, just not stellar. Loses a few points on service and value, but location and food are great. Been there several times and keep going back. See attached photos - if those don't convince you, nothing will... 
18847 4 Didn't have the yeti cooler I wanted but called the manufacture to find who did in town. That's going above and beyond in my book. 
18848 3 Great park, so much to and do for the whole family. The adrenaline junkies have the rides, the more sedate family members have some great shows and hands on exhibits. In my opinion this is the best all around attraction in Orlando. 
18849 2 I will say the bread is amazing. I go there and probably eat a months worth of carbs. We split a margarita pizza and it was just ok. Not horrible, but not great. Can't say it's better than the tons of other options in the area. 
18850 4 Been eating pretty consistently at Chaba Thai for nearly 10 years & it's definitely one of my favorites! I stop by every couple of weeks. I can't get enough of the green curry. 
18851 4 I absolutely love this restaurant. Why do people fight to get tables at restaurants that are twice as expensive and half as good? 
18852 4 I had the Tuna melt and it was everything. It came with a fried green tomato which through me off at first ... but I def recommend .. I wish I could share my sandwich with you guys 
18853 4 This place is a MUST. The Roadhouse burger might just be the best burger I've ever had. The decor is top notch in an old historic railroad depot. GO HERE!!! 
18854 3 Good coffee and great pie! Really enjoyed my salted pecan pie, filling was wonderfully balanced and the crust was good. Not amazing but a solid crust. Nice ambiance with window seating for people watching. 
18855 3 A shop like this is a dangerous, dangerous thing to place on a university campus. When finals roll around and the stress is high, a line of anxious students piles out the door in hopes of sweet sugar therapy. My favorite remedy is simple: vanilla on vanilla. 
18856 0 Disgusting. Tastes like scraped deep-fryer. AVOID. 
18857 4 Simply badass tacos and tortas. Unpretentious, cheap, and consistently excellent. Getting a torta and cooling down with an iced coffee at Once Over is my new tradition. 
18858 4 Best tasting cupcakes in Boston. Perfect level of sweetness and great texture. 
18859 4 Excellent service, very professional, and really care. Erik really took care of us! 
18860 4 The service was grade A fantastic and the food was delicious and flavorful! Vancouver's food game is strong! 
18861 3 Good Italian food that's upscale but not too expensive. Great place for lunch and drinks. 
18862 1 Expensive loud and over stimulating. Service was terrible while bowling. They do have nice bowling lanes, all sized and organized bowling balls. But please if they're going to charge what they do then let's raise the bar on service and customer service skills. 
18863 1 The Jerk chicken was just bbq chicken with a ton of bbq sauce on it. The rice was heavily doused in bbq sauce as well which tasted kind of disgusting. Nothing like what you would expect Jerk chicken to taste like. A ton of better caribbean options in the area. 
18864 1 Is it that difficult to manage the coffee bar?!?! Regular coffee and a clean bar to prepare ones morning java is clearly too much to expect ... I luv wawa Im not sure why this one has such difficulty maintaining the coffee... 
18865 4 Wanted greek close to the office: found my new favorite lunch spot. Great food, staff was friendly, cozy spot, and the lamb gyro: insanely good. Free desert was a nice touch, will definitely coming back often! 
18866 1 Over priced pretentious food....waiter actually stood at our table and read the menu to us.....uh, ok...thanks but we can read. Waste of time and money. 
18867 4 The guys know their stuff. There was no wahoo redneck Duck Dynasty nonsense just a lot of excellent information and expertise. They're professionals and they love be their craft. Thanks guys, I'll make sure and spread the word. 
18868 2 I liked the food but it's not the place if you are looking for ambience or outstanding service. I went there once but I think I would rather take out from there. 
18869 3 Hard to describe the food quality. Its a place to go and experience for yourself! ingredients have a taste in this restaurant that you could never imagine. highly recommend it!! 
18870 4 Awesome convient location with plenty if seats... :) 
18871 4 Great restaurant. Great service great food. Loved the experience. Not the most romantic place in the world but the price was just. I do recommend it if you are looking for a quick inexpensive fast food. 
18872 4 I've spent 20 years performing in or attending the Orlando International Fringe Festival. It's absolutely a fabulous time. TONS of great shows and wonderful social time at the beer tent. I highly recommend! 
18873 4 I have been riding my bike by tge Mt. Hood Brewing Company fir the last several months awaiting their opening. Today I ride by and YES they are open. Having the Hogsback a Oatmeal Stout tasty. Staff is very freindly, wising them success. 
18874 3 A favorite breakfast spot for delicious interesting food, pretty good service and real cloth napkins. Too bad it is so popular. The only downside, I hate waiting for a table and the noise level is a bit high. 
18875 3 Nice, small place. The menu is a bit overwhelming but the dessert and tea were good. Others complained about parking, I paid for parking on the street. There is parking behind he cafe. 
18876 3 Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. This is an old bank, they have tables inside two huge safes with thick metal doors. Lots of seating here outside of the safes too. The sandwiches are wonderful: great bread, fresh vegetables, etc. 
18877 4 Wanted to share the great experience we had today at All 4 Pets in Avalon Park. Shadow is shiny, smells great, and was happy here and that's what matters. We got a complimentary treat and bandana! Highly recommend taking your pets here 
18878 4 A great BOOKSTORE ! Big Location , Great Cafe , Love going here & buying books , downloading them to my Notebook Ereader , relaxing 5 MEOWS 
18879 3 Very good dinner, we ordered lomain noodles with fried rice, with ragoon ears, and egg rolls. 
18880 2 Really just an average sports bar no more no less. Zingers (boneless chicken) are very good. Pretty good beer selection. 
18881 4 This is a favorite restaurant when we are here for the AKC National Championships. We've eaten in the restaurant as well as gotten to go orders, lunch or dinner you can't go wrong. We have several different entrees and not been disappointed 
18882 2 Almost empty and still waited, and waited for food. Friendly employees, but not very engaging. Good food. 
18883 4 The location is conveniently easy to get to by public transit. So many great dishes in the menu! Japchae and volcano maki roll are my current favorite dishes but i also love the cheese steak dumplings and watermelon salad. For drinks, loved the guava mojito. Also, staff is super friendly! 
18884 3 Clean and friendly atmosphere, love the outside patio!! Always fresh food too! :) Good specials and if you have the app its even more convenient. 
18885 4 This is such a charming shop. And the owner opened just because she genuinely loves books. It's clean, friendly and is a great stop for children and their parents. Really an all around nice shop. Support local! 
18886 4 Love this shop... local and has the nicest owners. The clothes are super soft with nice cute prints and colors! Great place to shop for a baby gift! 
18887 4 Best breakfast tacos for low prices! Pancakes are huge! Love the food love the service. This is our go to breakfast joint in the south side of Austin. They are always cheerful and happy to serve you. 
18888 2 I would go here again, although its not a place I rave about. Its a little too expensive for what they offer. 
18889 2 Quiet and clean location that is never too crowded. Full range of menu options available at every Subway locations and even the occasional local special. 
18890 2 Delicious fried chicken and I heard the fries would be good but they were OK. All in on my supper in the city. Service was good and friendly. 
18891 4 The Ambiance is beautiful. The staff is very friendly. The Cauliflower Taco is really good. They also have the best Arnold Palmer I've ever tasted. I will definitely be coming back. 
18892 0 Was here for a Christmas party. Turns out the bar tender treated herself to a generous tip. $5 more than I provided. Very rude. 
18893 3 Their Sunday buffet is a little expensive, but it is to die for. Lamb biryani is the best. Save room for dessert--the gulab jamun tastes like French toast dipped in hot syrup. 
18894 4 This enormous Italian-style restaurant offers generous portions and a boisterous atmosphere. Whether for a working lunch or dinner in a large group, Maggiano's delivers. My grilled vegetable sandwich with parmesan fries was outstanding, and my dining companion thoroughly enjoyed his fried ravioli... Mmmm! 
18895 4 Beef cheeks and lingua were amazing over corn a la dente amazing! Good ppl up front too! 
18896 4 Greg and the whole team at Handy Haulers are a professional crew. They showed up ready and eager to work. Thanks for your enthusiasm to get the job done! Definitely recommend! 
18897 4 It's not Lee's Hoagie House (Philly) but it's the best in Austin and it's a chain at that. If they could only fly in Amoroso's rolls.... 
18898 3 A very relaxing place for drinks! Came here with a few friends for a couple of beers and appetizers. Food was delicious. All of the bar staff were very pleasant. Definitely recommend the 3 way chicken sandwich and fried brusprouts! 
18899 3 Great food and a great atmosphere. The wait staff are always friendly and willing to recommend new drinks and food options. The muscles and chorizo are an amazing appetizer and the pork chop is spectacular! 
18900 4 Pavia does great lunch! However, it's catering service is impeccable. They are very helpful when ordering for a crowd and provide a full-service experience!!! All of my lunch meetings will be catered by Pavia!!! 
18901 3 Good cocktails. Right in Central but off on Green St and unassuming from the outside. Neighborhood/local vibe. 
18902 4 Favorite Ramen Lunch spot. Friendly and Fast!! 
18903 2 Cheeseboy is awesome. The heavy handed servings of jalapeno are not. You have been warned! 
18904 0 Was visiting from out of town and waited for about 45 minutes then was told the kitchen was closed because the boiler caught fire!!! I didn't believe it because the staff seemed overwhelmed and understaffed. 
18905 4 Fantastic food, service, views and staff. We came here for my Dad's bday! The free cake they brought him was HUGE!!. The Filet Fignon was perfectly cooked too. GREAT cocktails as well. The place is just beautiful... 
18906 2 Disappointed they replaced the NY Carnegie Deli cheese cake with a generic. Terrible. 
18907 4 The people here are friendly and helpful. It is convenient, and dependable. Rates are still very good. 
18908 1 Great atmosphere and decor!!! Guest service needs work!!!! 
18909 4 Excellent service, waiter was very attentive as well as funny. Food was very good as well as large portions. 2nd visit in 30 days, and plan to be back again. 
18910 4 Love the fries, chicken fried chicken, mashed potatoes-- are crazy good!! The Sonora salad with salmon is also delish!! 
18911 1 Very mediocre Steaks. Horrible risotto. Great service. 
18912 4 Thank you Josh E. Josh E. got here early which was appreciated. He was thorough and explained our system to us. He checked all zones and sprinklers and explained everything in detail. Very nice technician. 
18913 4 So freaking good! The fried chicken sammich was one of the best things I've had in my mouth - then I had the dan dan fries and added another thing to that list! 
18914 0 $225 for a childish crunchy cotton skirt? Simply ridiculous. I understand paying high prices for locally-made great-quality clothes, but some of the prices are unfathomable. With all of the awful experiences other yelpers have had, I'd say spend your time and money in some of boulders other great establishments. 
18915 0 The person selling the ticket at the airport informed me it would be 30 min to the dolphin hotel. It took over an hour and a half ... 
18916 4 We love the way they season the teppanyaki-prepared food here...it's better than anywhere else. The family that runs this place is very sweet. Always a joy to visit and they really encourage chit-chatting among the different customers. A really friendly atmosphere. 
18917 2 Sushi is good. Usually a great variety. Sushi chefs are rude and talk in Spanish about customers. Inexpensive place to go for sushi on a belt 
18918 3 Conveniently located in the mall. Right next to the Marriott. Great place to watch a game. It was very crowded when I arrived so it took a while to get a drink ordered. There's a television everywhere you look. 
18919 2 This McDonald's is fine. The bread is often stale though which is a bummer. Things have improved drastically since my former review. Gotta get rid of that stale bread though. 
18920 3 Really getting better... New menu,new look, wish more healthy-less fat dishes but tasty non-the-less. The chef is doing more organic(yea!) ... And more variety ...we really want them to be successful as we livevin the hood... Definite up turn now! Keep up the good work guys! Excellent brunch too! 
18921 4 Just tried the Gang Panang and was reminded of how much I love this place. The waiters and waitresses are always super sweet too. 
18922 4 Amazing sandwiches and burgers, can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Including the coffe 
18923 3 the stuffed chicken is amazing a little pricey but really good food. 
18924 4 Had a sushirito for $8--it was better than expected and reasonably price for m lunch. Great service, quick, and friendly. Would come again! 
18925 3 Cappy's is such a guilty pleasure. So tasty and so greasy. Their calzones are incredible! Incredible AND cheap! Actually the pizza is good too. The service is fantastic even when it's busy which is really impressive. They are so nice there too. But the calzone's....go Cappy's! 
18926 3 I always do my order online for delivery and store pickup. Ordered multiple times since they opened about a year or so ago. No complaints so far except for maybe the lack of parking space to pick up my order. 
18927 0 HARDCORE OVERRATED, its a small litte place, with ratty service. I've had better italian at the Olive Garden. 
18928 3 Love this place, great atmosphere, decent service, their okra dish is fun, if you are looking for a glass of wine this might not be your place though. 
18929 2 The wings are really good but the waitress didn't keep up with our drinks and we had to wait with empty glasses (gasp!) a few times. 
18930 3 Great atmosphere and very lively inside. It has lots of space for sitting and it's in a great location in Gastown. The best iced mocha I have had. Will definitely be back! 
18931 4 Fantastic service and maki. The chef sent out fried smelt for us to try, which was delicious. The space is small, but they do accept reservations and they recently got their liquor license. We will go again next time we are in the neighborhood! 
18932 4 The best nachos you can find in Portland. The place looks like a dive in the inside, but that's really one of the great things about it. The foos is fantastic and drink selection and beers on tap are very good as well. 
18933 4 Excellent service with a smile and great prices. My favorite spot to get any beauty regimen. 
18934 3 Surprisingly good hole in the wall. Recommend takeout as not much in the way of atmosphere. 
18935 4 Not from Austin but this place came highly recommended for all the succulent eye candy! I did not leave empty handed that's for sure! :) You will want all the things :) 
18936 1 Sub par pub grub. Come with low expectations and you may be surprised. 
18937 4 always exceeds my expectations when travelling for business at the world trade center. if not just for the convenience of walking across the street. 
18938 3 Tiny Starbucks, but they crank you through the line quickly. Nice outside seating area, completely shaded. Perfect for bringing the pooch or a quick morning cup alfresco! 
18939 4 I called on a Saturday morning and requested a arrangement be made and delivered that afternoon to my friend on her special day since I live out of state and couldn't attend. The flowers were beautiful and they were delivered on time. 
18940 3 My first time in Portland, my dad and I walked around the corner because we need a quick breakfast we both got the egg wiches on croissants. Next time I'll try somthin raw or the bacon jam. 
18941 4 In town for an Ohio State game and staying downtown. Came here based on Yelp! reviews. Very nice! Had the special goat meat chili con carne. Excellent! Also had a side of mixed vegetables which were very nicely prepared. For beer, enjoyed the Gold Standard (Helles Lager) and an Octoberfest. 
18942 3 Great salad bar with the option to add unlimited veggies and toppings. You definitely get the most for your money here as opposed to other salad spots in the Financial District. The line moves fast, so be ready to fire off what you want quickly! 
18943 4 Honest people! I tried two DIFFERENT places that were trying to take advantage of me so I kept looking around. I am glad I found them because they are honest, customer focused, people! 
18944 4 Light crispy crust and lots of topping choices. Great friendly staff so what's not to love! Switching from Mod to here. 
18945 4 It's really nice. I normally don't like sweet. But this one is super close. You definitely should try. 
18946 3 We love this place. They have a special on Wednesday's for a soda and two slices of any kind of pizza for $3.99. You can't beat that! It's part of our regular weekly routine. 
18947 4 I kind of don't want to tell anyone about this place, but I always end up spilling the beans when the subject of office space comes up. Great energy, smart people, "networking" opportunities in the best sense of the word. 
18948 4 Josh was an amazing tour guide. He had great humor throughout the tour and a great deal of historic and relevant information to offer! I love Hahvahd 
18949 4 Excellent food for price & real diner experience. Loud and nice and clean and wait staff real nice 
18950 4 Best burgers in Austin. I love putting a friend egg on my burger and I always get the truffle fries. Milkshakes are great as well. 
18951 1 I had ordered the Bacon jalapeno cheesy bread and thought there could be more jalapenos spreadout through the bread where each of my 8 pieces had jalapenos in them like i had ordered... 
18952 3 Do Saturday Brunch instead to beat the crowds. Well, I don't want EVERYONE to. Saturday brunch has the same great food, music and vibe, but less crowded. And they even have a box of toys for kids to play with. 
18953 3 Classy place. So friendly. Sitting at the bar. Vidal is a wonderful host and explains the menu. Let's you taste the wine before he pours. Nice place. Great food 
18954 4 We went here for Valentine's Day it is was such a wonderful treat. Food was amazing, service was fantastic, and ambiance was on point. This place really delivers. If you are looking for a date night or special occasion, you can't go wrong here! 
18955 2 The service was excellent, but food was average. We ordered the ceviche, queso fundido, and vegetable enchilada. Queso fundido was rich, but quite good. Other dishes were ok. Also ordered the ice wine for dessert, but they gave me the "full-pour" without asking. 
18956 4 What a great new addition to the neighborhood. Fun warm drinks when it's cold...Fun smoothies when it's hot! And a HUGE sitting area on top of a drive thru?!?! Exactly what we've been waiting for!!! 
18957 0 Terrible food, dirty tables, and floors. The $11.00 salad was prepacked from the store, the seafood gumbo had gelatin consistency, the peel away shrimp were not fresh or seasoned. Both my husband and I got sick from eating here! Come here if you want to pay for the view. 
18958 4 I tried the peanut butter smoothie and the superfood acai bowl and though the line was long everything moved pretty fast. Portions are large. The staff is super nice also and make you feel welcome. 
18959 4 Great local company! Ive done tons of business with them from buying garbage disposals, faucets, toilets even toilet seats! They are always very nice and helpful and affordable! Ive learned so much about plumbing since my dealings with them! 
18960 4 Best darn German food restaurant this side of the big pond! Shared the pork knuckle with my wife and now we're both stuffed. Yummy! 
18961 4 These cakes are so yummy! Buntini's, perfect for business' or just a thank you for great job someone did for you. Presentation is professional and makes a great gift. 
18962 0 I have been waiting 2 hours for my order. When I called to complain, they told me "it's coming, it's coming, 2 minutes! 2 minutes!" Horrible customer service. 
18963 2 We waited 1.5 hours before we got sat, which is fine since it's brunch. But the food was just okay. It was pretty much lukewarm when it was brought out to us and the portions are smaller than what they should be for the price they are. 
18964 3 This is a Brazilian bakery. The food was very good but I just did not know the terminology. I would recommend the breakfast sandwiches and the sweet bread. What is Brazilian sweetbread?? I do not know but they had several choices. 
18965 3 Wasn't sure what to expect as I'm used to going to registered massage therapists but I enjoyed my experience here. The massage was good, long, unique and a great price. What more can you ask for? 
18966 4 Skip the big brandname chain coffee shops and go here for great service, prices and cozy atmosphere 
18967 4 edward! you made my day. i felt so welcomed. you made me smile (eventhough i was bummed about having to go to work) - i so appreciate your sincerity and kindness. ps. my freekin veggie sub was a masterpiece---absolute work of art. THANK YOU!! 
18968 3 Great pizza... the crust and unique specialty toppings take it to a different level. Add great beer selection and friendly staff and this is one of our favorite places to eat in West Linn. My hubby used to complain about eating pizza, now he suggests it!!! 
18969 3 We love this burger bar! My favorites are the truffle fries and margaritas! The rest of my family loves the milkshakes. Burgers are always fresh & tasty! It gets really crowded & with Texas summers, waiting can be brutal, but worth it! 
18970 1 I got the HanLin Creation milk tea with mixed white and black pearls and was not impressed. The big pearls were hard and the milk tea wasn't good. Hard pearls alone will make me not come back to this boba drink place. 
18971 1 Apparently this place had changed hands since I was last here. Food is more Southeast Asian(Viet?) than Chinese. NO MORE LUNCH BUFFET. Not terrible but pretty pedestrian. 
18972 4 Good family-owned Tex-Mex restaurant. The food was very good and the wait staff was friendly and helpful. Just a heads up, it's a BYOB kinda place so be prepared to bring your own beer, wine, etc. We brought a bottle of wine and they provided the wine glasses. 
18973 4 Love Irish Pubs. Love Boston. Alan behind the bar was terrific and really knows his stuff. Whenever I'm in Boston, I'll come back here. 
18974 2 Happy hour is pretty freakin good but $7 for a cup of GD coffee!! That's outrageous! I didn't spend 8 years of my life fighting through the rice paddies of Khe Sanh to come back and pay $7 for a hummingbirds beak full of Folgers! 
18975 4 My daughter said the lobster Mac & Cheese was the best she has ever had!! The stuffed lobster w/ a clambake was awesome and filling! King crab leg well you can't go wrong with them anyways lol. Also loved the decor! 
18976 4 The most amazing and cheapest watch repair guy in greater vancouver he charged 5.60 to adjust my band o my god this guy is amazing Everyone in vancouver needs to come here for watch repair 5/5 amazing 
18977 3 Great food love the flavors. Patio is very warm and inviting Miser is very authentic. Good meat choices. Need to focus on cleanliness. Lot of signs of dirt buildup Definitely recommend for authentic.Ethiopian food 
18978 2 I was excited to have a "real fish house" in our area, however, the fish was just mediocre. The price is a little steep in comparison to the quality of food they're serving. On a positive note, the service was great! I most likely will try it again. 
18979 1 Just because you put an egg on it, doesn't make it breakfast. Although the flavours are good, most of these dishes are dinner meals that have an egg on it. Apparently, voila!!! Breakfast.... Probably won't be coming here ever again but i did enjoy the lavender latte. 
18980 2 Food was good except everything was wayyyyy too salty. I feel like they should take it easy with the salt and have customers add our own salt if we needed. Portions were a good size. Waffles were good but I wish it was a little more crispy. 
18981 3 Food has a lot of variety I must say. Garlic fries were ok. The dynamite rolls were really good. Their hunen kung pao pasta was decent. It's very nice looking inside actually.Very fancy looking. 
18982 3 The place is full with students, hard to find a place to sit. I had a mixed berry cake and a black coffee. The cake was pretty good, Airy, sweetened just right. On the other hand the coffee was average, I Liked the thinking cup coffee more. 
18983 4 Great vanilla latte! The ladies that served me were super nice. I really liked the decor of the shop. Their logo is awesome too. 
18984 0 I picked up some Orange Chicken and Chow Mein for my wife and I. The next morning at 4am we both woke up with FOOD POISONING!!! If yelp would let me leave no stars I would. 
18985 3 Great little spot to grab a coffee and have some good conversation~ positive upbeat vibe....they actually Top your coffee off with heart shaped foam....really cute and fun! 
18986 1 Small place. The food was average. Cioppino and oyster stew were ok. The oyster stew was a bit too sweet. The onion rings were thin. It would've been better if they were cut thick. In summary, below average to average. 
18987 4 Pretty sure they add crack to their tuna melts cause I just can't get enough! The people that work there are ridiculously helpful and cheerful! 
18988 4 Leah is great. I have very thick hair which I don't let anyone touch but her. She knows how to style and cut my hair plus is phenominal with color which she had to correct from a previous bad salon experience. She's just terrific. 
18989 4 Great game store! Lots of room for gaming and a large selection of games to buy or play. Parking can be tricky on weekends but there's plenty of street parking and neighboring businesses are closed on Sunday so use those too. 
18990 4 Excellent! Perfect fusion of sushi and burger!!! Highly recommend all American burgushi and deliverance roll. 
18991 0 This safeway is a joke. Every other store has been updated to the 21st century except this one. Old tills, no self check outs, alot products unavailable. The owner is obviously a cheap skate 
18992 4 This is my go-to diner. The food is always incredible and the portions are generous. Depending on when you go, you may have to wait (the space is quite small) but it is worth it. 
18993 4 Beautiful salad bar with interesting fresh selections. The meats are seasoned to perfection. My favorite place!!!! I love their deserts as well!!! 
18994 2 The service was wonderful but the custard did not taste as good as other places. The custard was too soft for me. I like my custard thicker. 
18995 2 Very nice staff and pretty good washin' (I can get past the water spots) , however BEWARE... my front license plate got jacked up after I went through :( 
18996 4 Super honest people. Brought in a car to get checked out here before I bought it. They were really honest with me and gave me all the info I needed to make an informed decision. This place deserves all 5 stars they get on Yelp, and probably a few more. 
18997 4 Always kick ass pizza, cheesy bread and salad bar! Friendly staff too :) 
18998 3 Excellent fresh oysters! My party and I had 5 dozen oysters. YUMMY!!!! 
18999 3 It was nice and kind servers. However, coming from a Latin culture, the food was just "ok". It's worth the price but not anything you leave bragging about. Definitely an Americanized version of Latin food 
19000 4 Frickin' awesome Calzones and very,very ono canollis! I definitely will come to this place again when I drop by Portland. Advice: Overnight FedEx me a calzone! I'm in need of good pizzeria's to visit here in Hawaii. 
19001 2 Very efficient online ordering system for their exotic fruits. Tried Mayberries for first time, fr Australia. Like a mini-lychee but softer outer skin is edible. A bit tangy. 
19002 3 Takes way too long to get in to see a doctor, but they are very friendly and caring, they saved my puppy's life and took good care of her. They are expensive but very caring and wonderful towards animals. 
19003 4 This is by far my favorite neighborhood spot in Hyde Park! Great for dinner or Sunday brunch, good for reservations or walk up, very attentive and professional staff. I highly recommend the grilled salmon. 
19004 3 I love the chicken Ultimo burrito. Very friendly staff usually. I think the portions might not be as large as they used to be, but I still love going there because of the great flavors. 
19005 4 Best donuts in Austin! Love the grape flavored donut! Only down side of coming here is the parking! 
19006 3 Great place to eat before a Red Socks game. Great food, esp the apps. Great nachos. 
19007 3 Airport food is looking up. The duck sliders with roasted peanuts and slaw was perfection. They're busy but prompt and fresh. 
19008 2 I really like this place. The burgers are pretty tasty and so is the chicken sandwich. But man, I can't understand the guys that take the orders. Repeat the order so you don't get the order wrong! This happened to me twice this month!!! 
19009 2 Blah, blah, blah blah, liberal blah blah blah Blah, blah closet Republicans blah, blah, blah, blah Blah. Blah, Blah!!! Bullies, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, BLAH BLAH !!! 
19010 4 I love this place. The decor is so outrageous, it's awesome. It's next to some awesome restaurants, so you can have dinner and dessert there. The staff is super nice. They have great frozen yogurt and many great flavors. Toppings are good and plentiful. They have late hours too ! 
19011 3 Highly recommend. The service was excellent, the food was fresh and delicious, and they took special requests with grace. Great meal for the six of us. 
19012 4 Any word on why this location closed. We were regulars here, went on vacation came back and it had closed down. I love Logans. 
19013 3 Great staff and good food with a fantastic river view. Their rock fish is amazing and they are very thoughtful for special occasions. They even have a patio for summer dining that is the best in the area. Plus, you can dine with your pooch on it. Thanks! 
19014 2 I don't really like Panera because they don't often change their menu. It's easy to go through the menu because it's been the same since its very opening. Boorrriingg. Kind of pricey for what you get. Plenty of parking is available. 
19015 4 Great place to enjoy a great movie !!! They are going to get some new seats yay !!! I hope they WILL bring the fish & chips back:( Happy Yelping Everyone! 
19016 3 Great little bar. Good food, great beer list. Tom, the owner is great. Try this place....you will go back! 
19017 3 Great food, great atmosphere. Had the falafel and stuffed eggplant. Warm fresh bread and dipping oil provided to the table. All was delicious. Amanda was our server. She was very polite and helpful. 
19018 3 This is the restaurant inside the Embassy Suites in downtown and we ate there on our first night in town. Service was fantastic, though the food was a bit on the salty side. Still, I'd come back the next time I wanted a slab of beef. 
19019 3 Good German food in an endearingly silly faux-old-country setting. Hard not to like. 
19020 4 Food and service exceeded our expectations. It was all fresh and very tasty. The restaurant was very clean and neat. Never thought this place would be this good. 
19021 1 Burgers are just ok (and normally cooked poorly). Definitely not worth the price or the ridiculous line. The only reason for two stars is because the milkshakes are good. 
19022 3 Amazing fresh fruits and vegetables as well as DELICIOUS sandwiches. The scones are also yummy but sometimes sell out! The setting is pretty as well as the store. Lots of parking available. Love this place! 
19023 3 Aw, this place brings back memories. My family used to get burgers here all the time. I like the cheeseburgers, and the onion rings are especially greasy and good and ginormous. Also their malts and shakes were really delicious. Super affordable too. 
19024 0 Pad thai was probably the worst I've had. They use thin spaghetti noodles. Shrimp was over cooked. Will not order from here again. 
19025 4 Excellent and friendly bartender. Drinks were very good and enjoyable. I really liked the atmosphere was it was nice and dark with a lot of wooden fixtures. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to grab a drink or play pool in Portland. 
19026 4 Everyone is super friendly!!! The sushi is delish and it's affordable. The waitress was very helpful even the person who makes sushi came over to say Hi! Awesome place. 
19027 0 Just horrible. My nail technician did a very rushed job, yapping on the phone the whole time, leaving the manicure bumpy and uneven. Overpriced for their quality of work. I will never be going back. 
19028 2 This place is okay -- food is hit or miss, service is hit or miss. Odd location for nightlife scene they are going for. 
19029 2 I went here with my bf for dinner on a weeknight. The crawfish tasted pretty fresh, but the flavor was just okay. The sauce didn't have any unique taste that stands out. The service was average. The seafood is mediocre. 
19030 4 This has got to be one of my favorite places in Austin!! By far the best grilled cheese I've ever had, and it is incredible every time! The location is great and the outside seating along south congress is beyond enjoyable. I would 100% recommend and go back! 
19031 2 Nothing really special here. Snacks, bubble tea, and thick toast with condensed milk. There are constant take out orders, which means the restaurant gets chilly in winter. Good for some sobering up over snacks and bbtea, or to chat with friends. 
19032 4 They have the best Baba ghanoush! I have also tried their falafel, hummus, and lamb shanks. All are good and worth trying. 
19033 2 Had a amazing dinner. Price was on point nothing over the top. Food quality was great. Only thing was they were so busy that service was hard but still wasn't to a point that is bad. The lobster was yummy and so was the sides. 
19034 3 Decided to try this restaurant on a whim while visiting Atlanta, very pleased with the overall experience! I'll admit, a couple sides may be an acquired taste (first time trying Ethiopian cuisine). Will definitely go back when in the area! 
19035 3 Advantage Vacuum offers the reasonable prices of vacuum, product knowledge and customer support. They carry different series of Miele vacuums, accessories and provide warranty service. 
19036 4 The wings are great, what is really outstanding is the customer service at the east Boston location. All staff are always attentive, cheerful & helpful 
19037 0 Our son was born 17 months ago and this was our second attempt at a date in all that time. The ticket taker wouldn't let us into the theater because we were two minutes late. Theater policy is especially stupid because moviegoers and waiters walk in and out during shows. 
19038 1 Not a great place. Eat on land beforehand. They only have fast food items. Also there is no alcohol allowed on the island so you won't be able to enjoy a glass of wine here. 
19039 4 Been coming to this place since I moved to Orlando. They always take care of me here very reliable tires and quick service, more importantly good quality. 
19040 3 Dinner. Once with friends, once with my better half. I love these little plates of deliciousness, & typically enjoy 4-5 of them in a given evening. Plus, pleasant decor & an interesting bar menu. All in all, an enjoyable (if spendy) treat.. 
19041 4 I feel like a peasant walking into this gorgeous, soaring building. From their insane bulk section to endless aisles of frozen food, this place is what's up. I love when a place has dates by the pound with the produce. 
19042 4 Place is great. Food is fantastic, service is good. Coffee tastes fresh and is local. My favorite breakfast spot by far. Never been disappointed here. 
19043 4 This is my favorite stop when I get off late and need a family dinner. My son loves the baked ziti and my husband and I always get a pizza. Great wine selection. Love love napolis 
19044 4 The Vancouver Aquarium is nice. There are many sea animals to see. Well kept. Good day to spend with the family 
19045 4 previous review got erased somehow but I will say what I said the first time......on eof the best restaurants in America peeeeeeeriod. 
19046 3 How do they fit all that stuff you need into one little store? Always will baffle me. Very friendly staff and pharmacy. I also develop my 35mm film here and they staff back there usually knows what they're talking about (which is rare at a Walgreens). 
19047 4 Went for lunch today had a lamb gyro my wife had a vegetable gyro they were both absolutely delicious. Looking forward to going back and trying other things on the menu. The portions were very generous. Two Thumbs up to Chef Alex. 
19048 3 I was pretty satisfied with the service - the ladies were very friendly and prompt, and the Apples 'n' Greens was made like I expected. Glad they have one of these on my layover! 
19049 3 Good place for a healthy choice dinner or lunch. Service is ok, but slow. Their prices are are a bit on the high side. 
19050 4 Great food. Great service. Always accommodating to my gluten free girlfriend too. Fast and friendly! 
19051 3 Easy climb up a few steps. great views of nice homes on colorado river and of downtown Austin. make sure you walk around the paths around as you can get away from the crowds and get some good pictures! I went on a Sunday, parking was easy. 
19052 1 Good vibes and great customer service but wayyyy to pricey.. 9 dollars for a small juice that equaled probably 5 sips. 
19053 2 It is an ok Chinese restaurant. The red sauce and fried rice could be better on a consistent basis. I eat there regularly cause they are in the area. 
19054 4 I'm not a huge history fan, but the fact that it was so interactive made it much more enjoyable. 
19055 0 If you want your order wrong, go here. I saw multiple people leave here shaking their heads because of screwed up orders. I just wonder how bad the drive thru is. 
19056 4 Awesome experience here- everyone was super friendly and nice. We had to wait a few extra minutes for our lunch so they gave us canolis on the house! My fave will definitely come back here again. 
19057 3 Best waffles I've ever had. Ever. The chicken seasoning for the Chicken and Waffles dish was a little weird. ADORABLE decor. Will definitely return 
19058 4 The food is good but the people who own it are the best. Super friendly. The corned beef hash is freaking awesome best I have ever had!!!! 
19059 4 Hallelujah, a fresh-ingredient-driven chef from San Francisco is in charge now. Delicious! 
19060 3 Great place as far selection. Looked a bit pricey but they did throw me an extra nail that was 30$. But, only after taking back the 35$ domeless ... I like my piece. 
19061 0 When I came in it looked like a really nice place but one I night when I was going to bed I found a cockroach crawl across the room 
19062 3 Walked into Posto for dinner with my husband. Had never heard of the restaurant and I am very glad we stopped in. The food was excellent and they had a great beer. The dessert was probably my favorite!! 
19063 3 A great cup of coffee (can't remember the name of it) with almond and a shortbread cookie. Always works well together... Tiny place and you can only get to it from 4th Ave heading east! That took me a bit to figure out... 
19064 2 I love the bingsoo here- I've tried mango/banana and strawberry, and both were delicious. Not too sweet but not flavourless either. However, both times that I've gone, I've had to wait ~30minutes... the first time I went, I actually thought they forgot my order cause of how long it took. 
19065 3 Ikea is a great option for modern and in a budget interior design resource, you have to do a little leg work to get your item but is a great experience. 
19066 4 Amazing venue for our group event! Owner and staff were extremely welcoming, courteous, accommodating, attentive --- to our entire group! We all HIGHLY recommend this place (AND food!) for any type of event whether solo or in a group. 
19067 4 Ordered pandan/green cake with fresh fruits for my birthday. Its so good, i cant stop eating it. Its not too sweet. I got the bread and love all of them. Highly recommended. 
19068 4 Once again John is the King. He's patient and he knows how to make glasses sit right on your face. Awesome 
19069 4 I had a cookies n' cream milkshake, and it was another one of those food items that belongs in the "So good, you wouldn't believe it was vegan" category. Hands down, this food cart was the best find during my 48 hrs. in Portland. 
19070 0 Horrible experience , bought a yelp deal and the restaurant said they don't honor it although it's still valid They asked me to take up the issue with Yelp. 
19071 3 Stopped in for a trade show break. Service was off slightly yesterday. Food good, atmosphere great. A good place to stop when in Orlando area. For me. 
19072 4 Very delicious food and friendly staff! Good prices and the food came out in a timely manner. Highly recommended. 
19073 3 Delicious baked goods! I picked up some almond croissants the other day, not too sweet. A bit pricey but fresh! Great friendly customer service. I will come for more that's for sure. It's probably the best in Port Moody. 
19074 4 If you like fried chicken, this place is a must! Easily the best friend chicken I've tasted in Austin (honestly the best I've ever tried). The atmosphere is good as well. 
19075 3 Love this place for the great music, friendly and enthusiastic staff and pretty decent food for the insanely low cost! Great place to stop before or after a night of partying, or if you just wanna have some drinks with friends and jam to some awesome playlists! 
19076 3 Spent the day bar hopping in Austin on Sunday, Service was on point! Robbie and Brooke were behind the bar, they were great! My only complaint was the band played the same set several times, then asked for request...but wouldn't play any of them. Oh well! The bar was fun! 
19077 3 Pizza hut is great in USA, its a different menu this prices are really cheap. 
19078 4 LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Support a local business, eat delicious food, drink amazing cocktails, let your little ones play in the Finntastic forest and relax in this home away from home! 
19079 4 Great food, friendly service, and quaint feel. The keg blew when my beer was 75% full and he gave it to me for free! Definitely coming back. 
19080 3 U liked godfathers pizza it was reonably priced. It had its unique flavor and friendly staff. 
19081 3 Great atmosphere, great margaritas, good food. Ask to sit in the back. It's bit too loud in the front, more of a bar atmosphere. 
19082 4 Megan's hair cuts are so good that my hair styles easily even as it grows out! I've stayed with her through new hair styles and years. She is awesome! 
19083 0 Went there to ask a few questions about tuning my amp. I was rudely told to leave and not come back from one of the owners. Terrible customer service. Save your time and go elsewhere 
19084 4 Jimmy is the funniest bartender ever! Pretty sure it should be called Jimmburger. For real the food was fantastic, our party had a range of food from the our burger to the portobello sandwich. 
19085 4 Awesome ambiance and great people watching. Food and wine were amazing. A sommelier helped us choose a Spanish wine. It was also our wedding anniversary and they gave us champagne. Great overall experience 
19086 4 Great food and truly exceptional service. Beet and Goat cheese salad was great as was the penne bolognese. The bolognese sauce was loaded with meat - something that I have found to be rare. We will definitely come back here. 
19087 2 The blue plates I've had here are nothing special. The sandwiches are pretty good and they are modestly priced for Downtown. 
19088 4 Atmosphere is very chill here. Waitstaff is polite and attentive. Food was great. I had the mushroom ravioli. Perfect amount and delicious! Would come again if I find myself in this terminal on a future trip! 
19089 4 Food is amazing as usual!!!! My favorite restaurant to be honest. Outstanding food geez, nothing here is less than 4 out of 5 stars, it's sorta overwhelming 
19090 3 I challenge you to find a more precious 7 Eleven. Other than that it's pretty regular. GREAT FOR: magazines, slurpees. 
19091 2 Food excellent , service sub-par. 10+ employees not super busy and it took forever to get our food , than it took forever to ring us up. By the time we got our food it was cold. I hope they pick it up or we won't be back. 
19092 4 This place is the best for a delicious healthy breakfast! Taylor was our waitress and she was so accommodating and helpful! Highly recommend! Thanks Taylor! 
19093 4 A neighborhood place Italian style. Friendly staff, pizza that is not a chain. Very tasty, baked with a slight burn on the crust - flavor. Task for the bread and peppers. Had a great conversation with the staff. Thumbs all 
19094 4 Robin at the bar was great Joes is very luck to have such a out going Friendly person and the lunch was great 
19095 3 Stumptown AND Intelligentsia AND friendly laid back people with ample seating. Can it get any better? Well I guess I would prefer stronger chocolate for the Valrhona Mocha... like the one at Coffeehouse Northwest. 
19096 4 Whitney is amazing. As a bartender, I have been where she is and she made sure we enjoyed our time. Thanks, Whitney!! 
19097 4 Geekatoo is great and affordable. They performed a virtual virus removal from my desktop computer. They were able to login remotely and remove all viruses. Computer is working wonderful now. 
19098 4 I ordered a cheese pizza for my family and it was fantastic, service was quick ad efficient as well as very polite!!! I noticed they have one in Randolph too?......The salads I saw and the Calzone (steak and Cheese) looked really good and will have to try it another time!!! 
19099 4 I LOVE, LOVE these sliders and fries. Burgers are special and execution is always spot on. If you haven't tried them, please do yourself a favor! WOWZERS! P.S.- TRUFFLE FRIES! 
19100 0 The wait staff was rude. Waiter reached right over my food. The wasn't much to chose from. Next time go to golden corral. 
19101 3 You can't find many good brunch places where you don't have to wait at least 45 minutes to be seated. This place is great. Chicken & waffles were delicious. Coffee was alright, but the waitress was very friendly. Will definitely come back again and again. 
19102 1 Food was pretty good - sturgeon, duck, trout, and pork chop. Salad too. Call it solid B. But the service was slow, exceptionally so. There are a lot of other restaurants that "bring both to the table." We won't be back. 
19103 4 Amazing food at a great price. We got the salmon and lamb plates. Everything was cooked to perfection and the salad dressing is amazing. The owner chatted us up before we left, really friendly guy which made the whole experience even more enjoyable. This place deserves a spot downtown. 
19104 4 I just finished an excellent lunch at Ming Court. The service by Joe was exceptional and the meal was delicious. I had the Chinese broccoli, shrimp dim sum and a tuna roll. All were amazing. I'd come back here anytime. 
19105 1 I had high hopes for a gourmet burger joint in Arlington but was severly disappointed and the quality and cost. You end up paying almost $10 for a burger that was ok at best. Better off at Bartley's in Harvard Sq for great burgers at a price worth paying. 
19106 4 This place was great. Came here for a birthday dinner. Sangria was good but expensive at $34 a pitcher. Had the Dungeness crab. Can't go wrong with that! Their onion rings were fantastic and coleslaw yummy and fresh! Cannot wait to return. 
19107 0 Not impressed. Very expensive with a poor view. Also, the champagne "flight" upgrade was a ripoff. You pay $14 for half a plastic cup of cheap champagne. Also, half of the window panes were foggy which contributed to the lack of visibility. 
19108 3 Great place to head before or after a show at the BCA. Solid wine list. Terrific Sangria on a hot summer day. Delicious tapas. Pricey, but worth it for a relaxing, "treat yo self" evening. Good, attentive (though never felt rushed) service. 
19109 4 Great atmosphere amazing food!!!I had the catfish and grits with 2 sides. The catfish portion was very large. I enjoyed their version of red pepper jelly yams. The biscuit was outstanding and so was the collards!!!I will definitely visit again. 
19110 4 We ordered the fried chicken, fried catfish, fried pork chop, cheese grits, greens, fried okra, dirty rice...... sweet potato pie and bread pudding. Everything was beyond delicious. We will be making this a weekly staple. 
19111 1 Ordered 3 signs 6" X 24"and they arrived in 7 days. They were bent, but I could still use them. Poor quality. 
19112 3 Super friendly staff and delicious pizza!! What else do you want from a pizza place?? 
19113 3 This place has great cheesesteaks! I should try something else on the menu but I can't help myself. 
19114 4 Modmarket is a clean eating kind of establishment. I love that it's fast FRESH food. They offer sandwiches, salads and pizza all made with organic fresh ingredients. I would eat here everyday if there were one of these in my town. 
19115 4 Bought our tree and stand here yesterday. Wonderful helpful staff and reasonable prices. All the trees looked fresh and full. Highly recommend this place. 
19116 4 The noodles here are so good!! But - pro tip - get here early as they get very busy, and when they run out of noodles they close. I personally prefer the noodles with either their Kailua pork or dumplings; their soup is not terrible, but not the best. 
19117 4 Sarah at La Raine's was so much fun and made the dress trying on experience a blast with me and all my girls. La Raine's was very accommodating for our crowd of 4 and Sarah was very knowledgeable of the dresses in store and ones for me to try. 
19118 4 Vegetarian pizza with tofu as a choice for protein... I could not be more excited than I am right now!!!! 
19119 1 I'm a Starbucks fan so have been disappointed with the service at this store. They are so S-L-O-W. I have never waited so long for an order. Maybe it's faster if you go inside. Not sure probably won't go back to this location. 
19120 4 Stopped here with my husband and we had a great experience. The avocado toast was incredible! And the salmon bagel as well. 
19121 4 What can I say? This is damn good fried chicken! A little spicy, not greasy, batter not to thick...just very tasty! For sides we had beans, coleslaw and mac'n'cheese. If they had one up above 2222 I would definitely go there more often. 
19122 3 Was pleasantly surprised after reading the reviews. It's a very serviceable urban grocery store. I can get most of what I need here. Worth checking out for daily needs. 
19123 4 So Authentic, and everyone that works there is always so sweet, like they are actually happy to seat and serve you. The prices are fantastic and they give you a lot of food- and it is really good food. I cant say enough, check it our for sure! 
19124 4 Favorite place to go to in Orlando !!! Coming from up north it's exciting to have Bonchon located here in Orlando it makes me feel like I am in DC or NYC. 
19125 4 Very good food. Nice atmosphere. Great service. A hidden gem. Food is well priced. 
19126 1 Ew I really didnt like this place. I got two of the vegetable tacos and they were super runny and had way too much of the mayo topping on it. The "falafel" taco was bullshit. 
19127 4 I get the shrimp burrito every time I go and I have never regretted it. I work next door so I do go a lot. 
19128 4 Our group had a fantastic time here for a recent team building event. Props to Stacey and Jacob for facilitating such a fun time! 
19129 0 Salmon was too dry. Rice was Overcooked. Waitresses were Slow. They forgot who order what, but they wrote our seats. It was AWFUL!!! 
19130 2 Food not exciting and service was slow. With so many new options popping up in Austin for Indian food especially South Indian, this place really needs to step it up! 
19131 2 This will not be the best sushi you ever had, but it's solid and the prices are quite reasonable. Service is often pretty quick, too. Go across the hall and buy some pocky in the market for dessert. 
19132 4 Not only was the food outstanding, but so was the service! Snooze is very gluten free friendly. You can't even tell that their pancakes are gluten free. If you're looking for breakfast or brunch, gluten free or not, this is definitely a must have. 
19133 4 Best vintage store in town! Great furniture for a great price! The employees are kind and very knowledgeable about top shelf mid-century furniture. 
19134 3 Their croissants did live up to their reputation. Definitely recommended. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a European café and patisserie. 
19135 3 Came in for the first time last week...will be coming back. Often. Food was delicious - comparable to banana leaf and tropika...but cheaper. Not to say it's dirt cheap, but you can have a meal for 2 maybe 3 including appies for about $35. 
19136 4 Dr. Lamalva is fantastic, really knowledgeable, and kind. Her staff is very helpful, nice, and easy-going. Highly recommend! 
19137 3 Sigh. Of course these guys are closed now. I will miss those seasoned chips, and having options nearby. 
19138 2 Need a bottle of water for your flight? Pick one up here! Pretty pricey but does the job. Otherwise, you should bring an empty water bottle and carry it with you through security, so you can fill it up at the water fountains located throughout the airport. 
19139 4 Wow. Just wow. This place never ceases to impress! I've been here for brunch, dinner and drinks, and all are quality food served by quality people :) the Bloody Mary really is that good, and I don't really like bloody Mary's, so... 
19140 0 This chipotle store was terrible. They nickel and dime you for the adds, the chips were stale and the wait staff was so unfriendly they made you feel like you were doing them a favor by eating there.. 
19141 0 Been sitting waiting to get my interior cleaned for an hour. 4 cars ahead of me still. Are you kidding me....nobody has come to explain the delay. Just sitting here waiting for my EXPRESS interior cleaning. Never coming back to this dump. 
19142 3 Nice and comfortable to stop for a bite or a glass of wine before you take off. Always better to sit there while waiting. 
19143 4 Best steak tips around! When I'm graving steak tips no other place comes to mind. Huge portions, great flavor, cooked perfectly every time. Haven't tried anything else on the menu cause there's no need. Steak tips, steak tips, steak tips! 
19144 4 Received recommendation for Dr. Gordon from a friend. Wow! Fantastic dentist and super friendly staff. Way better than I expected and I started with high expectations! 
19145 3 It's a great place to live if you're a BU student. Besides the price, my roommates and I really liked it. 
19146 2 Very unique burger restaurant simply delicious burgers with a twist. The restaurant itself has an awesome atmosphere great feel. Remind of a high end restaurant in Las Vegas. 
19147 4 Great, fun place! I agree with Heather F., it was like "Affair Night" when we went, not that it's a bad thing, just interesting. Bartender great! Good to have a "different" kind of spot in downtown. Talk about Lifestyle... 
19148 4 ahhhhhh! just had a summermoon latte and i feel like i could conquer the world! ....plus it was deeeeeelicious :d they use this super sweet creamy delicious milk.. "moon milk" definitely my favorite coffee in town! 
19149 4 My friend Claudia and I went for lunch today. First time for us both. Service was outstanding, food was great and the all you can eat option gives you every bang for your buck. Will most definitely go back with our Sushi Lovin' Crew next time! 
19150 2 Ordered the lobster roll was just okay had fries with it and the fries came already cold that sucked, fiance ordered the baked stuffed lobster he liked it 
19151 4 the only thing greater than the food was Hilary, our waitress. She was so friendly and down to earth, had great recommendations for a rose. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town. 
19152 4 Awesome place to eat!! Great service and great food. Fair prices and a wide selection of menu items. The baby back ribs are awesome!! We eat here on a regular basis and never had a bad experience! Must eat place in Cocoa!! 
19153 4 WOW. Pricey? A bit, yeah. But oh my god it's good. We had octopus, bone marrow, and the smoked trout and just wow. One of my best food experiences in a long time. Don't be scared to try something new! 
19154 4 I absolutely LOVE Blue Star. Quality ingredients, creative ingredients, and I'm totally in love with their donuts! Thank You!!! 
19155 4 Their chicken fried rice, or any of the fried rice is fantastic. It only comes with onions and peas and your choice of protein but boy are those veggies fresh. The family is always welcoming and the food is always a great choice. 
19156 4 My home away from home. Best for outdoor seating (unless the smokers have taken over). Fabulous pasta and salads of the day. They focus on beer so it's less perfect for those of us who like fruity drinks, but with such a comfortable vibe that's a minor complaint. 
19157 0 Service was ok but what do you expect from DD? Coffee was luck warm and and burnt tasting. I have always liked DD but over the past year their coffee qualities have gone down down down. 
19158 4 Another 5-star review for a fast delivery of Aloo Chole, Garlic Naan, and vegetable Samosas on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Exceptional! 
19159 4 Great place to meet for a drink before heading out for the night. Open, airy, and good lighting. If you are trying to meet up with friends coming into city, this works great. Easy to spot people. Staff was very pleasant and drinks were tasty. 
19160 3 Very friendly staff and reasonable prices. I have visited visited twice but didn't buy, because the trucks never won me over. No sales pressure at all. I know a couple people that have bought and they were happy with their purchase. 
19161 4 Never had a bad meal here! The service is great! The menu is broad enough to where everyone in the group will be happy! 
19162 3 I don't even eat burgers and I love this place. The Anderson location is the way to go. Sorry southies. 
19163 3 Great food. Good service. Loud, cramped restaurant accounts for loss of one star. Will go back. 
19164 3 That ride was probably not worth the wait. The outside looks much cooler than the inside. Since I had a fast pass, It was worth it. If not, I wouldn't wait very long. 
19165 0 Terrible bar service. Second time going and both times the bartenders have been totally inattentive and unfriendly. Not a good vibe overall. Plus, the chips are awful and the salsa likely Pace Picante. 
19166 4 This place is absolutely delicious. Real good food with no gimmicks, but with some amazing little twists. The chicken sandwich on the brunch menu is to die for and cooked perfectly. This won't be my last time here. I am a a huge fan. 
19167 2 Tasting menu features many strong dishes. Sadly pacing of the meal is very poor. Long waits between courses. 4 and a half hours for the meal when if the pacing was better it would have been 3 hours. 
19168 4 Great bread and tea. Stumbled upon this bakery out in the cold. The matcha espresso is amazing+! 
19169 4 I have been in a number of halls and these guys and gals rock! A great time! The foks running the games are super friendly and answered all my questions. 
19170 3 First timer. Food was delicious. I had the Egg noodles with Shrimp and Vegetables. Definitely will ne coming back. www.TravelPeach.Dreamtrips.com 
19171 3 My appt. was for 3:00pm. I got here @ 2:48 & was told it would take an hour. They didn't start working on my car till 3:02 and were done by 3:55pm. Nice job crew. Anna works the front counter & was very nice to meet. 
19172 2 Food is average! Service is okay! My boyfriend and I got a rice plate, didn't give us a spoon and fork! Maybe they're expecting that we gonna use chopstick for our rice plate?! 
19173 4 Delicious! Huge kids meals, fast counter service and even express pickup if you call ahead. I had a lobster roll and husband had a steak bomb and both were huge and delicious! Great choice! 
19174 4 Had a corrective cut done by Walker and I am amazed! Such an amazing and kind person with phenomenal skill. My hair has never looked or felt so good and Walker was so kind during the entire process. Will definitely be returning soon :) 
19175 4 Had a really good experience last night after losing my phone and then having problems with the replacement. Kelsey was terrific and not only helped me with my problem but made several improvements to my plan which will save me money in the end. Kudos and thanks. 
19176 4 The service here has been great, the reception people are kind and helpful. I don't feel judged when I bring my dog here:) 
19177 3 Fast delivery, and big slices that you can actually fold in half to eat like a decent person. 
19178 2 Average lighting store, lots of variety, a bit pricey compared to the competition in Richmond and Coquitlam. 
19179 4 This was such a great choice for Mothers Day. Robert (GM) and Chef Tom as well as the whole staff were so friendly on such a busy day. The food WAS AMAZING. The atmosphere was just what we were looking for. Great neighborhood. Wish we lived here. 
19180 0 Let me be clear: If you want crappy drinks made by useless "bartenders" who obviously have no experience making cocktails and love hanging out in a place that attracts douchey Boston bros. DEFINITELY COME TO THIS PLACE! 
19181 4 Always amazing food and service. Get the vegetable deluxe it is phenomenal. They are willing to work with you on your dietary needs. Been coming here for years and it never disappoints. 
19182 4 Has tons of flavors! For people who don't like ipas, there are plenty of great options. The place also does paint nights as well so it's a great place for an activity. 
19183 4 Yum! Yum! Yum! This place is so delicious! Everyone at my table enjoyed the food immensely. I had the Chicken and Dumplings, Turnips, Rice with brown gravy. I tried my husband's mac and cheese. Very tasty! We will definitely be back! 
19184 4 This is the only location I'll ever get my haircut. I'm sure the other employees are great but I can always count on Balvi and Masad to do an amazing job on my hair. Been going here for years and don't plan on going anywhere. 
19185 4 It's sooo so good. Everything was delicious (I got the vegetarian platter). The injera, the different lentils, everything was good. It's small inside but a big outside patio. Get there early or expect a wait! 
19186 3 My soup was a bit salty, but everything else rocked! Try the bloody mary. 
19187 3 The food was delicious. The service was great! Friendly atmosphere. Would come back again. 
19188 4 Delicious homemade food and very friendly service. The breakfast sandwich is the perfect portion and made with all really delicious ingredients. Our waiter was very attentive but not too attentive and he was very nice and friendly. I would definitely come back. 
19189 4 My pup Winston loves coming here! The staff is friendly and as an overprotective mother I appreciate the live camera feed they have on at all time. I'd highly recommend CBW! 
19190 3 Nice burger joint. It's hard to find char-broilers in the Portland area and this place is a welcome surprise. Nice burger selections with a decidedly Pacific Island flair... Teriyaki sauce, pineapple rings, etc. Yummy! 
19191 3 Good food, cute little cafe. Oconnors down the street is better but fat city is fun to go to. Usually is a bit o a wait but it is worth it. 
19192 2 The crab legs are on point but the price is a bit steep so if you plan on getting crablegs prepared to pay over 20 bucks basically for like a whole crab haven't tried anything else. 
19193 4 Wow! Absolutely the best burger I've ever tried. (Earth and Turf) the beef fat Fries were great tool. Fast, friendly service. Only suggestion would be to add a kids burger to the menu at reduced pricing. 
19194 0 Way overrated. Make some normal burgers that aren't slathered in stuff...or if you insist on all that flavor, make em good like Casino El Camino 
19195 4 Delicious coffee--I had the bullet latte! On weekends they have destination donuts so I was able to enjoy a maple pecan donut which was delicious! The staff was so so friendly which makes a huge difference too! 
19196 4 Lucas has been instrumental in taking care of a shoulder injury that made any overhead reaching painful. Highly recommended! 
19197 4 I had a quick visit for a minor issue. My wait time was short (30 minutes) and Dr. Marsha Ware was exceptional. The whole appt, start to finish took less than an hour. Very pleased with the customer service and the professional care received. Highly recommend. 
19198 3 We go every Wednesday. Very casual small town feel. Try the Brunswick Stew! If you want authentic southern...this is your place! 
19199 4 This is a great dental practice! Dr Yegorov is very personable and takes the time to explain everything that is going on. Nothing felt rushed and you can tell how much she cares about her patients. Highly recommend! 
19200 4 I had a great time on the bus. They had a bunch of buses to choose from and we chose the one that looked like a giant limo. We danced on the dance pole and drank, and the diver was really fun :) 
19201 3 Fantastic Tofu Soups Very fast service What more can you ask for? Only star off is the fact that their tofu soups can sometimes be lacking in meats and seafood. In addition, they have really expensive meat dishes, which was a bit out of my price range. 
19202 3 Awesome food and fairly priced. Great margaritas too. I never leave disappointed. It can get pretty busy, but worth the wait. 
19203 3 Driving back from Portland, found this place on yelp and it didn't disappoint. Very warm and cozy atmosphere. We had breakfast and we were both very pleased by our selections, will definitely stop here again when passing through. 
19204 4 Love this place. Get here early though because the wait can be daunting. But once you get here you won't be upset. Great staff, great food, and great ambience. 
19205 2 Awesome arcade games, awful young bouncer on a power trip turning people away. It's a mixed bag but the games are awesome! 
19206 3 Loved this spot: super quick service and my calzone was light and appropriately spinachy- delish! Husband had the gnocchi and they were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light-not sweet like some restaurants that add sugar. Great place for lunch, glad we stopped in! 
19207 0 Food is good but the service is really bad. In the afternoon the weather is really hot but they give me hot water. Crazy service i ever seen 
19208 0 Thought I would try this. Wings horrible. I did not eat. Cheesesteak okay but not the best I've ever had. Fries. I asked for extra crispy and they were white not even tan. Will not be back 
19209 3 Truly the BEST Nachos in all of the Portland Metro area. Huge serving size, easy to split between multiple people. Always fresh, always delicious. A bit of a "dive bar" atmosphere, but service is always prompt and friendly. Prices are affordable. Great jukebox. Casual, low-key environment. 
19210 0 I have never liked Blue Cross Blue Shield. I've had problems dealing with their red tape and incompetence in the past. Unfortunately, my current employer has recently switched our insurance over to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas and I am already annoyed with their services. 
19211 4 Went for the first time tonight, great place. Staff could not be friendlier, food was great as were the drinks. Great local hang out with views from inside and on the porch. we will be back! 
19212 4 Sushi so fresh!! I ordered a salmon collar and they originally told me they didn't have it. But as soon as the shipment came in they were cutting & cooking as we were talking! Thank you Alfredo 
19213 4 Words can't do this justice. TL;DR Just go and experience it. A great place for all ages and interests (history of the collection, theft, etc.), architecture, diversity of pieces, library ambience when you find the right spot. TIP: watch the documentary Stolen about the ISG painting theft before going. 
19214 1 I wanted to like this place, but it was just eh. Service was friendly. Flavors did not taste what they were worth. It was empty when we went on a Saturday afternoon, unusual- should have been a sign. 
19215 1 Calamari was over cooked. The pizza for $11 was a disappointment to say the least. 
19216 1 Ordered the $49 entree meal: small portion and overpriced! Few cubes of steak. A few tiny pieces of salmon. A few shrimps, lots of bean sprouts. Service: average. not as entertaining as some other places that I've been too. It was okay. 
19217 3 Starbucks located in Animal Kingdom park in Discovery Island. Great stop for breakfast sandwiches and coffee to start your day. 
19218 4 Connell was super helpful! He found me a deal to suit my needs and answered all my questions. 
19219 4 Attended the Corklandia at the OMSI on 11/10/17. There were many different wine and food vendors. Will definitely attend another After Dark event in the future. 
19220 4 Wonderful salon, great atmosphere and very professional. I am always greeted right away usually by Marcus who is very friendly and helpful. My whole family sees Marlena who knows just what works on everyone from my mother to my teenage girls! I would highly recommend this salon! 
19221 3 The appetizers were delicious! Amazing beer selection! Not the cheapest but worth it. Tater tots = delicious. 
19222 4 Great experience with Service King Decatur. Cordiality and timely feedback and delivery. Exceeded my expectations. 
19223 3 Food is so so, but atmosphere is nice! Went for a trivia night on a Wednesday which was lots of fun 
19224 4 High quality chocolate and delicious desserts. Worth every penny. Thierry I love you. 
19225 3 It seems sometimes that some of the best restaurants are hidden in strip malls. This is one of those places. Nice variety of food, with some interesting choices. The drinks were decent, although a bit pricey. I'd definitely go back to try other options. 
19226 4 As a European, I know what is good Italian and what is bad Italian food. I'll tell you that the food here literally gave me a taste of home and perfection! Most amazing stuff and wine list. Everything was on it highest! 
19227 4 First experience Rosie did an amazing job always listened if I didn't like something never cut me or hurt me in most places people are very rude but they are very nice and care about to here customers will definitely be coming back 
19228 2 At another Smoky Bones, wonderful. This one not so much. Service st the bar was good, ribs a bit tough to eat. But $10 for a Dewars double? It was either watered down or so full of ice that it was practically clear. 
19229 4 All of the desserts are delicious! 
19230 3 I enjoy it. The peach cobbler is delicious! Potato salad is good as well. Brisket is really good. Although, I got the moist once and it was extremely fatty compared to another time when it was less fatty. 
19231 4 If you want to eat where the locals eat, this is it. My favorite place for breakfast tacos. I am so regular, I have a tab! The food is super fresh and Nueva Onda migas taco and a limeade is as good as it gets! see you there... 
19232 3 Finz is definitely pricey for a struggling 20-something, but everything I've had here has been worth it. I recommend the lobster BLT. Or just stop by for a delicious pomegranate martini and a buffalo calamari appetizer and move on to somewhere cheaper for entrees! 
19233 0 I would give it zero stars but that's not an option. The waiting staff is uninformed the manager lied about frozen fish. It is DEFINITELY NOT fresh catch lol. But other than that the water was good lol. 
19234 3 It's getting better. The first time I came, they had just changed from being a coffee shop and I guess the inventory transfer had some issues (bugs in the hot chocolate). But I've been back twice since then and everything has been great! 
19235 2 best at the animal kingdom for causal dining, nothing super remarkable but I like to avoid quick service 
19236 4 Awesome. Delicious. Nice service too. Even if you're a vegetarian, you'll find options. 
19237 4 I have only been here once but I was very pleased. The food was great and our waiter was very professional and prompt. Good food good service - couldn't ask for more. Will go again for sure! 
19238 1 Food is ok. I just wish their "gyro meat" was lamb. There is the choice of steak, beef, or chicken, but traditional gyro is lamb, and lamb tastes much better. The gyro bites are very tasty and my son liked his chilli cheese dog. 
19239 4 Cool dog park. The whole park even beyond the dog portion is pretty sweet, considering it's on such an urban area of south boston. It is right next to the channel center garage. 
19240 4 Writing this on behalf of my 17 year old (ASD) son who loves all things Lego :) wonderful place with knowledgeable and helpful staff when it comes to Lego ~ but most of all, they make him feel comfortable, answer questions, offer fair trade in and assist with sale. 
19241 1 Food amazing, delivery is bad. Maybe one or two times out of tens of times I got my order without something missing, damaged, late, or being cold I keep coming back because the food is really good. I recommend that you go eat in. 
19242 3 Solid tour and free beer! Tour guides are loud and funny. Minus points for making us wake up early on a Saturday - I just wish they continued the tours throughout the afternoon. Plus points - Shuttle to a local bar helps the cause 
19243 3 Great food, nice environment, good check, service is rather slow but the wait staff was wonderful. I definitely recommend the jalapeño queso. 
19244 4 Game Stop in Dedham is the same as Radio Shack in Dedham. Great service, Great selection, Great location! 
19245 3 Pricey but Pisces Rising is good food ! Not real traditional but fun, 
19246 4 Great place! Great food and great atmosphere! Best thing that happened to Malden Center!!!!! Fish tacos were amazing. Drinks are great! 
19247 0 Staff was very rude and messed up my order - which is near impossible to do when I'm giving them step by step instructions on what I want included. 
19248 4 Great patio, food, ambience. Perfect for sunday brunch. Very courteous staff. Didn't have a chance to try any wine, but the grey hounds and spritzers were delicious. Order the salt and pepper calamari as an appetizer. All together great experience. 
19249 3 Have always enjoyed the Stanford's in Seattle, and was not disappointed here. Food was plentiful and up to the usual standards. Sitting at the bar, which we prefer as the service is usually better, we enjoyed the bartenders and their speedy and attentive service. Will be going back for sure. 
19250 3 Get ready to have a fun time and see some wonderful aquatic animals. Also be prepared to get splashed or even soaked, but you'll still enjoy it and in Florida it won't be long before the sun warms you and you won't be wet for long! 
19251 4 Thank you Daphne for helping me with my two cute new dresses! One was vintage and the other was an adorable Betsey Johnson. You and the rest of the staff were so accommodating and I will definitely continue to shop and sell with you guys! 
19252 0 I wish I could give this 0 star's, I left in tears the animals are not cared for and the whole place is depressing and utterly heartbreaking. 
19253 4 Excellent Martinis! Christina the bartender makes an excellent thin mint martini! If you get the chance to have her make your drink do it! Amazing. 
19254 4 Best place EVER!!! Delicious food, excellent service and amazing personell. We were treated like royalty. The flat bread complementary appetazer with the home made sauce was out of this world. Keep on!!! Will go next time again on our next trip to Orlando. 
19255 3 excellent bakery , deli and wine .... a lot like eatzi's but smaller and not so snooty ..... desserts are off the chain ... 
19256 4 This Texas based company is just what Columbus needs! Fresh Tex Mex food made from scratch unlike anything else. The restaurant has a unique decor and a fun and hard working staff. Make sure you try the Creamy Jalepeno and the boom boom sauce. Happy hour has free nachos too! 
19257 2 Came back and had a better experience. Both the service and the food were much improved. The burger was well cooked and flavorful, the service quick and cheerful. Will definitely try this place again. 
19258 4 Love this place! It is super cute. The service is always excellent. The food is always impressive. 
19259 1 Indifferent staff, bitter and pricey latte. The food in the display case looked uninspired and kind of desiccated. The industrial decor leans too far in that direction - this is one cold place. Would hate to go there in the winter! I will not be back. 
19260 4 Don't let the fact that this get is hiding in a non descriptive strip mall fool you. The service is great, the environment upscale and the food is wonderful. 
19261 2 Greasy and somewhat satisfying in the moment but I don't think I'll be back. I was super sorry that this place is not going to be my local Vietnamese fix. The search continues... 
19262 3 Bipartisan Cafe is a a great neighborhood coffee place for the growing Montavilla pocket. Capitalizing on their niche interests of politics and pie, you can expect to find neighbors discussing recent politics and good, big, slices. Plenty of couches and comfortable places to sit. And pie, of course! 
19263 4 Delicious food, perfect layout, even has billiard table and stage for live bands. Tons of easily viewable screens makes it an excellent place for sports viewing as well! Great addition to the area! 
19264 3 I had a margarita and it was delicious! The stuffed mushrooms were awesome too, but most of all the service was spot on Our bartender , Carolanne ( I think) was very accommodating. We will definitely be coming back. 
19265 3 Food is good, but service and ambiance is not great. Well it's busy location, lots of Asian people, means good, pretty authentic food then. 
19266 4 Love the wine tasting concept and the food is phenomenal. Only thing we miss is the cheese tray with wine pairing. BRING IT BACK!!! 
19267 4 Very tasty ice cream, the chamomile &a strawberry flavor was delicious. The guy behind working the guy was very helpful in helping us, just a couple of friendly tourists, find out some cool stuff to do in the area. 
19268 3 Lots of cute accessories for the pre-tween girl. Only buy when there is a sale - other wise everything is ridiculously overpriced. I've always had decent luck with the sales staff. Friendly and helpful. 
19269 4 Best, largest, cheapest tacos ever. That's all I need to say. 
19270 4 Definitely the most helpful and fair prices around. The service they provide is unrivaled. They are extremely knowledgeable and will help from start to finish with no rush. 
19271 1 I got the lamb gyros with fries... Flat bread was cold/stale. Lamb was like processed bologna, yuk. Fries were undercooked and just not good. I ate less than half before throwing it out. I should have went to The "G" Spot. 
19272 4 Great service, the driver was very helpful and courteous. He picked me and my kids in less the 30 minutes and had us at our destination in a timely manner. I give it 5 stars. 
19273 3 This place is small and expect to wait and sharing of tables, well worth it. Since it's a small restaurant, it does get smoky and you will leave smelling a bit greasy. 
19274 3 Probably the best Korean restaurant around town. Definitely get their tofu stew like kimchi jigae, and their pajun pancake. It was pretty good! The only downside to this place is that they don't do Korean BBQ. 
19275 4 Favorite place in Boston. Love the patio! Best potato salad - and I'm saying that, coming from Germany! 
19276 1 I have a thing for greek salad with grilled chicken - they do a decent job with it. BUT their pizza SUCKS! Sorry but it does. The sauce is I can't even explain it - I think there sauce is similar to perhaps eating a can of tomato paste. 
19277 4 Fish stew was great! Liked the shrimp app and the meatball app. Good experience. Service was good Went there before a Bruins game. 
19278 3 I love any place that offers brunch cocktails that go beyond mimosas and bloody mary's. I love good benedicts, and a place that would offer a bacon benedict. I love solid sides like potatoes o'brien- super crispy and delicious. I love Genie's. 
19279 4 Excellent bbq beef sandwich (Banh Mi)!! Melts in your mouth and insanely cheap at $4! 
19280 4 Tried this place based in Yelp reviews. Was not disappointed. Great atmosphere with delicious pizza!! 
19281 4 Do you wanna enjoy a great coffee in a european style cafe, so you are on a right spot. This is a great and lovely place to be and you will enjoy your experience with no doubt 
19282 4 Amazing pizza and the staff is very friendly! The live the variety of Specialty pizzas that they off. I wish the place were bigger to dine in but other than that the food was great. 
19283 4 It doesn't have the character the original has, but they try with the exposed brick and the center donut tree. But more seating than the original PDX outpost is much appreciated. Still have the familiar varieties. My go-this are the bacon maple and the ODB 
19284 4 Had the calzone and it was very good. Maybe the best in Austin. Just moved to the Circle C area and have been to Mangieris maybe 5 times. Everytime I've been there with my wife the waitstaff is super friendly and helpful. 
19285 2 Not a large space and crowded very noisy. Burgers delicious but not big as classic americans 
19286 0 They charged my card twice about two months ago and each time I contacted them they said they'd have a manager call me and I still have yet to talk to a manager... Pizza is OK but it is not worth $40 per pizza. 
19287 1 The Rescue Bagels I tried were very mushy. They sort of had the chewy center but lacked the crusty exterior to be a true New York style boiled bagel. They had the consistency of a steamed bagel which some people like but not me. 
19288 0 Don't try to trick me into believing that sirloin is ribeye. Charlatans. 
19289 4 I have never had grilled cheese sandwiches like they have prepared. The Mexican cola is a real winner I will be going back there I live in summer port anyway 
19290 0 Lame lame lame. Who converts their restaurant to "reservation only" without notice or posting the information. Waste of time 
19291 3 My only beef with Dressew is they don't accept Visa, forcing me to either bring enough cash when I come.. which I never know how much to take, or use my Interac card which I also never use anywhere else but here. 
19292 3 I really enjoyed the food here. I was looking for just a really great burger and wings and Sidebar had it. I really liked the location too! 
19293 4 Wow hands down the best chips and guac I have ever had. The tortas are also amazing. And the decorations are beautiful! My favorite place in Portland right now! 
19294 4 This tour was super great!! Rita was amazing! Energetic & full of information about the history & funny stories! I would definitely recommend a tour! Worth it!! 
19295 4 Our server (Jeff) was the best I may have ever experienced. He knew his food, clearly loved his job, and knows how to pass patron's desires to the kitchen so that they get exactly what they want and in the way wanted. Food was outstanding as well! 
19296 4 The owners here are very nice and friendly. Located in the Mall, they are out of the tourist area and more where locals frequent. I would give them a look if you into comics and Superheros. 
19297 3 Hooray for Herrera! Finally a decent burrito joint downtown. The carnitas burrito was great and I can't wait to return so I can get my hands on the spicy chicken... The chips and salsa I ordered on the side were not great, however. Just stick to the burritos. 
19298 2 Decent. Nothing super extraordinary but decent for a burrito fix. Watch out for mundo fillings squirting out. Napkins are a must. 
19299 0 This place is extremely slow. They are often quite understaffed. Prepare for about 20 minutes from the time you walk in the door to the time you get your food. 
19300 3 DBU built us a nice deck in back and a front porch for a really good price. Good craftsmanship on both. Once started, they completed the job as planned, cleaned up the work site with no hassles. We'd recommend and will probably do business with DBU again in the future. 
19301 4 Our first tour and it was fun. Lots of good food and information, went on the market tour with Tracy. She had good energy and would recommend taking this tour if you don't know anything about the market. Will be doing more food tours in the future 
19302 3 Great place for lunch or dinner - keto friendly and ultimate place to pick and choose what goes into your stir fry - you pick all the ingredients and sauce selection then hand it to the folks to stir fry and deliver to your table 
19303 3 New espresso machine. One of the best lattes in town, easy. 
19304 3 Good food and cheap! Get the chicken shawarma (didn't care for the beef), falafel, chicken kabob, hummus and french fries w/the garlic sauce. It's very much a take out place, but there's seating and the restaurant is clean and spacious. 
19305 4 Not sure why this place is always dead! Their quality of food has improved so much since they opened! The bar is really awesomely set up! The buffalo tenders and margherita pizza are what I get every time I go! So good! The bartenders are all very nice and attentive! 
19306 4 Found this place through social media. I ordered their Dragon Bowl, it was really good and refreshing. Staff was really friendly and welcoming. 
19307 4 I called because I couldn't find parking and the person on the phone was SO kind and wonderful! She took my order over the phone and brought the food out to me! The food was delicious! Will definitely go back!! 
19308 0 If people think that this is good grilled cheese then they must have never made their own at home. Highly over rated. 
19309 4 Yes, go. Get the guacamole. Have a margarita. Don't try to rationalize why the menu is Asian and Mexican at the same time. Just eat and enjoy. 
19310 4 Waffles with nutella and caramel. Do I really need to say more? Great staff, great idea, cool little spot. Probably my spot for a quick snack in Boston from now on. Oh yeah, the waffles are AWESOME! 
19311 4 best tacos in austin, huge portions, always in and out real quick 
19312 4 One of the best hotels I've stayed in. Full fitness center, mini lap pool, Silver T stop across the street is direct from Logan I'll try the waterferry on my way out. 5 hands down. 
19313 3 A few trips and always seem out if my favorite IPA. Great atmosphere and always good service. Very good sandwiches. 
19314 3 Been to Curra's many times - delicious, fresh food, amazing margaritas, almost always great service! I have had some abrupt servers before - but the homemade tamales more than made up for it. Be sure to try the avocado marg. =) 
19315 0 today was my first and last time here. the service and food were awful. if I were not with my mother it would have gotten ugly that's how rude the servers were 
19316 4 The service was great and the food was delicious! We went with three adults and four kids and everyone liked their food both the entrees and the desserts. Would definitely come again!! 
19317 4 Great service. I fast delicious food. Enjoyed the dinner here. Will come back when I visit Disney again. 
19318 4 Rest In Peace. This place was an experience. A special chapter in Portland's culinary scene. Im sure the great people who made it all possible will be back at it with something new and inspiring. 
19319 2 My facial was great but yeah....this was very expensive for nothing special. A RIP off. Do NOT go here. Better places out there. 
19320 4 Justin is an exceptional agent. He made our first time selling/buying experience so easy, It felt like we were house shopping with a friend. He was (and STILL is) always available to answer any question. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone buying or selling a house! 
19321 2 Nice choices for red wine but food is no big deal. Not a lot of flavour and service very very slow. 
19322 3 Great park in our neighborhood or as my daugher calls it. The big park. Lots to do tennis, basketball, wallball, splash park, kiddy park jungle gym and lakes. Pretty sweet. 
19323 3 The pizza is delicious!!!! The white pizza is my favorite. The slices are huge. An individual will likely satisfy his or her hunger with 2 slices or less. The staff was very friendly. They have great customer service. I definitely plan to return. 
19324 4 Love this place....everything we have eaten here is fabulous! It is always packed on the weekends so prepare for a long wait. If you can squeeze into the bar the Bloody Mary's are delish!! 
19325 4 It was a little off the beaten path from where we were staying, but the hour of beer education, sampling and humorous tour guide was worth the train ride. Free beer, free souvenir glass, and invitation to party afterwards. 
19326 4 What can I say? I got what I want from very kind staff and didn't wait too long. When it comes to Dunkin' and places like that....that is exactly what I want. 
19327 4 Brunch-fantastic! The bloody Mary's and coffee were great. I got the goat cheese bacon omelette. The bacon was perfectly cooked, crispy. The potato cakes were delish! 
19328 4 Best espresso! And the staff is super friendly and fun. Thank you for the great experience! 
19329 0 Aglio Olio was overcooked and had waay to much olive oil, it tasted bland, soggy and disgusting. The ravioli gingante is also tasteless. Not recommended at all, its a waste of our money. I wish they could improve the food, but the service was great though. 
19330 3 No Miller or Budweiser here, thankfully. Just good craft beers, ciders, and mead with intimidating Viking names. 
19331 4 The corn fritters are free and hard to resist. Leave room for the unforgettable rock shrimp, And the unforgettable key lime pie. 
19332 2 Standard chain restaurant offerings. Nothing to write home about but works in a pinch. 
19333 4 I absolutely loved the food. We had the oyster omelet and steak. There's something about that oyster omelet that's very different and makes me want more. Steak was okay. I would come back for the oyster omelet. 
19334 4 I really enjoyed my experience here. The staff was friendly, the doctor was very knowledgable and they were able to see me within a week of calling for an appointment (which is somewhat unheard of in South Austin). I will certainly be coming back and referring everyone! 
19335 4 The Big Kahuna is an authentic, refreshing bite of Hawaiian cuisine. Favorite dish would definitely be the Ahi Poke. Fresh and delicious. Two can dine with drinks for around $25. 
19336 3 I got the $10 tofu and veggies and was impressed for the price. The miso soup was average, but the flavor on the tofu + veggies was well above average. Light flavor but well balanced; uncommonly just right. It felt healthy and tasted good. Recommended! 
19337 4 Absolutely love Atlanta Cupcake Factory. It is one of the few cupcake bakeries around where the cupcakes don't taste like someone simply dumped a bag of sugar into them. Every flavor is very savory and delicious. The decorations are simple, but pretty. The only downside is the tiny parking lot. 
19338 4 Just found out about this place! I think this place is much better than Dave's Fresh Pasta. I only got the ravioli - regular cheese and veggie. Both were delicious. This will be my new place. 
19339 4 i bought some lenses and frames from hallmark a few years ago, and they were friendly, efficient, and professional. periodically i have to have a new screw inserted, or new nose pads attached, and they have always been great. 
19340 2 I've been twice, good food, decent price-Not one of my favorites but will go back. Staff is nice, breakfast wait time has been shorter than other popular breakfast spots. Also has a nice patio for summer 
19341 3 Good service. Get the chorishi's fire. Not the best sushi in town- but better that Musashino- not better than Uchi. Great music(if you are into Thievery Corporation and Saint Germain) and atmosphere. Comfy booths. It is what it is. The bento box at lunch is a deal. 
19342 3 I am here a lot for events for the Atlanta Apartment Association. Great space and is perfectly located near the Cumberland Mall. Parking in the garage is convenient and the place is clean and very well kept. 
19343 4 I love this place! I've been getting my hair cut by Ashley for the last 3 years and she is really great. Good convo, good cut, and good beer. Can't beat that! 
19344 4 I made an online order from them. Flowers came from this branch not as expected. I contacted customer service and they immediately sent me a replacement arrangement. Service was so quick and easy I'm leaving them a full 5 stars! 
19345 1 It feels pretty unacceptable to me to wait 40 minutes for a taco with no communication from staff. Really disappointed because flavor wise, my food was on point--I just can't justify the lack of information/a workable system--it's a food truck! Time is money, right? 
19346 0 Rude lady at the front desk. They may take walk ins but they are not "welcome." Acted like I was inconveniencing them. This is the closest place to me but I'll take my business a mile down the road. 
19347 4 A little late on posting this review, but it was our saving grace on New Years Day when we needed brunch food on a Monday afternoon! David was hilarious and helped me decide between a couple different options. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu! 
19348 0 Takes forever to get your delivery, and very bad attitude when you try to ask about your order. makes it super uncomfortable! 
19349 3 Had a breakfast plate with sunny side egg, biscuit and bacon. Everything was delicious and decently priced. Biscuit tasted homemade. A warm, down home, Country feel to the place. Service was a little slow but overall it's a good find for this area. 
19350 1 This place is close to my apt, so I want to like it. Tried it a few times now, and I've never finished what I bought. Both runny and gritty somehow - not delicious. 
19351 0 Not the best doggy playground. Lots of vagrants hanging around, making it not as desirable of a place to bring your pup 
19352 3 I stopped by for lunch n couldn't be more satisfied with the seafood massaman rice plate came along w lots of vegie. The portion is perfect for me. Friendly service as usual. 
19353 4 These guys are the best! If you need a period costume or just something for fun, this is the place! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They are priced fairly and are prompt and helpful. Their place is organized and there are plenty of choices for each theme. 
19354 4 I'm updating to make clear that I used the Heat Busters in Dallas, TX. I lived there at the time. 
19355 1 Overpriced and too much frufru... Very noisy and not a good selection for lunch. Too expensive and over spiced. Tried four tomes nut still disappointed. Seasons 52 much better!! 
19356 3 Hooray for the local. It is one of my favorite spots to plot and plan before going out into the brooding nightclub world. The food is not too bad and the beer is cold. Sold. 
19357 4 Amazing place to stop in for a quick cafe au lait. Pure deliciousness, not too heavy and I got every ounce of foam they made for me! 
19358 4 This place is pretty good. It's clean, next to the airport and has free wifi. They serve free continental breakfast and has wifi. If you need a place to stay, come here. 
19359 4 Fast but not fast food. One of my favorites, great to have salad and roasted potatoes with my tacos. LOVE the salsa bar. 
19360 1 Got a Groupon with my mother for massage, facial, and manicure. Manicurist called out due to child care issues, massage therapist was late, and facial was so so. We won't be going back! 
19361 3 Basic breakfast. Nothing fancy...wonderful waitstaff. Perfect place to just go eat! Loved it. Pork chops, grits, biscuits, scrambled eggs. Yummo. 
19362 4 This is my secret spot for.......? Customer service is sweet and genuine. There's always great markdowns and sales. 
19363 4 The owners were so kind and friendly. The Ahi Poke reminded me of being back in Hawaii. One of the best meals I've had in ages! The $12 price is well worth it in quantity and quality. I'm going back with my boyfriend next week...I CANT WAIT!!!!!!! 
19364 3 The food was good, the employees are friendly, service was fast. Nice place for a quick burger or hot dog. 
19365 4 Walked in and they literally had 3 donuts to sell, 2 flavors. I opted for the Passion Fruit Cocoa Nib since I love chocolate with cayenne and it was delicious! After eating the donut, licked the paper wrapper clean and didn't care who saw me. 
19366 4 This is a nice panda express i've ever been. The lady named Linette is really nice and really cares about the customers. I hope they hire more people like her. 
19367 3 The food was delicious and service was great. But the whole experience was ruined by the droves of noisy middle schoolers yelling, leaving their trash and not buying anything. Their rude behavior was shocking and not a good look for the town. 
19368 4 I took my girlfriend and this place was delicious. The portions are massive and the price is low for Japanese food. I will definitely go again! 
19369 4 This is my favorite lunch spot around. Nice selection of lunch specials (though some wing or boneless wing lunch combos would be awesome). Friendly service, the food is always on par, and there is rarely any kind of wait. 
19370 3 Stumbled upon it and had a great dinner lobster Mac was amazing and so were the sirloin tips. Our service was great too 
19371 4 Amazing food and prices. Everything was good and great customer service. Will definitely come back when I visit Orlando again. 
19372 0 One of the rudest restaurants I've ever been to! The waitress don't give a damn about the customers and they have the nerve to say tip isn't enough when the service was horrible! 
19373 4 I had a great experience at Judy Jetson. My stylist, Derrick, gave me exactly what I was looking for. I was getting an undercut for the first time and he game me styling tips and a cool, edgy new cut. I'll be going back here. 
19374 4 I was fancying a burger and Yelp lead me to Five Guys for the first time. I found the store spotless and the service excellent and surprise the burger was great! 
19375 4 Place has plenty of food and dessert even for the pockets eater. Place is great when no one could decide what to eat ... 
19376 2 A little disappointed. The lunch specials may be decent value, but the dinner menu was very overpriced. $14 for just a Cuban sandwich (Cubano Mixto) with no sides or drink or anything else included. The atmosphere was nice, with a good location at the battery. 
19377 0 The upstairs coffee bar is closed and they decided it would be a good idea to be understaffed and train a whole new staff today so I've been waiting a half hour for coffee. 
19378 4 When your wife calls you at work, after receiving an arrangement, and you hear the emotions of joy and happiness overwhelming her all is good. Thank you for an amazing first experience Beaverton Florists, I'll definitely be back! 
19379 4 Great brunch, the French toast will blow your tastebuds! You won't leave here disappointed. The coffee wasn't too good, but everything else is on point. 
19380 4 Great store! Very well stocked and organized, the ladies that work there are very helpful, and talented too! I highly recommend this store...if you are a beader or want to learn to bead, go here. 
19381 2 Went here for the first time today. Nice and clean .. I got a deluxe pedicure which was suppose to be 35 to 40 minutes. It was done in about 25. It wasn't that busy but clearly volume is important. Still looking .. 
19382 4 Great place for the price! Great for large groups and great for one-on-one sushi too. Cheap place but not cheap atmosphere or food. A+ highly recommend! 
19383 1 My husband and I are here for dinner. Food is very good, expensive, but good quality. My issues is that the GM allows men serving to have beards. Not just short beards but extremely long beards. I do not want to eat in a place that allows this. Disgusting!! 
19384 3 Good meat and produce department. Furniture is high quality at a good price. Sheets are not worth the money here 
19385 4 One of the best things about living here -TWIST! Great flavors and welcoming staff! I came here once and now it is one of my favorites! A fun lounge feel. And great owner!! 
19386 4 The Tom yum soup and basil fried rice are to die for!! Been coming here for more than 5 years now. 
19387 4 The beer selection may be the best in the Boston area with a very friendly and knowledgeable staff that's will help you sort through the hundreds of choices based on your mood and/or tastes. 
19388 4 I was so excited they added a Papa Murphy's down here! I grew up on this pizza. It's delicious and not greasy like the other pizza chains! 
19389 4 Loved this store! Excellent prices, wide selection, friendly and helpful staff (Thanks Marissa). I bought 3 identical dresses in different colors because the fit was great and the price was right. I highly recommend stopping in to try on everything. 
19390 4 Amazing hazelnut latte Hazelnut made in house , great cozy place Great location Excellent coffee 
19391 1 Everything was a little dusty and prices seemed quite high for the quality of the merchandise. Unless this is the kind of place where you have to start at $100 and haggle to some more reasonable ground I'll be shopping at Jordan's. 
19392 2 Good but a touch overrated in my opinion. The old-fashioned is pretty solid, though. 
19393 3 Big Buckeye Fans here! They have a few flat screens with ESPN on as well as the game of the week! Great service and very friendly family owned an operated establishment. Oh yes...they give great cuts as well. Very pleased with everything that Silver Lane represents! 
19394 4 Definitely not fine dining, but great food for the price. Great salsa and standard Mexican fare. We go here every couple of weeks at least. 
19395 3 Pretty solid food truck. I tried the Chicken Torta. I definitely want to go back and try the Carne Asada. The dude working was very pleasant and made my order very quickly. I would definitely recommend this place. 
19396 0 Very disappointing! I too trusted you guys. nr 2 dinner-- 1/2 way over salted and no chicken in the chicken dish, other half way under salted! Hot and sour soup served cold with raw onions. Mostly inedible. 
19397 3 Very good. Got there before the crowds. Fun spot. Good Bloody Mary. Tasty omelettes. And great selections overall. Great blend of flavors and textures. 
19398 3 要去健身房的路上，都會經過這家看起來小小的，但是裡面總是很熱鬧的可愛餐廳，害我都還沒運動肚子就餓了起來...。每天都看到那麼多人在裡面開心的用餐，自己默默就把這裡加入到想吃的餐廳口袋名單。 直到有一天，和朋友在討論晚餐要吃什麼的時候，我提議了這家餐廳：） 開車前往的話，可以停在餐廳後面巷子裡的運動中心停車場(聽說是免費，我們就是停這哈哈)。 很快的，服務生就將我們帶到位上。光是看到菜單就流口水了...想到泰式料理，我就直選了green curry。另外兩位朋友則點了fried rice和stir fry pork belly，開胃菜選了papaya salad和chicken satay。 先來說說開胃菜好了，其實沒什麼好挑惕的(可能我特別不挑吃哈哈)，硬要說的話...papaya salad個人覺得可以再辣一點點；chicken satay不用說了，我覺得很棒！它的醬很特別，很想把整塊雞肉都覆滿醬汁再送入口中。 主餐的部分呢，奇怪的點是，飯竟然要另外加錢，不然你只能得到一個綠咖哩，一碗雞肉在綠色醬汁裡的綠咖哩，別說你只吃雞肉(和喝湯？)，你怎麼看都覺得這要配飯吃才行，不能理解這怎麼單吃，我的意思是，它們不是應該要是一個seat嗎？要附贈飯才對。就像你點了滷肉飯，卻只來一碗魯肉，然後沒有附飯，要加錢才有喔！吃火鍋沒有飯可以理解，他的湯是可以直接喝的，而且喝得到鍋物裡食材的香味，不像咖哩醬那樣濃郁，需要搭配其他像是飯、麵、冬粉，就算麵包也可以吧....但沒有。 再來，朋友說fried rice就只是一般炒飯，我嚐了一口...嗯...沒什麼特別的，但不難吃。stir fry pork belly以為它會是打拋豬肉那種，碎豬肉啊、九層塔啊、小番茄啊、辣椒等等那樣的感覺，結果其實很像台灣的燒肉口感和視覺，不難吃，只是跟想像的不一樣，然後有點太鹹了...要一直配水喝(還好水不用錢) 不論餐點及用餐氣氛，還有親切的服務生，整體來說，是不錯的！ 
19399 0 Everytime I order it takes about an hr and I order the same thing weekly subs are always soggy enough said will Not order again! 
19400 4 Best lunch deals in town. Amazing tacos and Kim chi fries. The food is very fresh and there are many vegetarian options. Customer service is top notch. Support this local business! 
19401 4 Food was amazing, "the melt" was my all time fav there!! Along with the boozy milkshakes! Can't wait to come back 
19402 4 I'm an out of towner and here for work. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. Keep it up guys! 
19403 0 I would give them a zero if I could. I can't believe that I had to wait over thirty minutes to get my meal. They have a process and couldn't follow it. After thirty minutes the manager finally thought about helping. 
19404 4 The service is great here. Me and my girl friend come here regularly and we usually order the hot stone bowls!!"they are exceptional". They always bring out lots of appetizers and little snacks for free. The hot tea is really good. 
19405 4 I'm a frequent visitor here. Great coffee and goodies. Nice staff also many of them have been there for years. Wifi available and a good place to sit and check your email or chat with a friend. 
19406 4 Only went once and got the lobster enchiladas which were absolutely delectable. Pelons should give me a free dinner or something for constantly recommending it. 
19407 4 Best take-out Asian in Somerville or Cambridge. Dine-in isn't fancy, but the staff is chill and they're great with kids. We've been coming here for years, and it was our best-kept secret. Looks like the secret is out! Good for these guys; they deserve it. 
19408 3 This is a great neighborhood liquor store. The staff is always friendly (they'll tell you where to buy limes when they're out for example) and the store often has wine tastings. Good selection of wines. Great hours - open 7 days a week. 
19409 4 If you're looking for *just a trainer*, look elsewhere. Glenn is a master at digging into your psychological hurdles, driving you toward your goals, and moving you beyond those goals to achieve sustained, life-changing fitness. Big muscles. Even bigger heart. Get ready to become your best self. 
19410 3 It is a very lovely restaurant with great quality food, good service and nice atmosphere. One of my fav Italian food places. Although it changes the menu quite often, we always order Milk and honey as dessert. Just had my birthday dinner here last night. 
19411 0 Too congested Too many kids Too slow delivering your food Too much of everything that makes for a POOR DINING EXPERIENCE!! 
19412 1 The burger was good, but not worth the half an hour of standing (literally) in line. If I have to wait for food, I'd rather do so sitting. 
19413 4 Love the atmosphere. Fun, clean, and safe. Dan is amazing. I've gotten several tattoos from him and am currently getting a band on my arm. Great for first timers to feel comfortable, and get a great tattoo. 
19414 0 This is the worst pizza I have ever had in my life. I was depressed when I left the restaurant because it was so bad 
19415 4 Place is small but not congested like most Italian places. Food is almost as good as north end Italian restaurants. So happy to find a good Italian place without god g all the way to north end. There is nothing much to say, everything was good. 
19416 4 l love all the food,the dinner special price I don't theres no savings either 8.99or2for17.99 where's the saving:( 
19417 1 Waiting 30 minutes for 2 sandwiches when the place is for the most point empty seems pretty ridiculous to me. Next time I will just try somewhere else. The wait time for 2 "Italian"sandwiches is not worth it. 
19418 4 Gordon's provided the liquor and wine at my wedding and they were wonderful! We couldn't be happier with the service! Making changes to our liquor list and the billing was very easy! We highly recommend them! 
19419 4 Cool new place. The staff is great and the vibe is fun, foods good with a pretty good option as well as drinks !! 
19420 3 Very flavorful food. Woman who helped us was very accommodating with special requests (I think she is the manager). Steak was nicely cooked. Chicken as well. The barbecue sauce was nice. The diablo queso is definitely spicy. A good fast causal option in the area. 
19421 4 Prompt and easy! Gentleman who came to install new windshield was fast and Very friendly and professional. A+ 
19422 2 Great organic Thai food. Everything taste very fresh and they have a great wine list! The service however can use improvement! The servers are not friendly at all! I come here mainly because I live in the community and their food is good. 
19423 4 This place is fabulous! The crab bisque!!!! & the bartender Rodney was amazing!!!! If you hit this place look for him ! 1 of the best bartenders I've met! 
19424 3 For the price you cannot beat the taste and the quality. I go here a few times a month since its so close to home and never been disappointed. 
19425 3 I've been there at least 10 times. The eggplant parmesan is splendid. Generous portions. Pretty good salads, too. I think for the price it's a great lunch or lite dinner place. Their honey mustard dressing is the best I've had. 
19426 4 Glad I was here. The Biryani here was by far the best Biryani i ever had in USA. I am sure other dishes are also super good by reading the reviews. 
19427 3 Had both the nachos and rice and bean bowl, which was too much for one person. Place could be less dark. What I ordered was good. They needed another serviceperson. I'd go back. 
19428 4 I could spend hours wandering around this store and still never want to leave! They have a unique selection of gifts, books, perfumes, stationary and clothing. I want everything there. Plus the snaggletoothed kitty wandering the counter is just too cute :) 
19429 4 Good variety. All the drinks I've tried thus far have been tasty. Prices are decent considering everyone else is raising their costs. Wish they accepted credit cards, though! 
19430 4 This was the most awesome restaurant. The pork was amazing along with the yuca and black beans. The staff was extremely friendly as well as the manager and chef. Will definitely be back when I return to Florida. 
19431 4 This is a Venezuelan/Colombian restaurant and it's fabulous! The food is perfectly inspired and taste fresh and looks beautiful! You need to do yourself a favor and eat here if your in the area! 
19432 4 Robert came out to my house to reroute a gutter after I got a new concrete patio poured. He was quick and the job looks great! No attempt to sell extra services, just a quick estimate and the following week, the job was complete! Looks great!! 
19433 3 Free WiFi in the cafe (I'm writing this from the store) - this is great considering most other places in the area charge $5-10 for WiFi. I haven't done any grocery shopping yet, but it seems to have pretty good selection. 
19434 4 Definitely my favorite place for poke bowl/ burrito so far! The salmon is always fresh with the mayo. Since I'm not a fan of green onions and sprouts, substituted with kale instead. I was there on a Thursday afternoon around 2, avoided the crowd and fully enjoyed my burrito. 
19435 4 I love how enthusiastic the servers are. This is my usual spot for a post midnight snack if I'm still on the road. Love the ambience and the people 
19436 2 Machines were nice, but it was like a zoo in there with all of the kids running around. Try to avoid it on Sundays. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if the parents would supervise their children. 
19437 2 I got the chicken sandwich and I felt it was decent but nothing special. The spiciness of the chicken stood out over the actual flavor which I felt was quite bland. Also, this place doesn't serve fountain soda or diet soda. 
19438 3 I have been here twice and both times the service and food were really good. It's a little pricey but still worth it. It's not the best I have had but still better than most places I have visited ouside of lousiana. I definitely recommend giving it a try. 
19439 4 Chris Reilly was FANTASTIC. Really helpful, warm and efficient. Also, hilarious! It's my third tattoo and he really helped me tie them all together. Ask for Chris! 
19440 4 So good. The food is amazing. My kids love to feed the fish after dinner. Great family restaurant 
19441 3 Always good. My potatoes were undercooked and I was offered another side. Very courteous staff. 
19442 4 Good food cheap, nothing more to say. I've lived in Chinatown pretty much my whole life and this place is better than a good number of restaurants in it. 
19443 2 Stopped in for a slice, first time here. Slice was small for the price and pretty greasy. Crust was good. Cheese was okay and the flavor was decent. Place was really loud - there is really no need for a TV on full volume plus music. 
19444 2 This is the perfet dose of art for me. It is medium size, housed in a classic old stone building which features a beautiful atrium. The perspective from when you are standing on the top floor looking down is very picturesque and somehow romantically Italian. 
19445 4 Come to THE Ohio State University and you will get a fabulous education, and an even better social life. Ahhhh Ohio State. How I miss thee. 
19446 3 Very chill place to have a drink, play board games and eat. Great service and live music. I loved the Mac and Cheese and the Caramel and Bacon Fries. 
19447 2 Decent place for your typical American food. Good in a pinch and for the value. Parking is in a deck so be ready to walk to get there. 
19448 4 If you don't have a vacuum cleaner that needs repair get one just to have the opportunity to do business here. This shop is so attractive and sells top of the line appliances. The owner is knowledgeable, professional and charming. The only place I would do business. 
19449 4 Best BBQ around. I especially liked the brisket, mac & cheese. The weekend brunch is exceptional. I encourage everyone to visit this restaurant. 
19450 4 Honestly I'm so glad to have a Starbucks and Thinking Cup alternative that is welcoming, great quality, quick, and all around a good experience. The layout is smart and open. New homework/coffee spot for sure 
19451 3 Quick service, beautiful restaurant, delicious food served with smiles. If I lived here I'd be a regular. Thank you for the warm wonderful food and experience! The meal and dishes were so beautiful it almost felt ceremonial. 
19452 4 An absolutely unbelievable spot. Everything I've tried here has been remarkably fresh, cooked to perfection, and delicious. I've tried the Blacked Tilapia (A), Cajun Tilapia (A-), Home Roasted Turkey (A+), and Jerk Chicken (A-) and all have been amazing. It helps that the manager is the nicest dude ever too. 
19453 4 What an outstanding place this is! I was blown away by the attention to detail. One of the best car washes I have ever been to. I would definitely recommend this car wash to anyone living in the Austin area.. Absolutely outstanding... 
19454 4 On time, quick, efficient and friendly! Angel does a great job - we would recommend him to anyone. 
19455 4 This fried chicken tasted just like my grandmother's did when I was little - totally awesome! The mac & cheese was very good and extra creamy. Cocktails were very good and beer cold. Great addition to the Battery at the new stadium. 
19456 3 This is fairly in-expensive sushi, especially for the Pearl District. It is a sushi boat bar, so you don't always know what you are eating, but the servers are more than happy to help out. Not a bad place to go for a quick bite to eat. 
19457 3 Great local. 4 rotating craft beers, friendly staff, nice vibe. I like it. 
19458 3 The vegan dumplings are full of fresh ingredients and lots of flavor - often a rarity in vegetarian cuisine. The shrimp and cilantro with aoli are amazing. I sacrificed one star because it's a little pricey, but we'll be back regardless of price. Tasty dumplings are worth it. 
19459 4 Wow..what a nice find. It's home cooking, and a step back in time cafeteria style eating. Fried chicken, catfish, fried green tomatoes, turnip greens, cornbread and more. The cherry pie was soooo good..like my Grandma use to make...Highly recommended this place...Open Monday thru Sunday 5am-10pm 
19460 3 Decent food, but the waitstaff is what makes this location so special. Sarah in particular was outstanding! Thanks for making my dining experience a pleasurable one! 
19461 4 Always reliable during game time (i.e. mothers day, birthdays, other holidays). I've never set foot in the establishment, and still order, yearly, like clockwork. Thanks Donna 
19462 4 best chopped salad I've had in a very long time - loaded with super fresh ingredients and all the best things. adorable venue and great staff. 
19463 0 Worst customer service ever. Very snobbish staff. Made reservation, Tables are empty but they don't have enough servers, are you kidding me? On a beautiful sat afternoon, how can you not be ready ?! What a big lie! 
19464 4 Absolutely amazing food and service. Whether you are dining in or getting take out the food here is the best Thai cuisine in Austin. The friendly service has me a loyal customer for life! 
19465 2 I think this place is cute. A little bit on the steep side. I had a breakfast special that was like 10 something, but that included coffee. This place is tiny and if you're claustrophobic i would not recommend this place 
19466 4 Great food. Best Indian food I've had in Boston/Cambridge thus far. Only ordered delivery so far but quantity is substantial and they made it spicy as requested. Bhindi, Paneer, mixed veg and daal are all really good! Great place, would definitely get food delivered from here again. 
19467 3 Wow, good things come in small sizes! It's a mystery how this little trailer truck can pump out better burgers than establishments triple the size? Very tasty burgers, fairly quick. Perfect for late nights, after an all night bender. The fries are crispy and delish too! 
19468 4 They keep me looking sharp! Wonderful efficient service. The do a great job on clothing and house hold items. They treat me like family! I would recommend to anyone! 
19469 3 Everything seems to truly be a dollar! Huge store with plenty of 'stuff'! It's fun just to go here and go up and down the isles to see what I can't live without! Employees were friendly and checkout went fast. 
19470 4 My 4- legged daughter Mia has been coming for daycare ever since TDS opened in Brookline and she goes in with her tail wagging! Safe place for the love of your life and Bryn is extremely responsive! Need I say more? Meera 
19471 0 Ordered Greek salad yesterday. It was awful! Dedham House of Pizza does not practicing proper hygiene and food safety techniques. Green lettuce turned to brown. Rotten tomatoes, looked like a week old. Had to return salad. Will never stop at this place ever. View my posted pictures. 
19472 4 This place is very nice, food was tasty, low key friendly service. Got the mixed fruit and veggie salad and a beef dish, very flavorful, ginger and onion notes. Just what we were looking for! 
19473 4 I love this place. Delicious food, with big portions. The service is super good and the waitress and service is amazing. Make sure you have their complimentary ice cream it is unreal. Best place to eat! 
19474 2 We were hungry....they had food. Not much more than that too offer. They were crazy busy, because they were the fastest place around that was open. It was this or eat at a research hospital cafeteria - that seemed too dicey....service - typical New England. 
19475 3 Great taste and good prices however skimpy on the portions. Best recommendation, orange chicken with chow mein and soy sauce 
19476 4 One of our family favorites! We love Blue Ginger! Especially during lunch and the Monday / Tuesday evening specials! 
19477 0 The beignets were hollow with piping hot grease in the middle. Dont expect fluffy beignets like you get at cafe du monde. These burnt my other half's mouth with the grease flowing out of them. Buy the mix yourself and you will fair better. 
19478 4 Absolutely wonderful. Forget those a greasy famous pink boxed donuts. The best donuts in the entries area are Blue Star donuts. There's alway a nice unique assortment. You won't regret it. 
19479 0 I'm pretty sure this place is a converted Quiznos. The food was terrible and a very dirty looking cooking space. I saw a lot of microwaving and processed food. Not worth a try. 
19480 2 Great customer service in my opinion but the equipment is very outdated which could become an issue. I would suggest doing simple print jobs and bring your computer since they don't have a self service one there. 
19481 4 Absolutely amazing. Had migas, breakfast tacos and a watermelon aqua fresca. Salsas were spot on. Had to go back for seconds and can't wait to be back! 
19482 3 Cheese empanadas. Yum. Cuban sandwich. Extra yum. Though ... I wish they gave the option to put their garlic-cilantro sauce on the sandwich. It was good, and it would have been a nice addition to the sandwich. Nice staff, too. :) 
19483 3 The new layout is very nice. Service is friendly and they get you in and out so great for families with young kids 
19484 4 Love my haircut by Bailie and color by Jay. Both are professional, thorough, creative and talented! They both took time to listen to what I wanted and answered any questions. The salon itself is inviting and upbeat. The whole staff was very positive and supportive of each other. 
19485 2 Perfect place for chinese food cravings....always line up,noise level moderate...dominated with asian clientele...food taste awesome with very reasonable price....not very fancy place but i love the foods....money worth plus tummy happy....wash room needs constant house keeping.....group-family-kids friendly...free parking at the rear(goid luck!)oopppssss never forget trying the deep fried silver fish.... 
19486 0 Dirty diapers (multiple) laying in plain sight in the parking lot. They tell you it will be a short wait. Which to them by definition is 1 hour. I took pictures of the dirty diapers, trust me the place is gross. Do not go here. 
19487 4 Excellent. I had the spaghettini con pancetta (a special). My wife had calamari and spinach salad. Our teenage son had a kid's sized pizza, which was larger than he could finish anyways. It was all very good. Wait staff were very attentive and offered great suggestions. 
19488 2 It was very busy when we came. Kind of slow which is understandable, but they messed up one of our drinks. The beer and kale salad were tasty, but the roasted veggie sandwich was made with very plain bread. 
19489 3 Nice little hole-in-the-wall type place. The food is really good, the prices are reasonable, and the service is quick and pleasant. A good place to go on your lunch break! I recommend the #6 special Gyro & Fries. 
19490 0 bad customer service! wrong price at cash register! two strikes they are out for me, but the third is not fresh produce, as in wrinkled jalapeno peppers! never going back there again 
19491 4 Obviously amazing barbecue, but probably my favorite in Austin. They have the BEST Mac n cheese as well. The line sometimes can be a little long, but don't let it turn you away. My favorite is the brisket and I get it every time. 
19492 3 Nice staff, Good food but always cold serving, have to send it back. 
19493 4 Fabulous. One of my fav places for lunch or dinner in the back bay. Not too pricy always great food and good service. LOVE the hot and cold chicken salad. Great salad and sandwich selection. Worth the long wait! 
19494 3 The margaritas are bomb and their fried green beans are just as good. Some of their small plates are pretty small and I think pretty $$$. I love their environment - great place to unwind after work. 
19495 4 Best coffee ever! I love their half moon lattes. Great atmosphere, parking is a little tough. 
19496 4 First hot pot experience and could not have been better! Barry is amazing and so is the rest of the staff. Sauce bar is the best 
19497 3 Wonderful restaurant in the middle of Boston's financial district. There is a salad bar, many people taking to-go orders; the Dner and Swordfish kebap plates are great; the Baklava is good as well. 
19498 4 The spicy miso ramen is absolutely divine. Any of the noodle soups are going to be great, really. A must-try for anyone in the area who likes noodles. 
19499 4 amazing cocktails and menu. perfect place for any date. a little higher priced than i would expect but it's very high quality so maybe it's justified. 
19500 3 Great atmosphere and music! Food was awesome! Best Fish Tacos I've ever had! Jerk Chicken Pasta was even better! 
19501 4 Beautiful decor, comfortable seating, and the food - delicious! Our group of five ordered various dishes to share. All were fresh, flavorful, and authentic. The lemon grass chicken is outstanding! Will be back again. 
19502 3 Chocolate ring was good but perhaps a little too rich for breakfast. Voodoo doll was perfect, the sweetness of the raspberry cut into the richness of the chocolate. 
19503 4 I drive off my usual to-work path to get Americanos from the 30th St. Pekoe. A splash of whole milk and maybe some syrup and it's a little bit of heaven. 
19504 1 Service was slow. Refills were not offered, coffee appears to be rationed. Omelette was decent, served with an untoasted Thomas English muffin thrown on the plate with some over cooked potatoes. 
19505 3 I like to call this place "a donut shop for adults". Delicious creations, everything made from scratch (you can usually see giant tubs of dough raising off to the side), and good, local coffee. The treats are a bit spendy, but just remember you're paying for quality. 
19506 4 Anybody giving this place short of five stars is crazy. Seriously can't find a weakness. Burgers, Fries, Shakes (caramel and nutella pretzel...ridiculous), and atmosphere are all top notch. A coworker told me about this place and I go there every time I'm in Austin. 
19507 4 They fixed the problem for me and I am very happy with them. Henry is a really good guy. 
19508 3 Expensive beer, cheap liquor, a good variety of munchies, I dig it!! 
19509 4 Great service and great food! We are visiting from California and we were just passing by and saw it! The ribs melt in your mouth! And the Club Sandwich was delicious! I would defiantly recommend it! And don't forget to have one of the mint chocolates on your way out 
19510 4 Amazing chai latte! They also have yummy pastries and tacos. The staff is extremely friendly and the lobby is very inviting. Great local coffee spot! 
19511 3 Delicious and defiantly worth a try. We got the blueberry bourbon basil / great flavor 
19512 4 4.5 star to be accurate. The booth is really good. I seldom had chicken ramen before but it tastes really good. The size is not large though I had to order two to have enough food. 
19513 0 prices are crazy - take a ride to Kimball's. $4 for a scoop that could collapse into the cone. I don't mind paying, but give me something in exchange 
19514 4 It is like 400 feet away from my apartment, I usually eat once a week. I love the food, one of my friend who never liked Thai food ate here and he is in love with this place. Best thai restaurant around Arlington MA area 
19515 2 So the Customer service was good. My burger tho, was wack. It was as ordered but my patties were uneven which in turn made my burger sloppy. It was the sloppiest burger that I've gotten from 5 guys. Fries were good as usual. 
19516 3 We had great service. Wait took awhile, but food came quick and we ate it even quicker. Big portions, and taste was distinct for that cafe. Liked it, would recommend, will return. 
19517 3 - had chicken fajitas for two (2) -- delivered sizzling HOT, well seasoned, and onions and peppers were caramelized to perfection - borracho beans were seasoned to perfection as well - rice was just OK can't wait to go back and use my Groupon!!! 
19518 4 The best Ethiopian restaurant I've ever been to. Fish tibs are amazing, also try them over shiro. The honey wine is yummy too. I no longer live in Atlanta but make it a point to visit at least once whenever I visit! 
19519 3 Stephanie was awesome. The lemon rosemary chicken was delicious! 
19520 0 Chewy crust with so so pizza. Not like other wood fired pizza I had. $18 for a small pizza (almost personal size) 1/2 Parma due 1/2 sausage n pepperoni. Not worth the money. Upper crust has better pizza. For way less. 
19521 4 Amazing, fresh, timely, and consistent! Their avocado curry, pad thai, and fresh rolls are my ideal comfort food. The staff is wonderful and their delivery is always speedy. 
19522 4 Just as the name suggests these tacos are very Yummi. I've been coming here for 2 yrs and have always gotten friendly customer service, and delicious food for both breakfast or lunch. 
19523 4 I've gone to this place since I was little. Best Tex Mex in the Austin/Buda area! homemade tortillas, great drinks, I've never had anything here that I don't love! 
19524 2 Great cheese steaks with meat pilled high and cheese from every angle. Now serving Philly pretzels and yes a Philly pretzel is much better than an other soft pretzel you will eat. Trust me I'm a soft pretzel connoisseur. 
19525 4 Not the best wings I have ever had but very very good. The dumplings are excellent as are the garlic noodles. Wish every restaurant was as casual, fast, and delicious as this. Hands down the best food i have had in Oregon. 
19526 4 The Wine Emporium has an extensive selection of wines and liquors and many beers that are difficult to find elsewhere, in addition to better prices than other liquor stores nearby. The staff is so friendly and helpful. A great South End spot! 
19527 4 I love Brown Bag, I tend to stick to the Mohawk stroller or the make your own sandwich, but I have never been disappointed. It is always delicious and I love all of the local bottled drinks they have available. The prices are great too. 
19528 4 Was craving Italian and I never expected such a great experience. This food was beyond exceptional. I can not believe I waited this long to try it. 
19529 0 The cake I ordered from this place looked beautiful but was horribly dry. It was really inedible. A second cake also had the same problem. I like cakes to be super moist, not dry as the Sahara! 
19530 2 Solid Food. Tasty sauces. Andes mints with your check. I too have to give it up to the Music Videos. You can't help but watch the TV. For that same reason, it's not a great place to try to carry on a quiet conversation. 
19531 4 Omg it soooo good! You have to try it! We asked all the locals what their favorite bbq place is, and decided to try this place out. It did not disappoint 
19532 4 Loved it! I liked the set up and decor. We tried the plate of four tacos and they were all delicious. I especially liked the chicken mole I can't wait to go back! 
19533 4 Great place. Larry was very helpful directing me to buy the right system and the installation went great. I really appreciated their attention to detail and level of service. 
19534 3 Great happy hour, attentive service and good happy hour portions. I adore Shigezo so I just had to come here. The bacon wrapped quail eggs were tasty and adorable and the ramen incredible. I will definitely come back. 
19535 3 yum, yum, yum... great original gyro- homemade tziki sauce with fresh cucumber, added lettuce and roasted pepper. Very, very good meat- the dolmathes (stuffed grape leaves) were fabulous. We went to the one by Faniel Hall and it was clean, quick and very good. 
19536 4 Great hibachi and delicious sushi! A perfect choice for dine-in or to go! I order from here all time time, and am never disappointed! Great sushi lunch specials, too! 
19537 3 The sushi is great here and the staff are very friendly, it's conveniently located in Brighton. Ideal place to bring a date as well. 
19538 3 OMG that FRENCH TOAST you won't know what hit you. First time in portland and my cousin brought me here. Don't sleep on this!! 
19539 0 I wish I could give minus 5 (-5)!!! The music was fantastic BUT the place is filthy!! The bathroom especially! As a female who frequents clubs I understand things get a little dirty but mould on the toilet and a collapsed ceiling! Yeah no thanks! 
19540 4 The tsukemen is amazing! It is a must-try on the ramen scene of Vancouver. My favourite is to get the spicy version and ask for extra chili powder. Service is also very good. 
19541 0 It was Saturday night an there was a lineup of 15 to 20 people and there was only one cashier. 
19542 0 Went into Pleasant with high hopes, thinking that it must be an institution -- and that we'd be able to get a taste of what's given this place such longevity. Unfortunately, we left thinking we'd had better meals in cafeterias. Plenty of parking, though :) 
19543 4 Great local bar with a neighbourly vibe. Bartender was great and very friendly. Had the muu-muu Burger (long sandwich, a baguette stuffed with fries and a patty) and it hit the spot. 
19544 4 Best burger I've ever had !!! The sage fries/ chili cheese fries--- absolutely amazing! Great experience all around ! 
19545 4 Some sort of error meant waiting 90 minutes for food, but, they comped the meal - mistakes happen, but it's nice when they respond to it well! 
19546 3 My son and I stopped in for a quick bite before heading to the Celtics game. We were greeted with a wonderful staff. The food was perfect and the atmosphere was great. You can't ask for anything more. We will definitely come back again. 
19547 4 Amazing food always every visit. Our favorite choice is the pad thai with chicken and shrimp. Getting some pineapple fried rice we almost always have extra for another meal for two because of the amount. 
19548 2 I've tried their cookies, muffins, cinnamon rolls, and cupcakes. Just so-so. Everything seems overly sweet and oily; the cookies crumble upon handling; the cupcakes aren't rich. They also seem inconsistent. Giving three stars because they're pretty friendly. 
19549 3 When I walk in the restaurant, it's like I'm walking into a 1950's buffet style diner. The meal is delicious, however not the best southern cuisine I've had. I was disappointed that they didn't serve breakfast on Sunday... 
19550 0 As of today (December 7th) NStar still hasn't shown up. I was waiting until 5:30 and my mother waited until 11 PM. What a sorry excuse for a company. 
19551 4 Got my hair done by Eileen, she is fantastic! My highlights look so natural and healthy, I've been getting compliments from everyone! I highly recommend her and the salon. 
19552 2 Food was OK, definitely not southern cuisine but not northwest cuisine either. Good selection of drinks. Good place for groups to hang out. Try to get the large table in the back of you have a lot of people. 
19553 0 I was so excited to go to dinner with my family. It was horrible! Food was COLD, waitress was so busy in an empty restaurant that we were literally waving someone down to get water refill. I will not be back 
19554 4 Obviusly family owned and authentic. I feel the plates are very traditional and affordable. Service was poor but made up by covering the cost of our hummus and pita. I will definitely come here again, the food was very good. 
19555 4 We order food from them all the time although I work all the way in Watertown. All variety of Middle Eastern food, served very nicely and timely. 
19556 0 A JOKE! Only cigar 'friendly' bar that doesn't allow you to bring your own cigar even after ordering drinks and food! Cigarettes allowed but no personal cigars. NOT a real cigar atmosphere. 
19557 4 My first experience of Ramen food in US. I ordered some spicy chicken ramen and I liked it. I had to wait for 40 minutes before I got the table but was worth it 
19558 3 Everything you need to organize, but with a Pottery Barn level of customer service. Outstanding. 
19559 3 While the pizza at Joe Pizza is pretty good, we keep going back for the subs. Great ingredients, and the freshest bread around make their grinders great. I go for either the Meatball Parm or Steak Tip... 
19560 0 Just heard about a guy being tossed out amidst racial slurs and management did nothing. Will not be going here. Sounds like a DUMP! No thanks! 
19561 4 Had the Parkway omelette, Amazing omelette. Stuffed with veggies. Great service. No need for lunch after breakfast here. 
19562 3 The Cadillac Margarita was huge, the food was great. My fiancee had the tortilla soup and loved it. I had the chicken chimichangas and they were a big portion and very tasty! 
19563 1 Alfredo was lousy- worst cheat meal. Very dry pasta and sauce was liquidy. No fresh parm cheese and my sisters clams were very chewy. Bad service as well.... Prob because we had a groupon. Def would not come back here 
19564 3 Good selection. I've seen better prices at other places. Staff was helpful, seems like a good place to hang out. 
19565 4 Not only is this the best restaurant in the Atlanta Airport, it would stand on its own anywhere! I recommend the Terminal E Burger. Absolutely phenomenal! 
19566 1 I was expecting something, I don't know, just something yummy, something gastown cool. I go meh. The staff was okay and so were the people. The food and drinks, could have been better. Nothing stood out, nothing at all. Definitely not going back. 
19567 4 I eat here a few times a month. The food is always fresh and consistent. The broth for the soup is perfect. My son loves the spring rolls. Try an avocado smoothie or coconut cake. Friendly staff and quick service. 
19568 4 Hands down THE best frozen custard I've ever had. The selection/flavors/combinations--superb!!! Come on thru!! Bring your family and friends! 
19569 4 Strongly recommend the Bermuda Bliss for whenever you need a pick me up/are sick/want to treat yourself. I love this place and the people that work here are so friendly. Prices: 16oz smoothies are $6.78 24oz smoothies are $7.71 
19570 4 If you come here and you don't get the sausage you are wasting your time. It's homemade and so legit. Also had a half meat lovers and half cbg pizza...exceeded expectations (and expectations were high). No wonder this place is one of the best in Boston. 
19571 4 the gyros here. are my wife and I's favorite. of all the gyros in the land. portions are generous. the owner Josef is sweet. came from Greece. the taziki is choice, cool cucumber/mint flavors. superior to all other gyros. 
19572 1 Had to wait about 40 minutes for a table on a Saturday morning. Food was ok, service was very sketchy. Waitresses clearly didn't want to make eye contact with diners for fear they'd be asked to bring a forgotten item. 
19573 4 OMG. The food here is out of this world. The chowder fries are an absolute must. Our waitress, Gina, gave amazing recommendations. I will definitely be dining here again the next time I visit Salem. 
19574 1 Fancy restaurant and great service! BUT food is just ok. We went there in new year eve. They had special menu. We had scollop for appetizer. New York steak and salmon. Salmon cooked burned. And scollop was salty. I wouldn't come again. 
19575 1 Out of four items ordered they managed to get two wrong, order taker was disinterested or bored, the food; burger ok, drink machine was out of half the flavor selections of Diet Coke. Fries were the best part and they were just ok, also, would not go back. 
19576 2 Trendy concept but the donuts are too rich for me and too funky. I know people like that but sometimes I just want a simple donut. I'll have to go somewhere else for that. 
19577 4 Love this place! They have the freshest ingredients, you can get everything natural or organic, nice detox drink area great place for lunch 
19578 4 Everything on the menu is delicious! My absolute favorite sushi spot in Austin! Try the Pork Buns and Spicy Lobster Dumplings. I'm drooling just thinking about it! 
19579 4 Very good pasta...homemade...highly recommend! Try Chef Mann's special pasta with sun dried tomatoes, broccoli rabbi and sausage in a garlic wine sauce...awesome! Seafood carbonara was also outstanding. Thomas was our server was attentive and knowledgeable regarding the menu and wines...he could not please us enough...what a pleasurable experience. Thank you! 
19580 0 Worst customer service Greek Restaurant in town. Do not bother. Owner was rude to customers. 
19581 4 I don't know whats wrong with some of the other reviewers here but this place rocks. The food is awesome the owners are really nice as well. We go here all the time and will continue to. 
19582 4 By far my favourite place to get a matcha latte!! 
19583 3 Delicious brunch, especially if you like Moroccan food! There was a small wait, but well worth it. 
19584 4 Definitely one of the best pizza places in Atlanta. Unusually friendly, neighborhood atmosphere. Well priced. 
19585 4 Bomb dot com! There really isn't much else to say! 5 stars for stellar service and amazing food! 
19586 3 Virgin America is definitely my airline of choice. The flight times are usually faster than the stated times, and if there's a few bumps in-flight, the turbulence has never been too severe to the point where I puke. Kudos for being friendly, comfortable, and clean. 
19587 2 Food is pretty good, but a bit overpriced and not that special. Really wished for better as Weston needs more options. 
19588 2 Perfect for a quick breakfast. Not at the scale of golden corral, but can't beat the 5.99pp 
19589 3 YaYa,s is fantastic! Just a little place open in the mornings. But the best guava pasteries in the world. I take a bag full to work and am queen for the day. They melt in your mouth with your coffee. The Palmetto rolls are wonderful to. 
19590 4 This is overwhelmingly great food and value. It's all good. We especially liked the jamon, the duck egg, the prawns, but it's all good. Don't miss it. 
19591 4 Simply amazing. Enjoyed the chefs tasting with 6 friends had a great time and was really happy with the service, the waitress and the food. If I lived in the area this would be a non stop spot to hit up. 
19592 3 A great place for some good Chinese. Authentic and great taste and relatively speedy. General Tso's is great and the hot and spicy soup was good. Definitely worth a try if you are looking for some good Chinese! 
19593 4 Two words - sushi burrito! Delicious and filling and totally worth the reasonable price. We will keep coming back over and over. The one with the mango in it is killer! Great location too. Love Happy Valley Station. 
19594 2 It's ok for a beer and some seafood, kind of loud, but it's a barking crab! Go with a friend and enjoy some Boston seafood and local culture. Make a mess! 
19595 4 These guys are great - I didn't feel any sales pressure or snootiness at all. 
19596 1 This literally took 40 minutes for a to go order. Burger was decent and not at all worth the wait compared to all the other vendors at ponce. 
19597 0 Did not brother to go passed the ordering counter. This place is FILTHY and it begins with the outside area. Walked in and all tables were dirty Walls and floors have seen better days (maybe first week of opening) It didn't look like a place that sells food. Absolutely disgusting! 
19598 3 The Cuban sandwich is awesome. Sometimes there is a wait for a table but that's how it is at most restaurants at dinner time, right? 
19599 4 Life savers! My phone was dropped and shattered. Insurance replacement value was a rip off and would take a week. Called these guys and dropped it off. Had my phone back good as new within hours for a reasonable price. So lucky to have this place on the Westside! 
19600 2 Eat here when in town for business staying nearby. Food is good, price can't be beat. Only three stars for gross wet rag smell every time I come in. Ewww 
19601 0 Juicy pork dumplings were the only decent thing in my order. I wouldn't recommend this place. 
19602 2 If you want to catch a game then this is definitely a place to check out. TVs everywhere and one really big big TV that will blow your mind. The food is your typical bar food that you find in a hotel but they have a good craft beer selection. 
19603 4 I've had the whole menu. Go with Wings, burgers/chicken sandwich, rings, quesadillas, wraps, and I've heard salads but I've never had one. In that order. All else is good but not stellar. Great place. 1/2 wings Wednesdays, 1/2 wine Thursdays. 
19604 2 We ordered takeout and were really happy. We had the pepperoni, garlic and hot peppers and it was loaded with all three. Yum! 
19605 4 The two movers arrived early, worked quickly and efficiently, and handled everything with care - the move was fast and smooth and I couldn't have asked for anything better! Booking the move was also easy - Jen was pleasant and helpful over the phone. Highly recommend! 
19606 3 Stopped for brunch after church. Loved the atmosphere and decor. Great cup of coffee. Prompt and friendly service. Ordered the Omelet special. Would have given it 5 stars but hash browns were overdone and reheated. Everything else was delicious! 
19607 4 Great friendly service, Warren is awesome! Love the decor and the food! Definitely a frequent customer :) 
19608 3 As far as breakfast tacos go, their Migas is pretty darn good. It's fairly priced and surprisingly filling. It's simple, but you can tell the ingredients are fresh and freshly prepared. Hopefully next time I'm in Austin I can try their Al Pastor. 
19609 3 Good place for a quick bite between drinks. The large slices really help soak up the alcohol. 
19610 3 Great food. Had a really great meal. The Newton location is way too small though. The wait was super long but the food was well worth the wait. We will definitely be back soon. #AlaskanCrabLegs 
19611 3 Great place in Multnomah village for breakfast and burgers. A cute diner with fun decor! We have been here 3+ times and have never been disapointed. 
19612 3 The food at Figs is always interesting and delicious. Sometimes the furniture is a little bit run down. It is one of my favorite restaurants in Boston and I think going out to Charlestown is part of the fun. Not a bad place for people watching. 
19613 4 I went here with some friends who are regulars. The salads are fantastic, and the drinks are delicious as well. It stands alone in a little enclave, so you could miss it if you weren't paying attention. 
19614 4 Love this place because the pizza is pretty decent for the price AND death metal playing in the back ground, freakin' awesome! Been going to this place for years and it's always awesome. Friendly guys too. 
19615 4 Great food, always come here. Gots an awesome sushi bar. Staff is friendly. Would definitely recommend 
19616 4 Great! Flavorful, plentiful, affordable, and unusual. Had the mixed tacos (1 fish, 1 pork). Will be back soon to try more items off the menu! 
19617 4 My favorite guilty indulgence. Keep up the good work staff is always nice and the choices at endless. Lastly if you like ice cream I highly recommend taking home a pint 
19618 3 We have been going here starting in 2016 and it has very good Thai food for this area. Prices reasonable and service very good. Not very big though. My friend who is pretty picky also like this restaurant. Highly recommended. 
19619 2 I ordered takeout during at 3 in the afternoon and it wasn't really that busy. Got 3 rolls the house, box and spider and ended up waiting 30 minutes. The rolls were tasty but took forever for a takeout order, especially since it wasn't that busy 
19620 4 I've been here 3 times-2 of those times I got Dr Wilson, highly recommend her. Wait time reasonable, check in quick & professional, followup fine, we'd come back. Like large waiting room & appreciated help to the car & with crutches! 
19621 4 Omg, this is an amazing restaurant. We opted for La Famille ($60 each person) and again, OMG. We had an incredible experience and our bellies and souls were fulfilled. Definitely going back!! 
19622 2 Great gym with good hours. My biggest issue is that they play the same lame music every day. It is literally the same songs. I have talked to staff about this - how hard is it to put on satellite radio or even just play the radio? 
19623 4 Awesome place love the food and the coco chanel among other items I love. Just about everything here is pretty darn good. 
19624 3 Very yummy pastries. I think if they started serving lattes and cappuccinos as well they would do a lot more business. 
19625 4 I'm really not a Jamaican food eater; however this food was banging. I ate it cold so I could imagine what it would taste like hot. I encourage all that can and will try Dat Fire Jerk Chicken. 
19626 4 This is the place for great beer, food, board games with friends, and live music. I love that it is year round too. I enjoyed their Pilsner and some Cards Against Humanity on a Saturday evening. Bringing your own games isn't a bad idea. Also, they allow dogs. 
19627 4 A friend and I actually stumbled upon B&G one afternoon while strolling through the South End. We suddenly had a craving for beer and oysters. The restaurant was very quaint and cozy. We sat at the bar which led us to great service. The oysters were fresh and delicious! 
19628 4 The food came out very prompt and was very delicious! I came around 10am Monday morning it was a little busy but people came n left. I had Leila she was so cute and very attentive! 
19629 0 Coffee is always burned and order is often wrong. Walk down to the Porter DD instead. 
19630 3 Very good, generous sized pizzas all in the setting of a fun, funky, , relaxed atmosphere. 
19631 4 went here for lunch the other day and the food was excellent! The portions were huge and the price was cheap! The service was quick and the place was very clean.. Definitely will be back 
19632 4 Best grimy little dive bar in the campus area. Hella cheap drinks, prototypical Midwest atmosphere, and a staff that knows what they're doing. 
19633 3 Best burrito and taco in this neighborhood for sure. Go here regularly for lunch. Battered fish burrito is my recommendation. 
19634 4 Excellent first experience! The salon is clean and inviting, and Erika is very pleasant, professional, and knowledgeable. This is my new goto nail salon. Hands down - the best salon ever!!!!! 
19635 1 Pillows the size of couch pillows, never had this at any other hotel. Front door had NO soundproofing. Remote didn't work. Only good thing they had electricity when I didn't and a room available. Wonder why? 
19636 4 The perfect rainy day place: ** French onion soup ** Whiskey & beer pairings ** Big comfy booths And that's not even getting into how awesome the patio is on sunny days 
19637 4 Willow Tree is great! We typically go during lunch time to enjoy the outside seating and a nice tall beer. The German potato salad is always a great side to any sandwich. I highly recommend WT as a place to go if you find yourself in Sanford. 
19638 3 I used to stop here every friday. The coffee has always been consistent, but what I really like here are the home made muffins they are really great. 
19639 4 The food was delicious and atmosphere was fun and relaxing. Our server was very nice and did a great job. We'd definitely return. Maybe we'll see one of the Wahlburg's next time ;) 
19640 1 Ordered the fried ravioli. Delivery took an hour and ten minutes despite being located a mile away. The ravioli was burnt and tasteless. Two stars for being at least edible I guess. 
19641 4 Love this place!!!! If ur in the mood for great Caribbean food that's packed with flavor come here. I stopped eating meat a couple months ago and I am in love with their veggie plate. Before it was the jerk chicken plate. 
19642 3 Great service from the moment we stepped in the restaurant up until we left! Mixed grilled meats, steak tips, shrimp and veggie enchiladas - all delicious. Up until tonight, i had only been here for drinks and apps. I will come back for dinner again. 
19643 1 I had a really mediocre dining experience here... I ordered the Pad Thai special, which was very bland with mushy noodles. It seemed pretty overpriced ($8) for a food cart even had it been delicious. 
19644 1 The food here is extremely oily for no reason and lacks much flavor. The momos are very dry. The sauces are nice and fresh and taste pretty good if you add salt to them. Not coming back. 
19645 1 I dislike the menu change. They cut Chicken Alfredo and the baked potato soup. I asked if they had fried chicken wings they told me yes and gave me buffalo wings. I was looking forward to coming here after a good experience 2yrs ago. Not impressed! 
19646 3 People: DO NOT open the last door upstairs. And do not go to restroom alone if you are easy scared like I do. 
19647 3 Seems like a good place to hang when I start grad school at Emory in Auguts. The patio is awesome and the service was good. I will definitely chill there in between exams... 
19648 4 Don't waste your time at any other donut shop, go straight here! The bacon maple is to die for- not too overbearingly sweet, donut is soft and fluffy, the flavors hit you just right. You pay for each donut individually, no dozen/half dozen deals. Worth it regardless. 
19649 4 This is such a great little concert venue. They get great acts, and every seat in the house is a good seat. Also, they have a great little snack bar in the back that serves wine. 
19650 4 Oh my goodness!!!! I can't remember the last time I felt this pleased with breakfast. The Rusty Jack with a side salad and a mimosa has started me off right for this beautiful Saturday in Austin. Everything was A+: food, service, and drink. 
19651 4 I went to a wedding catered by Chef Silvia, and the food was AMAZING! While everything was delicious, the ahi tuna tartare was especially good. In addition we had a rum-guava bbq sauce that was so good, I wanted to put it on everything. I would highly recommend Travelling Gourmet! 
19652 1 Audi (Mag) service department isn't as good as the BMW (MAG) service department. Never had an issue with the BMW service team but our Audi had to go back three months in a row for engine coil replacements. 
19653 3 Shopping street of Boston. You can find all the good fancy(pricey) stores around the street. The red brick building in the street brings a refreshing look and it is not somethings like 5th/madison of NY. Drive around. You will definately stop here. 
19654 4 Jessica is the best manager in town and always takes care of her customers!!! I will be returning to this location time and time again for a quality burger. 
19655 3 One of the best burgers I've ever had! Took our orders lightning fast and with good spirit! The staff is friendly and helpful. 
19656 3 Amazing restaurant... they also serve half of each vegetarian dish you order. The food was great just need to improve on the wait time to be seated. Will come back here:-) 
19657 4 Picking up some delicious cupcakes for Mother's Day. Love Sister Honey's cakes, but you have to order weeks in advance. Can stop by any day for slices of cake and cupcakes available in the front case. 
19658 4 I use these guys all the time to go from overlook Ridge in Revere to Logan. They are always early..which can be annoying and always call to say they are downstairs. They help with the luggage and take credit cards. What more can you ask for? 
19659 3 Great food, but it can get crowded and noisy. I've tried the Ron Burgundy (this is a messy eat!), salty balls, and the dumplins. Everything was delicious! 
19660 4 The very best Chinese restaurant on Austin which has no truly authentic Chinese restaurants. Impeccable service & quality ingredients. Always impressed here. Best Chinese restaurant in Austin no contest. 
19661 3 Pretty good food. Enjoyed the chicken Karachi and pakoras. Lunch buffet was smaller than what I have seen in the north Austin area. Good, but I think it has some room to grow. 
19662 1 Food wasn't horrible but $3 bottle waters and $9 for a slice of average pizza isn't worth it! This was extremely overpriced - even for a New Yorker! 
19663 4 Oh my goodness! So freaky deaky good! I NEVER. Oooh aaaah. CHEEESE! Fresh fresh FRESH! Come here if you want to leave happy. :) 
19664 3 I used to come here on a regular basis. I love the service and the ambience. Finding a parking spot on a regular day was not easy so I had to find a different location. Otherwise I do recommend this place for their great products and services they offer. 
19665 4 It's a very good restaurant to go!! We had a bbq there were a lot of meat.good for a meet lover!! Recommend 
19666 2 Enjoyed the pakawra here. The rest of the meal I got was pretty decent but nothing to brag about (I had the lamb shoulder). I went on a Saturday night and they had a dancer performing in the dinning room. It was interesting. 
19667 3 Awesome family restaurant. The chicken and jellyfish salad with Chinese radish, cucumbers and carrots is SO tasty and perfect for the summer!! Also their Kung Pao chicken (diced chicken with chilies and peanuts) is the best I've ever had in Vancouver. Hits the spot. 
19668 3 I always love Blue Ridge Grill. Get there early for a cocktail and enjoy the ambiance of a first class steakhouse. The tuna tartar is a wonderfully decadent starter and the on-the-bone steaks will have you asking for a doggie bag no matter how hungry you are. 
19669 4 As a self-proclaimed "healthy eater", this place is my cup of tea. Delicious, low calorie options, plus vegetarian friendly! Great atmosphere, and service is great. 
19670 4 Want a one of a kind, great tasting, and high-quality meat burger? Go here! Atlanta is sometimes overwhelming with so many good places to choose from. We went here on a Sunday unexpectedly and next time we visit atlanta this will definitely be a stop. 
19671 3 Good food, drinks and atmosphere. Margy are solid on those hot summer days. 
19672 4 Wow! What a nice find. The food was excellent. Our server Theresa couldn't have been more attentive or accommodating. The staff was so nice. Honestly, the best dining experience I've had in Cocoa Village or Cocoa Beach. Highly recommend! 
19673 3 terrific addition to the neighborhood- a local business that has great food. 3 cheers for the breakfast sandwiches. the space is bright and airy and pleasant to sit in and relax. 
19674 4 I will come back in a month! The guy who did my hair hardly speaks english but he's good! I just had to show him a pic on my phone and he got the idea of what i wanted! And only 18dlls!!! 
19675 3 I liked the mini affagato sundae at happy hour, but prefer the flavorful Salt and Straw actual ice cream over their soft serve they have here at Wiz Bang. 
19676 4 Best mexican restaurant in sw Portland. Incredible food, great drinks, great atmosphere, fair prices, friendly staff. I must recommend this place. Parking is a crowded being next to Bentos but there isn't much you can do about that. This is a 5 star restaurant between a 10-16 dollar price range. 
19677 4 We were skeptical on how good seafood could be at an airport restaurant, but this was delicious! It actually made our list of top 3 restaurants while on vacation! Food came out surprisingly fast, and all 3 meals were exceptional! 
19678 4 Good General Tso's chicken and eggrolls, and have always had my take out ready on time. 
19679 3 The only thing lacking was the tanqueray and tonic, my husband said it was awful. But then that's what you get when you order something that's not on the menu. Great service, good sushi, yummy fried scallops. Will come back for sure! 
19680 4 Excellent and so glad Cocoa Village has Ossorio. Their food and service is excellent. The best lunch in town. 
19681 3 A bit pricey but it's worth what you pay....the spice level is what you exactly want....the ambience is quite good and the staff is friendly....if around Norwood/Walpole....a restaurant to stop by... 
19682 4 Delicious spicy fried chicken. Small, crowded, hard to park, but well worth it. Consistently good & friendly staff. Glad they opened in Austin. 
19683 3 The staff are great and I find them all friendly and knowledgeable. The only reason I don't rate a full five stars is the store only seems to have specials on weekends. I would like to see more specials during the week. I prefer to shop here when I can. 
19684 4 When in Vancouver near Esther Short park this is a great place to grab brunch over the weekend. I had the lobster and Brie omelette which was delicious also filled with fresh mushrooms and tomatoes. My companion had the kahlua pork which also looked great. Service was friendly and quick. 
19685 2 Revised review: I went back yesterday after several months...I ordered a cappuccino to go and it was actually pretty good. The staff is friendly, which is also a plus. I'll go back and see how the regular coffee tastes... 
19686 4 Dr. Borus is kind and caring. He has a good bedside manner and is a great surgeon! I would recommend him to anyone! 
19687 4 A go-to in our house. Nice sophisticated decor and atmosphere, and great food on every page if the menu! 
19688 4 First place I visited in Austin. I'm falling in love in the city. If you are around don't miss this place. 
19689 1 Service was ho hum... It lacked any personal touch, kindness or suggestive selling. She even dropped off our check before I could order another drink and we were sitting in the bar/lounge area... 
19690 4 Oh my god. Go here. Eat everything. Die happy. Be reborn. Repeat. 
19691 0 Boring!!! Don't waste your time on this "experience". It's long and super outdated. Universal should just get rid of it. 
19692 4 Highly recommended. The gin was my favorite, and I'm definitely not a fan of gin. The staff was awesome and friendly. Pretty intimate setting which was great. 
19693 2 This place was good. Nothing super-d-duper amazing, but we had good, attentive service and the food was good. I had miso soup and sweet and sour chicken. Clean restaurant and a nice little haven away from the busyness of the park. 
19694 2 I liked this medium-sized, quiet cafe. Breakfast was good, and service was ok. Tasty drinks including Blood Mary & Mimosa. 
19695 4 This place is top-notch. From ambiance to service, appetizer to dessert, I highly recommend this place. The steak is amazing, the bar is fantastic, and the view is phenomenal. 
19696 3 Food is always so good. You get to pick exactly what you want and all the different sauces are amazing. And you can always add some sushi if your the mood. 
19697 4 Best coffee and baked goods in Vancouver, hands down. Worth every penny. 
19698 4 Absolutely the best customer service of any gun store in the area. Good selection, and well staffed with very knowledgeable and friendly people. 
19699 3 Another really great pho place in Austin, no surprise there. Nothing stuck out that made this place particularly awesome but they're serving up pho that's just as good as a number of other places in the area. 
19700 4 Yummy! I just finished the shrimp sandwich and it was very good. Friendly people and cute inside. I highly recommend. 
19701 4 Bomb beef. One of the best in the biz. I go super 3-way, but I doubt you could mess up their beef. Don't think I've tried anything else on the menu, and don't really see why I would. 
19702 3 Good sushi!! And service. The dishes are well presented and prepared - the ingredients are always fresh. One of my go to restaurants for sushi in brentwood area! 
19703 1 Service was slow, food was cold. We complained about the seafood being cold and no one came over to address it or find out more. Will not be coming back here 
19704 3 GREAT beers, nice staff, comfy location, great neighborhood. Such a great addition. Downside? Yeah, their hours. Close at 9 on Friday and 8 on Saturdays. Are they Amish? Oh well, get in there early to catch their fine brews and hope that hours may possibly expand at some point? 
19705 4 Great food good prices superb management and perfect staff. I will always head here when in the area 
19706 3 Great food, very welcoming atmosphere, I'll be coming back! Can't wait to come back for happy hour and play some pool! Hope this place sticks around. Def recommend this spot! 
19707 2 It's ok. Staff were somewhat distant, the food was decent. 
19708 3 The food was ehhh. The atmosphere is ****ING outstanding and I'd definitely come here for a drink and apps, but the food is purely mediocre. 
19709 4 Nutella donuts. Enough said. Really though, it's clean and delicious and well it's Tim Hortons!!!! It's great!!!! 
19710 4 Great place to eat when downtown, I really enjoy the chicken Kabob or the salmon dinner plate and the smoothies are spectacular. 
19711 2 Not sure if it's in response to prior reviews or just maintenance cycles, but cleanliness and functionality of burrard station has improved quite a bit. In any case, there's no getting around this station as a necessary evil :P 
19712 4 Great spot. Scorpion Bowls make it impossible not to have a good time! 
19713 4 A great portland/beaverton breakfast spot. I come here a couple times a month. They have great food and are friendly staff. Quick and the food is hot. Can't ask for much more. 
19714 4 Amazing burger and fries! The Bonzai Burger is to die for! Teriyaki and pineapple on a burger is a great combo! 
19715 4 omg it's so good. and the patio is so beautiful. and the menu is so inventive. and the line is so long. (le sigh) there goes your entire sunday. 
19716 2 Those fries! It's Rally's. It's not supposed to be fancy. It's that "hit the spot food" and only spend $6. 
19717 3 They have above average ramen and a chill vibe. The service was great and prompt! This place is the real deal and I recommend it to anyone looking for another ramen place to try out! 
19718 3 For a reasonably priced hotel the rooms are clean and the kids love the pool and thw staff is friendly and helpful. 
19719 4 Busy place !!! I show up at 8:30 pm still have to wait for the table. Pho Dac Biet was very good compare to I Luv Pho in Atlanta GA. Will come back again 
19720 2 I really like the idea of FIGO, the food is quite good as well. The missing stars are mainly for the price for what you get. When it comes to something simple as pasta and bread it really feels like the price is a bit high. 
19721 4 Amazing! Great...great and friendly service...excellent craft cocktails and delicious tapas, priced correctly....fun ambiance on the Saturday night that I was there...definitely worth checking out on your South End discovery 
19722 4 This is my trusty dry cleaner. They're incredibly friendly and very efficient. 
19723 0 Worst experience ever stay away. there are many better resorts around. under staffed for a big place like that. 
19724 4 I used Precision through my insurance for windshield replacement.Andrew was still quick, friendly and communicative. I was given a four-hour window for the replacement, and Precision showed up only 90 minutes into that block. If I ever need another windshield replacement, this will be my preferred go-to. 
19725 2 Probably one of the better LA finesses around. Machines are reasonably up to date. Locker room generally clean and not too crowded on a regular night. But like most LA fitness, pretty basic neighborhood gym, no towel service, which is a bit annoying. But all in all not bad. 
19726 4 Been on the tour before so Jared took us on a totally different tour! He was great! Well worth it, always do a great job! Bring gloves! 
19727 3 I think it's the manager he's the one with the permanent sour puss on his face. Even when I'm fake friendly- he's still so rude. Great food though that's why I come back! Haha 
19728 3 I had a harsh review here in the past. But my last two service appointments were handled really well (thanks, Brian). Both were unscheduled and handled promptly, one via overnight but with provision of a loaner car. Denis 
19729 3 I ordered the seared tuna sandwich, which was incredible, though a lighter choice with no side. Also tasted a dish that was mashed potatoes and chicken with gravy so menu runs a wide range. Happy hour was quite generous for both hours and prices on drinks. 
19730 4 Great food and fun to go with friends or family. There is outdoor seating in the summer which is great! The inside is really pretty with high ceilings. You can get 1/2 portions which is key, and splitting a salad and pizza with a friend is a great meal idea! 
19731 3 A great place for Brazilian style baked goods and coffee. Nice staff, quick service! 
19732 3 It's small and there aren't many places to sit but Blossom Tree has great food! 
19733 4 Wicked good! Awesome food Great drinks Wonderful service I will be craving the food!!!!! 
19734 4 The most amazing meal ever. We chose the chefs tasting menu. He is amazing. Next time we are in odd we will definitely come back. The service was perfect and the timing was swift. No complaints! 
19735 3 Always wanted to try but afraid of high prices. 3 courses for $25 promotion sucked US in. Weren't disappointed. Great service, wonderful flavor from salad to dessert. We had grilled pork shoulder and it was tender and very tasty. Would gladly return. 
19736 3 I tried the chicken, it was really dry. I would say stick with the pork Gyro 
19737 4 Had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant and was certainly NOT disappointed. The food was excellent, atmosphere great and servers very friendly! Will definitely come again 
19738 4 Dr. Youngkin and his staff are wonderful! He is very punctual, kind and helped bring my two children into the world. His staff always returns calls quickly as well. I highly recommend him for any infertility issue as well. 
19739 4 This place blew my mind. I had a great time at the bar. Joe knocked it out of the park with food recommendation, and even meet us for a different drinks. 
19740 4 Food was fantastic and service was quick. Yama was our chef in hibachi and he was great. Can't wait to comeback. 
19741 1 Convenient location for work, so likely I'll return. Aside from that it's a simple tavern offering simple tavern food. Folks were nice the place was good size and they had a nice patio area with lots of seating. 
19742 1 I usually buy my oils, chemicals here. But recently i had them change a tube for me. they didn't tighten the rim lock down, so after riding, the tube spun around, and i had to put a new tube in at the track... I'll never make that mistake again 
19743 4 Love it! The pizza is great! The patio is fun and they have live music outside. My favorite is the portabella mushroom pizza. That with a cold beer....yum. 
19744 4 I went here when it first opened and it has gotten even better. The ladies here are so sweet and I love having My (Tina) as my go to. They stay pretty busy but they are patient and give plenty of time with each client! 
19745 2 I always order the salad bowl here with Adobe Chicken, fresh Pico de Gallo, salsa, chili, and more for $10. Quick service and easy, healthier choices than other food places here. 
19746 4 The San fran sandwhich is phenomenal and best thing on the menu. Add it with avocado you won't be disappointed! 
19747 4 Amazing place, with a beautiful and big patio! waiting for italian food - from Patrizi's 
19748 4 I love it here. Always a new beer to try, great pizza, cool staff, friendly regulars, and golden tee! And my first "date" with my girlfriend was here! If you like beer and pizza, you will love the Brewhouse! 
19749 0 Poor and slow service. They were out of several items on the menu. They overcharged us for an item by 50%! Food quality not great. My last time in the restaurant! 
19750 3 Excellent, amazing salted caramel frozen custard. This is a must-try. I would avoid the fruit-based sorbets, they didn't taste quite so good. I have a feeling the Nutella and the Vanilla custards will be quite good. 
19751 3 Good place went there for our anniversary. Only real issue I had with the joint is that it was slightly over priced, don't know if we would go back. 
19752 1 2 people dinning his fish sandwich came to the table. I waited for my 2 tacos, 1 fish 1 jimichurri. And waited. After he was 1/2 done my 2 tacos finally came. Fish taco was soggy and the stk taco dripped oil. Not good won't be back. 
19753 3 Exceptional service and the food was delicious, though the lamb was dry which keeps me from giving them give stars. The belly dancing was fun to watch and we had a nice time at Truva even though we were the only party in the restaurant on a Friday night. 
19754 4 Jonathan was absolutely amazing! He took care of our party of 20 and we never had to request refills on anything. I would highly recommend coming to see him! 
19755 3 Staffs are friendly. More towards authentic Tex-mex compared to other Mexican restaurants nearby. 
19756 3 Inventive fusion with cool decor. Order a bunch of small plates and eat family style. 
19757 3 Happy hour ichiban: Pint of beer $5 Vegi Curry $5 Pork Belly $3 Quail Egg wrapped in bacon $3 Shishito Peppers $1.50 Shitakke Mushrooms $1.50 Grilled Squid $4 Tokyo Ramen w/ corn & garlic $6 Another beer $5 Total $34 いいぞ!!!!! 
19758 4 We enjoyed this ride so much. The wildflowers were breathtaking. The pavement is in great shape. If you are a cyclist and want a great ride without having to worry about traffic, it is a must in Austin. Minor caution for roadrunners and squirrels. 
19759 4 Had two occasions to use them. Totally professonal, they didnt start until I was completely numbed up. The doctors and assistants work well together and get the procedures done. As satisfied as one can be about what they do. 
19760 2 Friendly service, fun atmosphere. The food is good but nothing fancy. 
19761 4 Just bought shades for french doors and the overall experience was better than I could have imagined. The design assistant was very helpful and so sweet to deal with. I would highly recommend the product and the store to anyone. 
19762 3 Solid focused menu. Pork carnitas taco was outstanding. Chicken taco was less successful. Overall great spot. 
19763 3 good Thai....great people. I am a fan. Lover of salad rolls and stuffed chicken is out of this world...my thai girl friend raved over it when I grabbed "to go" and shared. Must give it a try! 
19764 2 There were a fair amount of options including several different kinds of tacos. Shrimp tacos were great especially with extra house hot sauce. They also offer an oreo churro which looked really yummy. The regular churro was good. 
19765 4 I may be 42 years old but I tell you this right now I had the best time of my life at that bar bowling playing pool the drinks the music everything about that place was wonderful awesome it was excellent. 
19766 4 Best Pho restaurant in Portland! And trust me I have tried almost all of them:) I highly recommend this place! 
19767 3 The barbecue chicken is very juicy and barbecue pork is tasty. The bowls are little bit filthy when they are served. 
19768 4 Good fresh fast good as expected at Wahoo's! Friendly staff, fast service, convenient location. 
19769 3 I had a good experience buying a used mazda3. Toni Belikov helped me and was excellent. 
19770 3 I really like the homemade pickles and natural ginger beer. Their sandwiches and burgers are very good. Easy and cheap parking in the attached garage. I also love their music selection! 
19771 4 Best Chinese in Atlanta. My favorite is their sizzling rice soup. Friendly family run restaurant 
19772 3 The pizzas are good - Fritti is better. But, the lamb chops here were awesome!! 
19773 4 This place has amazing French toast.. I go there every week. You want a excellent breakfast/brunch this is your place. Friendly staff excellent food. They make everything there at the cafe best whipped cream ever. 
19774 2 Went here with my wife. Food was pretty good. Lobster Mac and cheese was overrated. Crab cake was pretty good. Chocolate cake was very good. Excellent waiter. Ok vibe. Will try out their Sunday brunch at some point. 
19775 4 Yay! I'm so happy that I don't have to drive far (UCF area) for Jeremiahs anymore because its closer to Kissimmee. I usually get the coconut gelati with soft serve vanilla but I tried cookie butter instead. Amazingly delicious! :) 
19776 1 Mediocre at best. Cold food. Slow service. Flat beer. Unavailable beer. Kind of a disappointment if you've ever been to a Taco Mac you love. I will say, however, the servers were very friendly. I won't be going back. 
19777 4 Very fresh and delicious free chips and salsa! they have a baked enchilada dish that is absolutely the best! It has three enchiladas, chicken, sirloin and pico!!! Yumm! ...The margaritas go without saying. 
19778 2 Quality bar and stage. Music didn't seem to be projected throughout the venue. Very cool and comfortable environment. Enjoy. 
19779 4 The best customer service! Stopped in before a concert at TD Garden. Needed last minute tickets printed and Dana went above and beyond to print for me! So nice and drinks are good! 
19780 4 Yes yes and more yes to this place! Spicy means spicy !!!! Had the pad woo sen and was very happy the parking situation was not great, but the food comes out so quick !! 
19781 3 Stopped in for lunch and sat outside on the patio. It's charming! Had a delicious beet salad with shrimp and a good glass of wine. Service was great! 
19782 4 1st timer. Wonderful service and amazing food. Highly recommended for a dinner for 2 or more. Beautiful live Spanish guitar while you eat and drink. I am a big fan as it is unique comfortable dining experience worth every penny. 
19783 1 Nothing to write home about. Mediocre Tex-Mex at best. 
19784 4 This is nothing special to look at, but they get 5 stars because the pizza is always hot and delicious and they've never gotten the order wrong. The people are always friendly which makes a huge difference. I'm a happy customer! 
19785 2 This is one of my favorite restaurant, food is amazing along with the atmosphere but one server cannot handle 14 tables, put more server on the floor so dine in customer can be service better and more timely manner 
19786 3 Stayed here for two weeks. It is on the interstate, but the noise of the traffic did not bother me. The park is very clean and quiet. Pool was clean and heated nicely. Office staff was very friendly. Would stay again. 
19787 3 Great beer selection from a variety of countries - a bit expensive but if you like beer it's a good place! It also feels fairly upscale. 
19788 4 Very good Mexican foods and nice drinks. Service is great and price not expensive. I love grilled chicken and mango frozen margarita. 
19789 4 Awesome service as always! Delicious food!!! Guillermo is the best waiter ever!!! Great drinks and super service!! 
19790 4 My favorite spot in Brookhaven. The sushi is incredible and I have always received excellent service. They have a small patio, sushi bar and a large dining area inside. Try the one Volcano, spicy and the best roll on the menu. 
19791 4 Food was amazing! So amazing it's indescribable! Service was great, not just from our server but from other servers as well! It is a bit pricey but the quality of the food definitely makes up for that. 
19792 2 I go here periodically for beer & a sandwich. This place has better food than Laurelwood Public House, which is right down the street. The service has always been excellent, too. 
19793 0 Nothing either way between harvard and central squares for more than 30 minutes at 2 o'clock on a Friday afternoon? 
19794 4 Easily best taco in Austin. Be patient, it's worth it. The pastor is heaven. For $1.50... TAKE MY MONEY 
19795 0 Worst customer service ever. I was horrified how they treated the gay couple in line next to me. Wouldn't be surprised if they get shut down. The manager was so rude. I would say never eat here. 
19796 3 Had a free coupon. Nice to have the TVs but they had no wait. If you have to wait and don't want to watch TV you have a Walmart to shop in. 
19797 4 Really awesome service and always easy to get an appt. Dr explains everything before doing anything and makes you feel comfortable. 
19798 4 Our sever was Xarumy and me and my best friend ate here today!! Her service and attitude was amazing and we will be back!! 
19799 3 Really exceptional ramen. I got something with delicious pork and fried Veggies. My partner got miso broth and it was perfect for him but a little too strong for me. I love the bone broth they use. Noms. 
19800 2 This place was beautifully decorated. Menu offered lots of options. Food was average but the service was so slow and we waited so long for our food that we all filled up on the yummy chips and salsa. They must be horribly understaffed. 
19801 4 Great food! Everything was fantastic. We had the lamb chops, sliders, and chicken flatbread. Q also was great help with recommendations. Superb service. 
19802 4 amazing food, very creative and interesting dessert!! 
19803 3 Good service. Looks family owned a even better food. looking forward to returning. Besides burger I recommend their pretzel bites and their Amazing beer selection 
19804 0 When you call this place they put you indefinitely on hold. What a service and good luck calling them. I called to inquire about tired fir my car after being in hold for 30 min I had to go. 
19805 3 Perhaps one of the headiest marts in all of Austin. Sandwiches are pretty good if the guys working aren't too stoned. Pretty decent breakfast taco's with some exceptional salsa. Good music usually and an awesome beer selection. 
19806 0 Went into this place with high hopes but walked out feeling I left hooters with c-rated food. Girls with skimpy booty shorts and crawfish that taste like msg was added. Service topped this off cause there was none. Want real cajun food? Not the place to go. 
19807 3 The food is delicious and the braised beef soup is really good. I did take out, however I wanna say that this was the first time I experienced the soup not separated with the noodles. I would recommend to maybe sit at the resturant next time. 
19808 4 LOVE this place! Wonderful, chill vibe. Live jazz 365 days a year. Rebeca is one of the most awesome bartenders ever! Sweet, smart, and hilarious, and she mixes a great Moscow mule! 
19809 0 Only if are purchasing food for a restaurant or to feed a pack of hungry animals in a zoo its worth getting a membership here and shopping here. 
19810 1 Past 2 orders that i've made were screwed up. 7/10 times i've had an issue. I'm all set with ordering delivery from here again. 
19811 3 It's a nice place to eat in the lake area! I enjoyed the JD burger and the curry salad was really good. It's an interesting salad and it's healthy! Ted was a good waiter. Thanks guys! 
19812 4 Love the burger and endless frys !! The strawberry lemonades are to die for ! Great service ! 
19813 1 Ordered the chicken Pad Thai, paid $13.60 for it! Way overpriced. Food was basic, I've had far better tasting Pad Thai for cheaper. Writing this review because I expected more for 13.60$. Honestly it was very underwhelming. 
19814 4 Cool environment, friendly, knowledgeable guy. Extensive juice selection, highly recommend! 
19815 4 I get the seafood and it's great! I literally am so full when I leave I can barely walk! So so good!! 
19816 1 great service and nice ambience. food was terrible and disappointing. 
19817 3 Salad was super fresh, also the pasta tasted fresh cooked not like it had been held it the warmer! 
19818 1 The food is good but the delivery part makes you never want to order again!!! Literally missed the call by a second and the driver left and made me wait another 15 minutes! Over an hour for my food ridiculous 
19819 4 Authentic Irish experience, and the duck couldn't get any better. Good vibes from friendly people in an awesome city. 
19820 4 I would highly suggest The Tin Shed for breakfast or brunch. A super friendly, comfortable atmosphere, excellent home-cooked food, affordable prices, self serve coffee stations around the place. Overall a real winning delight. 
19821 0 Simply awful. The menu is terrible and the food basically comes from a can in the back. Don't eat here. The place smells like a wet ashtray and service is terrible. Simply the worse place I've been to dine in 6 months in Boston. I want my money back 
19822 3 I love you, Donna's Donuts!! I don't eat a lot of donuts, but I do enjoy yours from time to time. Great sandwiches, great coffee! 
19823 4 I've been wanting to try this place for years. I finally went today and I have to admit the food was great. Compared to some of the local places near me. I would go again. 
19824 0 Painfully slow service, numerous menu items not available, left smelling like food... Skip it and go elsewhere. 
19825 4 Very delicious Dosas. Had the Madras Masala Dosa, very good!! 
19826 4 Amazing food.! If you like vegetarian meals I think this is a must try place in Atlanta. 
19827 0 Terrible customer service. Waited for 30 min at the airport for a shuttle. Called company and they hung up on me. Told me they are struggling to be timely because it is raining. Seriously?! Do NOT rent from them!!! 
19828 4 The best oxtails I have ever had. The gravy was otherworldly. Cannot recommend highly enough. 
19829 3 Excellent food, fresh, clean place. The owner is very courteous and helpful. Looks like they will be successful at this location. 
19830 4 I'm obsessed with their Hakata Ramen...broth is beyond flavorful, noodles just cooked right...oh I'm in a happy place :) 
19831 0 Totally gross. Major meat market. Well suited for bad tourists and the worst of the locals. 
19832 4 I've been to many Starbucks drive-thrus and this one is my favorite. The employees are always extra friendly and the line goes so quick! 
19833 4 Ramen noodles sounds like no big deal, but this place is simply the best. If you like noodles than you have to try it out. 
19834 4 This place is phenomenal! I love the live music, food, and not to mention their mason jar drinks! Two thumbs up. 
19835 4 I love these guys, friendly and quick. Having a tostada today - what a great and filling affordable option. I also love the burritos and the fact they have cactus on the menu. What more can you ask for from a food truck. 
19836 0 Ordering on app really sucks It takes too long to process and you end up having to call and order anyways 
19837 3 Fantastic breakfast and service. Period. And the bacon was outstanding. Never had an empty cup of coffee. Friendly staff they're like family. They are over you. JustAn Restaurant.o 
19838 4 My favorite go to place in Marblehead. Great burgers, craft beers on tap, specials and service. 
19839 4 I do lots strength training and heavy lifting and visits to Lisa make a world's difference every time. Very knowledgable and persistent. She uses many different techniques and approaches. The space is very relaxing and her pricing is very reasonable 
19840 3 Stopped for lunch this week and it was delightful. Great service, a very tasty sushi lunch with miso soup. Will definitely go back. Prices were good as well. Little too much TV (2 of them in a small restaurant) but everything else was just fine. 
19841 3 I enjoy Apache. I really like the poetry nights and the food is good. Very talented people perform and it's a nice spot. Kind of makes you feel like you're in the movie, Love jones Lolol 
19842 0 Sadly dissapointed at the lamb shawarma and hummus. They also called a shawarma the same as the gyro. Shawarma was dried and missing the yougurt sauce. Not a good experience. 
19843 1 Salsa and drinks were good. So if you are in the mood for chips and salsa with a drink....this is a good place to go. If you are in the mood for dinner....avoid it. Beef fajitas were terrible. No idea how to describe the taste. Service was fair. Nothing great. 
19844 3 My favorite thing to get here are their pumpkin chocolate chip muffins. When I lived in the area I would go just to get these. Amazing flavor, perfect texture, and moist. (I think they were vegan, but thats besides the point). 
19845 4 FIRST TIME vegan burger eater and will 100% be back this week! WOW! Go eat here and I promise you will not be disappointed!!!! 
19846 4 Love love this place - I especially the Spanish latte and the prosciutto panini, croissant and that wonderful tomato sauce they have on the side to dip sandwiches 
19847 4 My family and I dined at Kaze Shabu Shabu last June 30th after watching "Riverdance" at the Schubert Theatre. Our dining experience was great. For more of my take on Kaze please visit my blog at http://this-side-of-heaven.blogspot.com 
19848 4 This place is awesome I am a big fan of Disney and this definitely helped my trip be way more enjoyable. It's just so much fun!!! 
19849 4 Her at the Orlando Eye. It's raining but the place is still packed. Loads of stuff to do & are here for the entire family. 
19850 4 I love their turkey club and their fries. Not sure that I really get the Latin American theme other than the few tacos on the menu. But the service is excellent and the food always comes out so fast! 
19851 1 The hostess was rude. She wasn't welcoming and gave us an attitude because we requested to sit by the window. Our filet steaks were way over done and dry. Our food was mediocre at its best. My waitress was very kind and attentive but that's about it...don't care to return. 
19852 1 If you're coming from San francisco, you'll be very disappointed. Boba is alright, the tea itself was just blegh. Nice decor though. Mochi was pretty solid, but i came here for the tea 
19853 4 Enjoyed the chillaquiles and abuela tacos. Outdoor seating is plentiful while everyone stares at their phones (hopefully reviewing this place on yelp). They definitely make the tacos fresh as this place tries your patients on waiting for a delicious taco. 
19854 3 City Thai is good! Extra stars for the awesome customer service and delivery. Doesn't disappoint when your craving spicy goodness. We have the pad Thai, chicken yellow curry and pork red curry. 
19855 4 I love Floral Lab. Have gotten arrangements for several different occasions (I work nearby) and they are always beautiful and unique - not the 'typical' 1-800 type of place. Really gorgeous and you do get a nice size of arrangement for the $$. 
19856 4 Great food. Delicious pizzas. Nice atmosphere, decor, and service. One of my favorite restaurants in Boston! 
19857 4 Great experience! I am a brain cancer survivor & going to Wahlburgers was on my bucket list. It did not disappoint! I had the Our Burger (Paul's choice) & sweet potato tots. Both were absolutely delicious! If you get the chance, go here!! 
19858 4 I was lucky and went when the line wasn't extremely long. Only had a 5 minute wait and was offered a sample of truffle fries in line. I ended up ordering the Llano Poblano burger and loved it. Will come back to try the Baby Kale salad. 
19859 4 Great food. Good selections. Best tacos ever. The Cowboy is great, also the Conquistador is tasty. Will definitely come to Tacodeli for my tacos. 
19860 0 Ordered a beef steak that was overcooked and oily. As a Dominican myself, I understand that we eat our steaks well done but this was definitely over cooked. Also, a recent video surfaced on FB showing a rat inside of the establishment. #NeverAgain 
19861 3 I've been coming here since high school and this is definitely our spot to get drinks. Service sometimes takes awhile even during slow hours. Friendly staff. 
19862 4 Excellent airport food option, great soups, sandwiches, mac n cheese and decent prices! Excellent for an airport 
19863 4 My favorite place to go for vegetarian chinese food. Always tastes great and a good deal for the amount of food you get. The owners/staff are friendly and the service is great. I recommend the dumplings and any of the vegan sushi. 
19864 4 Love the food, love the service, love the prices! Service is quick and friendly and every meal I've had tastes fantastic! This place is truly a gem! 
19865 3 Everything is just awesome there. Love all the cakes and especially the matcha frappé. 
19866 4 Amazing food and atmosphere. Quick, casual, and fantastic. The staff was so kind and helpful- stopping by frequently to check on us! I got the cheeseburger and it was beyond amazing. 
19867 4 Hands down one the the best places in Portland. They have opened a bar with beer on tap!! The staff is awesome and supper helpful, and always willing to help. I highly recommend Guardian Games!! 
19868 3 Nice easy location to get to. I like coming here after a trip to the gym. There is ample seating both indoors and out. This location is a bit further away from home but has a large parking lot (vs. the one in Milton). 
19869 3 Like a trip down Memory Lane. Ever now and again you need to stop in and enjoy breakfast at this old school eatery. A terrific place to enjoy eggs, country ham and red eyed gravy with a biscuit. Save room for lemon icebox pie as well! 
19870 4 We were locked out of our condo and they were right on time, professional and a great price. Also didn't wreck the lock in the process which is a bonus. 100% recommend them 
19871 0 beautiful restaurant but did not enjoy my meal. i got the beef carpaccio, beet salad, and lobster roll and everything was under seasoned and did not taste good at all. i expect more from a nice restaurant on park avenue. i will not be going back to blu 
19872 4 If you need a nice Brazilian, LOOK NO FURTHER!! There's no place around here that tops their bikini or brazilians. I highly recommend the hard wax! Groupon always has a great deal on packages as well!! 
19873 4 The best Asian food in ATX! They are always busy so be prepared, but definitely worth the wait! They never disappoint. Love love love 
19874 3 Great prices. Great service. Superb food. Recommend the calzone, chips and dressing, cheesesteaks. 
19875 4 I've been with Dr Rust for a couple months now. He's been great and very friendly. The staff are great and helpful,they work hard and quickly as a team even when it gets a little chaotic.. great place if you have to go.. 
19876 4 Great food at great price. Loved it. We ordered chicken tikka and keema with spicy chicken starters. All was delicious and our hostess (Jessica I guess)was sweet and nice. Totally recommended. 
19877 4 Portobello burger is to die for. Surprising amount of options for veggie-friendly, and all absolutely delicious. Comfortable atmosphere, eating on the deck is the best. 
19878 4 This was my first time getting my nails done and Im so In love with them Definitely gonna be my regular spot. Nails by Noon. 
19879 0 The chocolate cream pie we purchased yesterday was probably the worst tasting sweet I have ever had? The crust was like graham cracker crust and the chocolate cream was sour tasting and very runny, YUK! 
19880 3 My first bar in Austin. Old house converted. Very midtown memphis. Love this place. Lots of hipsters and cool ambience. Wish I was here for a band. 
19881 2 The doughnuts are obviously delicious but the space is way too big and the line is always so long because the cashiers take 20 minutes to fill an order. It's cash only too which is inconvenient as hell and makes no sense in 2016. 
19882 3 Great food, tastes very authentic. Friendly service. Good atmosphere. The pad thai is the best I've ever had. Easily affordable, a group of four people can walk out of there spending just over 10 bucks each and be completely stuffed. 
19883 1 Ramen was not warm, and the servings were so small. The service was horrible, and the egg was cold. They should just stick to the other location, it's great. I'm not sure what happened with this one. 
19884 4 Wonderful place! The food was excellent and the service was fabulous! Vegans and non-Vegans alike will love the atmosphere and delicious foodie-approved fare. Be sure to make it a priority stop! 
19885 4 In North Boulder, it's the best coffee shop. If Emma and Marie are at the counter, you will find sparkle, light, and goodness in your beverage. Great place to listen to your spouse of friend or pull out your laptop and work. 
19886 2 Went for brunch a few months back. The menu had a bunch of interesting choices, though I can't remember what I ended up eating. Thought the place was OK - a little bit more expensive than some of the brunch deals on Tremont and the food wasn't as good. 
19887 2 This cart used to be really good, don't know what happened, it's not as fresh and tasty as it used to be a couple years ago when I first tried it. It's good for a quick fix if you want it fast, sauces are good. 
19888 3 Great variety of hard to find spices. Huge selection of rubs and premixed spice combinations. Friendly service. Convenient location. 
19889 1 Jerk chicken didn't taste authentic. Chicken taco had bone in it. Restaurant is in food court of flea market so don't expect atmosphere. 
19890 4 There are no words. Amazing food, better service, fantastic bartenders....just go when you are in Disney. 
19891 4 Great food... amazing service... get the meat combo for the table, can't go wrong. Love the place. THANK YOU !!! 
19892 3 For a food court this place is decent. Their tofu sub, while not the best I've had, is tasty and tastes healthy too. I have also had their vegetarian spring rolls which are deep fried goodness! 
19893 4 Great spot. Tequila selection was amazing. Have cubano sandwich,it is the best I have ever had. Awesome bartenders 
19894 4 Love this place! Awesome workout, great people. John is really supportive and patient. The hour flies by and I feel more in shape than I have in years! 
19895 4 A++++++ This is like a little vacation every time I get to go here!! Food, ambiance and the people who own this place and work here are awesome Win, win! Go check it out! 
19896 4 The mango smoothie was really good! They even gave me the extra! This is the first smoothie place I've tried here in MA. 
19897 1 Not the best place when it comes for Latin music. The food is amazing staff is great but the salsa is not good. Go to Havana club is a better atmosphere 
19898 4 I've come to this little breakfast place a few times and it has never failed me !!! I absolutely love their pancakes and service is always wonderful-I highly recommend if you are in the area to stop by uncle Charlie's :) 
19899 4 Best Thai in Portland, and I am picky with my Thai food. Pad Thai is not fishy, stir fry's are full of veggies. Go here as often as I can. 
19900 2 It's on a corner, is rather small and friendly (and thereby cozy), and the eggs Benedict were B+. Plus you can learn Portuguese while you eat! Nothing amazing foodwise, but I really liked the feel of the place. 
19901 3 Ate here last night based on recommendation from friend. Order the Oaxaca burger and the heirloom tomato salad. Both were enjoyable and I like the portions. The burgers are not huge, so depending on appetite you may want a second. Agree with other Yelper reviews. 
19902 4 This place is a great alternative for quick lunch. They do not have your typical sandwiches, so do not expect the usual. They have portobello sandwich which is awesome, and I do not know of another place making a similar one. (It comes with caramelized onions, parmesan flakes, tomatoes, greens.) 
19903 4 Excellent dive bar. "Small town" feel. Friendly service and fun place to enjoy a brew. I plan to come back! 
19904 3 This is one of my favorite place to eat Mexican food in Austin. It is an Austin icon. It's been here for years. Give it a try. 
19905 4 I've been getting my lashes done here for about 6 months now. She does an amazing job. I always get tons of compliments. 
19906 1 Great selection of health-food meal replacement bars. Something seemed to change some time ago and the cleanliness and image dropped off. 
19907 4 Oh. My. Glob. These Donuts are delicious. You can tell how fresh they are, moist not squishy, light and fluffy. Perfect texture and not too sugary-sweet. Amazeing. The heath bar and raspberry filled are my favorite! 
19908 2 Love the huge private rooms to talk and work. Girl behind counter had an attitude w me when I asked if she had sugar free...atmosphere is great... coffee is okay... fast service, at least... 
19909 4 I've always had great service from Nikon. Sadly this location no longer does repairs - all go through the Toronto / Mississauga office now. 
19910 0 I was surprised that I didn't get the 7% cash back as promoted here. I used the same credit card that worked for others locations. I guess Sage doesn't offer it anymore but haven't updated Yelp. 
19911 4 For a brewery, their menu is fantastic. The problem is you don't know what to order because they have so many great options! 
19912 4 We've been here a few times now. I love to no-meato burrito with a side of their jalapeño ranch. Not your typical veggie burrito, much better flavor, not just rice and beans. My husband has tried a few different burritos and been happy each time. 
19913 4 One of my favourite places to eat when on holiday in America. Love the food here, especially the desserts! Staff were very helpful. 
19914 4 Service rules, the bourbon pecan bread pudding rules, the coffee rules. Kim was eager to help and easy to talk with. I definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a midafternoon pick up. 
19915 4 Fantastic Beet Loaf! Like other sweetbreads (zucchini, pumpkin, banana), but pink and not too sweet. The coffee was good, the service was good and the ambiance was great. And its Native owned, so its nice to have some "culture" that isn't misappropriated. 
19916 4 Adore the entire staff. They are so kind to our companions and keep us on budget Thanks! 
19917 3 Worth the trip best Cuban sandwich in Atlanta. The food is very good the place need updating but not necessary since all the Spanish places tend to look the same. Definitely will be back again and again. 
19918 4 After a motorcycle wreck this place has treated me right and helps me to function better in my everyday life. Excellent pain management facility. Dr. Shockett is great. 
19919 4 I had the most magical birthday here! It feels like eating at your extended family's house - good food and kind people!! Amazing. 
19920 1 The food was delicious and I ordered here several times. However, today I found several strands of hair in my pad see ew. I am very disappointed since the food was so good. 
19921 4 Dope spot! Games are in great condition. Great cocktail options. Craft beer available. Real chill place for any day of the week. 
19922 4 I love Teddy's this is a good old fashioned diner where you can get real food for a good price. The staff is always wonderful and there is usually a wait for a table. But they move quickly. 
19923 4 Loved being able to get real tapas Spanish style. From the croquetas, octopus, omelette, Iberian ham! Heaven. 
19924 3 Slow service at times- but really good frozen yogurt. I'm personally a fan of white chocolate and oreo. It has outdoor seating too which is fun in the summer. They deliver as well. It's open late. 
19925 4 Lovely restaurant and friendly service. My friend and I were just looking for a light meal and a glass of wine. We split a pizza and were quite content. I will be back one day soon to try some of the other interesting menu items. 
19926 3 Just had beef bulgogi meal during my lunch break and it tasted very good. Giving four stars because there are not too many choices but overall very happy with the food and the service. 
19927 0 Hate to write a bad review, but this isn't a great restaurant. Food is so-so. 
19928 3 This is a great place, great food, awesome service, and Frantastic prices. 
19929 4 John L. Loved your comment about the Max from SBTB. Totally accurate and spot on. I stumbled into the Garage on accident while in Cambridge and fell in love with Newb comics. Haven't tried the food yet, the Newb employees said "go to Pinochios"... I did.... it was great. 
19930 3 Definitely an all around great little stay for the price. I recommend saving your money and staying here. It's merely like a regular hotel room, bur is definitely all we need since we are rarely in the room to begin with. 
19931 2 The service was fast, waiter and staff were nice. I feel the pasta was over priced. The flavor was good. 
19932 4 Burritos are so delicious here! I always got a steak, with my preferred toppings, and grilled. I frequently get a craving for a Bell Street Burrito. 
19933 3 Pretty cool casino and the only poker room with limit hold em in lower British Columbia. The poker room has 4/8 limit and no limit games. There are blackjack tables and slot machines. They give good conversion rates on foreign currency as well, 
19934 1 The food was disappointing and the portion sizes were tiny in our takeout order. Given the mediocre quality and cost ($35 for two pasta dishes and a side salad), we will not be repeat customers. 
19935 3 Casual, dive-y atmosphere and cheap food/beer. Shared a pitcher of Yuengling and a fresh order of tater tots on the outdoor patio (the inside has a strong smokey stench). Left happy without the usual dent in the wallet. 
19936 4 Got the gluten-free brownie and gluten-free chocolate chip cookies and they were amazing!! Honestly, better than any regular chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. Will definitely be going back for more! 
19937 0 Please do NOT go here! It is literally the worst food in Boulder. We paid a crazy amount for this extremely lacking meal. Not ok...beware! 
19938 0 This place is nice enough to live, but watch out when you move out; they definitely will take advantage of you and charge ridiculous move-out/damage charges. I would stay away from this place. 
19939 4 AMAZING!!! The best brunch I have ever had. The grits and bloody Bart are are must try! 
19940 4 Just finished up trivia night- what a blast! Questions were challenging, but understandable to anyone. The staff, drinks, and food were all wonderful. Definitely coming back! 
19941 2 Great food, service is lacking. Staff seems disorganized and and not helpful. 
19942 4 Judith gave us excellent service and the food was great as it always is at Burger Fi, if you go make sure to try their Cajun fries ! 
19943 4 Such a great place to check out in Harvard Square, i great place for kids and a neat place for adults. Who cares if you're 40, it's definitely a place to check out while around the area. 
19944 3 Dog lovers paradise! Great selection and the owner is so chatty and helpful. Lexi dog and I will be back. 
19945 2 Had a couple hours to kill before a flight. Wanted a nice sit down restaurant for breakfast. The food was great, but the service was really slow, especially for not being busy. David was a nice server, but I had to keep asking about filling my coffee. 
19946 3 Loved it. Nice local place for me. The food was really good and service was great. Will come again! 
19947 4 This place has the best bubble teas. You can say less ice, 50/80% sweetness and they make it perfectly the way you want it! I love their Jasmine Green milk tea and their Thai Ice tea. 
19948 4 I went to summer camp and the cook there was really bad and when he made fried chicken it was all raw and stuff. So I probably wont come to your restaurant because I'm scared for life although I'm sure your fried chicken is much better. 
19949 3 Skip the menu and order the lasagna pizza. Out of this world. Also it's better to order a whole pie than individual slices. More cost effective and they won't tell you to just get the whole pie when you are drunk and ordering 4 slices to yourself lol. 
19950 2 Good food, service not so good we've felt rushed a couple of times with the check and couldnt enjoy more time at the place. 
19951 4 This is my second time at birds but the first time getting a drastic change. I saw Jualdo today to get bangs and he did a fantastic job! I asked for longish, wispy bangs and he did just that in under 10 minutes for only $10! Very happy 
19952 4 Great local sports bar!! HANDS DOWN BEST STEAK TIPS IVE EVER HAD! highly recommend them great for lunch if your in the area or take some friends out for dinner. Either ,or...this is a great place to eat!!! 
19953 1 Ordered take out here and was not super impressed with the pizza...Maybe it tastes better when eaten on the spot? Overall it was a disappointing expensive pizza. Did not think it was worth the money. 
19954 4 Awesome brewery. Everything I look for: Yummy beer, nice staff, and great atmosphere. This will likely become a go to for us! 
19955 2 Good place for a healthy and fast sandwich during the week. Staff is friendly and quick. The salads are big enough to share. Hot subs and Cheesesteaks are darn tasty. 
19956 4 Dr. Paolucci and Michelle are awesome! I had a lot of dental work done here and despite Metlife not being a preferred insurance provider, I continue to come here. Very personable staff that takes their time getting to know their patients and ensuring everyone is a satisfied customer. 
19957 0 If you like Styrofoam, and cheap, overcooked vegetables, this place is for you. At five dollars for a vegetable plate with drink and bread and taxes, the price is pretty good, and the servings were generous. However, the quality was at the bottom of the barrel. 
19958 4 Best liquor store in Smyrna! Huge selection, great staff. I have a liquor store across the street from my home but I drive here instead! 
19959 4 Very affordable and yummy. This is my new go-to pizza place. The delivery is always fast and the guy is always super nice. 
19960 4 My wife and I came here to listen to a little jazz before going back to our hotel. The music and the ambience are great. If you are ever in Austin, check this place out. 
19961 0 Yelp said they were open, but they were completely closed. No sign at the door to why they were closed during the time that the business hours stated at the door was open... not good for business 
19962 0 After they replaced my front breaks they lost the rim key. 18,000 miles later I need all new break pads and rotors. My new shop was shocked at what an awful job was performed. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!! 
19963 2 It's true they give you huge amount of food, but it was just too spicy for our palate, even at "mild" level. Unless you like super spicy, be forewarned! 
19964 2 I got 2 burgers for $3.19 using the survey coupon. Its a hamburger. Although I have noticed that prices are creeping up then they used to before. I don;t like bullied into ordering cheese. Other than that. Its a good quick stop place to get some food. 
19965 3 Bacco is a great spot. The food is good, love the open windows and the drinks were decently priced. Will definitely go back. 
19966 3 Very delicious food, reasonable prices, good potion sizes and efficient service. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Austin. The corn bread before the meal arrives is such a great touch and absolutely delicious. It's hard not to fill up on them before the food arrives. 
19967 3 Delicious beers tucked away in an office park. If you're missing Avery in their old location, wander over to Wild Woods just down the street and you won't be disappointed. The space is small but I can imagine that the outside space will be wonderful upon better weather! Drink up! 
19968 4 Eggs over roasted asparagus. Oh my god I would have licked the plate if I could. SO GOOD. 
19969 3 Super nice place and great friendly service. Cappuccino was well made and in a real cup not paper. Good atmosphere and plenty of seating. Nice windows to sit and people watch. Most of all the coffee was good and you can tell the barista takes it serious. 
19970 4 Had a breakfast burrito, yum. Added a bowl of fresh fruit, extra yum! Clean and friendly. We'll be back. 
19971 4 Best burgers/fries in Austin. Sassy sauce is off the chain. Keep up the great food and service. 
19972 3 Ambiance is fantastic, TONS of tea options. Sitting in the little train seats is so much fun. Great spot to go alone or with friends. 
19973 3 The shrimp and grits were good, and so was the fried green tomato they served with it! The southwest burger was very good! I'd come back! : ) 
19974 3 Very good pizza, online ordering and delayed delivery worked great. It was hot but not real hot. All in all great pizza! 
19975 3 Had the Eggs Benedict today it was so very good. Wonderful flavor, the only reason they don't get five stars is because the wait for food was long. At one point the chef had 10 tickets going at once. I will be back. 
19976 0 I cannot understand why an Employment Agency like PSG would advertise so many jobs and when you do an application on line you never hear back from them. They don't return e-mail's or phone calls. What seems to be their problem. They are in the wrong business!!. 
19977 3 I love the Sunday Jazz Brunch here (good music + good food = awesome). I've only attended a couple evening shows, but it works nicely as a small music venue. The trivia nights here are good, but they get very crowded and tend to go late. 
19978 0 I'm writing this as I lay in this bed unable to sleep due to the smell. It's dirty shoes on! I've got the window wide open ac on high. It's bad. It's also creepy it does not feel safe. Checking out early. 
19979 3 Awesome sandwich joint with friendly staff. Love that they've got plenty of options to choose from. Wish they had more seats but overall, a cool lil spot. 
19980 4 We love Bob's. The food & the service is great! Been probably 20-30 times and NEVER disappointed. Great subs. Great deli. Fair prices. 
19981 4 Phenomenal German cuisine! Best German food in central Florida hands down. Try the German potato salad. You will not regret it. 
19982 4 Beer, good vibe and great food!!! Best grilled cheese I've ever had! The service is good and Matt treats you like family. 
19983 4 The most authentic Italian pizza I've had in the states. If you love real Italian food (not Italian-American), you will not be disappointed! 
19984 3 Great place to sit and study or work or hang out with friends! Seating upstairs and downstairs! Delicious pastries and Tacodeli tacos! Great coffee - in particular, I love their cappuccino and cortado! Very modern and sleek interior! On Congress, so good luck parking! 
19985 3 Very good food, very good service, very cute outside and nice inside. I really liked this place for a more upscale lunch experience! 
19986 4 This is one great chalupa! I grew up in south Texas and know a good chalupa, these are amazing. Love the staff & great hospitality. 
19987 4 Currently my favorite Portland brewery. All beers are fantastic, especially their IPA. The brewery is great to visit, especially when you can sit outside in the summer. A little more cozy inside in the winter, but still a good place to stop in for an inexpensive pint. 
19988 3 Convenient location near the lake. Friendly service. This is a local favorite. It's a nice place to for a quick one on one meeting or to break out the laptop and get a little work done while out in the field. 
19989 0 Although we had a decent dine in, the food was not great. Customer service was slow and we waited almost 40 minutes for our two Chimichangas. Definitely won't be coming back. 
19990 3 this is for the food cart on Yamhill and 5th. Great soups, friendly dude. Mostly began sandwiches which are small and tiny, but the soups are top notch. Mushroom barley soup is so good. Delicious food, fair prices for downtown carts. Recommended for their different the usual offerings. 
19991 4 Delicious. Would never have found this place if it wasn't for yelp. The food here was amazing, a definite must try if you're in the area. 
19992 2 Decided to try this place for lunch since we were near. They had a mini buffet for appetizers which was cool & the lunch portions were a good size. The dishes weren't super amazing but they were decent. I'd come back 
19993 3 The food was Delicious!! Only only complaint is that the Monday Special which was meatloaf was done by 4:30pm. So I was unable to get 2 dinners for myself and my guest. If the restaurant closes at 7pm, why not have enough to cover the dinner diner's. 
19994 4 truly a wet place!! got the best rides shows and fish ever it will keep the family entertained you can even touch manta rays and dolphins. it is the best place ever... well everything at orlando is Video link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hje2uYLHBAE 
19995 4 This is a casual to upscale restaurant and bar. Gorgeous views, inside and outside dining. I had the Fish and chips..delightful. Full bar& nice local pinot noir served here. 
19996 4 Amazing service. George does an excellent job of explaining what is wrong and what is needed and works very hard making sure you are happy. I keep coming back! Excellent place. 
19997 4 Yeah, Gave it another try and had much better service and of course best dam Buffalo Pizza around..hands down!!!! 
19998 2 Ok food and atmosphere. Had to order simple syrup to my cocktail since it was unexpectedly bitter. Had a Caesar salad, asparagus ravioli and tiramisu...nothing was memorable. I had heard this was the best Italian in Columbus but Brio or Olive Garden have better flavor profiles in my opinion. 
19999 4 I've had a DermaQuest chemical peel, hair coloring services and a Guinot hydraclean facial done at rouge and I don't have enough words to explain what a wonderful experience it was. I would recommend all of their services and products to everyone. You will love it too! 
20000 4 I have been to this restaurant a couple times. The Salmon was amazingly flavorful and cooked just right. The NY Steak was good as well. Their service was efficient both times. 
20001 4 Went here for a birthday celebration. Birthday girl got her dinner free. All menu items delicious and service is the best. Always try the specials - they are great. 
20002 3 Totally decent Indian food. Ordered the old standby Chicken Tikka Masala and was not disappointed :) 
20003 4 Great Chinese Food! I had House Special Fried Rice! It was great. The portion was big, good customer service. I also got the chinese herbal tea. It was delicious! 
20004 3 I really like this gym. The staff is friendly, everything is clean. I took one star off because of the endless phone calls to sign you up, but you can as well do yourself a favor and sign up=) 
20005 4 This location is awesome. Their staff is always friendly and provides excellent customer service! 
20006 4 Love the food!! Reminds me of Chicago. Unlike the other imitators. Deep dish pizza, Italian beef and the tamales taste so authentic!!!! Call in your deep dish pizza a half hour before you get there whether you done in or out. 
20007 3 Pretty routine hotel , clean and efficient. Lobby bar, though, is way overpriced. Bright spot is bkfst hostess Alyssa. Bright, cheerful and eager to help make early morning more enjoyable. Great job Alyssa! 
20008 4 Best pasta in the city!!!! Love their pizza as well. Specials are always interesting and unique. Highly recommend!!! Wish there was one on the east side of the city. 
20009 4 It was great good service ole ty if good had leftovers great flavor more than enough never had so much before I had the trio and desert was good 
20010 4 Wonderful experience. Went there for brunch and really enjoyed their tasty pancakes, egg benedict and toad in the hole. Recommend the last one to everyone. 
20011 4 Oishii is all we have to say. Picture worth a thousand words. LOL Tsukiji market fish outstanding. 
20012 4 Phenomenal vet and staff. Both were accommodating when my cat and dog were sick. 
20013 4 Love this place. I always order the beef Sharma rice plate! So much food for a great price. It comes with sliced beef over spiced Basmati rice and a side salad. 
20014 3 Seriously one of my favorite happy hour spots in Boulder! The only downside is they don't rotate the happy hour menu (why it's not five stars). Mussels and Frites with a glass of wine is the way to go! 
20015 3 Great atmosphere, its right on Lake Eola. The service can be kind of slow, but the staff are friendly. The food is yummy. My personal favorite is the spinach dip. 
20016 4 Great keratin treatment! Makes doing my hair in morning so much easier. Now on my third visit. 
20017 4 I love it every time here. Chef David is the absolute best! Yellowtail shots, Omakase sashimi, Chanel Replica Roll, any Uni dish, Matcha Brûlée..etc etc. I could go on. I've been several times and I always leave super happy and satisfied. Writing about it makes me want to go back... 
20018 4 I'm really glad this is my neighborhood bar, great burgers, good cheap beer. 
20019 0 Went by today and place is closed permanently. No forwarding sign in window. Phone out of service 
20020 2 Better than you might think. Has a cool, fun crowd sometimes. Don't order food. Simple yet useful tip. Can be dull and lifeless but can also be friendly and decent. It's the rooftop that isn't The Ranch. That place is raw awful. 
20021 4 This is 100% the best steakhouse that we've been to from cocoa to titusville! Nick, our waiter, was amazing and on point the whole time! 10/10 great experience. Also, order a martini or old fashioned because they're excellent 
20022 4 Great service, beautiful place and the food was amazing. Went for magical dining September 2018. Tried pretty much the entire magical dining (limited) menu... it was so good! Oh... and the drinks were awesome too. 
20023 4 Very good massage today! Jonathon listened and was very intuitive as well. I had exactly what I needed- a therapeutic deep tissue massage, with focus on my tight spots and knots. I have already booked my next appointment! 
20024 4 I've eaten the turkey burger , regular beef burger and the vegetarian burger. All 3 have been the best burgers I've eaten in Atlanta! 
20025 4 My new favorite Ethiopian with the right price I could eat here every day, delicious and service with a smile. Plus it's right across from campus. 
20026 4 A must see... Great beer, great food, unique eclectic, place. Tent outside is where our party of 14 sat. Good quick service, heaters kept us plenty warm. Pumpkin Ale good, IPA very good, stout was very good as well. Also enjoyed the outdoor fire. 
20027 2 The food was excellent but there was no apology or even acknowledgement that we had to wait half an hour past our reservation time. Service was ok but not great. 
20028 0 There is no way to give zero star. This is the third time they have given us chicken irrespective of us identifying as vegetarians. Service at its worse! 
20029 4 The food is consistently good. I love having this option on this side of town.pmjpg Pj 
20030 0 The unprofessional & loudest staff I've ever encountered at a Starbucks. I am from Philadelphia & needed to get some work done while on vacation with this staff it was impossible. Positive the drinks were great. 
20031 3 Not the best thrift shop in town but definitely considered a hidden gem. I found great stuff here for half the price. 
20032 3 A cute little eatery , the food selection is good and tastes awesome! They have a small menu that's exotic and adventurous and always makes for a fun dining experience. The drink I had wasn't that good however and that's the only reason it's getting a 4 
20033 4 Love this place. It's old school Austin with creative food and original cocktails. Parking can be a challenge as can getting in so be sure to reserve in advance. The decor is vintage and location off of West 6th is easy to make a night from there. 
20034 4 Everything on the menu is incredible. Try the Pork Belly Bun. you won't be disappointed! 
20035 4 Delicious albeit unhealthy so be sure to come on your cheat day. Worth the inevitable wait. Bring your appetite as portions are massive. 
20036 4 The food here is amazing. The lines can get long, but that is to be expected. Plan accordingly. 
20037 3 Solid place to eat if you're looking for some good Spanish food near Disney! Have stopped in several times with my family have yet to be disappointed 
20038 2 It's a train station, pretty clean, I liked going through here. 
20039 4 Staff was very friendly and informative. Clean store and good prices on good refurbished comps. I am very happy with my purchase and my experience. Thanks Matt B. and crew. 
20040 3 Have gone here twice, once dined in and once outside. Both times impressed by attentive wait staff. Food is good and fresh. Highly recommend the cheese plate and lighter fair for dinner. One star removed because the cocktails weren't my favorite. 
20041 4 They are HONEST, NICE, they reccomend, not "you have to", KNOWLEDGEABLE, best of all....Jake repaired my Oldsmobile Omega, afterward I asked questions...he answered them without hesitation and without my feeling that I got " ripped off. I shall return with wife's car! 
20042 3 Got the poutine with braised beef. I imagined the beef would not have been ground beef like hamburger style, but it was still very good. Could definitely have used more cheese, but I really loved it! 
20043 3 Overall a nice hotel. Rooms were very spacious with a full kitchen. The staff was nice and they will drive you to somewhere you need to go. I would say it could be a bit closer to outside businesses though that would have given it 5 stars. 
20044 3 yes it's in a busy food court (that's the downside) however GREAT lobster roll and GREAT chowder! 
20045 4 I had surgery there on 9/11/12 and, other than a bad IV person, had an excellent experience. The nurses on the 15A floor were exceptional. The food is good. I have no complaints. 
20046 4 Visited based on Yelp reviews. GREAT flavorful food. Hot link chili dog (with steak chili) was awesome! Check it out. 
20047 0 I really tried delivery again and it has been an hour and 15 minutes I will not be ordering again no matter how much I like the food not worth the wait 
20048 0 These people are extremely cheap and didn't deliver what I ordered via Teleflora. Consider me an experienced buyer who only wants the best for the people I send flowers too & I will never order from here nor Teleflora again. 
20049 3 Not the most amazing food or atmosphere, but it's consistently good and has great happy hour prices. It's definitely in our weeknight dinner rotation. 
20050 3 Had a burger here before the snow storm... man oh man I was surprised it was really yummy and the bartender was assume 
20051 4 Perfect. Close to convention centers, but much better and more affordable than hotel food. Classic decor, tasty menu, and lots of variety. We will likely return before we leave the conference. 
20052 3 Food was so so, but very fast! Best thing is they have ORGANIC chicken so my little can eat and I can be at ease! 
20053 3 We enjoyed the entire meal. The hummus platter was fresh and delicious. Our burgers were excellent. The chicken tortilla soup was very fresh and tasty. We will be back again. The okra and pickles are pickled daily in house and you can tell by the taste! 
20054 4 What a fabulous find! We had a five star meal at the airport! I still cannot believe it. Seared scallops, goat cheese, pear and bacon salad, and swordfish. Just delightful. We will definitely be back! 
20055 3 The food and beer are good. The food is much better than a typical brewery. My main reason for knocking it down a star is because it's a bit over-priced. 
20056 3 Excellent patio with waterfront views. Great spot for drinks, vibrant staff, well priced for this location. Overall clean restaurant with good service. 
20057 0 Not satisfied with the light skinned Hispanic gentleman working here. He is obviously sick and coughing all over the place without covering his mouth. He is going to get other customers sick if he hasn't already. Jesus Christ. Someone report him to McDonald corporate. 
20058 4 The best kabobs in town, perfect mixture of heat, warmth, and cold veggies on a hot day, We will continue to come back and eat here again and again and again. We love the food truck place on Riverside! 
20059 3 Everything was very tasty. Wings were crispy and delicious. Good place to order a bunch of different items and share. Kids liked the finger food. Only complaint was that the heating wasn't adequate for the coldest day of the year. 
20060 4 Had to try this local icon. Delicious breakfast for us all. Great ambiance will definitely come here again. 
20061 4 The service was excellent and the chicken patacon (with spicy cilantro) was outstanding. We also enjoyed the vegetarian corn cake and vegetarian patacon and shrimp tacos. We will definitely return! 
20062 4 Great food and good experience. Worthy of trying more times and first time for everyone! Beautiful plated flood and tasted great! 
20063 3 I bought some pre-marinated cuts which saved the day, actually it saved the party and my lunch since I am on a GF cleanse at the moment hard core, no carbs. $$$, however, decent quality. Customer service was awesome. 
20064 0 A/C broken but the food is ok one of the ppl working there told me the air was broken for almost 2 weeks I will not go back into the A/c is fix this is not a 3rd world country if so can I get third world prices 
20065 4 I eat here all the time and it's always fantastic! The Goan fish curry, the momos, the chole bhatura and the house fried rice are excellent. Friendly service and great location too. 
20066 4 Wine list is great, great choices at a reasonable value. Inside has a cool decor. Food is really good. Hope the best for them! 
20067 4 THEY HAVE A FULL BAR. Nuff said. At the soda fountain you have the option to add different flavors to your soda like lemon, chocolate and cherry. This must be a mid-west thing because we have nothing like that in California. 
20068 0 I was a fan of Sam Adams, I always drank their beer and have done the tour! I will probably boycott now because of the recent news of St Patricks parade! 
20069 4 SO SO SO SO GOOD. the bread was toasty, the cheese was oozy, and the meal was filling. I built my own sandwich with the Easy Tiger sourdough, aged cheddar, manchego, and basil pesto. It was so yummy and perfect on a day walking around South Congress. Definitely go!!!! 
20070 2 Good pizza. The combination was full of meat and very filling. We ordered to go so I'm not sure what the vibe is like when dining in but I imagine it could get pretty busy with Birthday parties due to the pirate themes and arcade. 
20071 4 Best Customer Service I have ever had!!! From my departure to my return, the shuttle was on time and fast. Made my travel a pleasure, down to the ice cold water they handed me during check out.... 
20072 4 The food and service were fantastic! The scallops were super fresh and well worth the price. The crispy duck leg was a tad dry but flavorful. Overall, this place is worth the positive reviews! 
20073 3 This place rocks! Everything is made from scratch. They have roasted jalapeños by the salsa and sauces. The prices were excellent. Half-price chimichangas and burritos on Thursday. 
20074 1 Haven't been to the Portland one. Doughnuts are solid, but our cashier, Zenyth, was rude. Instead of being helpful with picking out a doughnut, she rolled her eyes while I was trying to decide on which one to get. Horrible attitude and customer service. 
20075 4 Went in to buy a flask. I looked at the price with raised eye brows. Guy at the cash register noticed and said, "I'll give you a discount". Yeah, man. That's how you take care of a customer! 
20076 4 Very friendly staff. Provided great service. The pasta was made from scratch with fresh ingredients. Authentic and very delicious. 
20077 0 Their service sucks. Long lines & not enough staff. The guy that was in back of me had a reservation and when he went up to the counter, they told him they didn't have any cars available. 
20078 3 Great tasting burgers! I just wished they would include fries/salads in the price of the burger. 
20079 0 Cosigning on how gross the pad thai is here. Soooo dry and flavorless :/ 
20080 2 This is usually my favorite place to come but the wait this time was fucking ridiculous. Some ladies who came and say themself got waited on and acknowledged before we did after sitting there for a good 20 minutes so we got up and left. Annoying 
20081 4 WHY DID YOU CLOSE?!? My ALL TIME favorite Thai in boulder. So sad to see them gone. Someone please tell me Naraya just found a new location and didn't leave me forever! :( 
20082 4 Absolutely delicious food! Lots of variety. The staff is friendly and talkative. Plenty of seating and the decoration is very appealing. Love this place! 
20083 4 Chicken batter has an added spice to give it a little kick. The meat is soooo tender and not greasy. The seasoned fries are soft in the middle. The mac n cheese had a perfect blend of cheeses and sauces. Loved the place. 
20084 4 This place is so cute and quaint. Such a variety of great quality items at reasonable prices. Every time you feel like you're in a new store for the first time because of the constant replenishment of inventory. Fascinating little gem of a place! 
20085 4 The salsa, the Mexican coffee, the service, the food... all exceptional. It could use some padded chairs though. Thank you for the lovely meal. 
20086 2 Not going to lie..kinda felt sick after. While i was eating my veggie taco, it was great. I was the only one in my group who felt gross after so it may just be my sensitive tummy. 
20087 3 Good place. I liked the service and the soda machines were greT. I love getting the kids meal. The only Brussels sprouts i like are carmalized. 
20088 2 Good not great... Typical Orlando higher end chain restaurant. General lack of attention to details. 
20089 0 Claim to be a great place. it's a walk up over priced wast e of time. 
20090 4 Favorite pawn shop in town. I bought my Tele from them and they worked with me on the price. The people are really friendly and helpful and I had a great experience overall. Great finds, great times. 
20091 4 Some of the best eggs Benedict ever! And I know, trust me. Long wait on a Sunday afternoon (obviously), but amazing and super quick service! 
20092 4 Very good, fresh food. Small place but it seems very clean. The food seems very authentic. 
20093 4 This place was exactly what I was looking for today. Fresh, great tasting Mexican food, at a fair price. The avocado salsa was excellent, and the menu was nice and simple. I'll usually choose Mexican food over any other, and I'm glad I chose this place today! 
20094 2 I had the crab burger and my husband had the wings. The food was amazing. The service was not great. They were busy and Leon seemed uber annoyed. It was just a whole weird thing with servers that overshadowed how good the food was. 
20095 3 Lovely. Liked it so much the first time, we went back two nights later. Good food, cozy, friendly. 
20096 3 Came here for lunch during work. Great place for a relax lunch, very quiet but fast service. Waitress was very kind and the food was good. 
20097 1 How can a Panera run out of bagels at 8:30 am on a Tuesday? Excuse, bagel Tuesday.....ok, it's called demand planning. 3rd time I had disappointment at a Panera in as many weeks. 
20098 3 Tried sachet cake, double backed almond croissant and hot chocolate. Nothing worth mentioning about the cake. Hot chocolate is really hot chocolate. So dense I am really a fan of chocolate. So won't say I like it. The croissant is superb. Might come back for this. 
20099 4 The family really enjoyed the artichoke and chips which was our favorite part of the meal. The fries were delightful too. The chicken tenders were delicious. Lemon Greek grill chicken was tasty, but the rice grains were too hard for human digestion. Overall, we will be back. 
20100 0 A revoir!!!!! Déconseillé hygiène litigieuse et gout déplorable!!!!!!! Je me faisais une joie de goûter le fameux burgerking au états unies!!!!!!!! 
20101 3 Delicious food, amazing vibe and decoration, really recommend this place, specially for lunch! 
20102 2 I would be only giving two stars but gave an extra star because attendants on non stop flight to Orlando were awesome. Nice, personable and entertaining. However staff at Orlando airport ticketing are rude rude rude. 
20103 4 I don't think that we will ever receive such kind treatment anywhere else. The best customer service ever. They notice that we are vegetarian so they make sure that they use different clean oven to cook our food separately. Speechless 
20104 4 I have tried many Thai pleases in the area but this is my favorite. I especially like the lunch menu because you get the salads bar included. The food is well prepared and delicious. 
20105 4 In about 30 minutes, they took my wife's hilariously broken iPhone (the screen was totally shattered to the point that the glass was beginning to pop off) and fixed it perfectly. Fast, friendly and highly competent--what more can you ask for? 
20106 2 Cute place ..slow service but really good food with friendly staff! 
20107 2 The coffee was good but food was average, reheated food stuff. They didn't seem to have a kitchen so relied on a toaster oven to heat up the precooked potatoes. It was decent enough for the price but I won't be rushing back any time soon. 
20108 4 Reviews were dead on for this restaurant! The flavors were amazing, fresh & tasty. Our family had dos tacos, California burrito, and dos tacos supreme with shredded chicken. Great atmosphere, excellent service, reasonable prices! Forget the chain restaurants!! 
20109 4 I love this place. I have never tasted pizza anywhere else like it. The staff is all family and super friendly. Pretty cheap too. 
20110 2 Good food & service, large bar & parking (which is difficult to find in South Boston). I enjoy coming here to dine with friends in the area. Lots of choices for appetizers & main entrees. Something for everyone. 
20111 1 What, you guys discontinued the double fudge cookie dough blizzard. Thats all my kids ever want 
20112 4 Literally the best place for smoothies!! Not overpriced and so delicious! The service is always wonderful. I wish i had a JC Smoothies closer to home but it's well worth the 30 min drive. Thank you! 
20113 3 What a great little find. Nice little space. We went for lunch. Definitely try the pork ribs as an appetizer. They were amazing! Food was great, service was great, excellent lunch special! 
20114 4 Thank you for your excellent customer service. I had two family photos framed at my last minute. The frames are beautiful!! Will come back again in the near future. 
20115 4 Kick Drum Burgers are the absolute best. All natural ingredients and housemade sauces top off fresh beef on a eggy brioche bun. They are delicious! 
20116 2 I ate at the sushi bar. I had sashimi which was definitely okay. The service was also okay hence the three stars. Would not come except late night arrival at the hotel. Convenient and price not crucial. Supermarket sushi at restaurant prices. 
20117 4 Alli B is awesome - she had to fix my hair from a bad highlight touchup, I came in orange and uneven. She did amazing work, my hair looks awesome - the ambiance is great, customer service is great, I will definitely be back - highly recommend Alli! 
20118 4 Chicken tamales, punuchos, tacos. All amazing and well priced! I'm here several nights a week for dinner 
20119 4 Great classes and instructors. It is a judgment free environment to get your fittest and enjoy your workout. There is everything to chose from ranging from traditional cardio, to strength, to pole, silks, hoops. The staff is friendly and energetic and is always there for you. Thank you, Foxy Fitness. 
20120 4 4.5 stars absolutely delicious and unique pizza, and pretty adequate pricing they serve RC Cola which is pretty rad too 
20121 4 this team is incredible; i have used them twice and Meire responded immediately to my requests, made herself available quickly, and the team did a really thorough job, and quickly. My house smells incredible! I highly recommend them to anyone i know and to the general public. the best!! 
20122 3 Bulk local hazelnut milk and almond milk! Woo hoo! This grocery has many items that I haven't seen at other local co-ops or at New Season's plus the staff is friendly and helpful. 
20123 2 Good hangover helper. Any of the tortas are very good and you can make your self at home at the salsa bar. 
20124 4 I love the outdoor seating area here and the food is great. I always order their hamburger and it is massive! Great amount of food for the price. They also have a pretty good draft beer selection! 
20125 4 Best Swedish Pancakes in town..Delish.. I've tried other breakfast items there and was unimpressed...But I will always get the Swedish Pancakes!!! 
20126 4 Soooo good. Had the queso fundido and tacos de carnitas. Both were excellent. Both types of salsa they serve are wonderful. Parking behind the building. Will definitely be back. 
20127 2 Not as good as Salty Sow if you're looking for a Gastropub. They didn't have many good drinks to choose from--- it's only beer or champagne drinks. They have a good brunch--- try Saturday or Sunday mornings. 
20128 1 The food is fresh, but not as good as I though. We order a Oden hot pot, and thought its going to have something special inside, but turn out the ingrdient inside are all that can buy in supermarket. Overall is too pricey, and dissapointed. 
20129 3 Service needs some improvement but the food was pretty good. Don't get the Unagi tempura. DO get the seafood risotto and wagyu! Yummmm :) 
20130 4 Good food, generous portions. They are still working out the process (recently opened) but the fundamentals of good eats are there! 
20131 4 Yummmmmmmmmmm. What's more to say? I've never had a bad experience, service is always fast and it's locally owned! 
20132 4 We went for brunch around 11 on a Saturday, and we were seated immediately. The food was well-priced, and their coffee-tequila cocktail was amazing (if you love tequila). I wish I lived in town, so I could try it for dinner! 
20133 4 $10 YOGA. $10 YOGA. $10 YOGA. It's a deal. And it'll only last til the end of 2015 as they're closing up shop. Find the daily schedule on their facebook (here: https://www.facebook.com/YogaConAmor). I sincerely hope that they go out with as many full classes as possible. 
20134 3 A lot of good food but more on the pricey side. Worth the little extra. Pancakes yummy. Omelette was big. A good fine for us today on the way to Xmas shopping. 
20135 3 Major props for gluten free pancakes - and lots of variety. Frankly - they were so fluffy, and similar to flour-pancakes, my friend and I asked the manager if they were in fact GF. Yep. Thanks for the sweet potato and pineapple upside down versions! 
20136 4 Great staff and good food options. Nice patio! Definitely coming back. Spaghetti with sausage was delicious 
20137 3 Pretty good! My only gripe is that this place is so busy! Sometimes you still need to wait a little longer than you would like even if you do have a reservation. Love the fish tacos, and you can them with a lettuce shell 
20138 4 Nastja did a wonderful job with our newborn session. She was patient during the session and very accommodating. Quick turnaround when it came to viewing the photos. Reasonable price packages and a lot of options to choose from. I can't wait to work with her again. 
20139 3 Love their Odon soup! I have been coming here for awhile and I always like it Although I have never had soup here before. This is first and I have to say that this will be my soup place going forward! 
20140 3 Very good burger joint that has become slightly overrated. Burgers are tasty but surprisingly on the smaller side for the gourmet prices they charge. Also would be nice to have some light beer options. And of course, there's the wait! 
20141 4 Great little North End GEM with great pizza and service! Love the Puttanesca Pizza....but every pizza on the menu is great. Highly recommend Locale for great pizza and appetizers! Great location too....right on Hanover Street. 
20142 4 Best Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie in Boston. I love their tins - bought a variety of 30 bite-size cookies for my office. Would recommend to anyone! I think they deliver too. A must-have! 
20143 0 I got food poisoning from this place, after eating a chicken kebab over rice. Never going there again to any of the locations... 
20144 3 Good combos and fast service. Their salty chicken nugget is good. And the Braised pork rice deluxe was also good ! Hainanese chicken was above average and their service was FAST! Like 5-10 mins for every items. Drinks were standard bbt and would suggest to go half sweet. 
20145 4 Great little shop with really friendly people working there. Good ice cream and sandwiches and a really nice, comfortable atmosphere. One of my favorite ice cream shops in Massachusetts and definitely worth the trip. 
20146 4 Great staff! Really talented nail technicians that take the time to make sure you're happy with your nails! I would definitely recommend checking this place out! Thank you guys so much! :) 
20147 4 Food great and service wonderful!! They even had a belly dancer come to our table!!! OPA!! 
20148 4 Always good food, great service with good prices! The pad Thai is amazing and the coconut ice cream.. wow!!!!! Our favorite Thai restaurant in Austin! 
20149 4 Old and awesome. Told it was the oldest continuously opened bar in the U.S. Awesome!! 
20150 3 A solid diner. I've been here four times while traveling to Westerville and the food here is 4 for 4. I like the counter for eating alone, the staff is really friendly, and the food is good. The burgers and sandwiches are great. 
20151 4 Food was amazing. I got the shrimp pad Thai and it had enough small shrimp for around one per bite. It was very mildly spicy and delicious. The atmosphere was casual but intimate and I would definitely come again. 
20152 4 really good job. those noodles are crack .. but has anyone else tried the soboro ?? are you kidding me... un real delicious very polite staff .. will come back often 
20153 1 This service has gone downhill. Drivers driving crazy, and getting a charge days later for a different amount have become regular occurrences for me. It's impossible to get anywhere with customer service when that happens too. I will be deleting the app. 
20154 4 There is magic about this place....you can order anything but I recommend the beer bacon burger...omg! 
20155 0 Looks great but the wait is ridiculous I usually come with appointment but the one time I don't waited over an hour. Tried to grab a bite to eat to kill time and couldn't or I would lose my spot. BULLSHIT 
20156 3 Good food. Good prices. I've only had lunch - both dine in and take out. The food tastes exactly how you think it will - I indulged a little for a pastrami on rye and it did not disappoint! 
20157 4 I live close and come with family quite frequently! I love their options and portion sizes are huge. Always friendly staff. Lynn took care of us 10/10 would recommend! 
20158 3 Very nice atmosphere and layout, friendly staff, good food and drinks, and easy to find location with street parking out front. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because one of my poached eggs were a little overcooked. Still tasty, though! 
20159 4 The host was a little impatient but over all my waitress Stephanie was AWSOME she was very attentive I didn't have to ask for anything she was on top of things we had a small miscommunication but she fixed it right away with no delay. 
20160 4 i like the farm to table concept, and the food quality is quite good. Some of my favorites include the chicken basil sandwich and the green chili. The pepperoni pizza is also quite good. Everything I've had here has been great! 
20161 4 Amazing location, delicious thick hot chocolate, and great treats. We always ho there for dessert , and we are both impressed each time Will revisit. 
20162 4 I went to Sage last night for dinner and I must say I really enjoyed it. I had the goat iceberg salad and goat cheese chicken. Both were really good. I also enjoyed the music. The ambience was very nice. I will definitely return for another visit. 
20163 3 Like the oysters. Food's generally good. Atmosphere relaxed, service a bit hit-or-miss, but have had some good experiences. 
20164 2 Del Mae enchiladas and the ceviche flight were great. Stay away from the salmon tacos, not double wrapped, they fall apart before they reach your mouth. 
20165 3 What great service and yummy food while at the airport! We enjoyed clam chowder and lobster bisque - both delicious! We also had their yummy Calamari Rhode Island style - best! Really great place!! 
20166 0 This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. It you like the taste of Healthy Choice or Lean Cuisine frozen dinners then you will love this. I just don't. 
20167 3 Delicious donuts, cute spot and friendly service - but pricey! Worth a try if you're from out of town although I'm sure there are other good places for better value. 
20168 4 I drove up from San Antonio at 5pm to look at a vehicle and not only did I get the deal and vehicle I wanted, but the staff were there well after closing to finish the process. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a Mitsubishi. 
20169 4 M Flynn is a lovely boutique jewelry shop with the best customer service. Their jewelry is one of kind and is all absolutely gorgeous. I will be shopping here for years to come. 
20170 3 Stick with the breakfast items - chocolate, ham & cheese, almond chocolate croissants. They will not disappoint. 
20171 4 Love the folks here! Always friendly staff and great selection of natural pet food and supplies. 
20172 4 My Grandpa gave me his old 64' Vespa 160 GS and it was in Okay Condition. Steve Fixed her right up and its running great!!! I woudnt trust ANYONE ELSE with my Grandpas Old Vespa! Twist 'n' Scoot is THE PLACE TO GO!!!! 
20173 0 Not good, I had a salad which was like a side salad just thrown together, my fiancé had the sea food basket and it was pretty bad. The only good thing were the French fries. It just really doesn't compare to 4 Rivers. 
20174 4 An amazing french restaurant, high quality food, outstanding service and priced for the neighbourhood (i.e. reasonably). Get a reservation because they are always busy. In the mornings the attached cafe serves espresso coffes and fresh baked croissants, better than any I've had this side of the Atlantic. 
20175 4 These guys just opened and this is a legit place to get coffee. And their pastries are amazing! 
20176 4 LOVED this experience while we were in Boston. A first-rate historical experience--the guides/actors were great at making the experience educational and fun for both kids and adults. 
20177 2 Just like any typical low cost hotel. Staff is nice and friendly, rooms were clean and spacious. Breakfast is included like all Hampton Inns. My only complaint is.... Parking is a bit of a pain. 
20178 3 The most friendly and effective Panera bread I've been to. Place was packed (line was all the way to the entrance) and somehow we managed to order food and eat in less than 45 min. 
20179 4 A truly special place to find literary gems. Great work, Lucky's! 
20180 0 Terrible. No attention to quality, for my one cheat meal a month, this was such a let down. 
20181 1 I had a small roast beef sandwich a small onion rings and a small drink and it was over $16 ! The sandwich was OK the roll was a little doughy. Food was average. I could have had a steak dinner for $ 16. It was way overpriced. 
20182 3 Never had a bad time there over many years. Great for drinks and bites or dinner If you come to the rainy city come to the Pearl and give it a try. 
20183 3 I've never had a bad meal at Turner's. the seafood is fresh and the service is good. They make a mean martini! My only complaint is the prices - although they're fairly standard for seafood. 
20184 4 I love the Cha Cha Cha. Great food. Pleasant outdoor seating. Convenient Location. Reasonable prices. Now if they offered Salsa dancing at night, this would be a one stop shop for me. 
20185 4 Best poke in Vancouver! Great taste and combination on the options! Really healthy! Price is worthy as well! 
20186 4 There is no reason to make anything else when the breakfast is so good. The portions are perfect and staff is friendly. 
20187 3 A very intimate space that is underground and old fashioned. The bartender was extremely friendly, knowledgable, and talkative. Their mules are great as well as their cocktails. Lots of seating a space to hang out and talk but also have live music for a fun night. 
20188 2 Second time using their drive through.... and again, they miss an item or two from our orders. Frustrating !!! Though all the servers were nice. 
20189 2 The atmosphere is tre cool, the vault seating , the glassed in fireplace, etc. But the prices are a bit, well, pricey. The baked goods are mediocre. And $8/day for wifi? Are you kidding me? 
20190 3 Nice little place. Friendly staff, good price, and the food was really good. I like their coffee too. We stopped here after camping out in single digit weather, and it hit the spot. 
20191 4 It's dark and cozy... the bar tender was busy but the bar tender was super nice and I must say...the happy hour burger was the best burger I have had in Boulder!! 
20192 3 The only downside is the music can get pretty loud. Otherwise I enjoy the setting, location, staff, food and coffee selections and of course the coffee!! 
20193 4 Loved my gyro with feta and fries with the Omega sauce. Also the fresh baklava with pistachios is on point. And the owner is a pretty amusing guy; they don't call it the Mad Greek for nothing! :-) 
20194 4 Came here on Sunday, and it happened to be Happy Hour. So we got to try a lot of plates, and had some very reasonable, delicious wine. The profiteroles were especially delicious. We will be visiting again very soon! 
20195 2 Not sure what all the hype is about. Got two pies tonight and they were mediocre. Crust is dry and kind of flavorless, too much garlic on one and just all around bland. Hardly any cheese, and very little sausage or pepperoni on either one. 
20196 4 A new Austin fav! Great food, chicken sausage is the bomb!!! The service makes the whole thing! Very friendly and accommodating! I can't wait until they put one in Dallas, but it will be on our Austin list of must visit when in town! 
20197 4 Great place to go before work. Jog around the park and get ready for the day. Always really clean and not overcrowded. 
20198 4 I would highly recommend this newbury street spa. I have been in to see Lucy 3 times for an absolutely exceptional message. I look forward to more emerge experiences in the future. 
20199 4 Such awesome people! I went in to buy an inexpensive gift and Lynda, the woman who helped me was so patient and knowledgable. I love the pearl studs I ended up getting and will hopefully have a reason to go back soon! Great selection at all price points. 
20200 2 Came for the oysters. It was blue point oysters. Didnt taste fresh at all So was kinda disappointed. The tenderloin tartar was awesome doe 
20201 4 Great Beer! Very good food. Nice atmosphere. Definitely recommend it. 
20202 4 Had the oysters, lobster chowder, fish tacos & toffee pudding. Highly recommend the pudding! It was the best I've ever had. Everything was absolutely delicious, however I would have liked the chowder to be a little thicker. Overall, great service, great food & great views! 
20203 3 The employees of this branch of Enterprise are very competent. It was a pleasure dealing with them. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because the windows of the car were dirty. 
20204 4 This has quickly become my husbands and I knew favorite restaurant! The food is awesome the service is great and I love how we can take the kids and sit outside for happy hour. This is a great place if you're looking for delicious lighter Italian food. 
20205 1 The food here simply isn't good. The chicken tastes microwaved, the bibimbap is so dry and flavorless. So sad because Korean bbq is so good. 
20206 4 Our food was delicious! But our server, Andre, was even better! He was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. He even brought us a little treat cause he was worried the food would take longer (which it didn't). I will definitely be back! 
20207 3 WOW, Maybe i should rent an apartment next to them so i can eat there all the time............ good food. YUM!!!!! I will definetely be back. 
20208 0 If it was possible to give it zero stars I would. They're not able to hold an appointment , commitment or service. I would rather never waste my time and go somewhere else. If you expect not to make it to your event on time book here. 
20209 4 Shelby is a hair wizard! Literally the best haircut I have ever had. She totally understood what I wanted. Usually I have haircut anxiety but Shelby made me feel so comfortable! I'm never going anywhere else to get my hair done! 
20210 1 Food is rather mediocre and overpriced. The only redeeming quality about this place is the location and views. There are way too many good restaurants in Portland for diners to waste their money here. 
20211 3 I only ordered from here because I saw it on grub hub and it was 5 minutes away... Never would have thought the sushi would be so fresh! It's been hard to find good sushi here in Austin, and I will continue to order from here! Very fresh sushi 
20212 3 Customer service is excellent here. Now once I wear what I bought and I like it...then I will go with 5 stars 
20213 3 Same day services available Mon thru Thursday!! Also next day :) Shirt was Dry Cleaned perfectly... friendly staff. Just need to remember to advise them how you want your collar pressed ;) 
20214 3 Good soul food. Nice china for a dump. Friendly ppl. The okra is soft and crispy a little weird but delicious! I had the jerk chicken. It was hot but good!! 
20215 3 Great service from Michelle. Had an issue with some faulty stock that had been used for some stickers. She had them reprinted for free with zero hassle. Their shirts come out great as well. Many washes and very little if any fading. 
20216 2 Divey, can get crowded, generally filled with salt of the earth people. 
20217 4 From the food to the service to the price...everything is GREAT. Super chicken, steak and cheese, roast beef, BLT, fries, onion rings...all yummy. I promise you can't go wrong. 
20218 4 The blue cheese crusted filet mignon was probably one of the best steaks I have ever had , totally enjoyed the food & the service at the bar 
20219 3 Pretty good Burgers. It's a bit on the pricey side for burgers but overall good. There fries were a little hyped up but still tasted good. I have yet to try the milkshakes. Heard they were da bomb so I will be probably returning! 
20220 4 What a great place to take a kid and have some great adult conversation as well! We love the gluten free pizza, craft beer and pinball machines! The kids reading corner is an added bonus! 
20221 2 I am from northeast Ohio where the farms are much smaller and do things like fresh dipped carmel apples a. Looked like a good place to pick your own apples but the store was a little too commercial for me. 
20222 4 It is quite good. Nice, classy place to drop by when you are in SoCo for a cocktail and lunch. At lease that is what I did. I do recommend their fried oysters. They are lovely! Same with a mimosa. Go for a batch! 
20223 2 Service was good. Nice esthetics with ok selections. Ravioli was quite good but all else was mediocre. For the price would only return for convenience sake. Not a destination to eat. 
20224 3 Ordered takeout the other night - was super delicious! Authentic tasting Thai food and have never had a bad experience! Consistently good food and service. Highly recommend the mango curry! 
20225 4 If you are looking for good authentic Mexican food go no further. The food here is fabulous and I see no point going to any local Tex Mex restaurant when El Patron is within your reach. Great service and great food! 
20226 4 Great environment and impressively good beer! We enjoyed playing darts and table games. Prices are very reasonable for the area. 
20227 0 I you like a pound of salt in your food then you'll love this place. My girlfriend and i both got different dishes and each of them were beyond salty. Totally unimpressed with the quailty of food......i doubt that i will ever go back there again. 
20228 4 Ed is a man of integrity. He does a good job at a good price within a reasonable time frame. You will not find a better AC guy. 
20229 4 Great place! Staff is amazing and the drinks are on point! By far the most beautiful nightclub in Orlando! Was in town visiting and the bartender treated me like a regular that always comes in! 
20230 4 Delicious food, great drinks and awesome service. The tortilla soup was amazing as well as the enmolades. Absolutely the best mexican food in SW Portland. 
20231 4 Great supermarket. The prices are low and has all the standard brands (plus some exotic). Parking is tricky so arrive early or seek out street parking. Also the produce section is fantastic, everything is fresh and there's a huge selection (including organic). 
20232 4 Great food, flavorful, easy, original. I enjoyed the ambiance and the staff were very friendly. All around a lovely dining experience. Highly recommend 
20233 4 Great service. Meals and sangria fabulous. Had the fish special but two of our party had the basically chicken fried steak. 
20234 4 Wow wow wow! What can I say!?! This place is amazing! The people there made me feel great and they were soooooo personable! Holy cow! I will go NO WHERE ELSE!!!! 
20235 4 Excellent fantastic, fun place. We had a huge party on a sat night and they went out of their way to accommodate us. Vey nice waiter, owner and amazing, satisfying food. Long line but well worth it. 
20236 4 Fancy smancy bar but still a great place to chill and enjoy a game. Chopped salmon salad is my go-to...never disappoints!! 
20237 3 When one is sick of the Diesel crowd and lesbian drama, I recommend True Grounds. Good coffee, free wi-fi, nice chill atmosphere hang out. 
20238 3 I was pleasantly surprised. The fish tacos are awesome! The street corn is also awesome. I came on a weekday at noon and the service was fast and everyone was nice. I can't wait to come back. 
20239 3 What's not to love? Still the best chain burrito around in my book. I have been going to Chipotle for 15 years and have never had a bad meal yet. The kid options make this a favorite for my 2 year old as well...got to start them young. 
20240 4 Amazing place for a cocktail, an app, dinner or dessert. Staff is friendly and professional, food and drink are amazing, and the ambiance is unparalleled. Highly recommended! 
20241 4 Best pizza and "bbq" (careful how you interpret that) Worth the trip despite the scary service and aged accomodations. 
20242 2 The bagels are great ! Friendly staff well most of them Pretty good coffee better then dunkin or honey dew that's for sure. They have flavor coffee from the bean. No artificial flavor shots Parking is not good at all though :( 
20243 3 Good food and great view of the bridge. Would be great to have a couple NW beers for those of us who like German food but aren't all that crazy about German beer. Even some bottles in the fridge would suffice.... 
20244 3 Despite the mediocre reviews, we gave this place a try and liked it! I had the salmon and it was amazing! Great service and my group enjoyed their meals as well. 
20245 4 First impression was excellent. Little pricey for a family of five but if you order right and share it's okay lol. Loved it loved it!!! My kids even liked it and they're very picky! Great food and great atmosphere and great customer service!! 
20246 3 I got the $5 Empanadas negro (one of several vegetarian options) so that I could justify getting the plantains ($4) at lunch. The order of empanadas was more food than I was expecting: 2 empanadas and a salad were quite filling (and tasty too). Good food, reasonable prices. 
20247 3 So recently this place did a style update. It is now known as the Silver Star Saloon and the outside was done up to look like a red barn. Seriously. This didn't change their customers or make it any more busy that I've seen but whatever. 
20248 0 Our experience was marred by an excessive wait for a table. The management was poorly organized and slow to react to what appeared to be a case of severe overbooking. This used to be our favorite local restaurant but it will be a awhile before we visit again. 
20249 3 If you are vegetarian, I'd highly recommend the "Veggie Tempura Maki". It's appetizing and delicious. Don't order "Grilled vegetables and Tofu". Because it's basically just that! Too expensive and bland. Indians may not prefer the taste of squids also. So be careful and make sure you don't order "Tiger eyes". 
20250 4 Wow, what a park. Lots of trails that are easy to navigate and not really get lost in at all. Very dog friendly all around! Plan to get your shoes wet a little as you go across the stream. Awesome way to cool off the dogs after a great trail. 
20251 1 The food is awesome but the wait at the new brick and mortar location is BRUTAL. 30 minutes for sliders is crazy. More people in the restaurant waiting for food than actually eating. 
20252 3 This place is super yummy. I come here all the time and they never disappoint. The only complaint I have is I wish that they always offered there eggs Benedict because they only have it on the weekends. 
20253 2 Chick-fil-A is the new craze in San Diego where I live. I never had the chance to try it so finally at the Atlanta airport, I saw a Chick-fil-A restaurant.... had the breakfast chicken muffin... Chicken patty was good, not great and a bit dry. 
20254 4 Love. It's inexpensive and just plain delicious. You can get kitfo that is really tartar! If you've never had Ethiopian, this is the place to go in Austin. 
20255 1 I love their tacos but the television on a news channel on high volume is annoying. I just order to go now and I notice that not many people sit in the restaurant. I mentioned it to the young woman at the counter but she didn't seem to care. 
20256 4 Luisa was amazing!! We had a party of 30 with separate / split checks. Perfect delicious and prompt. Thank you for a great tram dinner!! 
20257 0 We went for dinner on Saturday at 11:00 pm and we were told that they were sorry but they were close even though on the web page it says it was open until midnight. We love the restaurant and we have been there many times but this was really disappointing. 
20258 4 Food was amazing, so fresh and delicious. Honestly best sea food place we tried in Orlando. I just wish it would be in my hometown but definitely will go back again and again 
20259 2 Great happy hour specials can make a whole meal. Friendly staff in a not-yet-completed feeling open space split 1/3 restaurant and 2/3 bar. Seems a good spot for an after work drink. 
20260 1 Only disappointments like Topher eat here. He recommended this place to me and I wasted my time. Food was bland. Cantina's next door and Annas a few blocks away. 
20261 4 I adore this restaurant! We eat here once a week at least. The food is awesome!! There is something not quiteee right about the ambiance though. I feel like this could be a huge success if they iron that out. 
20262 4 I ate there this morning and had the Italiano omelet. GREAT food! Excellent service, great flavorful butter for the rolls. I will definitely return, probably sooner rather than later. 
20263 3 Basic Irish pub but they were open for an authentic Irish breakfast on a Sunday morning. 
20264 1 I used to love this place, but it hasn't been the same for a long time now. IMO they are cutting corners to save money. I have a photo as proof on size difference 
20265 4 Incredible! It is hard to find places like this around here anymore. Great spot in the center of Natick, and hidden so people can't find it! The staff is friendly and chatty. The food is tasty and cheap. Everything is quick also. Cash only. Awesome. 
20266 0 The girl at the register was rude and unpleasant. I ordered my drink to drink it somewhere else and when I went to drink it discovered my drink was almost half empty! Would not recommend this location. 
20267 4 The food is sooooo good, came here to purchase a house and stumbled upon it. The portions are large, beware! Definitely coming back....DELISH!! 
20268 3 Was near the CDC and had lunch with some clients and they took me here. Got the fish tacos and they were very good. Service was a little bit slow, but overall a solid place. Would come back. 
20269 4 This place is so detailed !! I came in desperately needing a wash at their closing hour and they still did a great job! Best car wash around! I went to coachworks down the street and that was a complete waste of money! 
20270 1 Sushi and food in general was pretty meh. Shrimp tempura didn't seem to be fried enough. More importantly, waiter was just kind of weird and off-putting. And kind of annoying. 
20271 4 Great service and better prices! The cook made a special Micky mouse pancake for my toddler! 
20272 3 This is a go to favorite for lunch with my coworkers. This place has EVERYTHING. I love the fried rice, teriyaki chicken, and bulgogi beef. Great for big groups! 
20273 4 Dannie has magic hands. I'm a runner and I constantly have tight muscles from all the training that I do. After a session with Dannie I not only stay injury free bit also have my muscles released so that I can run faster. He's great. 
20274 4 This place should be 10 stars out of 5. Wow. Best burgers I have ever had. So flavorful, so juicy, and such a great combination of ingredients. This was a great experience. Great service, great food, air conditioned during the heat wave. FANTASTIC. 
20275 3 Extremely good service, romantic ambiance, and the best tom kha I've ever had in the area! 
20276 3 Really good pizza and traditional italian entrees. The atmosphere is cafateria style but the food is on par with some North End eateries. 
20277 4 I was looking for an apartment near downtown but not "in" dowtown. This place is a straight shoot to my work. No commute is fun, but hey, that is the norm in this area! Beautiful interior finishes.. brand new, elegant and modern. Love it? 
20278 4 Fresh, fast, reasonably priced, insanely great tasting food. I had the daily salmon special Arepa, it was out of this world. I coulda crushed 5 of them no problem. This is a must try ! 
20279 4 That bartender with the curly mustache is one sexy ass mothafucka. Seriously, it's worth the trip just to see him in all his glory. Oh, the beer is fantastic too. But not as fantastic as that mustache-faced, godlike figure. 
20280 4 Great spot for a quick breakfast! The line is never too long and my food/coffee is always served to me within a few min. They also have a solid donut selection. Highly recommend if you're looking for a Dunkin alternative. 
20281 0 The gentleman working at the booth was INCREDIBLY rude. He was shouting asshole as we drove out of the carwash. Also, when the mean we're drying the windows they left spots and streaks and blamed it on the inside of the car. Awful experience! 
20282 2 The unit we stayed in was not bad. However, the fact that the check in is 20 minutes away is more than inconvenient. Also, the fact that this is not explained to you until they hand you the keys. Will not stay here again. 
20283 3 Great southern style lunch! The only down side is that my chicken tenders took a long time and my sides got cold. Good was good 
20284 4 Good service chicken pot pie is better than average. Veggies and fresh fruit were great. Much better fare than fast food. 
20285 3 Trivia night on Sundays! Fun and you can win alcohol! 
20286 4 My favorite restaurant to eat in in JP. (Well maybe except for Ten Tables.) Mango Curry and Pad See Ew are always great. People who work there are wonderful and knowledgeable and friendly re making sure things are vegetarian. 
20287 2 A large hole-in-the-wall venue trying to be upscale. Pretty mediocre food from what we tried. The best was perhaps the pad-si-ew, followed by the green curry, and the sweet-potato corn fritters in last place. However, service was quick and pretty friendly. There's room for improvement. 
20288 4 I love this place especially the chicken with kimchi rice and the dumplings are to die for. My husband works down the street so he brings me food from here often!!! We also enjoy the beef and chicken tacos. Great customer service as well 
20289 4 Love this salon! The team of guys & gals working there do such an incredible job. I've only had pedicures there, but they always take great care. You can also ask for fun nail art too, which I need to go back and get my Mario toes! 
20290 4 I have been to over 40 Pho places in Portland and this place wins the prize. If you are not a serious meat eater don't bother going there. This place is clean, fast and delicious! That's all there is to it. 
20291 3 Great food. Friendly staff. Just got back with my to-go order and paid for pork belly on my poutine but it's just regular. Kinda disappointed about that. 
20292 1 I only get delivery from here and it's usually my go to place for thai food but recently it hasn't been worth it whatsoever. The pad thai noodles I got earlier today were too watery and I couldn't even eat more than a fourth of it. 
20293 3 Innovative and creative local food! The inside is beautiful and homey. I would recommend getting there early or making a reservation. 
20294 3 I go here often. The pizza is always good!!! The crust is great and their lunch special is a great deal. The service is also really good! My kids love their lemonade too! 
20295 4 Wow. The best sushi I've had in a while. I wasn't sure what to expect because it looks like a random restaurant from the outside but it's actually pretty cute on the inside. Service is good and food is delicious. 
20296 1 It's a Boston experience but I wouldn't go again. Expensive, small portions and the food wasn't great. Expect it to be noisy, often times excessively noisy. Staff was very nice though, good for them! 
20297 4 Extremely helpful and friendly. I let them know I couldn't buy today and just wanted to check if my prescription with high astigmatism was doable. They treated me like I was spending 1000s and I didn't spend a dime. You can't beat that. 
20298 4 This was a wonderful find. It is different than most of the Park Ave. restaurants. Everything was so fresh. I highly recommend the seafood fettuccine. I can't wait to go back. 
20299 4 Great brunch diner food with a mexican food spin. Never a long wait (if there is a wait at all) and always fast service. A hidden gem in Boulder! 
20300 0 I have been coming here for years and it's always the same self-serve service, nothing special. But my mom likes it here so I come with her. Today is the last time we'll be coming here thanks to the attached photo. How did you guys pass health inspection?? 
20301 4 Sad that I can't go here anymore because of my new work schedule. I have to settle for overpriced and mediocre service... This place is the best Automotive Service in North Van. I highly recommend it. Just wish they were open at a later time. 
20302 1 Went to watch Deadpool closed captioned. Noticed how none of the previews are closed captioned. So deaf people can have know idea what's going on until the movie actually starts? Good job AMC 
20303 4 Man, I hate lines... But this place is worth the wait. This is the Farm to Market Joint really good burgers. 
20304 3 Very good, simple Italian food. Always a good meal. The veal is a good bet here. The pasta is also quite good. 
20305 4 Happy to say that these young, independent business owners are selling a great product and running an awesome little shop. 
20306 4 I love this place, they do a great job, manicure lasts almost a week, they pay attention to detail. be sure to make an appointment they are always busy!!! I think it's called Kim's nails now...... 
20307 4 I love takis taverna! Their pita bread is sooo good! My boyfriend and & love their calamari. The price is also good. 
20308 2 Food is pretty good, lots of vegetarian options. Not really a place for kids - the kids menu doesn't really exist and it's super loud. People dance on the tables and did I mention that it's loud? It's really loud! 
20309 3 Service was good. Prices were reasonable But the garlic bread. Wtf! It was like store bought. Texas toast. Absolutely unacceptable. What more can I say. 
20310 2 You get a discount here if you work for CDC- so that's nice. However, I thought that the food was really bland. So I am in no rush to go back. I ordered the lasagna. The food was filling though, I have to say. 
20311 0 always same same thing this lady still there and same treatment bad customer service will i hate this place 
20312 4 I leased a 2017 Kia Sportage yesterday and I love it! Wayne helped me find the exact car I wanted. He was very helpful and knowledgable about the Sportage. He beat all the competitor prices and I'm thrilled! I thank them for all their hard work. 
20313 3 Very good prices and excellent food. Must try their 50+ dollar sea food platter it's the best! 
20314 4 Nice waiters and very good looking and tasting food (tried it for brunch) 
20315 3 We had a great dinner at Sofrito. It was quick, tasty and plentiful! Definitely the best option for this area for Latin food. Can't wait to go back and try more items. 
20316 4 Love them. Best pizzas for the price & they deliver. They have great online specials. They also use Mozzarella cheese, my favorite. 
20317 3 Pretty awesome bar staff. Ive been here 20million times and never sat at an actual table. Always have an exceptional time here since this is a dedham local fave. 
20318 0 45 min and still waiting for my food. This place has great reviews, but service was terrible tonight. People that were seated after me got their food. Obviously kitchen is not organized. 
20319 4 Great food, great service! We were here for Sunday brunch. The empanadas were amazing. We didn't try anything we didn't like. The cocktails were delicious, too. 
20320 4 This is an amazing restaurant. The food is always large and perfect, the staff is always great and attentive and the prices are reasonable for the food served. Triple D rated highly. Also a great gem to have in the community. 
20321 2 Hmmmmm where do I even start?!? Bigger then the last location. I give the music a 3.... Strong drinks :-) 
20322 0 Walked in with a family of 5 and the host sat us in the back by the restrooms. He didn't apologize and he do anything to get the business. Horrible experience! 
20323 3 Loved the french toast and plenty of hot sauce choices for my side of hash browns. I grab a seat at the counter where there was plenty of room to grab some grub and read the morning paper. 
20324 2 This place has the potential to be great...great ambiance, high quality ingredients....where it falls short is in the execution. Over cooked octopus, undercooked cappellacci, under warmed chocolate cake, port wine with a glass full of sediment. Small tweaks would make all the difference. Service was excellent, however. 
20325 4 The courtyard alone is worth the price of admission. Absolutely stunning. 
20326 4 I gotta say, I'm not from around here so I don't know what else is around, but this is a solid liquor store. It's clean, has lots of staff and a really unique selection of beer (and liqueur). 
20327 4 Great food chicken and red velvet Waffle's are great. Shrimp and grits are also great. Nice atmosphere, clean and polite host. 
20328 3 Have been eating at this place for the past six years. Is definitely a little gem in south Austin. I usually stop by for their lunch special or breakfast tacos. Great family - locally owned and operated. 
20329 3 Very good smell as soon as you open the door. Classy place with lots of options for desserts and drinks. Museum option is worth a look see. Prices are decent. Service a little slow since there are so many people coming in constantly. 
20330 3 James was so nice! Excellent job and great service! I will definitely visit again. First time here got me in and out very quick. 
20331 4 My absolute FAVORITE place to shop for gifts for others and myself. Sometimes I just like to roam around there to see lovely things and enjoy what's new. There is always something new. And there is no pressure to buy, ever. The furniture for sale is ever-changing and always interesting. 
20332 4 Went for lunch today. Wow! Best wings I ever had. Had the donkey flavor. Loved it. Nice atmosphere and a ton of tvs to watch games. They have good appetizer specials as well. Five stars. 
20333 4 Healthy and unreal flavours. A+++ dining experience 
20334 2 decent service good food... not as good as the pricing would have you assume but good. Nice ambiance... HH isn't great (all cocktails are well) but not terrible. Pretty middling stuff all around but a nice change of pace if you don't want to go downtown 
20335 3 Nice outside patio and decent quality food. Nice server. Pic is the Bella Bella Benedict. And. Brioche French toast. 
20336 4 The GF says the pesto scramble is probably the best vegetarian breakfast in the known Universe with a definite best when bracketing Multnomah county. Get it half-and-half grits and potato cakes. Aardvark sauce? Well played, brunch master. 
20337 4 Some of the best ice cream I've been able to find in central florida. Good prices, friendly staff. We were there when it wasn't busy, and that ice cream hit the spot on a 92 degree day. I'll definitely be back. 
20338 4 Great good, good service! We dine in and order out ALL the time! Chicken stew and tenders are delicious! 
20339 4 Dive bar with loud live music and cheap tall boys. I'm way too old for the crowd, but $#@! it, I love this place. 
20340 4 Great food and excellent service. Fun to watch them prepare food. Would rrcommend the restauran to anyone. 
20341 4 This place has been around for long time. It's a fast food style Chinese place but food is actually amazingly good and better than you expect. Their fried rice, dry ribs, calamari are even better than many fine dine Chinese restaurants. 
20342 4 Delicious Breakfast! You won't regret!!! Amazing frittata served with 2 huge slices of pure heaven mozzarella! 
20343 0 This place has went to shit! Cold fries and Luke warm burgers that are tiny. Won't be back! 
20344 0 Poorly cooked food. Manager sitting at a table near us looked grumpy and the service was bad. Terrible experience. 
20345 1 Go here if you want to be cool, but the chocolate sucks. $20 bucks for 8 pieces? I wish that I just bought some M&Ms. Nice atmosphere. 
20346 1 This is my 3rd time back here and I was not as happy leaving as the previous few times. The guac was not as delicious and neither was the food... it seems like it has gone downhill in the past year. :( 
20347 3 Best food In the town...very friendly staff..and did I mention FAST BUT PERFECT. STAFF IS ALWAYS GOOD & CHEERFUL, no matter when you go store is always VERY clean and they go out of their way to take care of you when you are there..to top. 
20348 4 Great new menu. Its finally a good dinner option. I think its the best bar in the neighborhood. 
20349 0 This is the WORST subway in this area! The Manager, Cheryl, is rude and crude and has NO idea what she is doing...The place is disgusting! I think the biggest problem is the management...I believe new management would be SMALL step in the right direction. 
20350 4 Awesome soups and food. Dessert sticky buns are delicious. Everything is fresh. The owner is such a nice person. This place is definitely worth a try. 
20351 3 Here is less popular than Pho Pasteur. But I do like Pho hoa better because they have better service(kind waitstaffs) and clearer restaurant and restroom. And honestly Pho pasteur doesn't have that much better taste than here. 
20352 4 I the layout, massage chairs, people, music and the leg massage is amazing! I would come back if i lived in Texas! 
20353 4 The food here is amazing and menu is very creative. Everything is fresh, organic and farm to table. Lunch specials are well priced and they have a fantastic happy hour. 
20354 2 Dude, It's IHOP - it's the same in every place. The waitress was attentive, friendly and talkative. The food was cooked as ordered. The place was clean, what more can you ask for? 
20355 0 Cold food and lousy service! Not a you're welcome to my thank you, much less, and thank you to me. And that was a manager! Too many places to choose from. I won't be back :( 
20356 3 Pizzas good and wings are great especially with the different sauces. Grungy feel strikes my fancy. 
20357 4 Great staff and delicious food. Love the interior design. The food is very fresh and great presentation. We sat at the chef bar. Got to watch how the food was prepare. Highly recommend this place. 
20358 4 Quick service and great prices. Brought her some fabric from ikea to make curtains out of and they're perfect! Don't be fooled by the bridal aspect of the store, she alters anything and everything. 
20359 1 Food was okay.... Nothing more. The service was rushed and not pleasant to say the least. Our waitress left a lot to be desired. We left without desert because we felt rushed. 
20360 4 There just aren't words to describe how good this place is, so I won't even try! I hope the five stars will speak for itself. Definitely worth the trek! Just try everything-it's ALL good! 
20361 2 This Starbucks is located right on Harvard Square. There are places to sit upstairs, but it often is too crowded actually sit. They have live music in the evenings. Never saw that in a Starbucks before. 
20362 4 First visit for procedure. All staff, from front desk to nurses to MD were kind, courteous and professional. I highly recommend this practice. 
20363 2 If you like lots of tvs, and red sox fans, you have hit the jack pot. Food however is not so great. Plenty of tvs to enjoy the game, but I wouldn't go for the food! 
20364 3 The sweet cream and strawberry is my favorite, the wife loves the sausage and maple. Seasonal stuff is usually very good too. The coffee is forgettable. The staff is always friendly. Always a short wait on the days we go, but never very long. 
20365 3 Said they were open to 1am and we went in at 12:00 and said they were closed only the bar was open Great Food tho! 
20366 4 Great place to get drinks around Fenway. Our waiter Brian was fantastic! 
20367 0 Got rid of Jason... no more trolley. Jason made the tour. My business is done.... Jason made the tour and now it's boring and dull. Not worth it 
20368 4 Chicken dumplings are A+. Free chai was very pleasant. Had lamb vindaloo which was delightful. Will come again. 
20369 4 Very good! Don't let the run down strip mall fool you - the best food tends to be hidden in these. The food is excellent and some of the best Thai in Atlanta - not just on the south side. The drunken noodle is my favorite. 
20370 3 Good food and service. Your typical pizza shop. Love their marinara sauce. Their new location is a major upgrade from their old spot. Much more modern. 
20371 4 I got the #30 - Vermicelli bowl w/ chicken (I changed it to sliced pork) and spring roll. I opened the container and there were two spring rolls inside! The pork was also seasoned amazingly. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT 
20372 0 Sadly, unless Megan is cleaning your home, it's not getting clean. The owner is difficult to work with. Not a proactive communicator. 
20373 4 The whole experience from the food to the ambience, service and live music was amazing. A neighborhood gem! David was a wonderful waiter and was very accommodating. Authentic Spanish food with creative dishes. 
20374 4 An old standby! Fabulous happy hour starts at 3pm --worth waiting for! The view is bout the best the Couv has to offer and the staff is always uber friendly and attentive. Cant help but love this place =) 
20375 3 Went to lunch with a co-worker and had the Del Mole burrito. It was good and so were the chips and salsa. 
20376 3 I love kimchi but only for lunch. Their prices during the weekend are insane. I Took my family there for lunch and couldn't believe how much more expensive it was. I'll just only go during the weekday 
20377 0 One of the dirtiest McDonalds I have ever been in. Slow with service and all the tables are disgusting. After asking if one can be cleaned we were told it had to wait. Don't eat here or you could end up with good poison. 
20378 4 Delicious food and nice wine pairings. John and Doug do a suburb job explaining each dish and drink and were happy to field questions. Really nice experience for our anniversary. Thanks gents! 
20379 3 We always enjoy stopping here for lunch or a light dinner. Everything is fresh and as described on the menu. Staff is polite, service is quick and the restaurant is very clean. 
20380 3 Very amazing food great service the lobster was delicious and the portion sizes were very big! It also had a nice white a blue atmosphere with a live fish tank gamy atmosphere and formal at the same time! A little pricy but you get what you pay for. 
20381 0 Yuck! The mocha Oreo frozen yogurt was gross. There were bits of something but certainly not Oreo. Not worth the $4.70, tossed it in the trash outside 
20382 4 Best rolls in Austin and the ambiance is amazing. Very friendly staff which is mostly all family 
20383 3 One stop shop for a good variety of Indian groceries you'd need! Headsup: This is a place good for snacking, so don't expect Indian dinner or lunch menu and don't expect an upscale ambience. Staff is helpful and polite. Service is fast. Have fun munching Indian snacks! 
20384 4 When your at the grill order off the secret menu the chicken Cesar calzonato well worth it. Let's all help and bring it back on the regular menu. 
20385 4 She is great. I really liked her massage. The place is calm and restful. I almost fell asleep :) 
20386 4 I'm here on vacation and chose Diamond Nails & Day Spa based off of their great yelp reviews. The reviews were very accurate and I enjoyed a wonderful basic pedicure for $25 (extra $5 for a French pedicure). The massage was amazing and my feet finally look ready for Florida! 
20387 2 Good beer selection, real Irish people, big, decent thick cut fries (with vinegar if you want) and a beautiful long wood bar. Staff is very friendly. 
20388 2 Good laid-back vibe, and killer fries. Hand-cut Idahoes dipped in creamy buttermilk, rolled in seasoned flour (this is the trick , I think) and lightly fried...served with a special sauce that could make a grown man weep. VGS, as we like to say. 
20389 4 Victoria is so nice and skillful. On top of her amazing haircut skill, she is also a super foodie. I definitely got tons of advice on where to eat hahaha. I will be back! 
20390 3 Food was excellent. Sampled several small plates and non-disappointed. Looking forward to returning soon. 
20391 4 The flat iron steak was great, especially at that price. Brussels sprouts are right on point and gluten free pastas are a great find. All in all, a great neighborhood place for some weekday eats. Sit at the bar, it's always more lively up there. 
20392 2 Stopped by last weekend for dinner. Got right in. Food was as expected. Moderately good, very fast coming out but didn't feel pressured to finish. 
20393 4 After shopping around i ended up buying from beaverton Toyota and suggest you do too! Great fast and friendly service! Ask for Alex! 
20394 3 Food was tasty, burritos were a fair price. Overall I like this place! I will return. 
20395 3 REALLY good and inexpensive food. Not great atmosphere but my dinner was less than $6 so I am okay with that. I would definitely come back here to eat. 
20396 4 Awesome place. Nice little gem right off the road. Large variety of yummies and tasty treats. Very friendly staff. Great place! 
20397 4 Got an estimate, the person was very knowledgeable and friendly, gave me some advice and a realistic estimate. Will use them in the future. 
20398 1 We had the chicken and BBQ pork banh mi and the laos noodles. All was disappointing in taste and presentation. The sandwiches are better tasting at the Asian Shopping Center. Service was friendly and attentive. 
20399 4 Impressed! Takes a lot to impress me since I have lived in many places (SF, LA, LV) with excellent cafes. Great service, great drinks and just simply a piece of art! 
20400 1 Super stingy on the sample cups. Be prepared to be babysat while you direct an employee holding a sample cup which flavor you would like to try under their watchful eye. Cake batter was so so- a little too sugary for my taste. 
20401 0 Denmark is like going to your rich friends house party who also happens to shop at Ikea 
20402 3 Great spot - outdoor seating for days you can sit outside... The food is reasonably priced and delicious. I have had the pasta a few times and found it to be reliably great... 
20403 4 The people who work there are so nice and accommodating! Also the donuts are delicious, fast, and great! 
20404 4 Awesome little dive bar, good food, great drinks and awesome local live music! Great ambiance! 
20405 4 One of my favorite burrito places when I lived in Vancouver. Good selection, $9.50 for a burrito the size of two stomachs, delicious salsas! Got to revisit when I was in Vancouver over the weekend, and it was even better than I remembered. Great stuff, people! Go to here! 
20406 4 Do yourself a favor and eat at Velvet Taco. Curry queso dip. What? Yes it's that good. 
20407 4 Am so, so thankful for the positive experience here. With no exceptions, every staff member was so professional and kind. Pablo and Lindsay and the intake staff were lovely. 
20408 2 Why did your veggie wrap get smaller today? expensive 7 dollar wrap. 
20409 4 VEGATARIAN possible! The best veggie burger ever! I asked and the veggie burger is not cooked on the same grill as the beef. Not the usual black bean or chick pea. Mushrooms, Brussels sprout cole slaw (yes!) on wheat bun. So yum!!!! 
20410 3 Had their sweet potato sandwich for the first time tonight, yum!! Diesel- please please incorporate some of the b11 menu on yours, it really is a LOT better, even the pastries seem fresher. 
20411 4 Awesome brunch menu. A lot of parking and quick staff. Cheese grits were on point and the eggs Benedict was the perfect proportion. More than enough menu selections to choose from for any appetite. A lot of seating options inside and out. 
20412 0 Hair in both an appetizer and main course is completely unacceptable. Massachusetts State law requires hair covering and gloves for all food preparation. 
20413 3 In a world of mediocre bagels, these are the best. It's worth driving to get them! Not a lot of flavor choices, but those they do offer are excellent. 
20414 2 We haven't been to a Fuddruckers for a few years. We were somewhat disappointed this time. I think their quality and quantity of condiments have seriously deteriorated. They have turned into just another expensive hamburger joint. 
20415 3 Great location and atmosphere! Bartender was attentive and his recommendations where on point! Was a little put back how long tables sat empty with dirty dishes on them maybe hire a busser and would be nice to have a host at least on there peak hours to help coordinate! 
20416 4 Excellent place and excellent oyster is the best oysters bar in the east orlando... And have a good promotion and happy hours 
20417 3 Been here twice in the last month and don't have one complaint. Great service great food and great drinks. Double decker and the last samurai to drink, hasn't failed me yet 
20418 3 This is a great cozy Mexicano restaurant. I don't care for the starters. But the main seafood dish with a mexican spin on it was great. 
20419 3 Great service from the staff here. Seated with a menu within 30 seconds of entering. Food come fast and very tasty. BBQ pork on rice and potstickers are worth it. Other menu items such as Curry beef w/ potatoes on rice is another favorite. Price is decent. 
20420 3 Older building. Small space. Furniture like Miami 1980's. Not very spa-like. But very kind receptionist and very good massage. Good experience. A- 
20421 4 This place was great; it is exactly what we want when we go out for dinner. The food, the service, the wine, the prices were all spectacular. I had the swordfish special and it was amazing. My hubby really enjoyed his pasta dish. Just go! 
20422 4 Always a delightful experience. Staff is attentive and helpful and the food excellent. We always look forward to eating at Gran Gusto when we're in Cambridge. 
20423 3 Amazing! And I love that they locally source. The new one up north is just as wonderful as the south location. Every burger I have had here has been perfectly cooked and the fries are amazeballs (that is one step up from amazing) - very fresh and crisp. Love it! 
20424 3 Nice interpretaion of a hamburger place. Very good burgers, healthy choices, and excellent atmosphere. The drink fountain is great! 
20425 4 AWESOME roll-ups and killer triple decker sammys. They also have amazing frozen yogurt w/tons of mix-ins. 
20426 2 Had fish tacos and mac and cbeese decent meal nothing special after seeing the Chronicle review had higher expectations. service was good not bad for a drink and quick bite 
20427 2 Average Chinese fast food, favs- garlic green beans, the dumplings are hit and miss, i prefer to dip in hoi sin sauce, BBQ meats bowl, won ton soup is sometimes quite strong in flavor, the Tonns in the soup are above average. I might say they were always pretty good. 
20428 4 Just delicious!! We had the Korean short rib stew and on a cold winter night it hit the spot!!! 
20429 0 I must say we just had the worst omelets we have ever had. The good reviews must be on the pastries and lunch. Also had to wait 30 minutes for our breakfast. There's no reason any omelet should take that long. 
20430 4 I usually have a good experience at Firehouse. The staff is always very nice and make a mean sandwich. I just need to remember, not fully involved. But all in all good food, good staff all good! 
20431 3 Well done. Good service, good food. Would go again for sure. Portions were generous and fresh. 
20432 4 BEST cold brew I've ever had. I also got the Cubano sandwich and it was bomb--good size, too. Jaho has a great atmosphere with lots of natural light and seating! Love love love. 
20433 4 Cool vibe, great building. Valrhona mocha is probably the best cup of coffee on the planet. I love this place. 
20434 1 Went to see ratatat. Show was amazing. Five check points for security, whack! 
20435 4 We had an excellent lunch for five, including kids. Great mussels. All the food was generous, staff was friendly and a nice atmosphere to boot. Not on the cheap eats side, but the value, quality and location are matched. 
20436 4 I've been to this I optometrist office for couple years now. They have a really great staff and the doctor that I saw was amazing. He really explain things to me in a way that I could understand about My eye health. 
20437 4 This place is AMAZING, always friendly atmosphere, all of the managers and waiters are extremely polite. My family have found our new go to spot, all of the food is amazing. 
20438 1 I agree with the chipotle comparison. Only chipotle tastes much fresher and is cheaper. It is sad to call this place Brazilian. 
20439 2 Had breakfast here twice. The buffet is nice, with the omelet station and many choices for breads, fruits, meats etc. it's a little expensive, but it seems all hotel restaurants are. 
20440 1 Got the chicken, beef, and pulled pork taco with sweet potato Fries and corn salad. Tacos were mediocre, nothing special about them. Not worth 3.50... Fries where drenched in syrup/oil. Corn salad was mediocre as well. More like dressing soup with corn. Was not impressed with my meal. 
20441 1 You will be entertained. Not a place for children, but not bad. They jump around on tables and mess the place up as part of their show. Kind of fun once a year for your birthday, but other than that. 
20442 4 Benold's is an A-plus jeweler who stand by their word. We had a custom ring designed through them and it came back with some mistakes. Benold's and Hallie were incredible advocates and made it right with no hesitation. I highly recommend them for all custom jewelry. Incredible customer service. 
20443 4 Customer Service is great! Friendly and helpful. Surprisingly good being that it's right next to campus. 
20444 4 Yum yum yum! Great service, inventive menu, and cute/welcoming inside. The siracha brussell sprouts were to die for. Not a single complaint; only praise. Just moved in a half a block away and I'll be becoming a regular! 
20445 4 Ty is reliable, dependable and honest. He's helped many of my clients with their homes (I'm a realtor) - including switching out their laminate counters for granite. Ty and his crew all ways do a great job. 
20446 3 Great coffee and pastry. Service ice excellent. Good place for people watching. Close to everything in Salem 
20447 4 I went to the Hair Shack to see Kate. She turned my dyed black hair red without the damage that can occur when stripping hair. And, she didn't break the bank. Excellent job, Kate! 
20448 4 I feel like I need to post a review since I'm there at least once a week. But I love this place! Your typical diner with great wings and sauces. Service is always pleasant and attentive. Their trivia nights are the best! 
20449 4 Great food and excellent service. Warm, Friendly environment. They have both indoor and outdoor seating available. Love this place 
20450 4 I went here through a vegan meet up on Facebook. Everyone here was so friendly and the food was delicious! I tried the Ruben and the fancy mac and cheese. I can't express how amazing the food is. Everything had great texture and flavor. I'm looking forward to coming back. 
20451 3 Staying here during a business trip. The staff is very friendly and my room is immaculate! Came down to the lobby for a few beers while I finish up some work. Good selection of local microbrews and a good appetizer menu! 
20452 1 Who does not have butter on their pancakes? Also no receipt, should have been in the bag! Hot food, good portion but for this price I could eat at Denny's. 
20453 0 Greasy and expensive. Feta and spinach omelette was just oily. Pancakes flavorless. Home fries okay. Cafeteria service with rude cook. You don't need to scream at the only customers waiting. Go anywhere else. 
20454 3 Good food, great and consistent service. Seared tuna was good but same cut, texture and quality found at less expensive restaurants. Portion size was good of as well. 
20455 2 Nice for outdoor seating, the food is nothing to write home about but they do have Down East Cider :-) yummm 
20456 3 Stopped by this spot for a late night bite. I had a slice of the veggie pizza - the slice was covered with cheese, peppers, olives and a multitude of other veggies. The pizza was good and I look forward to visiting next time I'm in the area. 
20457 0 I wish there is zero star or negative star. Soundproofing of the rooms are extremely bad. Their cleaning staffs are also very rude. 
20458 3 Chicken was juicy, full of flavor and spiciness is just right that doesn't overwhelm the natural flavor of the chicken. We had mac and cheese and fried pickles too and were all just as good! Definitely going back and the staff is awesome! 
20459 3 Good and friendly customer service. Too hard in-house made waffle cones. Ice cream flavor ok. 
20460 4 Wow, the garden burger is the best I've ever had! 
20461 4 simply put, whole bowl is better than sex. whoever has a problem with it doesn't even deserve to get eat it. i would rate this 10000000 stars if i could, i would have it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, even dessert. 
20462 3 Wonderful brunch!!!! Great drinks for morning time and the location is very nice. The service is excellent and the bar is sweet. Maybe sure to reserve a table ahead of time. 
20463 4 Nice unpretentious. My son loved his steak tips My pizza without cheese and veggies was perfect. He also raved about his cheese pizza. 
20464 4 Very delicious pho! The dishes are served in large quantities that do not disappoint, and the servers are very friendly! 
20465 0 Getting into the park is a nightmare! No organization or people to control the crowd. Staff upon entry seemed miserable. Dirty and smelly bathrooms. I recommend leaving the park well before it closes. Again, no organization. We were stuck like a herd of cattle for over an hour. 
20466 4 Usually a buyer here not so much a seller. Every time I've been in the staff have been really friendly. Their 90% off clearance sale rocks. 
20467 2 3 1/2 Really, but nothing great. Flatbread, wings and ribs were all ok. I tried the clam strip special and they were really over battered and greasy with a few "fishy" bites. 
20468 3 Oh man. Been waiting for a good izakaya in Boston. They have a good selection of kushiyaki and yakitori! Out of the salmon collar tonight! So sad. But will have to come back again for it. Promo $1 valet parking but I doubt it'll continue for long! 
20469 3 Food was fine the one time I went. The setting was great if you like oldy worldy wood panelling. Made me feel like I was in an old movie (in a good way). 
20470 4 The best pizza you can get in my opinion. I love business trips just so that I can snag a pizza on my way home! 
20471 4 Best hot chocolate ever! My daughter ventured down the street and into this little place on the corner each day of our Boston vacation for a cup of their frothy goodness! 
20472 4 Great good, great service, had an oustanding experience. The mint tea is excellent and the chicken bastilla is awesome. 
20473 4 You never let me down!! Needed a cozy atmosphere and amazing food on this cold night! I love every ounce of you Eddie Vs! Best Happy Hour in town! The calamari has my heart!! 
20474 3 I love hanging out on the lawn of this gem on the East Side. It feels like you are at a friend's backyard party. Great place to go after a show at Salvage Vanguard, or on a cool fall night. 
20475 4 Does anyone know if this is worth it ?? $20 unlimited all-you-can-eat shrimp on Wednesday? My family loves shrimp!! I just want to make sure they're not stingy with the shrimp? Comment ? Picture ? Let me know!!? 5 star given due to idea ! 
20476 3 I've eaten here once and food was delicious I had a call in order and it was really busy so I still had to wait a while to actually pick it up. 
20477 4 I love this place! The French vanilla muffins are the absolute best. The pimento and cheese spread was also very good. 
20478 0 Took us 30+ minutes to get to our parking spot tonight and the airport was DEAD. One of the customers forgot where they parked so the shuttle bus was driving in circles to find their car at our mercy. 
20479 4 These folks do a great job! Clean shop, friendly service. My new fav is the lemon pepper...extra well done. So crispy and tangy. 
20480 4 Josh is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. I am very impressed with his customer service and individualized attention. Highly recommended! 
20481 4 Excellent sandwiches in this sunny cafe with friendly service. A short walk from the Adams NPS visitors center, and well worth the walk.! Try the Italian sandwich on a fresh ciabatta roll. 
20482 1 Place was packed and we figured wings and beer would be good. Service is slow and wings are eh. Beer is good, but I prefer good food with my beer. 
20483 3 An unexpected gem in Malden! Great food at a great price. Fun ambiance. They also do private events at the location at a reasonable and competitive rate. I've been here for brunch, lunch, dinner, cocktails, and a couple baby showers. They don't disappoint! 
20484 4 Beautiful space with lots of natural light. Staff were friendly and my mocha was delicious. I will be back and will definitely recommend this place to my friends. So excited about all of the great new places joining the neighborhood! 
20485 3 Cool lil' hole in the wall place Very authentic & fair prices Try the daily specials 
20486 1 Nonexistent service, but at least I got to test out some of the gadgets I've been interested in. 
20487 0 I only had dinner here once, for my son's birthday. We were so dissatisfied with our meal we never returned. This place is over rated! The prices are very expensive as well. I only liked the Buddha statue at the entrance..... 
20488 4 The food was very good and the hospitality was very nice I would eat there again. And I would also recommend it to my friends and family. 
20489 4 New location in NE Alberta St is excellent as well! my fav dish PAD EGGPLANT :) Yum yum yum... 
20490 4 I have a home warranty on my new home, but when our AC went out I knew I could trust Ed to honestly diagnose the problem. An honest guy that knows what he's doing....What else can you ask for? 
20491 2 We had been dying to try this place. However we were very disappointed. The chicken wings had the right flavor but they were over cooked. They took forever to bring our food. I had the bulgogi and it tasted too salty. I felt very ripped off 
20492 4 Why is Bert's not listed amongst Austin's BEST and most ORIGINAL of BBQ places? It is, hands down, the very BEST Austin has to offer. Great people, great service, great food. I have been a customer of Berts for two decades and it never ceases to amaze me. Really good! 
20493 4 Went to a session with JJ using ClassPass - it was intense!! And a fantastically tough workout...the best part was that JJ took the time to do adjustments, which is KEY on the Reformer. So excited to have a stronger understanding for next time!! 
20494 4 Great breakfast in an Atlanta staple. The country ham and red eye gravy is fantastic! 
20495 4 Took my father here for father's day last summer, and he loved it. Great hamburgers, long lines -- he was very happy. 
20496 2 I am pleased to report that I received a very helpful response from Dawn, owner of Jericho Counselling. She is results oriented which I appreciate very much. Thank you! 
20497 4 The food was great and atmosphere is pretty cool. Low lighting. Place is bigger than you think from outside. The food came out quick. Ribs fall off the bone chicken was juicy BBQ sauce is like a sweet and tangy. There was also a live band playing music. 
20498 4 I have always been nervous going to the Dentist but then I came to this office and they make you feel right at home. They truly treat you like family. 
20499 4 I always find well trained employees who are interested in good customer service. What a pleasure to do business with these people. 
20500 3 I love a good lunch spot and I have to say this place did not disappoint. great for a quick to-go lunch and the wraps were delicious! will def come back, new fav spot for me, very good food for a really reasonable price 
20501 4 We love coming to this coffee place best green tea,chicken and wafles are amazing!and the environment is really neat.Truly a place to visit over and over again. 
20502 3 Excellent service and communication. No hassle ride home from the airport. I'll use them again without hesitation. 
20503 0 Very unpleasant atmosphere. So loud you can't have a conversation. Staff try to do a good job, but they lack training to handle many types of situations. Should be shut down for inflicting hearing damage on children & employees. Will NEVER go again. 
20504 4 Dr D and the staff are very friendly and nice! My back got better with each visit all thanks to Dr D and his great team! 
20505 2 Thanks to Frank B. the photo of this Starbucks is now accurate. 
20506 4 I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the new Buttermilk Batter Blaster! It makes a nice big fluffy pancake. Really super stellar. And I love the Chocolate too, which I get here at Whole Foods. It's great for when you're feeling snacky -- a quick choco waffle with whipped cream. Yummy! 
20507 1 The beer here is above average. I would struggle to put them in the Land Grant/Seventh Son/Four String echelon of top Columbus breweries. The place comes off as craft beer for hoity-toity types. Which is fine but to me not what the craft beer movement is about. 
20508 1 Nice atmosphere but limited and weird menu. Can't even get a regular salad...watermelon or peaches, really? Not for anyone counting calories. Cocktail was flat, sent it back and they gave me same flat drink. I wouldn't go back. 
20509 4 Best diner I have been to in years The half Benny was incredible. And my wife's corned beef hash omelette was Excellent and huge! You may have to wait in line to get in as well. The staff was very friendly and fast. 
20510 4 Chicken curry was hot and tasty. Pad Thai was spicy and delicious. Sat at the bar, the bartender was friendly and attentive. 
20511 3 Been here twice so far (one lunch and one dinner) and have had solidly good experiences. The waitstaff is friendly, but not always the most attentive. I would like it if their fries were actually more like Irish chips, but they're still pretty good. 
20512 4 Second time coming and the staff is so knowledgeable! Jonathan recommended great new menu options and when it came out it was 100% what we wanted! Cooks make the food fast and ready! Highly recommend this place! Great vibes and atmosphere! 
20513 4 A great eat, the atmoshere is very nice, with dimly lit light and cozy seating. A spanish influenced steak house, the food is very good. The service is spectacular, from a great waitstaff to valet parking. A reservation is a good idea if going on a weekend. 
20514 4 Been for dinner and brunch and absolutely adored both. The stuffed pancake changed my life. 
20515 2 Decent food, great variety, and friendly service. If you have a multiple diet group, this restaurant is a great choice white vegan and vegetarian options. 
20516 4 The service was excellent! They had good portion sizes and great prices. The manager even stopped to chat with us. The atmosphere was cozy and warm. 
20517 3 Real cool guys, shop is awesome, and pricing is great. However asked for a trim and ended up with a buzz cut, recommend being specific on instructions. Experience 5/5, cut 3/5. 
20518 4 In a nutshell, cleaner, quieter its the NW's obvious choice in gyms. It just makes sense. 
20519 4 Service was very fast and friendly. Food portions were what Iwould expect for the price. Will come back again. Would recommend reservations just to be safe. 
20520 2 This place is good. The boba was fresh and the tea was yummy. However the store was very dark and cold and not as clean or tidy as i would have hoped. 4 stars for the drinks, but minus 1 for the ambiance (or lack there of) 
20521 4 Ritual Salon is the best and most innovative full service salon in Austin! I have always been supremely happy with my hair cuts and color and have been with Bridget for 15 years. I highly recommend this establishment. 
20522 4 Food is excellent. I got the chicken wrap. Super messy but super delicious. The two guys working there really cool. 
20523 3 Good pad thai and chicken massaman curry. They made it very mild the way I like it. The edamame good have used more salt but they were fine. 
20524 4 Buying my 3rd MINI !! See Don Saucier, modest and unassuming salesperson. A dream to work with. 
20525 4 The bbq is terrific. Ordering is cafeteria style and meats are priced by the lb. It is too easy to purchase more then you can eat at one sitting. Leftovers make great takeout. 
20526 4 Not many true barber shops in this city and these guys/gals now how to cut hair. The atmosphere in here is always stellar and the cuts are even better. Great old school barber shop who are always busy but move efficiently. 
20527 4 Love this place. Atmosphere is great and the drinks are AMAZING! I had their version of a lemon drop.... holy crap- it was way better. Definitely recommend it! 
20528 3 A very nice new theater. The seats are comfortable and recline. The screens are big and the staff is helpful. They have delicious popcorn which I a must for any theater chain. They serve it in a stainless steel bowl and use coconut oil. 
20529 3 One of our favorite Japanese restaurants in the whole Boston area. Delightful staff and wonderful food. One of my favorites is their teriyaki salmon...well-done. Plus, their sushi pizza is crisp and fine. Worth a try for sure. 
20530 3 Cozy pub that has a very cool playlist. Drinks are a little pricey but made strong. Loved the artichoke dip and black bean soup. Loved the fact that they have outdoor seating with heat lamps for a cool Atlanta night. 
20531 4 Arrived on time and moved twice as much as I thought we would. Will definitely call again and in fact have scheduled to move our office, as well. 
20532 2 Food is good. Wings are amazing. Service, not so much. Worth the service sacrifice? Think so. Buy Why does a salad take 30 min to come out? 
20533 4 This is the best bottled kombucha I've ever had. It is smooth and has a perfect balance of flavors. My favorite is the lavender lemonade. It's so good we now sell Lion Heart at our massage practice. The owners are also very helpful and friendly. 
20534 4 Had the greek burger. Perfect portion. I thought it was delicious. Highly recommend. Cool set up and atmosphere. Pretty good drink selection as well. No complaints! Nice place to grab a bite with your friends, maybe even family. 
20535 4 Highly recommend. They were on time, courteous, helpful, great experience. Excellent choice for to and from the airport. Great price. I will definitely use again. 
20536 2 Apparently very dog friendly, do not expect the sushi to be quick -expect an hour every time no doubt! Great beer selection & tasty gumbo! Not the kindest wait staff but its a bar, not a hair salon -take your bad days elsewhere 
20537 0 horrible company with miserable customer service reps. Just horrible. Never again. 
20538 0 Bleehhhhhhhhhhhhbhhbbhhhbbbbb!!! Absolutely gross! Was terrible. There was cheese on my pancake. The bacon was burnt and disgusting extremely disappointed. Never coming back! 
20539 3 Not bad, i was very surprised. I had a mediocre pizza there many years ago and hadn't returned because of that. But I did go this March 2018 and the service and the food were both very good. 
20540 4 This is a great place to smoke hookah. Joeseph took great care of us and we totally enjoyed the night. 
20541 3 Loveeee the cheese empanadas!!! The churros are also good but the waiting is toooo long. 
20542 4 The absolute best smoked rotisserie chicken complete w excellent salsa and chimichuri. $9.50 and I still have lunch tomorrow with corn tortillas and pickled carrots. Did I mention afejores for breakfast tomorrow? Family run shack w limited tables and oh to go! 
20543 1 Not bad but we chose the wrong one. It was advertised to have more but come to find out there is 2 different places. 
20544 4 I'm an espresso junkie, and this is my favorite place to get a latte in Boulder. Period. Great food too- bagels especially, and the baristas are always friendly and genuine. Great atmosphere, great espresso, great food- on second thought, never go there. It's mine. 
20545 3 Great little french place to stop into for some coffee and sweets. The macaroons were very fresh and tasty. The chocolate croissant was delicious. They will heat it up for you as well, which makes it even that much better. They provide the baked goods at Elizabeth Street too. 
20546 4 Love this studio. Awesome little space, great classes and teachers too. Maria, Precious, Taylor & Heather are really great teachers. Check this place out of you want to get in kick ass shape ! 
20547 4 Always had a great experience here. You can't go wrong with Red Robin. I love their bonsai burger the most. That one really tastes great, especially with some fries and root beer. 
20548 2 Not bad for a quick, healthy lunch. They have a good selection of hot sauces that you can douse your whole bowl with! 
20549 3 Cute old Irish pub in Boston. No tvs in the pub but it is a great place to go. I got a goat cheese salad that was wonderful and split a curry fries. 
20550 1 Silly that it costs over $2 extra for brown rice. No low sodium soy sauce either. Not a good option for healthier or dietary needs. Sushi was average. Probably not a repeat visit location. Better sushi restaurants elsewhere. 
20551 4 Great neighborhood bar and grill. Service is warm, food is good and big selection and they make there drinks good. Would recommend 
20552 3 Our last stop of the night, great atmosphere! Will definitely go back! Wanted to try the green chile pork tacos, but they were out of them:( so I tried the pork shoulder sliders, a little dry, but had good flavor. 
20553 4 Hands Down the BEST PAD THAI in PORTLAND!!! I don't what they put in there, but it truly is the best! On a side note, they are starting to do somewhat of a cocktail night on Saturday nights. They're open until 3AM and sometimes have live music!!! 
20554 3 So lovely here..the Burrata and any pasta will keep anyone happy for lovely satisfying nums! They are quite amenable to vegetarians and can convert almost any of their dishes. Top it off with a lovely and varied wine list and its a win! 
20555 2 Great pedicures, but skip this place for any type of acrylic/gel work. I had a fill a few weeks ago here and the edges of the acrylic started to lift within a few days. No bueno. 
20556 3 Always a good time! It can get a little loud now that some people seem to be showing up just to talk loudly through the presentations? 
20557 3 The atmosphere was awesome! The rolled yogurt was good and I think the portion size was perfect for how rich it was. We played some games while we waited and the wait wasn't that long. Overall the service was great and fairly quick. 
20558 4 Love this very out of the way theater. Prices are very reasonable from concessions to the price of the movie itself. Always has the newest titles. Arrive early as the parking can get filled up quick otherwise you will be in the grass. 
20559 4 Fantastic restaurant. The food was amazing. The staff was fantastic. My server Christopher was perfect. This was the best place to have lunch during my layover at Boston Airport 
20560 2 Decent, cheap veggie sushi right by the beach. 2 items, miso and salad for $6.95. Fast and friendly service. It won't blow your mind but it will fill you up. 
20561 3 Also the Blaze at Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua, NH is just as good! 
20562 4 Excellent staff! From check in to bar service to check out. Decent room with full fridge and stove top, huge layout. Very cozy and comfortable. Pool was great. Felt like bath water. Will definitely be back. 
20563 4 Facility is quite clean, Eli was very efficient and personable. They only do inspections; I needed new windshield wipers that I could purchase there and Eil installed making it easy for me. Much better than gas stations I have been to in the past! 
20564 4 I have become a regular weekly. This place is 100 percent fresh and everything I have tried has melted in my mouth from the rice, to the sauce, to the tender meats. I absolutly recommend the passion fruit shake, its my favorite! 
20565 4 If you have not been here, you are missing out! Fantastic HH! Great range of wines; price points are quite reasonable! Lovely and solicitous staff! Quaint atmosphere! My pasta dish was exceptional! We were here on a Wed. It was busy but not crazy! Make it your next choice! 
20566 4 They have a really good variety of meats and veggies to chose from! Great meal!!! 
20567 4 I LOVE this nail salon! I drive all the way from millenia and its worth it every few weeks. There the best and take care of you always. 
20568 1 Quick service, but overpriced for what it is and its ambiance. Not really a relaxing place, but this airport terminal has so few food options. Had the fried shrimp, which was good but not worth 23.99... 
20569 4 I stayed here for a work conference and was happily surprised with the decor and cleanliness. The rooms are spacious and the meeting rooms are conveniently located. The view from the restaurant at the top of the tower is spectacular. 
20570 1 Awful after making arraignments over the phone with Darius, I showed up as scheduled and was turned away 4 hours before closing. Understand first come first serve like darius explained. After having dinner at a nearby restaurant and keeping tabs it turns out lazy workers. 
20571 4 Sooo many delicious choices!! My 8yr old filled her cup a little too much and dropped her cup, I was so surprised by the quick response of the staff, they were so kind as to clean up the spill for us.. the staff here is wonderful 
20572 0 Disconnected electric car charging stations for no reason! These are supposed to be public and active at all times but have neglected multiple request to turn stations back on! 
20573 4 Great service, my friend came in for a tire leak and they fixed it for free. Kodo is the MAN! We appreciate the great hospitality. We will defiantly be back! 
20574 2 Mall food court Chinese food for twice the price. (Szechuan beef was weird and sour; General Gao's chicken was very basic breaded fried chicken.) Inoffensive, inauthentic, and forgettable. 
20575 1 Meh. This burger wasn't to our liking. It's made somewhat flattened and very crispy, which is odd. Fries were good, but didn't make up for the burger. 
20576 4 Was super timely, and GREAT prices for a six street place. The menu had great options, and bathroom was clean. Employees were nice, food was great, and reheated well. I definitely will come back. Parking is close too! 
20577 1 I am only giving this place two stars because the people seem nice. The food was awful, my god how does anyone eat this stuff. A sidewalk vendor with a gorilla working the stand would make a better sandwich. Yuk! 
20578 4 Stopped here before getting to train station. So delicious and super nice bunch. Very happy!! They also gave my Cubs some spicy rice on the house and they crushed it !! Thrilled , cause my kids are extremely fussy! 
20579 4 Been loving this place lately. Super convenient and I've never had a bad experience with the food. They'll even add ingredients to certain rolls, super accommodating. Service has always been great and food comes out pretty quickly. 
20580 4 Beautiful park that's full of trails to walk or run. You can definitely spend an entire day here so pack a small lunch and some water. There are even logs for you to climb across. 
20581 4 My husband and I love this place! They are super polite, the service is great, the place is super cute and with a pleasant environment, the food is amazing (our favorite Greek food), and they have an amazing apple cider. We highly recommend! :) 
20582 4 This is one of the premier event spaces in greater Boulder. Even if you are not an Alum of CU, you will certainly find Koenig is great to host any event. 
20583 0 Not a place to buy a Christmas tree if you are single and need helping getting it on your car. They will give you twine but there his no one that will help you. 
20584 3 No scumbags in the lounge , just some wanna be's and people either with money or wishing they had money.... Had to stand around.. No treal big.. 
20585 3 Definitely the best dining option inside Orlando International Airport. Vegetarian burrito can be made vegan with options like grilled vegetables, Chipotle-style. 4 stars for airport food. 
20586 4 This place is great! Have enjoyed everything that we have tried. The Malia Kofta is a must try for anyone who hasn't tried it. Great food as well as economically priced. Definitely recommend for those nights when you just want want to indulge in unhealthy Indian food :-) 
20587 4 Great Experience!.. We sat out on the patio, which overlooked the stream. Great atmosphere. The service was great and so was the food. A place I would recommend and return to. 
20588 4 Oh my god! Sorry clam season is over because their clam chowder is the best I've ever had anywhere! 
20589 4 Super fun! We tried to avoid getting soaked by sitting strategically. The captain and passengers weren't going to let us get away with it, so they teamed up and drenched us in the last 10 mins or so of the trip. ; ) 
20590 1 I expected a lot more. For almost $14 (and that's takeout) I got a mere 8-inch pizza, and I seriously doubt the freshness of the ingredients. Next time I'll go across the street to ModMarket to stay local and get a better value. Seriously disappointed. 
20591 1 It would have been great to see some of their unique and local spirits listed on the menu as well as the $17 cocktails. The atmosphere is just blah here, service unfriendly and just wouldn't go back. 
20592 3 Can not start my day with Jaho Coffee. In particular, a mocha latte. The coffee here is delicious and they pair it perfectly with the chocolate. Always hot. Excellent. No other coffee compares to thiers. 
20593 3 Great pizza!!! We ordered the Funghi pizza (mushroom) to share. The pizza was very flavorful and paired great with the wine we brought. The service was very fast and friendly. Great place to meet up with friends. 
20594 4 Damn good eggs benedict and even better catfish hash!! and as others have mentioned, it's small so... be ready to wait for a table. You probably have an iPhone or something to keep you "busy", right? 
20595 4 This is by far my favorite Colombian restaurant. When I visit family in Orlando, I try to stop by for a quick bite. The best empanadas ! They should make one in Los Angeles! 
20596 4 Great service, excellent food! Dog-friendly. We've been here several times and have not been disappointed. Highly recommended. 
20597 4 I have been framing all my art work with Austin Art & Frame. They are certainly knowledgable, professionals and very detailed oriented. Their work is superb! 
20598 3 Very impressive buffet which includes a drink, meal, dessert and Naan. Great value! 
20599 4 No doubt one of the best burgers I've ever had! Had the kick drum burger with the house made mustard... Amazing! Also, thy make their ketchup from scratch, so be sure to get some fries with your order. 
20600 4 Like someone else said, it's a short show but so worth it if you're a big Harry Potter fan. It's not even on the universal map. It's not took long of a wait too. 
20601 1 Drinks are okay, the staff was pleasant. The cocktails are too overpriced though for a rundown hotel like this one. Stop trying to be swanky and instead do something about the fact that the place is falling apart. 
20602 4 I love the olive garden. The food is just superb. The service is fast and courteous. The prices are reasonable. Ask for "jose" great server. Very attentive and funny too. 
20603 4 My favorite Thai place in Boston. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious!!! My go-to meal from them is the pad khee mao (drunken noodles). The BEST! They are always very friendly and provide great customer service, whether I'm eating in or getting take-out. 
20604 3 Reads is now Hi Tech Automotive. Staff is very kind, genuine, and helpful. I came in for a vehicle inspection and they took care of it! 4/5 stars because they said it would take 35 minutes and it took an hour. But I'm grateful they were nice & thorough! 
20605 3 Not the best veggie burger I've had, but I can't go in here as a vegetarian with any expectations. Our waitress was very nice, prompt, and helpful. The menu has lots of carnivore-type food for all you meat lovers out there. 
20606 4 Amazing team. Flexible, detail-oriented, and responsive. I've had a number of dog walkers before, in NYC and elsewhere, and this experience has been superior thus far. 
20607 3 A friend from Boston recommended this place for a great casual dinner. Food was great, service was attentive, red brick Sam Adams was great. Highly recommend the corn cakes! Great assortment of sandwiches and love the vibe of the place! 
20608 4 Food is amazing and staff are very sweet. They fixed a problem with the yelp app quickly. The shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce is so good and the seafood noodle soup too! 
20609 3 Beautiful brand new apartments on S. Congress. Great amenities and staff. It is brand new so they still have a few kinks to work out but it is an all around wonderful place. 
20610 4 Such amazing food! So fresh and great service. Highly recommend the Chile Rellenos, the best I have ever had! 
20611 0 Do not order delivery! I've ordered shredded beef with hot green pepper. It tasted like the mix of leftovers!! Some of the beef had cumin and other didn't! And all beef were wizened. 
20612 4 Great customer service!! Drove 30 minutes to this store after a horrible customer service experience near my house! I found what I needed plus more and was surprised with how great the quality and selection was. Worth the money & time!!! 
20613 2 The food was decent but the service was terrible. It was hard to even get tea refilled. 
20614 4 Great little italian restaurant. Wonderful food, great service! 
20615 0 Terrible service. Food is dry and bland. Will never come back here. The owner is also a prick and a racist. 
20616 0 Waited half an hour for two sandwiches -one cold- while watching people who came in way after me get sandwiches pizza etc. very annoying. Nothing was offered other than "oh sorry". 
20617 1 The food was awesome, the service was horrible. We sat at the bar and never got a second drink with our meal or bread. The wine pour was atrocious!!! Never asked us how our meal was or if we wanted anything else, like another drink. Will never go back!!! 
20618 3 So hard to find a good Chinese resturant. The tea was superb, the food was fresh,hot and decorative. The crispy noodles were fresh and cooked perfectly. You can definitely tell why this place has been around and loved by locals for 30 yrs. One of orlando's best kept secrets. 
20619 3 Great place to watch football w/ 10-15 screens. 
20620 4 The first time my friend and I had their Italian cheese pizza with Garlic on it we both shed a tear or 5, I don't know what they do to make their pizza so good but it is AMAZING. Very friendly staff, fun environment, and affordable wine 
20621 1 Lots of salty sauce in the chicken shwarma. Unfriendly and $8.50 for small pita. Won't be returning. Not sure why places keep raising prices without improving quality. It really shouldn't be hard to see when you have very few returning customers 
20622 4 First time using iTech and was very pleased with the service and pricing. Took in my iPhone for a cracked screen and came back and hour later to a fixed phone. Would use them again for their services. Highly recommend. 
20623 3 Good local spot...Great patio and live tunes. Good crowd on the weekend. 
20624 4 Feeling full on fresh veggies quinoa and tender chicken- perfect for middle of day- with a pleasant open atmosphere. 
20625 3 Went here for the $2 burger. I was not disappointed with the handmade patties. The beer selection was large. I'll be back here again. 
20626 3 Super friendly and always smiling. We've been using Fashionaid since moving to the neighborhood and never had a single problem either with dry cleaning or basic alterations. 
20627 4 Needed a new roof and were very happy with the service and our lovely roof! Highly recommend. She was able to help us out when we had some issues with insurance and worked with us. Thank You! 
20628 3 Most convenient apple store for a Needham resident. They carry a great selection of accessories and the wait during the week for the Genius Bar is never too long. I love their free iPhone classes too. 
20629 4 Outstanding pizza and outstanding friendly service.. Cory is very friendly and attending to service. His staff is easy going and very nice. Pizza is thin new York style and true to style. 
20630 4 Great work these guys. I wanted full auto detailing for my Mercedes C 300 sports for making it like brand new. 4 years and my car never looked more good than this. 
20631 2 Meh. Food was unremarkable. Salad was lettuce w two tomatoes, dinner was sirloin with broccolini and roasted potatoes - sadly nothing memorable. Dessert was chocolate ice cream with a soggy biscotti. I'd go elsewhere. 
20632 4 Quite possibly the best burger I have ever had. The meat was excellently seasoned. The Cajun burger was full of flavor. Will definitely be back. Worth it for sure 
20633 1 We go here frequently and everything is typically adequate. I do think people should know this morning they tried hard to sell me an empty propane tank. That was very disappointing and dishonest. 
20634 3 One word: tasty business. OK, that was two words but you get the point. Nice spin on the ol' chicken n waffles. Lots to see here. 
20635 4 The owners are so friendly and their ramen is delicious. My favorite is the spicy miso ramen (very spicy). They do not do delivery but call 10 minutes in advance and they'll have whatever you want available for pickup! Not too expensive and the portions are huge. 
20636 2 This place is just ok. Had a slice of pizza and a salad. Both were fine, but forgettable. 
20637 3 Tasty little nibbles for a dim sum Sunday brunch. Get the congee. 
20638 0 Closed down by the City/County Health Dept. Bought stolen meat from undercover police officers. http://www.kvue.com/news/Austin-restaurants-busted-for-serving-stolen-meat-to-customers-126362998.html 
20639 4 I originally checked out this place with some friends that wanted to catch the open mic night. It was fun, and I was impressed with the atmosphere, menu, and laid back people. I will be going back. I am somewhat new to the neighborhood, and this is a nice find. 
20640 4 I had a slice of the 'Zeus' pizza. Seriously maybe the best slice of pizza I've ever had because of the toppings and type of bread, etc. I'll definitely have to come back because I want to try out a lot more of the menu. 
20641 4 Our first time at this millers location, very good atmosphere, great outdoor seating area!!! Cheap beer prices for the area!! 8$ Miller lite pitchers all day every day!!! Chicken zingers omg nutty good!!! Service was great too, Nicole was great!!! 
20642 4 My favorite bar in Boston. Small, cozy, and always full of live music. The music does tend to end early though. Bartenders are incredibly friendly and strike a rapport with everyone. 
20643 3 the lobster raviolis were absolutely delicious but my dumb boyfriend was challenged by the waiter to eat a large pasta dish and it was gross watching him out how BIG it really was. seems like a fun place to take your family for a huge meal. 
20644 3 Food was on par for the experience. Slightly upscale but it's an upscale mall area. Cocktails are where they shine. Excellent bar tender with an excellent stock. Would absolutely come back. 
20645 4 This seafood restaurant is my all- time favorite. Their rock shrimp are so delicious. If you order them broiled, they seriously taste like little lobsters. Their corn fritters are addictive too. Our server was very friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is very casual. 
20646 4 Just bought a latex bliss from this lovely store. I couldn't be happier with the service. The environment of the store is very cozy and welcoming. Buying a mattress is never an easy task but this staff makes you feel like it's one of the peaceful parts of life. 
20647 4 Sweet is delicious! We picked up a dozen of assorted mini cupcakes and was happy with every flavor. Carrot Cake and Red Velvet were especially delicious. The cupcakes look just as good as they taste and the staff was friendly and very accomodating. 
20648 4 Amazing southern food at a good price! Got the chicken leg, Mac and cheese and fried okra and it was outstanding. The seasoning on the chicken was the best I've ever had. Shared a cinnamon roll for dessert and it was huge!!! Def recommend! 
20649 4 Absolutely love this place. If you like authentic and flavorful, this is the place. I've never been disappointed and everyone I've brought to the restaurant has been blown away. Thank you Pho Van! 
20650 4 My family really enjoys Lebanese food and we were very happy with our dinner here! I fell in love right away with the fresh baked bread. Yum! We also enjoyed: hummus, kibbah (fried), and the grapeleaves. I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Portland! 
20651 4 Goooooooo. They have a soup, salad, and appetizer bar that is to die for, and every dish I've tasted is delicious. So reasonably priced and excellent service. Very clean, bright, and open! I only wish I lived closer. 
20652 3 I would have to say it is the best sushi in Beaverton. It is a little pricey, but you are definately getting what you are paying for!!! 
20653 3 Ordered Peking duck and spicy pork feet. The Peking duck is a bit expensive comparing to the size of the duck. The pork feet was good. 
20654 4 Awesome Ramen I've ever had and love two girl that serve us! So sweet! definitely going next time! 
20655 3 Pretty tasty burgers with good options and drinks, but the typically endless line is what kills hopdoddys for me. I don't think it is worth the wait, but still good food. If you are a local check it out when it's not busy. 
20656 4 I LOVE Chocolate cafe! It has great food, seating,and deserts. (My granddaughter wrote that first sentence.) 
20657 4 Fantastic, expect waiting a little bit. Totally worth it though! We had the shroom burger which was insanely good also the truffle fries were amazing too! Best burgers, ever! 
20658 3 I get the soup and they do a good job. There are daily specials, so you are going to want to look up the menu and see if that day's soup options appeal to you. 
20659 3 If you're looking for an affordable dining experience with good food to boot this is your place. I appreciate that the food comes out fast so if I'm out with the kids I can quickly head out if need be without too much lingering waiting on the food! 
20660 2 I like it in general ...but the fact that it only has few selections from its menu on the website throws me off a little bit. Pricing wise, it's also pricy for the food in my opinion. 
20661 3 An extra star for the owner to reach out to me. 
20662 3 very very high end Restaurant in an unlikely location. just been there 1 time. will ABSOLUTELY return very soon. give it 4 and a half stars. prices about %15 lower than Boston but just as good quality and service. 
20663 0 I did ask for less ice, but your cashier refused to listen. Paying $5 for a cup of full iced? Even Starbucks doesn't charge that much and they have better quality tea than yours. 
20664 4 Went to Kamai Baru before watching Mad Max Fury Road. Luckily, we arrived during food happy hour. So much food at a great price with an awesome atmosphere. 
20665 4 Pretty good service and food. The perri perri chicken is pretty good especially the perri perri sauce. Tried the chisme sandvich is really good. 
20666 0 Service was ok. Place is nice on the inside. Food was bland! Only thing we ate on our plates was the refried beans cause we were so hungry. Wont go back ever. 
20667 4 I really love the food here. Also, the ladies that work here are really sweet. Definitely start with the fried pot stickers. For entrees, I have yet to have a bad one. 
20668 4 Opening weekend was awesome, good times had by all! Catch it while it lasts! - Bring friends! 
20669 2 I'll never go back because the food is overpriced and mediocre but the ambiance is nice. The food was yummy (had the begian waffles with nuts and fruit) but the server made the experience awkward and expensive 
20670 0 Recommend doing something to expedite luggage delivery to baggage claim area at Orlando airport. Very poor service. 
20671 3 I've been here a few times, and I've never had a bad experience. The chicken is always juicy and delicious! My only issue is that I wish that they had a few more straight-vegetable sides (instead of vegetable + grain) 
20672 4 It doesn't get a whole lot better for pastry. Not cheap, but excellent quality. Well worth a try. 
20673 4 Fantastic pizza; the slices are unbelievably huge! Wraps, and sandwiches are great as well. Fair price too! I would recommend this place highly. 
20674 3 it's a great farmers market in a great location, full of great produce, great food, and great people. What can I say? It's Great! 
20675 1 Pretty standard. Very expensive for the quality. It's hard to fork out $14 for chicken, beans, rice and sour cream sauce. The service was good and the staff was friendly. I will most likely return to give it another shot. 
20676 1 Downgraded you...a seat charge? At lax and they are trying to drop 10 flights worth of baggage on 2 claim belts...ugh 
20677 4 Went here for a girls night and shared a bottle of local wine and ordered the chautierre plate, bruschetta and French fries- all amazing! Loved the ambiance on the patio. We'll definitely be back. 
20678 4 CLAUDIA was amazing, she's like the wawa mama of everyone. So involved and makes sure everyone feels welcomed and that her smoothies and what not are satisfactory. She deserves to own this place tbh. Love her. 
20679 3 Love Dumpling Daughter for a quick meal. Staff is very friendly and the owner is often there and super nice. Food is simple and absolutely delicious. This is a local gem. 
20680 3 My husband and I go here for special occasions. The food is always good and we have never had bad service. I also enjoy going for their theme nights. I love the Wisconsin Cheese Trio and any of the chocolate desserts are sure to please. 
20681 4 This place is amazing. Fine menu and waitstaff. Very romantic. 
20682 1 Chipotle over Qdoba over Boloco. I don't know what more to say. I've been there only once , and decided not to go there again. And I haven't seen any individual that likes Boloco, so I guess its not just me that doesn't prefer this place. 
20683 4 Chelsea is wonderful! I have longer hair, lots of split ends, I asked to clean it up. She did a great job, added some layers and kept my length. Now I can get a comb through it. I will visit her again. 
20684 3 Solid grass-fed beef and house made veggie burgers. Great fries cut in house. Excellent bloody mary. It gets crowded and the ordering setup is unusual, but the staff is super friendly and helpful. 
20685 4 Just really good constant quality -our waiter was fine not outstanding but overall just a great place 
20686 0 I ordered a chicken salad and got a chicken sandwich instead. Order took forever didn't have time to wait around to change the order. The sandwich wasn't that good maybe it was because I was anticipating a good healthy salad instead of a unhealthy greasy sandwich. I won't be back. 
20687 3 Good, affordable food in an area lacking mid-day dining options. Nice, attentive staff, and pleasant decor. The food and service will only continue to improve over time. Now that the Scoutmob mob has died down, go give them a shot. 
20688 4 Fantastic! High price but definitely worth it! With the all you can eat you can choose anything on the menu! They make it fresh to order! 
20689 2 Food is good just don't get margarita ... They get a small cup fill it to top with ice then splash small amount of mix from dispenser...3 ..4 sips you're done. 
20690 4 I really enjoyed my time here, and the staff was incredibly inviting. I've never seen so many beer options. I plan on going back many times, as I signed up to become a loyalty member. 
20691 4 Fabulous service and really great food! I highly highly suggest the spinach and feta phyllo and spicy sausage English muffin with an espresso! 
20692 4 Luiz did a beautiful job with my hair color. Needless to say, I will go to no-one else! 
20693 2 Yelp review had prices at $$, should have been $$$ Prices were too high, more like Fisherman's Warf prices. Service good, some of out party of 8 liked their food very much, others not so much. Portions small for prices, I have eaten at upscale places before, this was pricey, 
20694 4 Got a great cut on the fly. Good old school barbershop with a twist of fun personalities. This owner understands a great customer service experience for the dude. 
20695 4 We love this place! The chicken and waffles are amazing. My husband enjoys the eggs Benedict and they were really good with the kids! 
20696 0 This should not be called Greek, because it is not. You get a lot of food, but a lot of food doesn't make it better. Don't waste your time and money. You will be disappointed. 
20697 4 Love, love this place. Always a good service with awesome food. The ambience is perfect for a nice dine out. 
20698 2 It was a nice experience. My job took us here for free with the VIP package and we got champagne. You watch a 3D film first before getting on the eye. Our tour guide was David and he was good. 
20699 4 I love Charlie. He does my gel and pedicure. My gels always last 3 weeks. Everyone here at image nails is very nice and attentive. Make an appointment if you don't want to wait. 
20700 3 Despite rumors to the contrary, staff at Waltham site insist hat the Cambridge location will reopen sometme in 2016. Great news for us Cambrige types suffering from withdrawal... 
20701 4 Great fries and absolutely cute decor make this lil neighborhood spot a gem. A+++ for vegitaran options. 
20702 4 Fast, friendly, skilled iPhone screen repair. Couldn't be happier with the work. Also reasonably priced. Will certainly return and will also recommend to friends. 
20703 4 This is the best burger in Florida. It's hot, juicy, crunchy, outrageously good. Bacon and super crisp potatoes and melts cheese and s special sauce, some avocado tucked away in there. Omg. 
20704 1 3rd time we've ordered from this location, and the 3rd time they have promised a 30 minute delivery that has taken an hour. Have had a good experience with other PJ's locations, hence the 2 stars. They should just get their delivery drivers GPS. 
20705 2 We really enjoy the food, but delivery times have gotten quite long. Please hire more drivers during peak time. 
20706 4 Good taste of bubble tea made from real fruit, will recommend. Please ignore the owner's poker face. Lol 
20707 4 Their sliders are absolutely delicious. The pulled pork and chicken sandwiches should not be missed 
20708 4 This arts center has been most accommodating with us and our every whim was met promptly. Mary is an outstanding lady who runs the place. Thank you Dougherty for all you have done now and in the future. 
20709 3 I loved everything about this place! The food and atmosphere were great! The only downside was that we waited an hour for our food. I will still go again just because the food was amazing. 
20710 3 I 've been here several times and for the most part have always had a good experience, the place is pretty clean and the service is not bad either. Overall had a great meal It's a little busy after 5pm so be prepared to wait at least 20-30 mins 
20711 3 I have seen this location go through various restaurant changes but this time the decor is interesting and comfortable. Nice wine decor. I would call about reservations. It can be busy. I have enjoyed their soups and sandwiches and flatbreads. Tasty. 
20712 0 So tonight I was looking forward to St Patrick's day at the Irish pub.I should have know it would o left.It was already crowded and the server with the green toto was not at all on point.She was not on point at all.,she needs more training for a crowd 
20713 4 Omar was incredibly easy and delightful to work with. He found me exactly the car I wanted and gave me a pretty good trade. I'd work with him again. 
20714 4 Super yummy food.. You will not be disappointed! So many vegetarian options as well..Great queso and a great variety of sauces on the side.. Customer service is spot on! 
20715 0 Didn't have anyone come over and give us water for 15 min took them 40 min to bring the appetizer the food was obviously just sitting out it wasn't even warm. Horrible service crappy food 
20716 4 Great casual bar, good food selectionals, good beer options, good atmosphere and service! 
20717 3 Came here for take-out at around 1:30am and was really quick--~15mins. I really liked the jia jian noodle!Dumplings were also decent! Will definitely return for dumplings and noodles. 
20718 3 Very very tasty, I had an amazing salad with grilled chicken, they put tons of wonderfully seasoned perfectly cooked juicy chicken in a perfectly wilted spinach salad, large flavorful pieces of feta apple and pecans in a light vinaigrette dressing. Great service awesome food. 
20719 3 Went on a Saturday afternoon with my parents (Persian dad) and really enjoyed the buffet. Not sure on the cost, but I'm pretty sure it's reasonable. The traditional dishes were all solid, and the meat was juicy and well-cooked. Solid Persian buffet experience. 
20720 4 The food is good. The queso is superb. But the avocado margarita is what has made this a landmark in Austin. Do not let the outside fool you. This place deserves 5 stars. 
20721 3 Pizza tasted the same to me as the original 's minus the "crusty" servers. Easier to park here also. 
20722 4 They responded to my call in less then 30 minutes and gave me a reasonabile price. You can tell Joe loves what he does. Thank you for the great service! 
20723 4 Best place to get a great history lesson. The people that run this place are truly wonderful. If you need help finding anything or if you are lost stop on by for a history lesson and a cool breath of fresh air. 
20724 4 The food is sooooo delicious!!!! I had the chicken, rice and cabbage!!! Very flavorful. I like the spice... The staff is very friendly also 
20725 4 I was surprised to find the bulk store, i felt like "a kid in a candy store" and just looked at everything. I purchased several things and all were reasonably priced. I loved grinding my own almond butter and paying less then a third the price. Love the concept. 
20726 4 these guys sure do coffee right. expensive but worth it. all the pour over coffees ive tried have been spectacular. 
20727 2 This place makes me sad :(. Pretty clothes, ugly prices. But good for a quick gift for a good girlfriend. 
20728 0 The window staff was completely rude...I asked for a receipt and she rolled her eyes at me...really. That is a standard given with any purchase. I asked for the manager and she was rude to him too...I will not visit this location again. 
20729 3 Shiny new Goodwill donation station situated convenient to Colonialtown and downtown - 2212 E. Colonial Drive. No retail, but they're efficient and helpful and much quicker than taking a carload of stuff up to their Winter Park boutique store, which has limited donation space. 
20730 2 NOTE- DOES NOT HAVE SUSHI. Came in under the impression they had sushi since there were a few people in our group that wanted it. Hot pot is with a checklist but it isnt buffet style. Minus one star for that and minus another for being super expensive. 
20731 4 I had pretty much ruled out Chinese food because it's always so disappointing. I went to Lucky Bistro last night with my family and we were all blown away, might be the best Chinese food I have EVER had. We will definitely be going back. 
20732 2 A very cute place to eat in the summer, because it's outdoors and colorful. They offer a lot of the same food around that area, and I think there are better options for lobster rolls and seafood. 
20733 3 Their cuban sandwich is a surprising joy, and I love coffeehouses that carry a variety of cane sugar sodas....plus they are very friendly to pets. 
20734 4 Shine was great! The guys showed up on time and did excellent work. They were courteous and professional and my windows and screens are super clean! The price was very reasonable. 
20735 0 Just called to price mount & balance on tires I purchases elsewhere and it was $15 to mount and $15 to balance so $30/tire which is just ridiculous. 
20736 0 I had explosive diarrhea after eating this Mexican monstrosity. I was absolutely shocking how bad this was. Mid way the the meal I thought about killing myself. 
20737 0 Only reason this place gets 1 star is for creativity.. we waited 30 minutes for a waitress to come over... She looked in our direction once but then never came back over.. we had menus if front of us even... FAIL. 
20738 3 Tiramisu...you haunt me. I love you. Get these donuts. If you can't wait for VooDoo, this is also a great idea. 
20739 3 My food was great. Samosas and naan and Mughlai Chicken was really really good. I wish I had two extra stomachs. 
20740 4 いつもLAからラスベガスに行く途中のお楽しみが、オースティンにあった！！生のポテトを使ったフライドポテトは好き嫌いあるかもですが、ぼくは大好物。バーガーも、普通のものをちゃんと作ったら最高においしい！ってことの好例。ここと、静岡のさわやかはいつ東京にお店出してくれるのだろう‥あ！どこにも書いてないんですが、ポテトもバーガーもアニマルスタイルにできます。ポテトの場合はポテトの上にバーガーのソースとチーズかかったやつです。 
20741 4 One of my favorite spots for lunch I love the Rey Cuban and the jerk chicken sandwich. The music and layout make it very intimate and a nice spot for meeting friends. 
20742 0 I went to AZ Studio and Spa for cut and color. I had a very disappointing hair/color experience with my stylist. Please save your money. 
20743 3 The Wives Burger is one of the best burgers in town and hardly anyone knows about it. Cool friendly atmosphere and nice staff. Sometimes they have some nice weirdos making strange music too , which is always nice. 
20744 1 Cold over cooked eggs. Hash browns had a taste of dish soap from a pan that was not fully rinsed. At least I know they clean their kitchen equipment! Pancakes were awesome! Would only come back just to order pancakes. 
20745 4 A welcome addition to east Austin. Interior Mexican in a beautifully designed setting. Fantastic service, delicious and thoughtful food and great cocktails. They obsessed over the details and it shows. I wish we could keep this place a secret, but no chance. Well done y'all. Welcome to the neighborhood! 
20746 0 The owner of the store does not give the employees brakes or lunches! It has been reported. But nothing has been done as of yet :( I feel bad for anyone who works here. 
20747 4 The new owner has redone the whole restaurant.. And the food is all homemade.. Great homemade pies also 
20748 4 This place is seriously the best! Their donuts are AH-MAZING, and they are always coming up with new and inventive flavors. The churro and the strawberry passion fruit have been my favorite flavors so far. So fluffy, SO GOOD. 
20749 4 Amaaaaaaazing coffee. Tasted like ice cream. Best coffee I've had in a long time. A little pricey (even compared to starbucks) but still delicious. Free wifi, perfect environment to study! 
20750 4 The food was great good taste to it alittle expensive but worth it service was great very happy with it. 
20751 3 Food was good-- and fast. I ordered souvlaki sub-- I wished they toasted the bread and more feta -- but it was good. 
20752 4 I have been eating here for years. The food is awesome. David and his staff know how to treat you right when dining in. One of my favorite take-out places in Louisville. Never had a disappointing meal from here 
20753 0 Extremely poor service, long wait for our food, wrong drink orders, and the food was not good enough to make up for all that. I was really excited about trying this pub out and took out-of-towners there and it was a huge mistake. Save your money and time. 
20754 4 All the employees here are helpful and always friendly. Kerrin is amazing! Her coloring and cuts are fantastic. I have recommended to many people who use her. 
20755 0 Tried for a ticket for one of tonight's showing-no go even with a disability and no ability to wait in lines the festival is not a good host. Super unhelpful and not interested in really serving the disabled population of Portland. 
20756 3 Went tonight and thepotato encrusted Talapia wasgood as usual.My wife had the poblano pasta dinner special, I tried it and it was was great! The service was very good(Steven). 
20757 3 Not exactly NY style, but really good. Especially for Austin. Love the fresh garlic and fresh basil. ;) The coupons are good too. We picked up so we can't say how the delivery was. 
20758 4 This is definitely a hidden gem. I'll probably never go to dunkin doughnuts again since the coffee and doughnuts here are excellent and taste less processed. The owners are a sweet little couple and I love supporting these kinds of businesses. Stop by, grab a coffee and a doughnut. 
20759 4 Very satisfied Customer! Reasonable quote, work done as committed, all communication was very timely and professional. Bottom line, I will call A's Tree Sevice the next time I need work done. 
20760 4 Was visiting Austin a few months ago and popped in here. Fabulous experience all around - nice associates, amazing product lines. Were they oiverly friendly? Maybe a bit. It was still great though - I was impressed and would definitely come back here next time in Austin, 
20761 4 Wow, What a breakfast! Definitely worth the wait. Had the fricassee and selected a waffle to go. Great portion requiring a nice long walk to Stanley Park. The place opens at 9am so be there early if you want to make the first sitting on a Sunday morning. 
20762 3 The food is really good, most authentic I have had in years but every time I eat there it messes my stomach up so bad, and I try something different every time but they have all been chicken based... so maybe it is the chicken I don't know. 
20763 4 The best pasta in Vancouver, bar none. Consistently and exceptional good, the pasta here is made fresh in house daily. The traditional roman pastas are really the highlight, from the cacio & pepe to the various iterations of guanciale. We dine here regularly, and it never disappoints. 
20764 4 I am blessed that I bought a house around the corner from Leal's. Anytime I get a flat, it's fixed in less than 15 minutes. They stay open kind of late, too... 6 or 7 pm...? 
20765 4 So lucky to find this excellent shop near where I was staying in Portland. They got my car finished in one day at a lower cost than I feared. 
20766 2 It's...fine. The cranberry chicken salad tastes suspiciously like the stuff Costco sells, and the layout is cluttered, chaotic, and really needs a cleaning, but it's fine. OK prices, OK coffee. You will, unfortunately, leave reeking of the grill. 
20767 4 Excelente lugar hermosa vista mucha naturaleza areas para hacer picnic el rio muy bonito y limpio. 
20768 1 Decent food but the location is absolutely taken advantage of to scale up the price and shirk down the quality. If you're willing to make the trip, go somewhere else. 
20769 3 I've been in NY for so long I forgot grits were a Southern charm! Grits, stewed collards, scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon and cornbread, OH MY! "The Southern" is what I had... I shall return. 
20770 3 forget Franklin's. this place has consistently tender, tasty bbq. 
20771 4 Happy to report this little Italian Cafe is still as charming and delicious as ever. We recently just had dinner and the pasta was wonderful as well as the seafood. Always friendly service any time of day inside or out. 
20772 4 A little slice of the South in Massachusetts. Grits, Fried Chicken and Waffles, Fried Okra, BBQ Pulled Pork, Corned Beef Hash, and Peach Cobbler. If these things sound good to you, go here. 
20773 2 The food is good but it's pricey. There are no competition around so you have to pay the price. Great friendly service and food is fresh. 
20774 4 Great Pork Ribs and Brisket!! Can't wait to go back!! The atmosphere was nice also!! Thanks Terry Black for coming to Austin!! 
20775 4 Great for a business lunch. Also fantastic for date night. The staff is wonderful. The food looks and tastes great. Nice indoor and outdoor seating. 
20776 4 I really like this McMenamins. I always sit at the bar and have the half tuna sandwich and a salad. It is always great. If I lived closer I'd have a couple IPAs to go with it! 
20777 0 The second most racist place in Atlanta. Never go here if you are black or an advocate for social justice. Also, the food tastes like dog poo mixed with bad cocktail sauce. Good trivia host on Mondays, though. 
20778 3 One of the best kept secrets in Orlando, in our opinion. We make dinner here a vacation tradition. Consistently good food, tasty and savory not greasy. Beautiful presentation. Service may be a little slow but always polite. Live music (harp and guitar) round out the evening nicely. 
20779 4 This place has super low lighting, very chill vibe, and kind of divey atmosphere. Had the pulled pork eggs Benedict and a half waffle. Waffles were so good they tasted like funnel cake. Will definitely return 
20780 3 The large Pizza is a little small, but taste is great!!! You need to get the bread sticks. They are hot, soft and in a garlic/butter sauce, KILLER!!! We spent 2 days here and went both nights for dinner. 5 stars if the pizza was bigger. 
20781 2 counter people as nice as can be, but the other patrons are a little weird. and always there. i had a sandwich here recently and felt like i was sitting in on a club meeting or something. the sandwich was turkey, nothing fantastic. 
20782 4 This is my go to coffee spot ANYTIME I'm in Austin. Love the summermoon latte! Wish they had one in Houston to feed my addiction to this unique coffee place! 
20783 4 I love Bloc 11. They have amazing sandwiches! My personal favorite is the Fairy. So delicious! I also really enjoy their Brazilian lime-aid and pecan sticky buns. Their coffee isn't bad either. It's a little dark for my taste, but with enough cream and sugar it's quite tasty. 
20784 1 The food was good. The seating was very minimal 10 chairs max at 3 tables. The wait was pretty considerable to with small portions. Good for light to go food or a gluten free option. 
20785 0 Coffee was ok, staff was nice, but they shouldn't be serving food. Not properly heated bland sandwich. They don't even have salt or pepper to improve the boring thing. 
20786 2 Classy stuff. Again, the ladies seem to love the place. Purchased my share of gifts here. 
20787 2 not bad. i'm not a big fan of pan asian -- fusion, sometimes; pan, usually not. but there were some yummies here. stick with the sushi -- excellent. 
20788 2 They have great zumba instructors here. Equipment is ok. Wish they would open later on weekends as I work 2 weekends a month and can't make it to the gym after work on those days. 
20789 4 Sojust is a great place to meet like minded people And have some wholesome fun! 
20790 3 The service was good and they accommodated my party very well. I called and let them know we were a group of visually impaired individuals and they were very helpful with accommodating everyone! The food was good as well! 
20791 0 Customer service is atrocious (attitudes galore) and the check-out lines are ridiculous. Typically, it's two open registers during dinner hours and the lines are backed up into the isles. This location is poorly run to put it mildly. 
20792 3 Just went here for lunch. Food is pretty good but a little overpriced for what you are getting. I had the Monument chicken salad which was really good, just not amazing. I'd come back if I'm in the area but wouldn't go out of my way to revisit. 
20793 3 Nice rooms, clean facility, good price. Rooms have stove, microwave, frig. Very skimpy continental breakfast...instant oatmeal, packaged muffins and granola bars. No fruit, yogurt, bagels... Coffee was decent, but only powdered creamer. Conveniently located across from a good grocery store! 
20794 4 I'm back again. They're playing MGMT right now and how can that not put you in a good mood? Anyways, drinking the Honey Latte today. So delicious! Believe it or not, you can actually taste a hint of honey flavor. Mmm. 
20795 2 Try this place for Happy Hour. It has a cute bar area. The menu was average. Not the best choice of beer on tap and the prices weren't great. I would maybe go back but I always want to walk over to Little Woodrow's instead. 
20796 3 One of the decent Chinese buffets in the orlando area. It's lacking in customer service which would be the only downfall. The food isn't amazing but it's one of the better Chinese buffets I have eaten at. Will definitely go back. 
20797 4 Jackpot ! Came to downtown before my flight out. Needed a good coffee some place with wifi to get some work done. Easy parking, nice and clean, two story with modern design and friendly staff and gooooodd coffee.. Not that many choices to eat so don't come here hungry. 
20798 3 I've ordered non-sushi dishes, and they were all very good. The wait for the food is pretty long, though. 
20799 3 Great location and warm environment. I have treated myself to several of their signature pedicures here and never been dissapointed. 
20800 4 Great fish and chips! Atmosphere was awesome... I forgot my to-go box, our waiter ran after me in the parking lot with my leftovers -- great restaurant !!!!! oh, and the hushpuppies! Shout out to the conch fritters! 
20801 4 Superb food, great prices. This place has a hookah bar on the enclosed patio and is connected to Java Lords Coffee House. I love to eat those awsome Gyros Gokhan makes! If you want a real taste of Atlanta, hit this spot up. 
20802 4 Dr. Welch is a perfectionist. Extremely detailed and also very kind and caring. Just person you want when you need a root canal. Dr. Welch with his decades of experience is perfectly matched for his chosen profession. 
20803 4 Still yummy and stick to your tummy. Pretty healthy too. If anything, the food has only improved. Had the "special" spicy black bean hummus with Bison today. Hit the SPOT! Thanks Bob & Mrs. Bob! 
20804 4 Stopped in for an iced coffee drink before a pedicure next door. There are tons of flavored drink choices on the menu (hot and cold). The chocolate chai was perfect and hit the spot. There were lots of folks sitting in the comfy seating working and chatting. Nice quaint spot. 
20805 4 Here again. The location on piedmont is by far my favorite, all of the servers are wonderful. I had Marlon today and he went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Had the roasted chicken soup and lavender latte. Yum! 
20806 3 We had plebes on going to Vortex. But decided to try something new. We ordered Bloody Marys, which while they tasted great, they had absolutely no flair. There wasn't even a celery stick in it! Besides that, the food and service was great! 
20807 1 Very average Mexican food. I honestly don't like Mexican much, but this was very predictable. 
20808 4 I love visiting historical sites! Absolutely gorgeous mansion. The view is one of a kind! 
20809 4 This was one of my favorite finds in Austin. I went around 2 on a Monday and there was still a line. The whole place is adorable and has a very Austin vibe to it. Try their Berdie sanders! 
20810 4 Yelp brought us here after a tired day out. It's a small authentic Mexican joint run by friendly Mexican ladies who provided some of the best service you can get. Food was super tasty and very authentic. True to it's name. Love it. Take this on the order and chili's 
20811 4 I was skeptical about the doughnut part but once I tried it I immediately became a fan. We stayed in Austen for a week, this is the best restaurant that we ate at. 
20812 4 This place is the best. They do a a better job than the expensive places in Boston and the prices are the best I have seen anywhere in the area. I got pedi, gel mani and eyebrow wax for only $58. They always are super meticulous and friendly. 
20813 4 Great diverse selection of bagels, new location is very nice. Bagel sandwiches are fantastic. 
20814 4 This is our go to spot for take out. They deliver an insanely consistent product literally every time we order from them. I also feel the prices are extremely fair for the quality and amount of food we get. 
20815 3 We enjoy their beef fajita's on wednesday (Special price!). The word is getting out though, because the crowds are getting heavier. Service is usually good to great, depending on how large the crowds are... 
20816 4 Fantastic Asian food in the heart of Animal Kingdom in Disney. The fried rice is out of this world. 
20817 4 I usually change my own oil but haven't ha d to do it so brought it in and only took ~5 minutes, very friendly and great service. 
20818 2 Pizza was not bad- when delivered it was completely stuck to the top of the box. I called back to complain and they sent a new one. Give em' credit for service. 
20819 1 Service was really slow, but the food was made fast. Got spinach and mushroom enchiladas and a steak fajita. Everything looked microwaved, not very good. Prices are cheap, good for college kids looking for cheap, quick food. 
20820 4 Well, that's some damn fine pie! Purchased a couple of pies and quiche to share with my officemates, and they loved 'em. I enjoyed my "delivery charge" of the morning breakfast egg sandwich--so flavorful and satisfying. 
20821 3 i tried this subway and thought it was really good i enjoyed the tuna sandwich a lot and i am going to come back 
20822 3 The food is excellent! Both times I went there was a bit of a wait before anyone came to us, but our waiter was great! Would recommend highly! 
20823 2 Atmosphere is very franchisey also the menu seems to be very westernised? Still a good menu not a fan of their sauces or the fact that you have to pair them together, good idea but i dont think it works :( other than that not a bad place 
20824 4 LOVE their house salad. The dressing is admittedly tart (which I like), super light, and all around delicious. The salad also comes with a soft homemade slice of baguette. I wish they stayed open later to accommodate dinner! Never enough San Francisco Bakery. 
20825 4 Without a doubt..THE BEST service as far as high-end boutiques are concerned. None of the sales-team act possessed unlike some other high-end stores with 3rd world service LOL!! Im sure most of you know these stores..Ferragamo is definitely THE REAL DEAL!!! Cant wait for the new store opening in August!!! 
20826 1 Great TV's, and $2 Natty Lights. I have tried the food a million times and I can't take it anymore. $5 burgers on Monday is the only food I like at Hudson. 
20827 0 The worst ramen place I've ever been to. plain soup, tasteless pork, cold pork bum, are you kidding me. They don't even have the real ramen noodle. DO NOT GO!!! 
20828 4 Just stayed here for a conference and was pleased with the room, customer service and food choices. I highly recommended this hotel and will be back soon. 
20829 2 I decided to give this place another chance since I live above it and found their lunch chirashi donburi special. Pros: good quality seafood, diverse menu, cool decor. Cons: bit overpriced, staff smoking outside handling food. Would go again 
20830 3 Very nice sports restaurant and bar. They have a lot on the menu and everything I've had has been great. They also had a good salad selection fair prices, fast and friendly service 
20831 1 Food was alright! Nothing spectacular. They really need to get a fly trapper! Our food was a total waste with all the flys landing on it. 
20832 4 College Traditions is THE destination for anyone needing to buy Buckeye gear! The owner, Kelly Dawes, is amazing and believe me her middle name should be "Customer Service". This is a great store !!! 
20833 4 Best yoga studio in Boston. There is such a great variety of classes, and all of the teachers are great. I love it here. One of my favorite classes is relax and renew--Sabbi is the absolute best. 
20834 4 This place is top notch. Food is great and service is phenomenal. Reasonably priced for the delicious food! All you can eat and the food is always fresh and yummy. I come here a lot! 
20835 3 Great food always at claim Jumpers I must admit I do miss the salad bar. Service was good team approach so many pick up to ensure no drops in service. The chicken pot pie is great but the chocolate calzone is amazing dessert for two. 
20836 0 Poor service. The food was very bad. The bar staff during the day extremely unfriendly It was a Friday lunch. Hopefully the owners/managers read the reviews. Been going there for a very long time, it seems to be getting worse each time. Won't be going there again. 
20837 4 Great service. Patched my run flat and fast. They came through in a pinch and they made me feel welcome. 100% would recommend them 
20838 0 Just gross. Grease running off the bacon onto the plate. Hash browns was cooked with so much oil they had oil in the middle of the Hash browns. 
20839 1 One of the better 24 hour pho places in the Burmaby area. Staff isn't too friendly but at least the food comes out fast. Good for groups. 
20840 4 I haven't went there and years and me and my family had an amazing time we went it was our first time back in over 15 years roller coasters are a great upgrade and my kids love them as well 
20841 4 So excited to have Napa Flats in Austin. The food is incredible. I highly recommend it! 
20842 4 Best food and service ever! I love the West midtown location the manager Rita is everything and shot out to our waitress LaNae! 
20843 4 Love this place. If you're a meat lover then this place is for you. The empanadas are awesone. The bacon wrapped dates are great and all the main courses I've tried were very good too. 
20844 2 This place is super cute and has a great selection of clever gifts and trinkets. Just wish it was more reasonably priced. 
20845 4 Extraordinarily kind barista, socially conscious establishment, nice vibe, delicious coffee with unsweetened oat milk as one alternative to cream, and delicious hot cider too. 
20846 4 We love this place! Happy hour specials, attentive staff and tasty sushi! Do you need to be anywhere else? I think not! Sunday is all day happy hour!!! Our favorite rolls are Fiery Kiss, Hottie Susie and Chorishis Fire. Fish is fresh - flown in from Japan. 
20847 4 Great Happy Hour!! from 4pm each night...$1 oysters and fantastic shrimp cocktail. Servers are always friendly, well worth a stop at happy hour, get there early for a seat! 
20848 4 Alex was our waiter and he was very personable! The tacos are awesome and the nachos huge! The barbacoa and carnitas were especially good! 
20849 4 We ordered take out after a long day at Universal. Pizza, hot wings and a salad hit the spot! It was difficult to eat in our hotel room, as they did not provide utensils or napkins, but we should have asked. Food was delicious and hot! 
20850 4 Best food since I hit Florida! If you like real authentic Mexican food this is the place. Great atmosphere and Fabulous food!!! 
20851 2 Great meal when it came to the local-Indian dishes. The Palak Paneer was somewhat dry. 
20852 4 Found this place shortly after moving to Atlanta a few months ago. Consistent service, fairly priced, and almost never a wait. 
20853 3 We stopped here after a very long drive and ordered the tofu pad thai and tofu gang guree. Both were good and the guy at the counter was super helpful. 
20854 4 I have eaten here many times over the past year of living in Sanford and every time has been great! It is a fun place to eat with friends and the food is consistently tasty. I find myself craving the spatzle all the time. Will continue to dine here! 
20855 1 Food is way overpriced and the service is mediocre. The drinks and guacamole are the only things worth coming here for. 
20856 4 Awesome pizza, easy to order. Service was even better. Gentleman behind the counter was fantastic and went out of his way to provide great service. I'll be back! 
20857 4 I've been very happy with the few massages I've had here. I especially like Daymond. 
20858 4 This place is fantastic. Our server was very attentive and brought the food cart around every few minutes. The pakora and potatoes were our favorites, but I surprisingly liked everything on the tray. At only $10 a plate, you'd be hard pressed to find a better Indian place in Marietta. 
20859 3 We love this place. Great customer service and you can't beat the quality of the tea. Boba is the best here. Hope they will soon accept their Kung fu tea app so purchasing is even easier. 
20860 4 Bought a Honda Fit for my daughter from this place. The service was excellent personalized and honest. The sales person Mr. Cliff Hudson was just great! Next time I am in the market for a car it will have to be a Honda from Curry Honda. 
20861 4 Cheap and easy haircuts comes complete with a free beer. Definitely more of a guys hair place. They once messed up on my hair but the manager overheard my story and gave me a freebie and did an awesome job. The staff here is awesome! 
20862 4 This is one of my favorite coffee shops in Columbus. Great coffee, friendly staff, and great location. 
20863 4 Love, love, love this place! One of my favorite spots! The burgers are amazing and the service is great! I have not had a negative experience as of yet. I highly recommend the burned marshmallow nutella shake with the Butchers Cut Burger. Delicious! 
20864 4 This hot-dog cart shows up on the SE corner of 12th and Main during the heart of weekdays. You won't find a better dog in the city, unless it's on a leash. 
20865 3 Very nice atmosphere Lovely people Very attentive Nice polishes Kind service Ok location at the Gaylord I would definitely recommend coming here! 
20866 4 Fantastic experience. You have to try it to believe how fun it is. Stephanie was a first class belayer. It was our first time and she was so nice and helpful. 
20867 3 Very relaxing and my salad was good. Would give 5 stars if it had been a bigger price of chicken with the salad. 
20868 4 Been coming here for years. great Tex mex style Mexican food and there is an extensive menu to choose from with something for everyone 
20869 4 Remarkable assortment of domestic & imported candy, fudge made in the store, Truffles, coffee, and vegan ice cream. The goodies are only outdone by the friendly & helpful staff. A must visit! 
20870 4 Cambria and Dr. Chen are highly professional, friendly and knowledgeable people. Definitely recommend these people! 
20871 0 The owner called me a bitch (He said he was the boss)today because I didn't want to miss my bus.. I asked him how long and he went off I wouldn't eat from here if they was giving out food 
20872 3 Hot and Sour soup was 3 stars Entrees were 5 stars. Their House Chicken is incredibly good as is their Sesame Beef. 
20873 3 This place is always packed, and with good reason: "The Diablo." If you like spicy, juicy, loaded burgers, Hopdoddy will deliver every single time. NOM! 
20874 4 Delicious! Probably the best Ethiopian food I've had. The service was great, the ambiance relaxed but cozy. I'll definitely be going back. 
20875 0 After 3:40 on hold I will never know if the food is good but I can say the service when trying to order for delivery is horrible. 
20876 4 Amanda is amazing! I have done SNS for the second time with her and my nails are literally perfect and have grown so much. I'm super picky but she has exceeded my expectations. :) 
20877 4 Today was my first of many future visits ! Great roast beef sandwich and awesome potato salad. 
20878 3 Quick delivery. Good variety. Above average food. I like the Cobb salad, though I always ask for the bacon to be cooked extra because otherwise it's underdone and squishy. 
20879 2 The seating outside is great ! They make a good salad but the entree's leave a lot to be desired. The pesto sauce is too greasy and the pasta has been a bit over cooked. 
20880 4 Great food. Hidden gem. The wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. I also love that they serve lunch anytime. 
20881 4 Consistently good food, friendly service, and great value. Can't be beat for traditional diner-style breakfast. A great old-school spot for locals and newcomers alike. 
20882 3 Oh, how I love thee! Please now that you are getting popular, stay awesome...maybe a little add-on space? Best affordable facials, I know of. 
20883 4 Quite possibly the best cuisine I've had in 20 years in Portland..matched by excellent service..it's definitely worth the expense if you want a real treat. 
20884 4 Sorry Charlie! This is the default go-to steakhouse in Orlando as far as I am concerned.Great Service! Reasonably priced for what it is, and I liked the food. 
20885 4 The best pizza I think I've ever had! Everything is fresh and made right there no frozen dough ! The crust was perfect! It's worth the trip ! 
20886 4 Great cocktails! The manger Steve is so down to earth and welcoming. Sunday's have fantastic buffets. I've never had a bad meal, at the grandview location! 
20887 4 LOVE this place. Loved Dr. Leeks and Dr. Rodriguez has been great as well. Staff is very kind and friendly, have been going here for years. 
20888 4 This is one of my favorite lunch places in town. The gyro is amazing. Also try the roasted chicken wrap. I love their fresh pita bread and the hummus is to die for. They also carry Ahmad Tea, which is getting hard to find. 
20889 4 These guys are very passionate about their coffee and the way it's made. Delicious, charming coffee bar. The shop is very new, it is a sister store to Simon's which has been a mainstay in the area for over 10 years. 
20890 2 Items are way too spicy! If they tone down the spice level a little bit, it would be a pretty decent meal with no lingering pain the next day. 
20891 1 Inconsistent. One good experience, and the next time was awful. One pizza had too much sauce, the other hardly any at all. Both were overly doughy and thick, a really disappointing experience at much too high a price. We won't be going back. 
20892 3 Great food in a city with limited options for non chain food. The service was good but the use of products and menu mix allow this restaurant to stand above the rest in Orlando. 
20893 3 The rub has a bit too much salt but other than that , spot on! Great sides- mac and cheese, green beans and killer potato salad. Nice seleof local beers to wash it all down. 
20894 4 This place is amazing and I'd like to take it home with me. Service was excellent, drinks were refreshingly delicious. Great way to start..or end an evening! 
20895 4 Top notch first class BBQ joint. This place is truly fantastic. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. The food is wonderful and fresh. We will be back. 
20896 4 I had my 1st Dental Visit here 3 weeks ago AND, I can honestly say, Dr R.Justin Tooke performed THE BEST EXAM & TEETH CLEANING, I'VE EVER HAD and the whole staff is Fa-Bu-lous--especially Ms Heather!!! #BestDentistInPDX #HeritageDentalOfcRoCks #HappiestTeethEver 
20897 4 Called for help in the very last minute and they showed up the next day! On time and fast moving! Great service and good pricing! Highly recommended!!! 
20898 2 Great food, great service, food are presented very artistically and uniquely. However, servings are small. Don't be seated near the door as cold air comes in every time somebody comes on or out, and it's annoying. We were moved to another table. Overall, great dining experience. 
20899 4 They got the hottest girls in here. Especially that cute Asian chick, she makes my heart melt. 
20900 4 Wonderful store. Not your typical ace hardware. It's got a personal touch for the surrounding area. Service is amazing and they carry many essentials that midtowners may want for their condos. Saves me trips from driving to Home Depot. They're also dog friendly. Highly recommend. 
20901 3 Great service! My server was very attentive, apologized for the change in servers and make sure we got our food on time!! I will eat here again!! 
20902 2 Heavy on concept and schtick. Soggy crust and dough wasn't great. Sauce wasn't bad but couldn't save the whole thing. Throw in surly service and voila - three stars. 
20903 3 Food: excellent Service: slow Menu: short and to the point Drinks: tasty To try: waffles with the white chocolate sauce Nicety: Cast iron pan as the serving dish 
20904 4 They've recently revamped this place and while the food was always good, the ambiance and menu are now better as well. Free eggrolls! 
20905 4 This was fabulous! We had the warm sweet potato salad, the swordfish and the duck stuffed pasta with drinks. 
20906 2 Starbucks, everything you would expect. The staff is friendly, they are usually fully stocked with lots of goodies. The wait times here can vary greatly because of its location in the financial district. 
20907 3 If you lovr chocolate you will love this little chocolate nook. Sweet treat for downtown disney. Large variety of flavors for there famous chocolates. Friendly staff, free sample as you walk in the door! Whats not to love. 
20908 3 Breathtakingly tasty! Venduras, atun de tataki tiradito and palitas de yuca. It's like there is a party in my mouth and everyone is invited! 
20909 1 The ambience, the seating, - all of that is the good stuff. But the sushi!! That's a different story. Gyoza The service is ok but need to improve 
20910 4 I've had many meals at both Uchi and Uchiko, and I continually vacillate between which is the better dining experience. Uchiko is a larger space and feels a bit trendier and sleeker than Uchi, but matches its predecessor in both food and service. You can't lose. 
20911 4 Love this coin operated family run laundromat and they are also great for dry cleaning. I took a huge blanket there and they made sure that it didn't shrink. It was much better than I expected. 
20912 2 i didnt order a bagel but i order black coffe which i should try next time bt i like the people are nice and have good choice of music and also the place is kept nice 
20913 4 Service was great! The food delicious! And the wine was perfect! Pretzel bread al the way!!! 
20914 2 The drinks are good but, the burritos are small and little weak. They look like tacos, with a little of meat in them.. Bottom line is that this place is ok.. 
20915 0 Just had the worst experience at this Red Robin. There were seven of us and half of our food was cold ( mac and cheese and vege burger). Not good 
20916 2 Meh. Average Thai food at above average prices. The menu offers nothing new or creative. Just the standard Thai fare. Prices are easily 50-100% higher than better quality food from restaurants in Woburn and Lowell. Next time I will drive an extra 5 minutes. 
20917 3 Went in late last night for a slice of pie and it was delicious. Crispy bread and great flavor. Regretted not getting another slice to go. Will come back on my next visit to Portland. 
20918 3 Great tuna melt and numerous refills in my iced tea at lunch. Very nice waitress. The locals show up for lunch around 1:30, so at noon in a weekday we practically had the place to ourselves. I'm going back to try the smothered fries 
20919 4 Can't get much better. 1 dinner came a little late so the manager apologized and didn't charge at all. Waiter was one of the best I've ever had before. Will be back... 
20920 4 Stacey is wonderful. She is very pleasant, knowledgeable and professional. I started getting facials here before my wedding and I enjoyed it so much that I have been going for years now. The services are excellent. I love the products she sells. I highly recommend. 
20921 4 I have purchased many love pop cards.They are beautiful and unique.You name the occasion,love pop has it. 
20922 4 brought us umbrellas for sun. Great service and super burgers, fries and shakes. Bean burger was awesome. Loud and fun. Price was good and quality excellent. Great staff and friendly. Went with locals and can see why this place is hopping. Fries are awesome and shakes killer too. 
20923 4 This place is always good. Good food, good drinks and good beer. Love the atmosphere too, very different from lots of our restaurants in portland. I love that you can come here and be kind of fancy or just causal and it all works. Soo happy it re opened 
20924 4 Clean, quiet and best massage in Portland. They will work out trouble spots if you need. Great for men and women. 
20925 3 I've had their beef shawarma and falafel sandwiches, and the Jallab beverage. Everything was fresh and tasted great. A Solid 4 stars. 
20926 2 We came with my parents for my partner's birthday dinner. Prices are reasonable and the dishes were good and flavourful. The best part is the wait staff did not try to oversell their expensive dishes at seasonal prices. 
20927 3 Vertical stacking Conceal a dust of chaos. Bibliophile's dream (review in haiku) 
20928 4 Crazy awesome late night happy hour!! Anywhere from 2 to 5 dollars and it all tastes so good. They also have a purple slushy drank that is a must have! We had great service at the bar and will definitely be back. 
20929 3 The beer is good as usual and the pizza is not to bad. Getting here can be a challenge if you're not familiar with the area. Also.... they only have one size beer. Those of us who would like less are ouyof luck. 
20930 3 Would have given 5 stars but one of my guests eggs benedict order was cold along with her potatoes. My omelet was amazing. 
20931 1 Uhhh...it's convenient. Go here if you like fresh made sandwiches or wraps that are lathered in sauce and have chicken that tastes like its from a can. 
20932 4 An amazing menu of Vegan tacos. Sometimes their wait can be a little long, but they have a great atmosphere of outdoor seating. Between good chats & provided games, time spent here is only enhanced by the anticipation of truly heavenly tacos. 
20933 4 These guys are simply awesome. Delicious food. Yummy drinks. Kick ass staff. They rock! 
20934 3 I was pretty impressed with Produce Row Cafe. Small menu, but all the right choices. Loved sitting on the patio which had a cozy urban garden feel. 
20935 3 The best tortas in the city! Good food, excellent service, and great location - love this place! 
20936 4 Just wanted to add another 5 stars for Rivamist who just saved my hair after a bleaching disaster. I will be going back there for as long as I physically am able to. 
20937 4 Love this no-frills place! The owner and staff are very kind and attentive. We have gone back every Saturday for the past few week. The French crullers are amazing and I personally love the chocolate coconut one! Great price for 1/2 a dozen too! 
20938 4 Low in cost, but not in flavor and creativity. Can't wait to be back. Awesome dipping sauces 
20939 0 Pathetic service!! Some of the waitresses are really lousy and disrespectful.. looks like they treat you based on your skin color depending on how much they think you tip. At least that's what my husband and I heard from a waiter who finally served us when asked about what's happening? 
20940 4 This place is awesome and it is not your typical resturant! Drinks and food is awesome ! 
20941 3 Their food is pretty good considering the price they serve it for and they have daily specials for lunch and dinner during the week. They also have drink specials for every night of the week. There's usually a wait for dinner but lunch isn't too bad. 
20942 4 Cool lunch time vibe, great service, and I saw Mea Whiteman! Lol. One tip! Don't order the cottage fries if your meal comes with it! Huge portion of fries! I'll build this review out more soon! My pictures are worth enough to hold u over 
20943 1 Friendly staff, cute restaurant, but not the best food. The French toast was soggy and cold and the cheese wasn't melted in the eggs. I don't think they make the food fresh. And they use plastic plates which looks cheap. 
20944 3 Decent place to grab a drink in the summer and get seafood. Even though it's a tourist trap it has a great view of the city. Living in southie i would frequent this place and enjoy going there. No complaints here. 
20945 4 Went to dinner with the husband here last night. Food was fabulous and the service was fantastic! Some of the best service we have had since moving here. Portions are perfect and food was authentic. 
20946 4 I invited 24 of my friends to visit this place since its in the neighborhood and I'm Moroccan. We had a great experience all around. Service was great and food was authentic, delicious, and the portions were generous. I highly recommend this place ! 
20947 3 I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak that was awesome. Had to grab it to go (about a 10 min. wait) and eat it at the gate, but it was worth it. Wish there was one of these restaurants back home. 
20948 3 It's a medium sized sephora. Expect to pay full retail for department store+ creams and lotions. The main reason to shop here is that won't be dealing with the comissioned sales "women" working the cosmetics section of the bloomingdales next door. 
20949 4 Outstanding food and value. Good service...they will help you understand the menu if you are new to Indian food. THE place to eat Indian in Austin! 
20950 1 The food was OK. I thought the rice was the best. We got orange and general chicken. Potstickers were a little better than average. If you like heavily fried, huge pieces of meat, you'll like it! 
20951 4 This is my go to shop, the staff is very friendly and knowledgable. They have a good selection of products to choose from. 
20952 4 OK this is what Texmex is!!! and the drinks are great!!! only takes one!! but two is always fun!! great service and awesome food....did I mention they have cabrito!!!! not many places do and I doubt it's this good yumm!!!! 
20953 4 Best crabs I ever had. The owner showed me how to eat crawfish. He literally went in the back, put on some rubber gloves and demonstrated how to eat them. Very nice staff and very good prices. 
20954 4 If you are in Austin this is a fantastic place for Texas barbecue. The sauce is a tasty and the ribs fall off the bone. It is a little bit pricey, but the quality is on point 
20955 3 Wood fire pizza cooked perfect. Excellent wine list and fantastic and attentive service. We love bringing family and friends here. Grab seat at the bar with a glass of rose if you are waiting for take out. 
20956 4 Really fun concept. Great wine list! So fun to see underrepresented wine regions, natural wines, a nice balance of styles with a general unity. 
20957 3 The food is pretty good, you get what you pay for. The same goes for the drinks. The service is okay. It always seems like the servers have a bit of an attitude and take a while to warm up. Great outdoor seating and inside doesn't get too crowded. 
20958 4 I've been buying espresso beans from Common Ground since last October. Excellent coffee, roasted to perfection...and not over roasted like some. My espresso machine loves it too! It's always busy...with cool-looking people. Kind of small so don't be surprised if there's a bit of a wait during busy times. 
20959 4 The staff are the greatest. They helped me with a marriage proposal. Plus not to mention the food was fabulous. 
20960 3 This place is awesome! Great stop for all you bakers out there for your holiday baking needs. Get the s'mores trail mix. You will thank me later. You're welcome. 
20961 4 Love the Lantana Cafe! Like the first poster said, fresh food well prepared, and reasonable prices. I often get the mushroom pasta, which is homemade and heavenly; my partner reliably goes for the cod/salmon/swordfish, and is never disappointed. Now they take credit cards as well! 
20962 4 If there's a "best of Atlanta" designation for fajitas this place should win it hands-down! Used to be a regular here until I moved out of the neighborhood. I just came back tonight after several months and they still knew my preferred drink at the bar! 
20963 4 We come here often and the service is always polite and prompt. The store is very clean and employees will wash hands before helping next guest. 
20964 4 These guys did a great job on a small remodel that was messed up by another contractor ( CEC Construction Services....don't ever use them)...Nick and his team are great. 
20965 4 fabulous fabulous fabulous! absolutely in love with all the theme parks in Orlando especially this one! marine animals have always been my favorite. Only complaint I would have is to maybe add one or two more rides but overall this park is well worth your timeee! 
20966 4 Very nice place! Big variety of burgers and drinks. So, if you are hungry this is right place for you! Definitely will visit one more time!! 
20967 4 i love everything about this place! by far the best banh mi in town. if you're starving and can't wait for them to make your sandwich grab a pate chaud to munch on while you wait. you will not be disappointed. 
20968 3 Fun place, great view, good fish tacos, and any kind of cocktail you can think up. What more is needed 
20969 3 Love the concept of soup and appetizer on buffet! The food was very good and the portions were fair. We had pad ke mow and pineapple cashew chicken. Loved the spice and the flavor! 
20970 4 I love this place! It being the closest one to our house we frequent it often! The ruby's are cold and the staff is so nice and helpful! 
20971 1 We tried the Prawn tacos which was pretty good, however Thai yellow curry with Cod was awful and it totally screwed up my dinner experience with my husband on a vacation to Vancouver at Marriott. 
20972 1 Don't take this review the wrong way, I just wanted to tell everyone that MuLan is shut down for renovations until further notice. I came here on 05/20/08 and it looked like they had a ways to go... boo, and I was so looking forward to trying it out too. 
20973 4 Its easy to order way too much at this place because everything looks fantastic. The cangrejo crab empenada and fried green tomatoes were for sure my favorites and you really need to try an arepa. The service is great and the price is right, ill be back again real soon. 
20974 0 I'm always skeptical when I see the phrase "Asian fusion." And I was right to be skeptical with this restaurant. One look at their menu and I knew it was going to be subpar and Americanized Asian food. Run away! Run away! 
20975 3 Yumm. Had the gorgonzola gnocchi. Woweee. 
20976 4 I just visited Istanbul and this food is on par if not better than the food I had in Turkey. A gem of a place that is also very clean. 
20977 4 Nice, thick broth + good ratio of ramen and broth. Pork could improve in flavor, but its soft and perfectly cut thin. Everything was great. 
20978 3 I have always enjoyed going into this place. They are helpful but not pushy. I have a very hard to fit foot. The gal that helped me was not pushy and kept bringing me boots until I found ones that fit. I love them. So glad I stopped 
20979 4 The best vegan restaurant in the A!! I always get the Philly!! Make sure you call your order or you will be waiting about 30 mins! 
20980 4 This is the best place to buy spices in the area. They sell spices in bulk, so they are fresher and much much cheaper than at any grocery store, and there is a much larger selection. 
20981 3 If you are a Harry Potter fan then you will love this. You will feel like you are in the book when someone is picking out there first wand. A must for Potter Fans. I am really glad they took the time to add this attraction 
20982 0 Places worse than Game On for an afternoon beer and some UEFA football.... 1. *tumbleweed* *distant bell being rung in a small mexican desert village* Ok.. nowhere. Srsly? $10 Sam Adams and no sound allowed on the Euro-sport. I'd rather go to the pub with THAT toilet in Trainspotting. 
20983 4 Always great cuts, always friendly! 
20984 4 I was surprised to see this region, so much fun! I would like to bring my friends here whenever they visit Boston! 
20985 4 Best Cuban on the south side. Cuban sandwich and ropa vieja are great. Prices are reasonable, and staff are friendly. 
20986 0 Food- reasonably priced Service- ....ehhh ok Decor- tacky as a fanny pack My girlfriend stepping on a load of butter on the floor....Priceless there are just some places that you don't wanna go to for everything else there is .....every where else 
20987 4 A big thank you to Clive coffee! I purchased a grinder and espresso machine from them and had the opportunity to come in for a full demo! Ben was fantastic help. Atmosphere was great! Learned so much! Thanks! Highly recommend if you are looking for help or a good machine! 
20988 4 Great little neighborhood pharmacy. Staff is friendly It's nice to get a prescription without being bombarded by magazine covers and cosmetic displays. 
20989 4 Excellent restaurant. I've been here several times. Tonight with my daughter. From calamari to arugula salad to spaghetti with meatballs(beef and veal), every dish is wonderful. Great staff 
20990 4 I'm not even a little vegan, and this burger blew my mind. They must work some kind of magic to make their burger patties taste like...well, meat. lol. It's incredible. Great seasonings and flavors. Highly recommend. 
20991 2 Here with some friends great location great ambience. The menu is good and something for everyone We have the fried pickles love. Everybody loved them! My wife had the fried green tomato BLT and liked it. Good beer, good server. Very casual I'm going back! 
20992 4 this is the my favouriye costco in the lower mainland. the parking spots are very spacious so no need to be afraid of accidents. theres also a much larger selection than the one by production skytrain station 
20993 3 A must stop for delectables like soycurls, primal jerky and vegan marshmallows! The store is small but decently stocked and has an abundance of vegan snacks and meals, even those hard to find veggie meats! Staff are super friendly and welcoming. Just go! 
20994 1 Not impressed. I don't remember the kind of doughnut I bought, but it was $3.50 and tasted gross. My coworker felt the same way about her doughnut. Overrated. Plus one star for friendly and fast service. 
20995 0 Too expensive, too crowded, too noisy. When you can eat a taco in two bites, it is tiny and expensive. Also, we ordered a main menu item and after 15 minutes we were told that it would take another 45 minutes to prepare - fail. 
20996 4 Social "Happy" Hour is a woman's best friend when transitioning from work to husband wife time. Thank God for $30 at the saki bar! My husband and I know where to go for great, almost perfect cuisine and ambience before, you know...wink, wink! 
20997 3 Nice people. Neat building. They did a good job fixing my chipped tooth. Very professional. 
20998 2 Decent burger, fries were not fresh tasting, lots of kids, with accompanying noise level. 
20999 1 The place was completely empty at lunch time which was a sign I should've paid attention to, but I wanted to give it a try. The two tapas/dishes I asked for were nothing spectacular. Untidy restrooms without toilet paper Expensive and totally not worth it. 
21000 4 Love this place. Hard to believe but the subs here really do taste better than the rest... especially their chicken subs. 
21001 4 Amazing tacos. We had both chicken and steak in a variety of configurations. The fireworks fries were also delicious. The guy taking orders totally messed things up, but recognized it, was apologetic and went out of his way to bring us our food and extra napkins. Big fan. 
21002 4 We got the best pad Thai and green curry in town. Simply delicious! Don't bother about the fish cakes though, they are just okay 
21003 2 Wasnt terrible wasnt great. Midline. I liked most of it then again we knew the bartender. That means speedy and strong drinks. So I am biased. Overall I say B! 
21004 4 Super awesome staff and really tasty food. yum! 
21005 2 They struggle w some basic items. Forgot to bring us knife/fork, temperature of room was cold, forgot to bring us plates for our appetizers. My PoBoy was good, but the table got a Colby pepperoni pizza that was at best average. 
21006 4 My friends and I went here on Christmas day, kinda as a joke, the line was long, the servers weren't the friendliest....but dear God....the food.....it's incredible. Absolutely remarkable. I'll deal with the snarky waitress as long as I can have more won tons, egg drop soup, and more fried pork. 
21007 4 Great place! So much to do, so much to learn!!! Fred S 
21008 4 Walked in just an average looking dude, walked out in the #hotdudesclub ! \m/ Music is not bad, but would give 6 stars if they played more heavy metal! 
21009 0 What a rip off dealership. Offered us 13k for a car that is worth by Canadian Black Book 24k. Greedy and time wasters. If you want to be ripped off then it's the place to go. 
21010 4 My favorite place in all of Boston/Cambridge for lunch. The food is excellent and the service is fast. I recommend the octopus curd lunch dish for lunch, but you cant really go wrong. 
21011 3 Pool is great. The staff are so friendly. My only complaint is the cocktails could be better, but they are a pool hall not a cocktail bar. 
21012 2 Slowest. delivery. ever. 90 mins to get 1 pizza 4 blocks? Yeah, I should have picked it up, but I was stuck on a conference call. Lesson learned, not worth the wait. Very average pizza but good onion rings. I'm sorry that I cheated on Beauty's Pizza. 
21013 4 This is the ultimate in gourmet cupcake deliciousness. They make cupcakes that are slap your mama good! 
21014 4 Foie gras perfect; enjoyed everything. Friendly service and a comped glass of wine! Portion sizes fit my smaller appetite leaving room for dessert. Yum! 
21015 3 The guys behind the counter were great. Pizza came out quick. Had a small sausage pepperoni onions. Crust was crispy which I liked. Sauce had a great flavor. Great pizza for the money. I would recommend it for anyone any time. 
21016 0 Would give 0 stars if I could. Currently here and have been for over an hour - 30 minutes after ordering, we were told they were out of the meal I ordered. Another 30 minutes later and still haven't received any food. 
21017 1 Sat for over 10 minutes, no one came had to go find someone to even get a drink. Best part of entire experience was the source dough bread. 
21018 4 This is a nice hotel near the Amusement Parks in Orlando. I would stay here again and the rooms are super comfy. 
21019 3 I attended a conference here last month. The room was clean and well maintained. The restaurant food was pretty good also. 
21020 4 Now that Stephen Bruno is at salon pv I now go here. It's a beautiful salon, and everyone is great. The other stylists are all newbury st veterans with great followings. Try for Stephen, but he sometimes works on movies being filmed in the area! 
21021 4 This is probably my only pho go-to spot in Boston. The pho is very authentic taste and the portion is good the price. Service never disappoints me here. Every time I'm craving pho, I go here (except when I get off work late at night). 
21022 4 1st time in. Ian, our server, was nothing short of an A+. Perfect service, delicious food, price that meets expectation. Going back again for sure. 
21023 4 Best vegan scramble I've ever had! Really flavorful and the texture was awesome (not soft and mushy tofu like many are). Not to mention, the cafe is so charming and has great Marionberry jam. Great spot to please vegetarians, vegans, and even meat lovers. 
21024 4 The Chanel Replica is an unusual and delicious roll. Had great service at the sushi bar. 
21025 3 Good restaurant, very popular, clean, modern, unique menu items. This place is busy. They specialize in Breakfast and serve breakfast all day long. 
21026 4 So soo sooo good! Better than Voodoo. Trust me on this one. 
21027 3 Rocking good pizza. I always get a thin crust pizza and salad. They have good beer prices and good beer on tap. The pizza is never greasy. The service has always been good. This is my fav pizza joint in town! 
21028 3 Beautiful view of the Colorado river, city and hillside. Great place to watch the sunset and drink a glass of wine. People had picnics and even a birthday party along the cliff. We saw a tourist with pumps. I recommend wearing flat study shoes or sandals. 
21029 4 this place had the best chocolate cake donut i've ever consumed. not joking. the other donuts are amazing as well but WOW i was shocked at how good it was. 
21030 4 Love this place - Def have a Portland feel! A great place to hang out with my puppy. Great selection/variety of beer, cocktails, & food! Best part is - I can order sushi & they were really delicious! 
21031 4 I've only been there once, but the donut I had was arguably the best I've ever had in terms of high quality taste. Other donuts elsewhere come off as just junk food compared with this place. 
21032 4 excellent food. i enjoyed bbq duck congee and beef rice noodle, both extremely flavorful and filling, the prices are great and portions can last 2 meals. quick service, but have to grab waitresses attention. great for groups 
21033 2 Not my favorite venue to go see a show.. but they have a consistent flow of decent bands playing each week that I'd recommend checking it out. The biggest let down at this place was that every micro brew I ordered was flat.. 
21034 3 Crowded but pleasant. Fresh food. We watched pita bread being made from our table. Knowledgable server. The food came out after about 15 to 20 minutes. Considering how busy they were things came out in a timely manner. Good food presentation. The vegetarian mezza was very good. 
21035 4 Convenient location, decent prices and they have options for the size of your burrito other then HUGE (Q'doba...) The burritos are really good and they have all different types, not just Mexican. My favorite is the Summer burrito, the mango salsa is delicious. 
21036 1 The service here was terrible. Even though the food was good I wouldn't come back here. It took more than an hour to receive our food and over 30 mins for the waiter to take our order. The staff was just lounging around as well. 
21037 2 For the chicken meshwi lovers like myself - they've changed their menu so unfortunately that item is no longer available :( 
21038 4 The service is so friendly and inviting and the Shrimp and Grits is incredible! I think this is the best grits I've ever had. 
21039 4 My fav: shrimp korma and butter chicken! 
21040 4 Dr. Howland is an awesome doctor. He provided options for my treatment and helped me make a decision. I am so glad I went to him. It has been 2 years that I am taking allergy shots and it has significantly improved my life style. 
21041 0 Fix the Beer. The hardware is the problem. At least 15 out of the 45 taps are faulty. Sorry guys, but I have given you 5 years and other customers will notice, Please Scott. 
21042 4 Another excellent local coffee house serving excellent coffee in a cool funky atmosphere, well as cool as you can get in a strip mall. Give up the corporate stuff and go here. 
21043 1 I love German and Swedish pancakes and these are good, better than ihops. German sausage is good as well.DO NOT EAT LUNCH THERE. The two times I ate lunch there I had gastrointestinal problems. Very rude on Sunday's at closing time. The aprons should be washed every couple of years. 
21044 4 Always a great experience in both food and beverage. Not a place to go for craft beer, but nice wine selection and fabulous cocktail program. 
21045 4 Mitchell was well knowledgeable about all the trees I had. His professionalism was outstanding and provided excellent service. Yard is looking better than ever! 
21046 1 The food is delicious but if you don't mind splattering the wall behind your toilet... Steer clear 
21047 4 Great selection, fair prices and super friendly staff. Will always be one of my favorite grocery stores. :) 
21048 4 Desiree was extremely helpful in helping me deal with the DMV channels and getting accomplished what I needed to with minimal frustration. I have been a long-time customer and will continue to be so with great customer service like that. 
21049 4 I love their migas! So good. Brought a friend here and she loves it too. Too bad they don't serve breakfast after 11 am. I hope they serve it all day. 
21050 4 Staying at the LBV Villas and Spa... This was the first time our family used this service. The product selection was excellent, great customer service, and delivery was just as expected. I will use Garden Grocer again the next time we are in Orlando. 
21051 1 Food is okay at best. Service is not that great. They dont have green tea. Two dishes had the same sauce only difference was one had red pepper to make it Kung pao and one had cashews to make it cashew chicken. 
21052 4 this place has delicious brunch! very polite, helpful and awesome staff. ethical ingredients. 
21053 4 This is the best place at PDX to get breakfast. I love their quiches and their pastries. They are placed before security, so make sure you have enough time to finish all your drinks! 
21054 4 Phenomenal food!! Loved the spinach gnocchi and Alfredo and chicken parm. Great staff! Don't walk by - it's a gem!! 
21055 3 Great service, great wine specials 1/2 off wine bottles Monday I had the Eggplant Parmesan entree for $11. Came with a delicious Greek salad loaded with olives and cucumbers and a fresh vinaigrette 
21056 0 Never seen a bank branch that could care less about customer service than this bank branch. 1 teller and 12 customer's standing in line. I would recommend using the branch on Adams Street on the Milton line. Never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get to a teller. 
21057 3 Went with other four people, we ordered different dishes. Grilled veg come with rice box, it is delicious. My friend recommended pork belly bun, and fermented pork, but fermented pork was sold out when we are there. Braised beef looks very good too, will try next time. 
21058 4 absolutely the best food i have ever had. it costs what it costs but its worth it. i just let the waiter pick for us and based on our opinion he brought the next round. perfect. 
21059 4 Depends on the staff..but I was very happy with the selection I was told would make my Canadian beer tour complete. I was happy. 
21060 4 Love this place! Food is fantasic. It is pricey, but worth it. 
21061 4 Great customer service. Oil change done in 20 mins. Another great local business that deserves more support. Take your car there for honest good service. 
21062 4 The staff were great! Friendly and very accommodating! They even opened shop earlier for me. Great location and they give you the option to use all organic products! I got shellac mani n pedi with a facial and it was a real relaxing experience. Will definitely be coming back! 
21063 3 A really fantastic company, place to work and community of people. The building itself is a work of art and creates a very dynamic social atmosphere that's fun and creative. The restaurant downstairs is tasssty! 
21064 4 If you need a great tire service center, drive to Leah's. Great service, quick, and friendly. Much better than the chain tire stores. Support ATX locally owned businesses. 
21065 0 Rude, unprofessional front desk clerk Roberta and Genevieve ruined my vacation. Serious bug and insect issue. They never changed sheets and towels, never cleaned room. Hotel district manager Andy never reachable. 
21066 4 Everything we tried including the oysters, pimento cheese, deviled eggs, salad, and steak was delicious! The service was wonderful...can't say enough about this place. I almost don't want to because I don't want the word to get out! 
21067 3 Love the splash pad! I brought my one year old. Granted, there are a lot of kids, but I waited until last hour for the crowd to dim and my son ran around enjoying himself. 
21068 3 All natural and organic, so don't expect a huge portion, but what you get is tasty and good for your body. 
21069 4 Trust these people with our dogs need we say more... Hope when my family grows with kids there dog walkers can before our nanny if needed cause I wouldn't trust anyone else. Fantastic caring services, always ready to help us with our dogs 
21070 3 Quick service, nice little airport location with lots of light. Legal on the go. 
21071 3 Food here is great and affordable. The service is usually pretty quick, but they do seem to take their sweet time giving you your check sometimes. 
21072 0 Gross, dirty and stale beer. Never again. Food was borderline nasty. Management didn't care. Paid our bill but we won't be back. 
21073 4 Not sure why they closed last year but glad that they have reopened! Great tasting FRESH food! 
21074 4 Not a diverse menu, but what they do, they do right. The grill items are the best imo. Comes with delicious veggies. 
21075 4 Food was amazing; we had the yam fries, coconut shrimp, crab/lobster stuffed ravioli and the mixed seafood. View was great, wait time was okay and price was fair. The waiter was polite and friendly, would go again. 
21076 3 friendly staff, huge assortment of curious george trinkets, shirts, toys and books, prices were reasonable 
21077 2 I can't say too much about Whiskey's, as I've only been once. Their wings are great, and they have a decent selection of beers on tap. 
21078 1 It was delicious overall, but it feels like they put msg in their condiments. The msg taste after the meal was terrible; it was still there after litres of water. I don't know if they really put msg in their food, but this is just what I've experienced. 
21079 4 First encounter with Peruvian cuisine in east Austin turns into a huge surprise! The flavor is bold and heavy! Dishes are prepared with imagination. I also love the interiors and the great ambience. Great experience overall 
21080 4 Great location, great service, great burger, shakes, and fries. Can't go wrong. The bacon and cheese fries are just awesome and the burger and absolutely delicious. Quick service, inexpensive. 
21081 4 Surprise! There's an awesome noodle and dumpling restaurant in brookline now. Soup was great. Dumplings were great. Fried chicken buns were REALLY great. 
21082 4 Super awesome brewery! The brewery tour is only $2 are you kidding me! The tour was very informative and this brewery has a bunch of history. 
21083 4 This place is pure Yum.. great place to hang out the coffee is good and so is the food highly recommended 
21084 4 Best food in Beaverton. Beaverton doesn't have enough food trucks. For a working class city, we deserve less pretentious venues for snobs from the West Hills of Portland and more fantastic options like Ochoas Lupitas!!!!!! 
21085 1 Order came wrong, not enough sauce, crust was soft, flavorless. Delivery came within 30 mins. Won't be back. 
21086 4 Great, fresh seafood. Sat at the bar and everything the waiter recommended was spot on. Oysters, the corn cake, the swordfish were all excellent. The clam chowder was good, but not amazing. Service was quick and attentive. Would definitely come back again. 
21087 4 Absolutely fabulous! The food, the music, the wonderful staff and the drinks all make me feel as though I've been transported to a cafe in Mexico. Our meals were out of this world! I will never eat Mexican food outside of Mexico ever again, unless I'm seated at Casa Vallarta! 
21088 2 A fine Starbucks location with some good location-specific decor. I'm not the biggest fan of Starbucks coffee or defrosted baked goods so can't be too generous with the review. 
21089 4 Impressive menu and staff incredibly knowledge in describing rare fishes and wines. Something for everyone.we had group of 10 with vegan and a meat only eater. Awesome hummus spread and apps to share My fish was amazing. This is a must! Ambiance is beautiful 
21090 2 Unique combinations paired with fairly edgy idea's. While there's some polish left to add on this one I think its a timely concept and hope it blossoms and matures fully. 
21091 4 Been here twice and really like the food and hospitality.. Staff is courteous and friendly 
21092 4 Didn't like this Starbucks at first for a minor reason but I've come to enjoy this location more than any other in Portland. I sincerely apologize for not getting to know the staff before leaving a review. That's my mistake. 
21093 1 Ugh! I can't stand Taco Del Mar. It's so gross. I cannot for the life of me figure out why people eat there. The burritos are so bland and watery, it tastes like it's been left in the fridge for two days. 
21094 4 Visiting Vancouver for the night on business. Great, small restaurant with exceptional staff and fabulous food and wine. Hats off to a fine place! 
21095 4 My go-to place for any special occasion. Great environment, the best sushi, and for the quality it's not much more expensive than your average sushi place. The staff is also very friendly and helpful... my only recommendation would be to make cocktails more reasonably priced. 
21096 1 My daughter ordered a basket for my b-day. It looks nothing like the pic posted on their site. I was hoping to support a local business but cannot trust you will get what you wanted. 
21097 4 Ermagherd! The best ice cream sundae evvarrr. There is nothing better. BE prepared for a long that line that moves quickly. Very busy location 
21098 3 Very friendly staff and great service. Will custom order anything. Fast. 
21099 3 Frankly rating is based on expectations. If you're looking for incredible gourmet pizza this is not it. This might be a grease fest but it's a fantastic grease fest! Add garlic to your pizza because they do it right. 
21100 4 Great food. Generous portions. My favorites are chicken teriyaki, pulled pork, and surf and turf. I think they r still trying to work out their kinks and try to become more efficient. Everything is made from scratch which takes time. 
21101 4 The food is great, hands down! I got there twice with my family. I will love to go there again! 
21102 2 Nothing special. Been to better. Bar food quality is ok, service is crap, they don't care...a bunch of pretenders, more corporate BS. Go to Christner's! 
21103 1 Very small menu selection, which might make sense if what was on the menu was delicious. Beans had too much oregano. Eggs had bad texture. Salsas weren't good. Coffee was good though...and hot! 
21104 4 Not your ordinary donut place. The most amazing donuts I've had. It's been a few months since I went there and I still rave about it. The line was pretty long but.definitely worth it. They only close down if they run out. 
21105 2 Pretty good burger needed a little more seasoning. Now the onion rings were off the chain!!! 
21106 4 Best bike shop in portland! Great deals and the only shop I can always count on getting repairs right! 
21107 3 Been coming here for a little over 6 mos, pretty consistently good blow- outs fir about $40 a pop. I like that they are on - time, clean and open at 7 am, for the before work hair-did. 
21108 4 This place is great! I love the neighborhood feel and cozy atmosphere. We ordered steamers served with a tasty butter sauce. Service was great and beer selection was nice too! We can't wait to bring friends from out of town! 
21109 4 Great food, excellent service. Great place for Indian food. First time visiting and will definitely be back. Asked for some substitutes and no problem! 
21110 4 My family was very impressed with the hay ride. Jay was our driver and was very informative / friendly. Learned a lot!! Good job on customer service!! 
21111 4 Easily one of my favorite restaurants/bars in Boston. Incredible brunch, fried chicken and great atmosphere. What more could you want?? 
21112 4 My whole family uses this office. I love that it is small and very personal. Dr. Lamielle and his staff are great! Highly Recommend! 
21113 4 Great Acai Bowl! So glad I found this hidden gem! Okay maybe it wasn't hidden, but I didn't know about it. Lol! Great prices, lots of options....and so TASTY! I will definitely be back. 
21114 4 Awesome fast service. Extremely helpful. Like whole nuva level helpful! I will be back. Thanks so much guys!!! 
21115 4 Overall a great place. Nice, pleasant team members. Clean and updated facility. The place isn't big, therefore not some overwhelmingly huge gym. More of a community sense where you get to see familiar faces. 
21116 0 Customer Service is horrible! Food has no taste. If you order check your food before leaving. They make mistakes on orders. Not worth eating there! 
21117 4 Very pleasant staff and beautiful selection of cards, small gifts, journals, and stuffed animals. Love this store everywhere but this store, although not the largest, has a lot of variety and is laid out. 
21118 0 A few days after sending a complaint to the Dunkin Dounuts, I received an e-mail. It was from the manager of this location. It was a form letter full of typos and had a blank subject line. It's clear this location has problems from the top down. 
21119 4 This spot is amazing, they really perfected the art of tea. I had the tea-more..this is A MUST TRY. 
21120 1 Food is okay. Don't come here if you want to grab a quick snack... They take 30 minutes to make a simple sandwich. 
21121 4 I stopped in the other day, and spoke with Matt. He was very knowledgeable, and did not try to take advantage of the fact I don't know much about cars. His advice was very helpful, and he even took care of a few scratches on my car! A+++ 
21122 4 These drinks are the best and the bartenders are awesome!! I like the atmosphere and location is great! 
21123 0 This place was horrible. We ordered food off of postmates. It smelled foul and tasted worse. Really, how do you mess up nachos, rice, and beans? 
21124 2 was at loca luna last night for a holiday party....food was good, mojitos were excellent....overall good experience 
21125 4 Just awesome. Great place to eat for breakfast. Service was quick and the food came out fast. I would recommend this place for breakfast or lunch. I love the lighter options. 
21126 4 This place is a lot of fun! They have LOTS of routes of different difficulties and they keep changing them, which offers new challenges on every visit. The routes are coded by level of difficulty, which is great for finding routes within one's level of expertise. 
21127 4 The alambré tacos are amazing!!! Its Hard to find a place that actually has skirt steak and this is heaven! I hope they place this on their menu permanently!! 
21128 4 Hands down the best frozen yogurt I've ever had. Incredibly fresh. The place was extremely clean, neat, and inviting. The owner was very sweet and helpful. Sooooo many toppings. 
21129 2 Chips and salsa were great. Waitress brought over a variety of sauces to try which was nice, but only enjoyed a select few (the cold one was delish!) Food was decent, but nothing great. Drinks were sweet and watered down. Nothing to write home about 
21130 4 5 Star Brunch. Are you hung over on a Saturday or Sunday? Go here. Live music, solid bloody mary's, great food. I've come here many times from bunch and Johnny D's has never let me down. 
21131 4 Fall is my favorite season, and Bella Organics is one thing I look forward to! Every year my husband and I head to their awesome corn maze, and make sure not to leave without picking up the homemade pumpkin butter. FYI: they also accept food stamps. 
21132 4 I have lived here my whole life and never been. I got a groupon and it was awesome! the guy that took the order was very helpful and made it so I got a taste of everything...good choice dude because I enjoyed it all! yummmmm 
21133 4 Great small place with big delicious gyros! Very easy to order and pickup or just sit down. Only place of its kind in this part of town, glad its here! 
21134 4 Dinner night with the family! Order a plethora of sushi, edamame and tofu. The meals were large and delicious. What a surprise to find such a good sushi restaurant! Plus $30 all you can eat option. 
21135 4 One of the best rooms in Yaletown. This has some of the best cocktails bartenders in Vancouver. Jamaican Patties are amazing. They also make a pretty crazy Jager mule. 
21136 1 So we decided to see if a $5.00 donut was ten times better than a 50 cent donut from elsewhere. It's not. It was kinda nasty, actually. Good if you're into extra grease. 
21137 4 God, I fuckin luv this place now. Tried their chicken tenders and fries yesterday, and extremely luv them too. Will officially come here whenever I'm in Austin now. Hell, the parking garage is even worth it now. This chicken is just a time machine 4 me. 
21138 4 Great customer service Always fresh food and happy faces Unlike other Russian stores in town Love their pastries, deli meat, bread and etc. Thank u!. 
21139 3 Nice Bertucci's location (although I wish they hadn't converted it from the old Wellesley Playhouse our only theater). Parking is tough and many times a wait, but worth checking out. 
21140 0 Every now and again somebody I don't want to offend by saying "no" drags me to this place. Gloopy food, too sweet and too much cornstarch, with little taste. It's Chinese for the timid and tastebudless. 
21141 4 Products are amazing! Check them out by reserving time for a facial massage! You will love it! 360-334-5656! 
21142 4 Thanks for years of service in clarkston Georgia for 16 years taste good and lots of food and the delivery time be just what they say and they save your order lol 
21143 4 Very good food and tap list. I liked the LEGO model of the facility. They are adding a walking path and several other neat things. Looking forward to a trip back with friends 
21144 4 Moving here has been great. Monica Basantes showed me around and answered all my question. Even after I moved in she continues to answer my emails in a timely fashion. The grounds aré clean and well kept. My experience with camden has been great thus far. 
21145 4 It's like a Brazilian Chipotle. So good and healthy! I love all the options you get with your bowl. I wish they had one in Denver because I'd be there every day! 
21146 4 The new menu is awesome! New England harvest is an impressive combination of completely new ingredients, love it. Pretty sad about the exit of pickled onions, but a really cool employee gave me the recipe so I can make them myself. Boloco for life. 
21147 4 Love this place. Scatter Brain pizza and flavor. Just wish thicker crust was more a option. 
21148 4 My favorite coffee in the world. I wish I could come here every single day. Unfortunately being a stay at home mom, I can't afford it. The mocha moon is amazing though, and I get it as often as I can! Always great service and great atmosphere. 
21149 4 Great atmosphere! Fun for the family or a date night. Kids are welcome in the theatre until 7pm, Grab a slice of pizza, order anything off the regular menu everything's good. 
21150 4 The pulled pork is AWESOME. Super juicy and favorful. Their blackened fish tacos are also yummy. I recommend getting them with avocado. The hot sauce is HOT but delicious. And most importantly, the owners/operators are super friendly and very customer service oriented. You will not be disappointed! 
21151 4 This place was great! I wish they had more room because we were eating on the way back to Houston and it would have been nice to sit and enjoy the biscuits! 
21152 4 I love it, the people here are very friendly! I just love the atmosphere of this place, everyone is friends here! The bar and pool were great for late night! 
21153 4 Finding good Asian food in Austin is very hard, however this jewel serves world class Thai food! Try the spicy catfish, it's really delish. It's spicier than most people say it is here on yelp, but very good! 
21154 0 This hotel was dirty, the pool had zero chlorine, the pools had a lot of hair, the rooms are dated, the sending machines had warm drinks, and the vacation rental program borders on hostile bullying. 
21155 1 Food was average, but expensive. Service was attentive. Menu had too many weird items. 
21156 4 Really love their acai bowls! The superfoods acai bowl is awesome! Will definitely be back! 
21157 4 Delicious unique breakfast. Love the tangine! The service is always on point. Well worth the wait. 
21158 3 Had a good old fashioned breakfast here and it was delicious. The atmosphere is adorable and homey and the employees are friendly. 
21159 4 Love this place! The roast beef port sandwich is awesome. Love the sourdough, I'll be back to this place often 
21160 4 Very fair prices and delicious! You pick and fill your own sides. Had the mac and cheese, coleslaw, and chopped beef sandwich. The chopped beef was very lean. One of the best barbecue I've ever had!! 
21161 2 A lot of fun! Beware the front row will get you drenched! It was a lot of fun this is one of the best rides in Disney! And there's usually no wait so you can go on it over and over again! 
21162 1 I am frequently flying in and out of California and Vancouver. The sharetea in California is much much much better and this sharetea has some work to do. However the good thing is that this place has lots of parking and can adjust the amount of sweetness on every drink. 
21163 0 We bought a fisherman's platter and fried calamari because the reviews were very good. The calamari were terrrible; loaded with breading and barely recognizable as calamari. The fisherman's platter was ok, but had very little fish especially for the price. 
21164 4 Just had a great meal at Grill Brew and would like to thank Tiffany for the wonderful experience!! Cheers from down under! 
21165 0 Just embarrassingly bad. Pastrami was thickly cut and tough- barely edible. Worst I've ever had. Meat knish had scraps mixed with potatoes and barely seasoned. Everything seemed prepared a long time ago. What a disappointment. 
21166 4 The best customer service so far, plus the spicy chai tea is nice & robust, not weak like most other coffee tea places. My husband got a latte which tastes good too. They also have suspended coffees to buy to help others in need. Overall, I love this place! 
21167 3 This place was great. The Whalbreski is a great beer. The burgers were awesome and the staff was so nice. The owner even posed for a picture with us. 
21168 4 Had an amazing time at ten! Good music, good drinks, good hookah, friendly service, and grown sexy crowd! My new favorite go to and more! 
21169 3 Excellent pork chops! Great salad and the brocollini was the best! The appetizer bang bang shrimp is worth coming back for. Since my first visit I've tried several other dishes. Everything has need excellent including the service. 
21170 0 Didn't like it. The service was slow, food sloppy. I loved the pumpkin and corn chowder though. I asked for a margarita without a lot of sweetness, and got the exact opposite. Not impressed at all 
21171 4 Quite possibly the best restaurant in Atlanta. Always a go to for family birthdays. Excellent wine selection. I could eat the piroshkis for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Great setting. Great ownership. 
21172 4 Excellent Coffee...and Best Marble Crullers in Boston!!! It's been a West Roxbury treasure for over 50 years! Fast service and no frills. 
21173 2 The food was average, with the exception of the burratta which was the best I've ever had. Everything else was underwhelming: duck wings, pork belly, short ribs 
21174 3 The food was great. I just wished they restocked the buffet quicker. 
21175 3 I lurve this place. They have one fantastic wine selection, and it's usually on sale. Join their rewards club (it's free) and you get coupons and special discounts. The kitchenware is unique, art selection vast, and endless possibilities for holiday food and gifts. 
21176 4 Best head massage! Got a wash and blow dry for $18. - and my hair is long! Great deal and they did a good job! 
21177 3 Great food! I got fish and it was perfectly cooked and delicious! The service could've been a bit better but our waitress was really kind and patient. 
21178 4 Service was a dream and I can't wait to come back for another slice of heaven get the pepperoni and mushroom for guaranteed satisfaction. 
21179 3 Good food and fast, friendly service. I had a chicken dish with injera and salad. The waitress was very nice and showed me how people normally eat with their hands or with the bread. I got the special so it was a good price too. 
21180 4 My wife and I went to Figs for dinner. She had the Fig salad with arugula, goat cheese and figs. I had the Tuscan Bolognese pasta. We also ordered a roasted chicken pizza. Everything was excellent, including the service. Highly recommended! 
21181 4 Decor was nice and simple in a cute little house, service was fast and nice, and the ham and cheese omelet w/ grits/potatoes + biscuit I ordered was really good. Great experience. 
21182 4 Matt, the watch guy, was top notch, helpful and knowledgeable. Needless to say they earned my business, no longer buying my watches only, he'll be my watch guy now. Thanks Matt! 
21183 4 Krystal is my new mani/pedi professional. The place was great and prices reasonable. Let flip flop season begin. 
21184 3 Decent food that's more interesting than your usual pub fare in a great location. Good for people-watching and very easy to spend the entire afternoon/evening here without leaving your comfy sofa 
21185 4 Had a nail in my tire. They repaired it very quickly and extremely inexpensively. Wil come here for all my tire needs. Thanks Bob Susalka. 
21186 4 Really good crust,nice and thin.Very tasty sauce with just the right amount of cheese.Great pizza served quickly and priced fairly. 
21187 4 I went here on date. I had a really good time. There was music and belly dancers. The service was great and the vegetable moussaka was even better!! 
21188 4 I always have a great experience here. The staff are delightful. And there's always a bowl of candy. :) 
21189 4 BEST FOOD EVER!!! The food was amazing. Highly recommend the hot rocks, Brussels sprouts, sake sushi, Shag roll, the fried chicken, and the beef on rice which takes a while to make so order it first, so worth it. 
21190 3 Very tasty waffles in both sweet and non sweet variety in a quiet little space right off Alberta. This place is good for breakfast or a small lunch and is rather affordable. I'd suggest it over iHop or Denny's. 
21191 3 This was my first time there. I love it. The setting is perfect for this jazz joint: underground bar whose wall is all filled up with dollar bills. 
21192 3 Yum, yum. The eggs benedict was a special treat, The coffee fresh and tastey. get there before they open if you want to get a table otherwise the wait can be 2 hours. Service is impeccable. 
21193 4 Love these crepes! Haven't tried all of the varieties, but it will be really hard not to order the cream cheese with blueberries and chocolate chips. Super good. Couple that owns the truck are super friendly too. Great spot for a snack. 
21194 4 We had a wonderful experience at Duffys! The food was great and our server Rhyki was very attentive and did a great job taking care of us. We will defiantly come back! 
21195 4 Awesome spot! Lots of fun and tons of things to do.you can bowl or play games. The service is amazing and the food is pretty decent. It's also pretty diverse if you're looking to meet all kinds of people. 
21196 2 We had the chicken cordon bleu and some salmon pie and both were pretty tasty! for dessert, we had the apple pie which was pretty normal. I wish they had a bigger dessert pie selection. 
21197 0 Hands down, the worst attempt at dining I have ever experienced. Twenty minutes for 1st drink, 45 minutes + for apps, 1.5 hours salads, 2 + hours, we left. Management was disengaged and unresponsive. 
21198 4 Omg This was my first time here, amazing service and food, and great atmosphere. I also love how they let you substitute on certain thing for ramen, and that you can put fresh garlic in, and put in your own sauce from three different choices from spicy, savory and sweer 
21199 3 Bought a couple rechargeable batteries for my drills for less than 35 dollars, the cost of replacement batteries were why I bought the Chicago Electric 18V drills. 
21200 4 Any time I go to a different sushi restaurant, I get upset because I didn't just go to oppa. You literally cannot go wrong with anything on the menu; everyone is friendly, service is fast. I'm so happy they expanded recently! You go guys! 
21201 4 Best tapas in Boston right in Woburn!! Don't have to drive all the way to Boston for good Tapas. Best squid ink dishes! 
21202 1 Went yesterday.... We were seated right away however they seated us at a large table and then sat complete strangers right next to us. It was weird for both parties. I order the lobster roll.....it was lobster meat tossed in lemon juice. Not good. Not sure if I will return. 
21203 3 This goodwill is much better organized then any other goodwill I've ever seen. Its pretty much like a boutique full of used vintage clothing. 
21204 4 Tried this nail salon for the first time and had Tammy do my nails. She did a wonderful job... It was a little packed due to the holidays...but everyone was super friendly and nice. 
21205 3 This is a local spot in Orlando Florida. It's good for those who are craving authentic flavors. The people are friendly and their burger were really good 
21206 4 Allison C's service was A1! great place to hang out and grab a few drinks and socialize with a few friends. The atmosphere is especially great on the weekends when the live DJ is on 
21207 4 Solid neighborhood spot with great live music. There's normally free music or trivia early with a later show at a great price. The beer tap list is solid, covering everything from sours to IPAs and the bar is ready to rock you with intricate cocktails. Come and get some! 
21208 2 This is a nice comfy place to have a nice italian meal. The inside is really clean and nice. I had the baked ziti omg soo good and cheesy. 
21209 4 Fast and healthy options! The portions are very generous, the service was great, prices fair and the food was awesome. I'll come back for sure! ( no pictures sorry, it was so delicious that I only had time to devour my crepes) 
21210 3 Good quality food... The staff were very friendly and helpful. You have to get the mango lemonade. 
21211 4 Don't let the location scare you. The place is very clean and the food is extremely good. I tried the pick 4 veggie plate and the jerk wings. Collards, cabbage, black eyed peas and mac and cheese. Yummy! 
21212 4 Great food and service. Pancakes are amazing. Cool atmosphere and drinks are well made. 
21213 3 OMG!! I needed that! If your looking for a cheesesteak that will make you want another ... Then Gut Busters is the place! 
21214 0 These is nothing good to say about the food. It will fill you up but leave you regretting your decision to dine here. 
21215 4 Everything here is always delicious, sandwiches especially so (but the pastries too--never dry and always a fun new selection each day!). It's really well managed and organized for such a small space and the wait for food is always shorter than you think it will be. 
21216 3 The orlando eye- I would have enjoyed it better if I would have went during the day or sun set. I couldn't see much at night. The mini video that u see before u go into the eye was enjoyable. But over all I would do it again. 
21217 1 Food was good and somewhat innovative, but the ungracious atmosphere made it less enjoyable than it might have been. The staff seemed more interested in turning tables than offering a good dining experience. 
21218 3 Pretty good Thai food, it's a little more sweet then spicy but still good. Try the curry, but I would recommend chicken rather then beef. If your in the area and like Thai food then it's worth a try. 
21219 1 Food was meh. Definitely not worth the price. Nice view though. Would be a good place to grab a quick drink. 
21220 3 Great Szechuan Chinese cuisine without having to go to Chinatown! Some great noodle soups and spicy wonton w/ beansprouts! Decent dimsum on weekends. Very good prices and good portions. 
21221 2 We ate here on our first night of our Disney 2016 trip. We had a party of 6. Food was ok, but could have been a lot better. Salads were great. Service was ok. With all the choices around here, I don't think we would eat here again. 
21222 3 Gel manicures are taken seriously here, and you get the best care and service! I do not feel rushed and hurried whenever I get a manicure done. Anh is great for gel manicures! 
21223 3 Great calabresa pizza! The combo of catupiry and pork sausage on pizza was uncommon and unexpected but so delicious. Great flavors and wonderful service. Renata was so warm and welcoming. We felt right at home. A must try! And with Old Town across the street it's a perfect date night. 
21224 3 Their mixed grill is really good. And so it the eskandar. But they are a bit pricey. Would go back every once in a while. Oh the lavash is just excellent. 
21225 4 Favorite gift shop in PDX. Some really awesome jewelry and they have REAL HOURGLASSES!! I love the location too great street in PDX. 
21226 1 very mediocre place, I like the location, but the parking is awful, the service is not friendly, the prices are hi ($8.50 for a muffin and half moon latte). The Half moon latte was pretty good. 
21227 0 This place is a big disappointment... the lady was a harsh with the cuticle trimmer, she cut me with it twice during the same visit... need some staff training time..... doing a bad job is acceptable but not spreading infection! 
21228 2 The morning staff is great although they could be a lot more liberal with the napkins. I did get a crappy ham sandwich one time but for the most part my orders are filled timely and properly. 
21229 3 I frequent a lot of pizza places, and love pizza. I decided to visit this place because of all the positive reviews on here. At first we didn't know what to expect. But the pizza was not bad, though the prices were a bit high. 
21230 1 Its.... expensive for food the quality of Taco Cabana. Margaritas are decent so it gets 2 stars. 
21231 3 Excellent burger (even though it arrived med instead of med rare), ridiculous milkshakes (nutella pretzel? yes), tasty fries, okay beer selection, very good margarita and a cool interior. Like MacArthur to the Phillipines, i shall return (to have more burgers). 
21232 3 The usual fare. This spot is a little cramped, but I appreciate the vicinity in a pinch. 
21233 3 Really good XLB - delicate yet structurally intact, rich broth inside. The pan fried dumplings weren't up to the same standard, but were still tasty! 
21234 1 Had a rude waiter. I asked him for a glass of water and he simply said No. What kind of customer service is that ?! 
21235 4 The Pizza here has gone from excellent to superb!! I love the Servers here Go for lunch and try the Tomato sandwich 
21236 3 Fantastic spicy fried chicken! Slaw and baked beans are standard, skip the mac n cheese but say yes to the fried okra, fried green tomatoes and the fried pickles. Too full for dessert this time but that gives us a reason to come back. 
21237 4 I love this store!!! Oh and the restaurant upstairs is great place to spend a lazy Sunday. They make great bloody marys!!! 
21238 3 I love this place especially there number one with house fried rice. I think this place is a lot better than that other restaurant in saugus called Kowloons! 
21239 4 This place has been my favorite since I was little and the food has only been getting better. Whether you're eating there, getting pick-up, or delivery, the food comes fast and always satisfies! 
21240 4 The Vegan Baja Taco was amazing! The best vegan taco ever! The chipotle cream sauce was delicious, the avocado was fresh and the vegan protein was fried to protection with the cabbage giving the taco the right color and tasty crunch! Made with absolute vegan love by Hector! Yum! 
21241 3 We came here for Dine out Vancouver. Awesome service, they were very accomodating and we had a great dinning experience here. Will come back again to try out their regular menu 
21242 2 Ok chicken. Sides are mediocre at best. Probably number 4 on the list of good fried chicken places in Austin. 
21243 4 Had a family dinner of 10 here. They accommodated us with our own personal dining area. Roselle was an amazing server. Great food, and great service. 
21244 4 What a spectacular experience! First visit...I tried the catfish fillets and Wing Dings. Perfectly seasoned and fried! Great portions! Great service! Clean! You must try it! 
21245 3 Loved the beachy friendly atmosphere. The food was not outstanding but you get a pleasant kind of homely feeling with it. The key lime pie was specially good.. everyone of the staff was really friendly and you have to appreciate a goodbye taffy with the check. Definitely will return. 
21246 4 Let me just say they have Vegan Donuts. I have a dairy allergy and it's wonderful to be able to eat a delicious donut again. 
21247 3 I have been here twice to have my eyebrows waxed, and I have to say Lorna is fantastic! She does a great job and is very pleasant as well. I now have a regular place for my brows. 
21248 3 The website is a total pain but the individual who came was great. She did a great job, was friendly and very fast! They bring all of their own supplies and the house cleaner touches base through text before hand. It was a great experience. 
21249 4 Best fried chicken I've ever had! Not too spicy, just right and the sides were great. 
21250 0 The ambience is good but food was below average. I wouldn't wanna go back agan. Cocktails were good though 
21251 4 The best donuts I've ever had, hands down. Go right when they open for fresh batches and no line!!!! The donuts are so beautiful they could sit in museums. And they taste even better...such incredible texture. Just perfect. 
21252 2 The food here is pretty good. Service is rather slow, it usually took our party of four close to two hours to eat and pay. It's convenient if you are at the hotel and would like food that is not sitting under a warmer. 
21253 4 Decent pub food and great tap list. Come for happy hour and order food from the sushi place next door - you'll leave with a full stomach and you'll be shocked at how cheap it is for high quality sushi. 
21254 0 They make up their own rules and state that their not like any other company... unsettling first of all, but also very condescending representatives. 
21255 4 Awesome people, super friendly! Had a few stubborn bolts that I couldn't get out, called these guys and they removed em in 15 minutes and refused any payment for the quick work. Even denied a tip! Business done right, I definitely recommend 
21256 4 I have never been to a chipotle where I got something I was unhappy with. The workers were incredibly friendly at this location! 
21257 3 What can I say? Unique flavors with great texture. The donuts aren't too sweet and some of the flavors are more bold than others, but overall it satisfied my sweet tooth. 
21258 0 They advertise service until late. It's not true. Sat at the order window waiting for 10 minutes; no service. If you've advertised being open late, then be open late. Ignoring your drive thru for the last 10 minutes make you a place no one will come to. Horrible! 
21259 2 Food is GROSS!!!! but the drinks are AWESOME!!!!! The bloody mary and the pepino are from out of this world!!!!! 
21260 0 worst service ever. the person checks you in, lets you wait for 15 minutes and then tries to transfer a number unsuccesfuly with the remark that it is not his fault as there is so many different departments at verizon. go to t mobile down the street! 
21261 3 This is a good place to relax watch some TV. The owner is a bad ass that will treat you well and remember your name. 
21262 2 Shopping carts not made for kids. I guess they don't want moms shopping here or they don't care if your kids get hurt. ADD MORE SHOPPING CARTS FOR YOUNGER KIDS 
21263 0 What a horrible experience. We wanted to take our kids to listen to the band. Called ahead to confirm. They said seven, but it was actually 6. There was no band, just a one man show. Which is fine, but not what we drove 45 minutes for. 
21264 4 Great food great service! The sweet potatoes are excellent! I'm not a steak eater but came here with a group my husband loved his steak and he tried gator stew! If you want a classy meal come here 5 stars all around! 
21265 4 This is my favorite Cuban place!! I definitely recommend getting the steak sandwich with black beans, sweet plantains, and/or French fries! So good, fast, and reasonably priced. Their coffee is really good too! Will be coming back soon! 
21266 1 Great atmosphere and very nice waiter. Hated it took me nearly an hour to get the food I ordered and another 30 mins for desert. I never remember waiting this long. 
21267 4 Absolutely one of the best meals I have had. Ahi Tuna with Lobster risotto is a must. Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar and have a conversation with the owner Tommy. A great experience!!! 
21268 2 Cute place. I liked the historical aspect. My waitress was not the warmest nor happiest person in the place. That's why I'm capping my review at 3 stars. Food was great. Exactly what I expected. 
21269 4 I ordered the K-Pop bowl with kimchi and was amazing! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the broth had a nice kick. 
21270 4 Let me just say that if you are coming here for a drink while waiting for a table next door, jokes on you! The food is absolutely stunning, a true party in your mouth! 
21271 4 There are no frills, but the food is great. We like to eat in their small dining room. Service is fast, and the menu has a great selection. 
21272 4 .......I mean, look, it's really fudgin' good: the food is delicious, service is great, and the signature cocktails are beautiful. If you're reading around being like, "oh, I don't know... should I go?". Go! Try a Franco 75.... or three. 
21273 4 I consider muu-muu's to be my favorite bar in portland... hands down! While you're snagging a drink, order the spicy beef salad- delicious!! 
21274 0 I read the reviews, but I was stupid to book the car with them. Please avoid them, they are big cheaters. I booked the car for $80 dollars and the total at the end came to $ 180.00 they are liars. 
21275 0 Don't know how they stay in business. Sales and management are very dishonest. Would not recommend purchasing anything from them , worth the drive to go somewhere else. 
21276 3 I have to confess that I am very skeptical of chain restaurants but our experience at Joe's was really good. Great view, good service, good food, and good value. We will be back. 
21277 3 Very good food!! I am glad it's close to home!! 
21278 3 great place for birthday parties they always cook my steak to perfection and were never disappointed! 
21279 4 The best Reuben sandwiches my husband and I have ever had! Also perfect beer suggestion from our very friendly waitress. We will be back. 
21280 2 Great food! Got the cashew and noodles with white rice. Along with the red peppers and onions, it was delicious! Not very updated on the inside but great food and service 
21281 3 The accolades for the chicken sandwich are well deserved. It was an absolutely delicious experience. 
21282 4 Best healthy artisan bread around!!! those sticky buns are unbelievable! This is by far the best bakery for bread + pastry, all freshly and consciously baked around! Open up in Salem, Ma!!! 
21283 4 The manager Linchul is awesome. Nice service and a must check place for Japanese izakaya food 
21284 4 Super live club! Last time I went the DJ was killing it the whole night had everyone super turnt. Music is loud and they have a big led screen with trippy motions goin all night to the music. 
21285 3 The waiters and waitresses were very nice the cook was very funny the manager came and greeted us pleasant place to be 
21286 4 As others have stated, the curry udon is delicious. I had the regular portion and my friend got the special curry udon which was much larger, had more veggies and an egg as well. The broth was so tasty and filling. Definitely coming back! 
21287 2 High prices and super small portions.. Some of their food isnt that good. I would stick to drinks and appetizers only. quality is good though. their chips and 3 salsas are amazing though. 
21288 1 It makes me sad to write this, because I was very excited about this place. I didn't mind the mix up that meant a long wait for our food. I was really disappointed that the entire meal lacked flavor. 
21289 4 I've been here twice and enthusiastically recommend it. I love tiny plates that you share! The food has been tasty, interesting, and beautifully plated. They put together things that I'd never expect and the results are outstanding. It's pretty pricey, so it's best for special occasions, but totally worth it. 
21290 4 Skip getting pizza and grab a garlic naan here instead. Awesome Indian downtown w great service. 
21291 4 Bombbbbbbbbb food!!! Omg everything !!! And super cheap. It's unbelievably delicious and fresh all raw and cooked. All veggies too. High quality 
21292 3 my usual order is A2, spicy beef thick noodle. this dish is hotter than some girls i have dated, but that is fine by me....YUMMY! 
21293 1 Go for the drinks at the bar. The food is mediocre and the service matches the quality of food. 
21294 4 Superb cuisine. You can't go wrong with the traditional Argentina dish that's the name sake (Lechon) and the chicken empenadas are great! 
21295 4 Great coffee and fresh baked pastries and cakes. Very friendly staff. The pecan roll I had there was divine. 
21296 4 Food is AMAZING. Authentic. For those who know the wonders of Lisa's in Hoboken, Bob's makes me miss it less. 
21297 3 All I ever get is the veggie burrito. Its pretty standard- black beans, rice, corn, lettuce, guac... Ya know, anything that's not meat. Service is fast & this place is good for whenever I'm on the go and can eat while driving. 
21298 4 Always the best Cookies and Pizza when visiting the North End. I am extremely lucky to have my daughter living on Prince St as she can send me some cookies. Thank you Parziale's...... 
21299 4 The Waypost just expanded and it rocks! Light is shining all around. There is also a new store that opened next to it, "Little Edie's Five and Dime" It really is a fine atmosphere. 
21300 4 Have to have the pork salad, horchata and tres leches. I'm so happy to finally have a cafe rio close to me and that it tastes just as good as I remember it being on the west coast. 
21301 2 Bonjour! How do you say in French, "please stop talking to me so that I can consider my dining options and place my order." 
21302 4 Best yellow curry I've tasted. I'm not an expert on Thai cuisine, but I've been going to Titaya's for years. Now that they have re-opened after their re-model, the place is definitely nicer on the inside as well. Great food. 
21303 4 Delicious food and friendly service! They even brought us free soup and Greek beignets to go with our meal! Plenty of outdoor seating and parking as well. 
21304 3 We experienced Posto's pizza via their mobile oven. I highly recommend the pepperoni. Thin, Italian-style crust, tangy red sauce, and flavorful meat and cheese. What else can you really ask for? 
21305 4 Perfect place to watch World Cup! Plus some of the friendliest servers I've EVER witnessed in Portland. 
21306 4 You can't go wrong with their sushi lunch combos. Great price and good quality fresh fish. 
21307 3 The food and drinks were great!!! Great ambiance. I will definitely be back. They offer valet which is great because it's hard to find parking on Edgewood. 
21308 3 Great concept. .a bit messy to eat but hit the spot. Right next to Thai Basil so good dessert place. 
21309 1 The sandwiches are way too greasy, and the prices are way too high. Not going back. 
21310 2 The food gets 5 stars but the service was really subpar. They wouldn't seat us with 3 of our 4 party. Plus, the restaurant was not very busy. There were plenty of empty tables. The waitress constantly forgot our drink orders and we had to always ask for refills. 
21311 3 Wow, what Awesome food and atmosphere! Great patio/outdoor dining area. Great way to chill on a Saturday afternoon. Libations aren't too bad either. 
21312 0 closed out of business 
21313 2 The ambiance has character. The service is good. The drinks are varied, albeit a bit light on the alcohol content for the mixed drinks. The food is okay. A good place to hang out with friends, but not the place you'd take someone to impress. 
21314 4 Great location in Mid Town Atlanta Easy on and off highways The staff is always pleasant Clean Comfortable rooms with a great view from the higher floors 
21315 3 finally made it up here--11 miles from home. great joint. tables a little crammed together, fantastic ambiance, super friendly service. great place to hear music. wonderfully decorated omnisex loo. crazy posters all over. 
21316 4 I had the shrimp & grits with a rum runner. Wife had a NY strip. Excellent food and service by John. Best meal out we've had in a while! 
21317 4 Alisha was great! It was my first time getting a wax and she was very informative and made me feel so comfortable. Definitely recommend! 
21318 1 Lots of TVs inside and there is some outdoor seating but there are far better places to watch a game in Atlanta. They have decent food but it's over priced. I'd only go back if it were convenient to other plans. 
21319 4 Dr Tran is very gentle. My son had difficulties with his previous dentist and wouldn't cooperate. But Dr Tran had no problems taking care of him. 
21320 0 What can I say. Not worth it. Had a reservation and was still waiting for a table after 45 minutes. Anyplace in the Short North would be better 
21321 0 So disgusting. Over priced and terrible, terrible food. My party was encouraged to get each dish because we would be hungry otherwise. Each dish that was brought out was worst than the last. Too hyped up for the amount of money you're going to spend. 
21322 4 Had breakfast, it was excellent. Shredded beef, eggs and bacon. The bacon was outstanding. Coming back tomorrow. 
21323 4 COOLEST spot I've been to for a drink. Bartenders have magic hands, and phenomenal energy. So glad we found his hidden gem!! Loved the vibe, the intimacy and how chill the energy is. 
21324 3 Was presently surprised with the food here. Most of the dishes we had were good. Service is just ok. The restaurant lighting is way too brightly lite during dinner time. Please turn off half the lights after 5pm for better dinner time ambiance(like what other restaurants do). 
21325 4 Great studio, great instructors and and all-around great deal! Laura, Connie & James are all excellent yogis, and I'm eager to start my aikido practice with James and Vincent, whose martial arts instruction I understand to be exemplary! 
21326 4 Darling coffee shop on corner of 23rd Ave with delicious coffee drinks and friendly barista. 
21327 4 The chocolate almond ganache lowkey changed my life and I don't even like dark chocolate. 
21328 4 This is as good as it gets for columbus. The BEST red sangria. Very dangerous. Everything on the menu is out of this world and healthy. Service has been so-so out of all of my visits, but they are young and I'm sure new to the service industry. 
21329 4 Fantastic flavors and presentation in a unique space. Everything was great. And the root vegetable brûlée was probably the best vegetable dish I've ever had. We will be going back. Other reviews mention the expense. Pricey, yes, but you get what you pay for: Journeyman is well worth it. 
21330 4 Wow! Can't believe this place doesn't have higher reviews. It is the perfect breakfast stop. The bacon is thick and crispy, the hash browns are spot on, and the biscuits are flaky. They even offer sliced avocado when it's in season. Prices are lower than other breakfast places I've been. 
21331 4 It was my first time here. Tried the mango sago and matcha mochi. First time trying both and really loved them. Good customer service- mixed pur orders and we are getting the expresso mochi for free. 
21332 4 Excellent restaurant, period. Authentic Turkish good at good prices in a warm and upscale ambiance. Service prompt and college competent. Stopped in for dinner on a weeknight so croud was light. Highly recommend and I'll be back! 
21333 4 Great and diverse tap list. Staff was friendly and quick despite being very busy. Definitely fits the bill for a craft beer tap room which is a plus. Flights were relatively cheap as well. Walking distance to Nationwide Arena! 
21334 4 Always great coffee. I do the mocha latte most visits. Quick, friendly staff... quiet place to study, and hold consultations. 
21335 3 Brunch was good, they got my order wrong but then fixed it. The food was good I would go again, just wouldn't order the juice as it was cheap and sugary. 
21336 2 this alons is good, the one by perimeter mall kicks this ones ass so i would check out the other one if its between the two...but they are both great lets be real 
21337 3 This is my favorite Pho place in Vancouver. The service is quick and the food quality is always about the same. Took off a star because the prices increased and the published prices don't always match the actual price paid. 
21338 4 Amazing selection of veggies! $3.99 more for unlimited bowl. Next time, I am going to pay more and try a few different combinations. A nice place, cheap beer and overall a good Mongolian joint! 
21339 4 Amazing food and very reasonably priced. I think they had some of the best collard greens I've had, with nice chunks or pork shoulder in there. Definitely would go back. They also do half orders of some meals / apps which is a nice option 
21340 4 I ate here recently for lunch and really enjoyed my meal. I had a Quinoa salad and it was phenomenal. Real nice bartender. Great meal. 
21341 2 the greek food was delicous wait staff was average the decor could of been better 
21342 4 So Delish. Can't go wrong with anything you order at Thomas Haas. Double baked almond croissant is killer. Pan au chocolate is always a winner. Sandwiches pretty decent. 
21343 3 One word - POUTINE! Surprisingly, it's hard to find poutine in this city with oozing cheese and bubbling hot gravy. Hank's does not disappoint, although I had to deduct a star for price / serving size. A tad overpriced for such a small basket of fries. 
21344 4 Love this place, one of my favorites so far in Portland. Great relaxed breakfast atmosphere but be prepared to wait a bit for a seat unless you're there really early on the weekend. The potato cakes are fantastic. 
21345 3 Overrated Radius burger (for the price) but great ceviche and small plates. The margs are tasty. 
21346 4 Absolutely wonderful food! Dill pickle soup and lentil soup are both great options to start with. Jäger schnitzel with the mushroom sauce is a must have! Also, coconut cake...some of the best I've had! 
21347 2 the food was great but the portions were small and over priced. 
21348 4 The best best Asian vegan cuisine!! And the servers are the kindest people!!!! This on my must stop by monthly favorite places to eat in Portland! You don't even have to be a vegan...the food is that good!!! Oh and did I mention the great prices!!! 
21349 4 This group is prompt, courteous and won't overcharge you! I had to go back on GE and they forwarded what I neede from them quickly and nade my claim much easier! 
21350 4 Excellent service and beer selection. Clean facilities and a comfortable layout with indoor/outdoor seating available. Food was great! 
21351 4 Go here for your shellac manicures and ask for Ashley. Look at my photo and you'll see what I mean. It's perfect! I've tried other spas but this one is just simply far and above all the others, and definitely worth the drive..... 
21352 3 Consistently good mexican food. Not a super diverse menu, but not just a taco or burrito only menu either. Decent prices and friendly service. 
21353 4 Josh and Malon are absolutely wonderful: excellent customer service and they know their wines backward and forward. Best experience here ever because of Josh and Malon! Thank you!!! 
21354 4 I can't believe this place only has three stars... Sure it's a chain, but the food is on the yard house level of chains, the atmosphere is great, and the cocktails rocked. 
21355 2 Ordered take out and not that impressed. The oshi salmon roll was good, but the agedashi tofu sucked. Way too much oil and they literally gave me 1 tablespoon of the broth to coat my 7 pieces of tofu. 
21356 4 Fabulous Saturday brunch! Love their location near the Saturday market. Excellent mushroom tacos. Cloth napkins. Very good service. Highly recommend. 
21357 3 We're working out way through Columbus breweries and this was our fifth stop, and the best so far for both food and beer. I really liked their menu, lots of interesting sandwich choices. The patio is really nice, and their beer selection is a nice mix. We'll definitely be back! 
21358 4 Found a few items! Cute and different. Souvenirs (lotion, soap and aroma) from CA and OR! 
21359 4 Came in for lunch it was clean well keep, employees are awesome and on the ball seem to care about there guest. I will be back to this one in fact I will drive by others to eat here. 
21360 2 Upon my fourth visit I realized nearly everything I've ever bought from them had either expired or expired that same month. CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATES BEFORE YOU BUY!!! 
21361 3 My salmon taco was delicious! I also enjoyed the ambiance of the patio with a nice cold grapefruit margarita. The service was pretty slow however. And the guac was just so-so. I will maybe be back for the taco! 
21362 4 Omg. Jack's special roast beef sandwich is heaven. Especially after a nice country road bike ride through the area. Who knew roast beef could melt in your mouth? Perfectly located near end of minute man trail. 
21363 1 I have never gotten food poisoning from this location but the food has looked questionable on more than one visit. I no longer eat here. 
21364 4 Probably my favorite brewery on the North Shore. A bit out of the way, so make it a destination after a day on the slopes or the trails. Favorite beer: North Shore Pale Ale 
21365 3 Very good food and overall vibe! Edging on the fancier and more expensive side. The Brussels sprouts are amazing! 
21366 4 Brisket cooked to perfection pulled with award winning texture. I you can then just do it. If time is more important then try McDonald's. I'm happy. 
21367 4 I tried the Smut Cake for the first time today, and boy was it fantastic! Oreo, cookie dough and brownie all combined in one cupcake! I will be dreaming about this one until I have another. 
21368 3 Decided to get a bagel this morning. It's so annoying when you have to yell throughout the restaurant to get an employee's attention. Apparently they were too busy BS'ing in the back. Then they felt like they had to give me attitude for disturbing them. Unbelievable! 
21369 3 Was in the area for stop, ordered take-out. Had chicken with broccoli, lo mein, and egg drop soup. Thought it was quite good. Standard Chinese take-out yes, but still good food. 
21370 2 Great Mexican food. I had the Tamales and they were delicious and large. My wife had the meat quesadillas and loved them. The house cabernet was excellent. We were there with a group of 15 and Maricela did a great job of serving us. 
21371 3 LOVE the Eddie Bauer outlet store! You can usually find a good deal on off-season items here. Selection isn't huge, but the quality of Eddie Bauer items are great. I've got shirts from years ago I bought here that are still as good as new. 
21372 0 These theiving, criminal sacks of garbage took ALL my quarters and dollar bills from my center console. THAT IS THEFT. These worthless inhuman pigs should be thrown in jail. 
21373 4 If you're stuck in airport this really is a great choice for food and wine and relaxation. I had professional service in a very nice atmosphere. I recommend Vino Volo when in Vancouver. I did not come for the wine but the selections are broad based. 
21374 4 These are the nicest folks. Kevork and John are amazing. Great service, super helpful. 
21375 3 This place never seems to disappoint, they seem to have just about everything you need at great prices, even organic stuff. 
21376 4 I absolutely love this place :) Their sushi is cheap, delicious, and because I go there so often I actually get a discount lol. I love it and I will go out of my way to get there if I am in a sushi mood. 
21377 4 The best empanadas around! Had an assortment but my favorite was the Verdura. Shared a nice bottle of Malbec. Had a part of 4 so and we shared the Parrillada plate which serves 2 but we all shared and it was enough. Friendly service and true authentic Argentinian food. 
21378 3 Best place to eat around Charleston. Burgers are the best and you can choose many different siders for it. Waiters are always in a hurry, so don't expect great service. 
21379 4 Just had an exceptional experience at this restaurant. Food was amazing but even more amazing was the service. Ask for Laurent if you go. He went above and beyond and was absolutely on top of things. 
21380 3 Great food, lots of varieties of beer, lots of tv's and two bars. Had an awesome time, would definitely go back!! 
21381 3 This shop was very pleasant - finding parking kinda sucked but I guess that's everywhere in Vancouver. They really do have a unique thing going here, and the tacos are a treat. I'll be back next time I head that way. 
21382 4 I went there two nights ago, and had a steak and a chicken taco. They both were absolutely delish! I can't wait to try the green chili and potato burrito, and the quesadilla. I'll be back very soon! 
21383 3 Pretty good salad and pork chops. Housemade gelato was yummy too. Avocado was yummy. Service was good 
21384 0 I think it's overrated. If you never been, try at least once. The food was okay, but a bit overpriced for the taste. You are really paying the ambience. 
21385 2 This restaurant has great prices but terrible tasting food. Stale fried noodles for the egg drop soup and bland egg foo young. 
21386 4 Cali burrito & the fish tacos are delicious!! A taste of California in Texas that we so desperately wanted. Thank you!! 
21387 0 Service was good food was incredibly bland and over priced. I wouldn't recommend this place. 
21388 4 Awesome property. Stayed here for a conference this weekend and the heavenly beds were great! Starbucks on site was fast and efficient. The restaurant on floor 72 was fun ..almost as fun as the elevator ride to get up there! Freindly staff:) 
21389 3 We always have a nice time at Carino's especially being Pasta Point members. The specials they have are fantastic - Mondays are family platters half price; great price - then Wednesdays - half price bottles of wine....friendly staff, manager...enjoyable experience... 
21390 3 The food here was great! I ordered the Rebel Wrap and really enjoyed it. My wife got the Thai salad and called it "crunchy and delicious". It was a little pricy for how much food I got, but I would come back and try something new. 
21391 4 Mike was fantastic! Super professional, and willing to take the time to go through every detail and explain it to this novice, first time home buyer. Highly recommend! 
21392 4 I highly recommend LISA MEREDITH , I had gone before to get my IPL treatment and now I am back and she got better! Her treatments include a microdermabrasion now, is a very good deal :) I planning to keep going ! 
21393 4 Only eaten there once so far (buffet) but it was delicious! Loved the paneer and naan. 
21394 4 Best cupcakes ever! They are large and dense, yet fluffy and they have a decent amount of icing without being more icing than cake. And on top of being delicious they are also vegan! Would totally recommend! 
21395 4 Great little hole in the wall lunch counter. Banh Mi and spring rolls are excellent! It's not far from route 128 so if you're in the area I highly recommend it. 
21396 3 Visiting tourist review... We noticed a lot of people going into this place at lunchtime so we decided to try it. Kind of funky interior, but it was really packed. We were seated and served promptly. The pho was really hot and delicious. Good find! 
21397 1 Compared to the other spring training venues no pro team appeal at all.My high school baseball field was much nicer we did however caught a great game Stros vs Yanks. 
21398 4 great food, service and atmosphere. loved the mushroom pizza and shoshito peppers with goat cheese 
21399 2 Prices are decent; after all, it is WalMart! Weekend crowds are to be expected, and parking is even worse than usual. Biggest complaint is the self checkouts...always a glitch. 
21400 3 Meatloaf was really good with crispy onion and ketchup. I loved it. I definitely order again. 
21401 4 We have been wanting to try here since they opened, years ago and finally did! Now I wish we would of went sooner. Food is awesome. Lamb perfectly cooked. The restaurant employee was very knowledgeable with wines. Enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service. 
21402 3 We ordered from here 9/1/18. We loved our pizza. My cousin was a little afraid to taste a white sauce. However, she was amazed at the food. 
21403 4 The best sundae I've ever had and I'm not a HUGE sweets person. The brownie was rich and chewy and you can taste the quality of the ice cream and the whipped cream. Price was very very reasonable as well for the quality you and size you get. Loved it!!!! 
21404 1 The pho was decent. Nothing to rave about. They did short me a quarter when making me the change. I guess everyone in Boston isn't an MIT or Harvard math wiz afterall. 
21405 3 Very good service. Fast and friendly. We had Mahi sandwich and it was very good. Love the corn nuggets. 
21406 4 This place is simply delicious! Whether if you want a cold-pressed juice or a smoothie, it all tastes "healthy" and fresh. Try the Dragonfly smoothie, so so good! 
21407 4 Update: Came in today as a walk-in for Pedicure and it was wonderful! There was a wait but the staff was so pleasant and worth the wait. I didn't get my technician's name but I love her work. 
21408 3 Every visit to Winebelly has been a positive. Excellent wine collection, knowledgeable and friendly staff, great food, and a casual patio-lounge vibe that fits south Austin perfectly. After Aviary, this is our second favorite wine spot. 
21409 2 Last time I was in, they were out of most of the flavors on their menu, and although the place was practically empty, they acted like they were too busy to help me. Probably not going back, there are better places that aren't so snooty. 
21410 4 Outstanding vegan fare. Had the jackfruit bbq sandwich with an avocado toast. Excellent. 
21411 4 Excellent food, fast and friendly service. One of the best vegetarian burritos I've had in a long time. 
21412 3 If you're lazy in getting CDs, you can sometimes find decent, and those guilty-pleasure albums a few months after they come out. It's great for getting much older CDs that you shouldn't pay full price for. 
21413 4 Dr. Tana is amazing ! The staff really takes care of you, I was so pampered. NO PAIN, total comfort. 
21414 4 Love this place,, small plates of food are so interesting and we get a little taste of everything. our server Emma, made great recommendations and loved the Tres Leches for dessert. Great seats on the patio away from the hubbub so we could relax and enjoy our meal and sangria 
21415 4 WOW...as a food snob that expects a lot of flavor, I must say this place knows how to cook. The best thing is they're cheap for the type of food and quality 
21416 4 A friend and I went last night. Our first time there. But not the last. Outstanding food and a friendly staff. 
21417 3 They need to hire some people that speak English. I had to use broken high school Spanish to order pai de queijo, and I'm more than certain that pissed off the Brazilians behind the counter. Never-the-less, they make awesome cheesy bread. Definitely stop by here. 
21418 2 Venue is nice. Friendly bartenders, good sound. Saw HTDA there and don't remember leaving the venue. Woke up on a street corner near Boylston St. My friend woke up in South Station, we only had a few drinks between us....All in all we had a good night....? 
21419 4 Oh my goodness!!! I love this place. Every time I'm in Portland involves a trip here. The thing I miss most about living at the old house (a block away) was this place. 
21420 3 Excellent Indian food. A few items that are non-traditional, but all cooked with imagination and care. Service helpful and friendly. Interesting ambience, with an eclectic crowd. Dessert worth looking at, though, like most Indian restaurants, not fully exploiting the depth of Indian sweets. 
21421 3 I eat here whenever I go to the Variety Playhouse for a show. I love Gyro, service is fast. Dining room not very comfortable but I'm alwaysout in 15 minutesor less. 
21422 4 Great food and service. The place was Packed!?! Had the gnocchi with sausage... Soooo tasty! 
21423 4 The drip coffee here is by far the best in all of Cambridge/Somerville. I have been coming here everyday since they opened and have never been disappointed. Come and give them a try and you won't be disappointed. 
21424 4 I have to say..some of the best beer ever..we hit 21 breweries..I know we have issues :) it was his birthday weekend and we are detoxing for the next 2 months..delicious beer..really good Jalapeno peppers.. 
21425 2 We ordered the lamb dish and the noodle dish. The lamb was really tasty but not the most tender. The noodles were okay, typical Nepal food, but not the best. 
21426 2 Are you a pasta lover? A fan of big portions? Then this is the place to go! I went with a bunch of my friends and did the family style. It was a good deal. Nothing too fancy though. 
21427 0 Staff is super slow...ordered a sandwich and no one is making it. By the time they even get started, my lunch break is over. 
21428 2 I've only been here a few times, but I never understood what was so great about their pizza. It was good, but not jump-up-and-down-in-your-chair great. 
21429 2 It's Target. Seemed pretty typically Targetish. The grocery selection was pretty big. The dollar section at the front of the store was pretty small. Tiny toy section. The book aisle has maybe 20 books. Check out lines were pretty long. On an evening, only 2 lanes were open. 
21430 0 It sucked. Not worth the money. Went this past Friday night. Hadn't been in a couple of years and was disappointed. 
21431 3 Experience: There's usually no wait and they're very accommodating for large groups. Food: A couple dishes can be sub par and bland, but majority of their dishes are good. The recommend the following: 1. Beef or Pork Momo 2. Shamday 3. Chicken Curry 
21432 4 I am in love with this place. I went because my back was in a lot of pain and my shoulders were very stiff. The atmosphere is relaxing and wonderful. Just what I needed. My masseuse was amazing. He seemed to really want to make my back better. 
21433 4 Best Bloody Mary I've had in a long time. The Crab Cakes Benedict was superb and so was the Carrot Cake French toast. Decadent!! Very good sitting out on the patio. Great service. Love this place 
21434 3 Monica took care of us. My friend Darin loves to be finger fed and they aim to please. My wife tried to sneak a tequila in but got busted, but we don't hold it against the establishment. Did I just burb barley or swine? (quote of the night) 
21435 4 Dustin was very professional and did a great job with my carpets. He was efficient and great to work with! My rug looked like brand new after he shampooed it! We very very happy with Dustin's services and would highly recommend him to anyone! 
21436 4 My favorite bar in Allston. The staff is great. Food always hits the spot. I show up weekly for the tacos and stay for the good times. You can't go wrong with the ave. I can't believe they're changing the name. It'll always be the ave to me. 
21437 4 My boyfriend and I loved this place. They have a huge wine selection (duh) along a bookshelf and you are able to walk around and pick your own wine. It doesn't feel gimmicky though. It feels intimate and well thought of. Try the cheese plate! 
21438 4 It's Ruth's Chris, need I say more? Ok fine, their cocktail shrimp is perfect, as are their steaks, the berries and cream dessert is light and the perfect way to end what's always a filling meal. 
21439 3 Love this location! They always make me feel welcome! The food is consistently yummy! 
21440 0 Never going there again! The service is awful, the food sucks & the atmosphere left much to be desired. Go there at your own risk! 
21441 3 Probably the best pizza I could find close to Lake Nona and they deliver. I'm from NY so my standards are pretty high. They have there off days but generally are good. Be sure to try the garlic knots as they are good too. 
21442 4 What a joy to find a restaurant that does everything you are looking for. Terrific service (Hi Bell!), ample portions, crab rangoons to die for, and a lovely floor plan. Five stars. My wife and I will be back many times. 
21443 4 I've been using house to house for 3 years now and will continue to. They always do a great job mowing and weed eating. Andy has been attentive and courteous every time we communicate. Keep up the great work! 
21444 4 Peter did a fabulous job on my nails! He was a lot of fun. He has this custom glitter ombré that he did on me and it looks great. Thanks Peter!! 
21445 4 The BEST breakfast burrito I've ever had. I was planning to come back Saturday and Sunday, was even planning on buying a few to bring back home but they're closed on the weekends. 
21446 3 I had a great experience at B & G. I just came in just for fresh oysters and some clam chowder. I am not a oyster expert and picking certain strains is like picking the Lottery. I would have preferred meater oysters. The ones I picked tasted great. 
21447 4 You mean I can grab a beer at the bar and enjoy it while I browse the extensive beer selection? I'm in. 
21448 3 Great menu, good food, and reasonable prices. Friendly wait staff and we were able to get in immediately on a very busy night at many other establishments. Will be coming back here. 
21449 4 Incredible. Healthy and flavorful menu. The cafe that a world class museum and cinema deserves. Thank you. 
21450 3 Nice coffee shop with a good view. Geared towards people walking the trail or who row. I wouldn't go here with the intention of sitting to get a lot of work done but if I were in the area and wanted a cup to go I would come here again. 
21451 4 This is one of my favorite seafood restaurants! The octopus appetizer and the lobster salad are heavenly and my absolute favorite. When I want to treat someone special...this is where I go. The staff is excellent also! 
21452 4 My only mistake was not coming here sooner. The owner stopped by asking for feedback at our table at the end. The food was high quality. Never been to Turkey but it tastes great. Will make this a regular stop. 
21453 0 The case was nearly empty at noon...on top of that, the man's attitude at the store was rude and unfriendly. What a huge disappointment....we drove all the way just to buy their donut! We went to Oakleaf Cafe instead. Never go back to Jennifer Lee's again. 
21454 1 I didn't love the food and felt it was pretty bland. I had a bite of my boyfriend's sausage, though, and it seemed like they got that right. Overpriced for the quality, though. 
21455 4 We came to watch the comedy & bands play downstairs last Thurs. While we waited we decided to try their dinner special... "Cornbread Mac & Cheese". OMG! Sooo good & unique. We recommend everyone to try it. The service was fast & friendly too. 
21456 4 The best pizza in town by far!!! The same as the Smokey's we grew up with. Always our family's first choice!! 
21457 4 One of my fave UPS stores. Friendly, fast, professional. I like that I can drop docs off for shredding, have my biz mail box there, mail items without a long wait, have items packaged for me, etc. 
21458 4 Never fails to impress. I love love love their baked goods. Please try the uguisu an roll, it's green but you won't regret it! 
21459 0 WARNING: If you go into Whiskeys drunk, you will most likely be hungover by the time you fight through crowd to get your beer. 
21460 3 For good coffee and bagels on the go this place is the spot for Milwaukie. The service is great and the latte's are consistent. 
21461 4 My wife and I enjoyed our first visit here. Staff was friendly, food was good, and price was fair. They have a good drink selection but need dark beer. Didn't get to hear the band, next trip! 
21462 4 So we didn't go for the chefs tasting but the daily offerings...still soooo good. Every bite was worth savoring. Staff was super friendly. First timer I thought the place to be bigger. Still great overall experience! 
21463 4 Was visiting town with a large group. A few of us walked in and placed an order for seven people, with the checks split up. They handled it easily, were super friendly about it, the order came out fairly quickly and accurately, and was also delicious. 
21464 0 The hotel has so many issues, I am not sure where to begin. It has been renovated and there are clearly things that have not been taken care of. The rates are good but you get what you pay for. 
21465 0 Check in crew at the boarding gate for aa147 bos to lax on 1/22/18 has no customer service skills or courtesy. No consistency hap hazard - don't know what they are doing. 
21466 4 I know this is an uppity restaurant with a chain feel, but the food is delicious so I can't not come here! The vegetarian options are awesome and the spices are perfect! 
21467 4 Dr. Fell is the best for us!!..she had taken great care of our 17y.o. Pug,now she cares for our other two pugs.could not be happier with the care and attention me and our boys get!! Ty 
21468 4 A great little bike shop with reasonably priced bike repairs and a good selection of bikes, helmets, accessories, and clothing. They got my vintage tandem ready for Spring riding! 
21469 4 The dolmas are delicious! I'll be back for more! They had just closed, but happily took my order! This is authentic yummy Greek food with excellent pricing! 
21470 4 Great food. Ceviche was just about the same as in Peru. Big servings. Not many customers around so the service was great too. 
21471 4 Two thumbs up from me: friendly, quick, and the atmosphere is top notch. Hope to be back some day. 
21472 4 This is the best salon I've ever found. Mary consistently gives me a great haircut. So glad to have a regular spot in the neighborhood. 
21473 4 This is a great place to come if you wanna watch any game you can think of (think Pittsburgh Pirates and Detroit Lions) and have a beer without dealing with smoke like some other bars around town that might show games. 
21474 2 Me and my wife have been to this establishment a few times because it is in the neghborhood. The hot and sour soup is good and I thought that the fried rice was decent, but the I the dishes seem average. 
21475 4 I've been coming here for 14 years...6 cars. Oil changes and car washes. Always awesome service!! Above and beyond. 
21476 3 Great selection of pastries, love the place and will be going back for more sweets.... 
21477 4 The folks at pipelines are friendly, prompt, knowledgeable, and overall amazing!! Heard about them from my neighbor recently, and they came highly recommended. I am in complete agreement, and recommend them unhesitatingly. I won't be going anywhere else for plumbing needs. 
21478 4 The best nail salon in Portland! Fast without rushing, clean, friendly and relaxing (no tv!!!!). I can truly unwind here. Fair pricing and great selection of colors. The owner, Tu (pronounced 'doe') is so nice. 
21479 4 I've been to several of these chains before, but I appreciated this one much more. The ambiance ranges from elite to jack and cokes at the bar. Thanks to our bartender (Blee? Your accent was so thick!) we had a great time. 
21480 2 No frills pizza. Slices of cheese pizza for $2.75 and the slices are huge. They do not skip on cheese. The crust has a lot of corn meal, which I am not a fan of. 
21481 1 Drive up pharmacy, what a great concept!!! The service I got was "blah." Good for the morning pharmacist he isn't paid to provide excellent customer service. Note: turn off your engine so you can hear from the speaker! 
21482 4 The wings here are great and I usually try to order them when I have large get togethers with friends. My personal favorite is the garlic parmesian and honey BBQ favors. 
21483 4 Terrific food. Ambience is a bit lacking but friendly staff, great service and delicious food warrant a five star. 
21484 4 Had dinner twice here. Very good food and the service is awesome. But you have to tell them to add more spice if you want spicy food. 
21485 3 Excellent sushi and other Japanese food at reasonable prices. Atmosphere is not impressive but is relaxed. Service is quick and friendly. 
21486 4 I have never seen this place before as it is sort of hidden. Awesome cold brew and antipasto salad. Comfy and cool vibe. Would go to over starbucks 
21487 4 Great place great concept, fast service! Manager stopped by table to greet after finding out our first time there. Would highly recommend 
21488 4 Yum their burritos are really good! So are the tacos. 
21489 4 If you like brisket, definitely check these guys out! I went to the Barton springs location and left a fat happy bastard! 
21490 3 Mango Sorbet is the best that I have ever tasted. Yum!! About $5 to $6 for ice cream. My kids wanted to come back for more. 
21491 3 Love this place! My favorite part is the Wednesday wine tastings - the staff is so knowledgeable about wine, yet in a non-snobby way. I have learned so much and have gotten the opportunity to taste so many different wines. 
21492 4 Legendary JP establishment. 
21493 4 Food was delicious and service was very quick to go. I had the Athenian and I got my husband the beef kefta kabob. The salad, rice and veggies were all fantastic. We'll definitely be back! 
21494 4 fastest sandwich shop in austin, bar none. my favorite sub is the #6 (vegetarian), and i'm not even vegetarian... 
21495 1 An uninspired menu with mediocre results: spinach salad was tasty, salmon tartare was not, white special pizza was forgettable. Chatty-Cathy waiter who kept telling us to try the restaurant he used to work at. My prediction that Coal Vines will not survive the Austin restaurant scene for long. 
21496 1 Verrrry slow service, expensive for what it is. Food is OK, standouts were the vege sides and the beer. The rest was meh, served cold and over priced. 
21497 0 Once, twice, three times and done. Poor selection in many sections, some items more expensive than Zupans or Whole Foods let alone New Seasons or TJs, and a tragic-comic customer service experience. Sad to say because they're only four blocks away, but it's Freddy's or New Seasons for this kid. 
21498 1 Although the food is good, prices ok you can't trust their cleaniness. when the health score is consistently low i wonder how much they care about their customers and reputation. 
21499 4 The best tacos I have ever had in my life. The chicken and beef were flavorful with good spice and the selection of salsas were amazing. I wish I could go back tomorrow! 
21500 4 Love this place,, feel like your at your best friends house but his mother is cooking! Food is fresh and prepared perfectly,, nice selections Games are on , so great place to hang out with a lot of great beers!! Train station really short walk too. It's our new favorite. 
21501 2 Quick lunch spot. Food was decent, but prices were amazing. My coworker got the bento box, while I stuck with the gyozas. Service was good. 
21502 0 Based on Yelp and Google, you guys should be open right now. 1pm on a Saturday. But you're closed. Second time this has happened to me. This is very annoying. I wanna try your food with a group of friends but you're not letting me. 
21503 0 If I could give no stars believe me I would. Too expensive, seemed dirty and the staff was not friendly. Pretty embarrassing. Wouldn't go back. 
21504 3 Delicious little spot just off Lombard. Be prepared to wait a little bit of time, but it's well worth it. 
21505 4 I was here at lunchtime with a group of 12. We all had great food and fabulous service! Not one single person had a complaint and we wanted for nothing! Highly recommend! 
21506 0 Yes, bad service, it was laud, but our waiter could not be bothered to speak up. The food is at best mediocre. My friends told me so, but the place looks kind of cool, you want to like it... but they were right, it is definitely a disappointment. 
21507 4 Very yummy choices for the gelato and all their donuts! Definitely a return customer here! 
21508 1 I had the green curry for lunch. The curry was bland, had chicken a few peas and one basil leaf. There wasn't and texture or aroma I would expect. Maybe they had an off day. It was my first time so no history to compare. 
21509 4 Simply the most heavenly cup of coffee in all of Austin. Our favorite is the Summer Moon Latte. The moon milk is so good there might be something illegal in it. Don't pass this place up. 
21510 4 The drinks are good compliment by a live band.The fried pig ears are very good.The lamb chops are just right.My team and I ordered over $100.00 worth of drinks and food. 
21511 4 The chicken cordon bleu scramble was amazing. The pancakes that came with it were huge, a meal in itself. 
21512 4 Purchasing a condo here has been one of the best decisions I've made in Austin. It's a perfect location. It's clean, and safe, and the neighbors are mature, kind, and quiet. 
21513 4 I've been going to the old treat your feet for years now. They recently moved here to this location. Susan, Alan, and Dennis are probably the best ones in there. My husband and I always get a great massage by those three. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone! 
21514 4 Awesome dispensary! Needed an oil cartridge and happened by here. I was $5 short for the one I wanted but the guy was so cool and gave me $5 off since it was my first time there. Very much appreciated 
21515 4 Simple, delicious, and natural. A great choice for a quick and hearty meal. Best to call the order in if you're in a hurry, but that's because it's made to order. 
21516 4 I have been eating here for several years. It is the best. If you don't like gyros then get anything else you like because it will be just as good. But you must get the Saganaki. It is to die for. 
21517 4 We have used coit several times now to clean our tile floors as well as our ducts. I find them to be fairly priced and the techs are very considerable and knowledgeable. We have hired different companies over the years but haven't looked back since hiring these guys! 
21518 4 Imaginative plates challenge the pallet. Love this spot! If you love to taste a variety of things, you'll love this. The cocktails are amazing, as well. 
21519 3 Best pizza around. Obviously this has been beaten to death, but they're pickup sercice is very slow. They know their product is great so they slack on the service, which I'm fine with. 
21520 4 Great service! They don't try to upsell you into a bike you don't need. Very happy with my mountain bike purchase! 
21521 0 They are no longer T'Kilas. The name change is Sotolero. They are charging liquor tax, not honoring signage for lunch, and confrontational. Service is slooooooooooow. 
21522 3 Very long wait, however once we were seen, the staff and doctor were very nice and though with the eval. I would come back here again. 
21523 1 Generally the store is okay but they never have any chicken! Today the meat area was completely devoid of anything, nothing, nada. I don't want to buy factory raised chicken at the large supermarket but you're leaving me no choice (see what I did there?). 
21524 4 Great food. We were vacationing and used Yelp review. Authentic food great service. Ask for Marcos. 
21525 4 Both my food and my drink were phenomenal! Great service as well! I would highly recommend the blueberry patch cocktail and the Turkey tips. 
21526 4 Nice place. Great food. Great place to eat. Had the fish tibs. 
21527 3 Lawrence is a nice guy and works hard on his business. Very welcoming and accommodating. Free wifi and cable tv. Support this local business. 
21528 4 This is a great fast, casual option in central Boulder! I had amazing service from Teddy. I would definitely recommend this great restaurant with tasty food! 
21529 4 LEMON MERINGUE PIE CONE SUNDAE! Vanilla custard, pie crust pieces, lemon meringue sauce covering the inside of the cone and marshmallow fluff on top. The most delicious and refreshing ice cream cone I think I've ever had. If you are a citrus lover you will not be disappointed. 
21530 4 This seems very authentic. I am not too familiar with Pakistani food but it was great! Service was awesome and the selection was good. The owner came by and asked about the food and service which is always a nice gesture. 
21531 4 Excellent food and atmosphere. Lives the volcano roll and summer roll. My children loved it too. Excellent. 
21532 4 So good, and the staff was so friendly. I had the spicy turkey, and it was delicious! It's definitely worth a try if you're in the area for lunch, I'm really excited that this place popped up and I'm sure I'll be back soon. 
21533 4 I only write 5 stars reviews and this place deserves a lot more than 5 stars.As a woman of a certain age it is so rewarding to see your image change with a couples of stokes by Julia.I'm so happy with my new look .Very friendly staff, strongly recommended. 
21534 4 Love the place, food really good price, drinks normal price miller light bottle 3.50, good taste, waitress really nice no complaints at all, just dont forget your I.D. they will ask for it at the entrance. 
21535 3 Had some great strawberry gelato the other week. This location is very comfortable. Lots of seating and space to get out of the rain. I try and stop in when I am in the area, usually doing some antique shopping. 
21536 0 WTF - went for lunch and waited almost an hour for food that never came, with zero communication, and my party of 3 ordered very simple things. We ended up walking out. I've NEVER done that but this place was just that bad. Don't bother. 
21537 2 I agree with Bill B. I don't know what all the hype is about. I'm Southern, and the food here is okay. Overpriced for what you get. Went for lunch and it was over $60 for 2. 
21538 3 Not a big fan of the long lines here on the weekends, but definitely worth it for the supreme omelet! 
21539 2 i always know where to go from that parking lot so i have no problem with it except dont go during busy hours, take me at least half an hour to get out and half an hour cost u lotz of $$ for parking. 
21540 4 The service is amazing!!! Heather was our waitress and she was wonderful!!! We celebrated our anniversary here and we have never felt more special!! Thank you Flemings for always living up to our expectations!!! #1 steakhouse!! 
21541 4 This place was packed on a weeknight when we came in but it didnt take long to be seated. Every dish we got and dessert was delicious, and service was great. Clean and modern decor. Will definitely be back! 
21542 4 One of the tastiest burgers I ever had in MA & NY. Simply delicious! 
21543 0 Went here because Hanah's Sushi was closed. Miso soup was good. Worst sushi I ever had. The seaweed and fish were both very tough. Nothing tasted fresh. Now I feel sick. 
21544 4 Awesome tacos. Definitely authentic. They grill the meats when you order so its not like you are eating meat that's been sitting around in a warming tray. Cheap and filling. 
21545 4 Delicious vegan options. Come one come all to this lovely place with lovely coffee. 
21546 1 What is going on here? I don't really understand this restaurant. The food is not good, 1/3 the menu was unavailable. How do they stay in business? The service was good! 
21547 4 DELICIOUS! Seriously! This place has an amazing selection of subs to choose from. Words cannot even begin to describe the deliciousness that comes from this place... you must go and find out on your own! Taste the sub rainbow! 
21548 3 Decent ribeye cooked just how I asked. Loved it smothered. No holding back on the grilled onions and sautéed mushrooms. Loved it. They could use a better beer selection. At least one craft beer on tap would be nice. 
21549 4 Fantastic tour guide Jake was very informative and had great jokes!! Did a great job showing us the different types of buildings and history. Made this an educational yet fun experience!! Cheers p.s maybe recommendation of portable microphones so everyone can hear him speak e.g when vehicles are passing! 
21550 3 The cod & chips, halibut & chips and the chowder was very good!!! Would definitely return if/when in Vancouver again! 
21551 4 So many options and the prices are very reasonable. The staff was super friendly and helped us whenever we had questions. They also have so many pots to choose from, and it is just so beautiful. Really enjoyed stopping there on Sunday afternoon, and can't wait to come back 
21552 3 The avocado margaritas changed my life. My friend who doesn't even like avocados ordered one by mistake and loved them. The rest of the food was very good but we all know the star. 
21553 2 Despite some negative reviews, all and all it wasnt bad. I had the pistachio on a cone. It was delicious, plenty of nuts and no green additive for coloring! Id go back...of until there was something bad that I could see. 
21554 2 Really kind of average. None of the fish seemed particularly fresh, and nothing really stood out. Not the place to come if you are really looking for super high-quality sushi 
21555 4 Best breakfast in OTown. Everything is delicious with great portions. I usually split my breakfast with my two toddlers and we are all full. 
21556 3 Excellent Fra Diavlo with homemade penne. Great service. $4 charge to replace linguini with penne is a bit ridiculous The lighting is very dark, maybe too dark but then again it is in a basement and is a small restaurant. Overall, I would definitely recommend and would return. 
21557 3 Honestly this is some solid food. I personally would rather have a thick pita (they have paper thin wraps here) but the falafel itself was moist and delicious. Soup bar is a nice touch and there's plenty of seating downstairs. 
21558 3 Finally tried this place since our favorite esparzas closed. A little on the pricey side but food was really good. Glad we tried it and will be back! 
21559 4 It's not easy to find a halal cafe. So happy to find this gem and they make wonderful sandwiches! They are so friendly and the coffee and tea is simply awesome! 
21560 3 Ahhh. Left a review for the wrong place. Trying to figure out how to remove. Haven't been here. 
21561 2 Service was very good. Our burger was medium although we asked for medium well. Drinks were unique and delicious. Environment is open and filled with natural light!! 
21562 1 Over priced- example: dog fish head 90 @ $12.99?? 11.99 at Blanchards, 10.99 at center st! The beer cooler w singles isnt even cold. Selection demand to be oriented to mid to low price beers and the few that are good craft beers are over priced 
21563 0 Had the worst experience there today when I tried to have a breakfast. The service was slow waited at least 30 min for my French toast and when it got there I pulled a long grosse hair out of it. I'm never going there again! 
21564 4 My favorite bar. Great beer selection, good food, and board games to play. What is not to love? 
21565 3 Nice guys, they had what I needed, and they replaced my tire super quick. All good. 
21566 2 This place is closed for renovations. The sign on the door did not indicate when it will reopen. 
21567 4 Great food and a large menu. I got a chicken fried steak in the lite size and there was still enough to take some home. Best chicken fried steak I have had in awhile. My spouse got the breakfast burritos and loved them! Can't wait to go again! 
21568 4 Great food and service. Nice peaceful environment. If you want some authentic shanghainese chinese food, it's a hell of a place. 
21569 3 Great French food! The crepes are very good, and the rack of lamb with blue cheese sauce was the best! The blue cheese wasn't too strong, it complimented the meat nicely! Also, you have to do the Gratin de Fruits (berries 'n cream) for dessert! 
21570 4 Being a novice cigar smoker, I really enjoyed the help I received from Zeke! He was very patient and informative. He set me up and even conditioned my new humidor. Excellent service! 
21571 4 Honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about Parkway. The service here is phenomenal. Everyone is friendly and makes sure you are well taken care of. The food is always delicious... I haven't tried anything I haven't liked. I'd give this place more stars if I could. 
21572 4 Badass tacos. Think Torchy's style taco but vegan. Aside from a greasy awesome tacos from a Mexican restaurant these might be some of the best tacos in austin. The bean Diablo taco will blow yer mind. 
21573 4 My truck blew a couple tie rods. Had my truck towed here unannounced. They were professional, and took care of me within the day. I felt the price was reasonable, and will bring my business here again. 
21574 2 Didn't have to wait in line, and the staff was helpful. A plus is that they are right next to a great thrift store! 
21575 3 Everyone was very pleasant and Abby our server was on top of it! The broccoli cheddar soup is homemade and delish! I had the one of their signature salads with sweet and tangy dressing and salmon. So good. Not too busy at lunch either. Perfect place to take clients 
21576 4 Perry is a wealth of knowledge. He helped me and my wife make the best decision based on our needs. We like how fast he moved and responded to the dynamic Austin market. 
21577 4 Jamie the bartender is such a joy! He makes me laugh, quick on service, and gives great recommendations for food! Love coming in after work or for a quick bite to eat! 
21578 4 My neighbourhood park and I come here daily. Great people, great dogs...I've never had any issues. It's a beautiful dog park with lots of places to sit and offers a stunning backdrop of Vancouver. 
21579 1 Delivery was on time, prices are low, and portions are large. But the Eggplant Parm Pasta was very greasy, like a soggy buttered pancake and the sauce was very watery. Next time, I'll avoid the Eggplant Parm. 
21580 3 You will see some of the really great woman here I was here several years ago..BIG Booty woman on certain days!!.....ONE of the best strip clubs..and its laid back without a lot of people.. 
21581 1 The waiter was cool. I hope he opens up his own restaurant that has baby corns and water chestnuts in EVERYTHING! 
21582 0 The gap between my friend Rick's two front teeth has more personality than this place. I mean, Cmon!!, bland colors, bland sales people, bland displays. Is this all that has become of America? Can't we do better? 
21583 0 Decent food, TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE service. The staff is straight up scary. Very rude. Dont bother. 
21584 4 Hugh is the best!! He knows what in and is personable. He makes hair recommendations based your what will suit you and your lifestyle. I have been going to him for over a year now. I wouldn't trust anyone else. 
21585 2 Not bad chinese, considering few better options in Somerville/Porter square area 
21586 4 We always have a great time here. Our Itamea Joe was fabulous. We order the Lyric Etude it goes great with the lovers roll! The server's are always gracious and attentive. 
21587 4 BREAKFAST PANINI. It's amazing. So glad they added the new addition, my only complaint was that the building wasn't big enough. Now it is!! 
21588 0 Manager a bit disconnected tonight. Closed out the tab. He tossed me my change, not a word he shared. How about "Thanks for stopping in tonight". 
21589 4 The sushi was amazing and the service was impeccable. Khiet was a great server. He recommended the lobster roll which was an excellent choice. I will be returning soon! 
21590 4 This place rocks! Good food, great service and an intimate atmosphere that allows for a fun time (you can hear one another!). None better. 
21591 4 Definitely coming back! Love that you can take it home in pint containers too!! They change the flavors out daily and have lots of toppings. 
21592 4 Great food everytime, polite and friendly service. Consistency is key and Macho Taco has got it. Love this place! 
21593 4 Wonderful kitchen, wonderful food. Family owned and the waitstaff is so friendly. Sometimes there is a little wait, but it is well worth any wait. The baklava is marvelous and you can tell the owners care about your experience. I love to take visitors from out of town here. 
21594 3 Very good experience. Upon arrival we were picked up from the airport within 5 min and same coming back. Vehicle pick up took 15 min although I didn't get the car I requested it still was a luxury car. I will rent from then again. 
21595 2 Another case of it is what it is. Another kind of TGIFridays but with pizza. It's good. Resonable prices for solid chain restaurant food. Drinks are pricey. 
21596 4 Bree was great to work with and was very efficient and knowledgeable. I would definitely use her help again and recommend her to others! 
21597 3 Love this grocery store! reasonable prices and it's very close to the t. 
21598 4 Great upholstery cleaning. Patrick was super professional and efficient. Will use for all my cleaning needs as the service menu is extensive! 
21599 0 Terrible Service and the food is sub par. We waited for a server forever to pay attention to us and the place was less than 20% crowded. All of the staff I encountered to observed had attitude. NOT Recommended. 
21600 3 I kinda miss their old location as it was on the way from my route to work from the gym. Their waffles are to die for along with a good cup of coffee. 
21601 0 Worst customer service on earth don't even bother with this location just save yourself the trouble and go to Piedmont or the peachtree location 
21602 0 Several years of great product and service have been undone by staff changes. 
21603 4 Great food, excellent price... my fav Ethiopian restaurant in Boston... always end up leaving this place happy and with lots of take outs. 
21604 0 Ate here twice. First time the lobster roll had little taste. Service was good Second time food was okay. Service was horrible!!! Waitress was less than pleasant it took forever to get her to come take our order. Would I return. A big NO 
21605 4 The best Greek restaurant in the world. I've travel to Greece and the islands on three occasions. Nothing compares. Periods. 
21606 4 Definitely skip the Dunkin next door and head over to Donut Express. Their fresh, handmade donuts are simply the best. I often see the owner there and she is super nice. I LOVE this place and highly recommend it. 
21607 3 This place is awesome. Don't let the naysayers fool you. General Tso lunch combo! 
21608 4 I can't imagine it getting better than this. Natural ingredients, variety, no sugar overload, and reasonable prices compared to others. 
21609 1 The food was okay, but the service wasn't stellar. Everything was in plastic bags which is so wasteful, why can't they use reusable bowls? I asked the server and she said that it's easier to mix around in bags. :/ 
21610 4 We're locals and had never heard of this place, but such a gem! Very cozy inside with the Portlandia feel...service was exceptional and food delicious....we appreciated the organic, local and sustainable foods! 
21611 3 The food was great, but overpriced. It was a long wait and a packed night on a Wednesday. If you don't mind sitting with people you don't know, go here. It's simplistic which was pretty cool. Its a nice atmosphere too. 
21612 1 Yuck. This place seems a lot like a gussied up sports bar to me. I'll say this for them--they don't miss any opportunity to cook stuff in the fryolator, so maybe you'll like it if that's your bag. 
21613 4 This was a great experience! I was moving in state but for quite some distance but nothing was damaged. The guys showed up on time, were well prepared and made the whole thing a breeze. The price was great too! Would definitely recommend. 
21614 3 I have to give an update because we order pizza here regularly. We still do not order any of the other entrees because when friends tell us its not that great we stay away :) Anyhow, the Cheeseburger pizza and the Brie and Artichoke are our absolute favorites! 
21615 3 the mac and cheese and coca-cola bake beans are out of site good. Definitely enjoyed them. This place is great for a business lunch near the airport. Don't buy the fried-chicken hype though...I'd order something else for the main dish 
21616 3 Mekong river is a great vietnamese-thai restaurant. Prices are reasonable (avg around $10) and their portions are generous. I would suggest the pineapple curry chicken dish. Very nice atmosphere for a date! 
21617 4 Don't listen to those 'no cheese' and 'tastes like cardboard' comments. The pizza is awesome and the lamb is very smoky. And it can be busy 'cause people are lining up yo have cardboard pizza!!!!! 
21618 3 I have since been back, and like I said before, the doctor's here are awesome! I guess that is what really matters and I would have given them 5 stars if I did not remember that scheduling issue. I highly recommend The Eye Studio! 
21619 4 Absolutely delicious cookies! Chocolate chip cookie is baked just right and a great flavor. Had their Hot Chocolate cookie (was a preview and supposedly coming full time this fall or winter) and it was amazing! 
21620 4 Very high quality service! Beautiful work and extremely good communication with me, insurance, and rental company. Highly recommended. 
21621 3 Great Happy Hour esp during Football season. Better get there early though 
21622 3 Very good, fun place. Solid lobster roll but...be careful. The voice mail says they are open an hour later than they are. Almost screwed me. 
21623 4 Great food, ambience, service and prices! This will be one of our go-to places. Fresh ingredients and large portions! 
21624 4 Friendly, fast service, but the best of all was the food. Absolutely delicious, and great portions. Would highly recommend. Cachapa was out of this world. 
21625 3 Best coffee in Salem. Great location, hours, and atmosphere. Do wish they'd encourage people to bring travel mugs by giving a discount like they do at Gulu Gulu. 
21626 2 CD Spins is a satisfactory used CD and DVD store. The selection is not huge, but they tend to have a lot of older music that is hard to find. 
21627 1 While I would be extatic if I could like Emma's, it just doesn't make the cut. The dough is bland, the sauce is bad (often sweet), and the cheese is just no good! Fails to deliver a quality pie. 
21628 4 I made Duke and I live in Jersey!! Haha. This is my place to stop anytime I'm in MA. Best roast beef around and I grew up on Riley's when I worked in Chelsea! 
21629 4 One of the best veggie burgers I've ever eaten. The poutine with mushroom miso gravy is out of this world. And the IPA and chocolate stouts my party ordered were both delicious. 
21630 4 I go because they offer a BOGO on 1/3 lb burgers. I will go back because the burgers are juicy and delicious. To add there is a bar of just about any topping you could want in the burger. 
21631 1 Do not eat here. Much better taco options anywhere else. This is bad. Their brand and design is great, the food sucks. Specifically; the ingredients are bland and taste cheap / not fresh. 
21632 3 I have been visiting this location since 1997. It actually hasd switched owners but the service is still great! The staff are always warm and hospitable. 
21633 4 I've been going to Brandon for many years. Starting with where he started in Clackamas Town center. He's always cut my hair to perfection and I've never been dissatisfied with the service he's provided. Great guy, great haircuts. You really can't go wrong. 
21634 3 This place has awesome food. The service is friendly. I cannot even begin to explain the portions. They are MASSIVE. The dining room is small but the atmosphere is upbeat and fun. 
21635 4 Still the best, the lobster is freaking great, crispy garlic, ginger and onion are both good choices. Crispy pork chop. I can't stop eating it every time I come here. About to try the congee today. 
21636 3 Great place to kick back with a happy hour martini (dirty martini is a special favorite). Love the calamari appetizer. Good fish and chips. 
21637 4 Great family outing for all ages! Reasonably priced, clean & music was great. So happy we found this place by our resort on this chilly, rainy day. We are all sore and tired from laughing and skating!! 
21638 2 Watery salsa and loud banal network TV detracted from the experience. Otherwise, the tacos were decent...not quite as greasy / savory as I normally see. 
21639 2 I've been twice and both times I'd rate it three stars. The service is slow, but once they show up the servers are very kind and attentive. The food we have gotten lacks some flavor. What I love: The fish tanks, the clean environment, the seats are always full. 
21640 3 I recently bought some veggie plants from them and liked the quality and price. Very good condition and prices for a true intown location. Check it out you will be pleased. 
21641 4 Justin is the bomb! $2.25 shiners. Came here for date night with the bae for the first time and had sesame chicken and shrimp lo mein 
21642 4 Every time I go for a visit, I have the tasting menu. Great food, bold flavours, it's always amazing.... I also always ask for the Parmesan Soufflé. 
21643 4 Great service by Chemere! Good music and DJ, tearing up the Dance Floor!!! What a great place to celebrate on a happy Friday... We will be back!!!! 
21644 4 I've been coming here for a couple years now and I am never disappointed with their service!! Such friendly staff and great prices! 
21645 4 Absolutely lovely. From the ambience to the greeting, attentive but not overbearing service from Nick,the gorgeous serve ware and of course the subtle and inventive food by chef. This was an exceptional experienced. Thank you Juniper! 
21646 3 Had a delicious bowl of braised oxtails and rice with cornbread. Peppery seasoning and tender savory meat, with the occasional bits of gelatin so typical of that cut. Have not had such a yummy bowl since leaving Chicago. Cute place too. I look forward to going back. 
21647 4 Roadhouse Benedict was delicious!! They have a great Bloody Mary bar and bottomless champagne brunch for super cheap on the weekends. Love the funky atmosphere and great service (although slightly slow but we weren't in a hurry). 
21648 4 I had the worst calzone ever. Half was only bread and cheese, other half had 3 pepperoni and a small slice of ham 
21649 4 Unicorn dress up day was a hoot. Food was great as was the service...do arrive early. 
21650 4 So so so good. Everything is pretty much gluten free. Which is nice. The salad bar is amazing- especially the gratin potatoes. The meat that comes around is so flavorful. We go every time we are in town. Staff is really friendly. 
21651 4 Great company!! Amazing service and staff! Jennifer & Matthew are the best. I have tried numerous "marketing" companies but Get the clicks actually produces new clients for my appraisal company! 
21652 3 This has become one of our go to places for breakfast when we get off the plane at PDX. Everything is so flavorful and fresh 
21653 4 This is really a top notch grocery store. Not only do they have a lot of Central Market stuff, they also have regular, well-priced grocery store stuff. It's got nice wide aisles, lots of cashiers (even when it's very busy) and is just an exceptional place to shop. 
21654 2 Good food, but the waffle fries were way too salty. They would have been awesome without all the salt! Good otherwise and really great service!!! 
21655 4 Excellent lamb wrap with fries. Great service too. The lamb wrap is a little different from the rest as the meat was ground, but so delicious. There is hooks and al fresco dining. 
21656 3 Just following up. I had no issues at all with the rescheduling/cancelling. 
21657 3 Salmon nigiri was very good. Also enjoyed the various rolls. Will be back to try the other dishes. Server was alright, thus the 4 star rating. For the price we were pleasantly satisfied! 
21658 4 A quick and tasty tacequeria! Would recommend the mole tacos. They also have a bunch of other Mexican snacks and sauces for sale as well. 
21659 4 Very cute spot! Crabcake sandwich was yum and I loved the carrot ginger soup!! Can't wait to try more! 
21660 3 Service is excellent very attentive and very nice. Food was good. lots of good options. Good crab cakes. The Surf & Turf was very filling and rich flavor. the outdoor seating is really great gives you the perfect atmosphere for seafood. 
21661 0 I had takeout the food was disgusting!!! I got the Egusi Stew smelled bad I added the Fish which was very dry I was told it was whiting and it wasn't .The price for very disappointing to spend $14.00 on lunch that went right to trash. 
21662 4 The France Pavilion has plenty of good French themed cuisine items such as croissants, crepes, small French pastries. It's a great place to stop by when you're at EPCOT. 
21663 0 Crowded! Bunch of kids and old people nowhere to study really. Remember your elementary library? Well this should bring you back some memories. 
21664 4 My aunt and uncle took me here, and I am in love with this place. Their Hawaiian pizza and chicken grill sub are amazing!!! The place is clean and the staff was very professional and hospitable. Strongly recommend it! 
21665 4 My favorite restaurant in town, Period. 
21666 4 I ordered the Chicken Shawarma and really liked it. The food is fresh and healthy, the prices are reasonable, and the service was stellar. I'd eat there again in the future! 
21667 3 Great salsa. My only complaint is that there are no weekly beer specials but other than that my favorite Mexican food spot. 
21668 4 Cesar was the best waiter! Along with the rest of the staff, it was so much fun!!. And my enchiladas..... they were wonderful. And my flight of margaritas.....so tasty!!!! I will be back! 
21669 4 Really good service and awesome snacks! Really good variety of snack and delicious soups. A real open bar too 
21670 4 Great Authentic Southern Home Cooking! Fast, Quality, Inexpensive...three words not usually grouped together! Highly recommended. Don't let the look of the place fool you! 
21671 2 Horrible service. Food was alright. Prices were alright. Was excited about this place, but not anymore. The best thing I tried- fresh grapefruit juice! 
21672 4 Hands down the best fried shrimp in the world! So juicy and succulent and plentiful portions too. Everytime I come home this is one of my first stops. 
21673 2 Had this place for dinner during the week. pros - chefs understand how to properly cook meats - good drinks - quality ingredients cons - i was not a fan of the non-traditional sides they pair their entries with - appetizer wasn't great. good idea but poor execution 
21674 4 I have now been here twice and I love it! Both times I got a pedicure and gel French manicure. After almost 4 weeks my fingers and toes still look really good! I will keep coming back for a long time. 
21675 4 Righteous pizza for a great price! Baby Doll Pizza rocked my world with a bacon, pepperoni and candied walnut slice. Will be back again! 
21676 0 They discontinued the chocolate stick not sure why. Plus you need to check your bag at the drive through you might not get what you want. Other DD have the variety of donuts that people want 
21677 4 Amazing service, attention to details and fantastic food! It's definitely worth the time to go and have a great meal! 
21678 4 I get my hair cut by Serena every month and she is awesome ! Great stylist, highly skilled, always pleasant, and very professional. It's hard to find consistency w/ hair cuts and she is the model of consistency. I always look forward to seeing Serena for a haircut. 
21679 4 Really good consistent and fast service. The flavor of the broth is really good and always hits the spot. Plenty of everything in the soup - noodles, meat, tripe, etc. some other places I've noticed seem to Be skimping... 
21680 3 A nice intimate lounge environment with pretty good sushi and excellent cocktails. The music isn't too loud, and the lighting isn't too bright. Ask for a corner table up by the windows if you want a bit more secluded location. 
21681 0 Only good thing was my coffee the chicken was mediocre .. white rice was undercooked ... found a egg shell in my bread :-/ i guess atleast it was fresh ingredients... only two high chairs not fun eating with a one yr old in a booster ... wouldnt come back 
21682 3 High quality burger place by Mark Wahlberg and brothers. Custom made, good drinks, will make you full. At Hingham shipyard area. 
21683 1 Both my wife and I were totally underwhelmed by our appetizers and dinner. My wife's pasta dish had an odd flavor and was sugary sweet. I've been there twice now and both times been disappointed. Won't be returning. 
21684 3 Nicely done! Kind of homey and very tasty. Yep I like it. 
21685 2 Decent location and friendly staff.. Prices are still significantly higher than Home Depot.. 
21686 4 Excellent food with even better service. Our waitress Kerri was friendly and unbelievably attentive My steak tip sandwich was excellent cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth tender! The pizzas were also great overall 5 stars well earned! 
21687 4 This cafe is so cute! The service here was amazing and their beverages were delicious! 
21688 2 Attentive staff. I got a mojito pitcher for 10$ but it was very very weak. Maybe like 3oz of rum in 32oz. 
21689 0 Monday night. 7 o'clock. Out of ribs. Really? Got a $7.99 brisket sandwich to go. Opened it up at home--slider size. Meat was marginal. Go over to Community Q and get them to show you how it's done. WBB 
21690 4 Hands down the best Greek food I've ever had. The spices were perfect, flavor of everything was amazing and the owners are the nicest people on the planet. I will be back, only two blocks from my office! 
21691 4 Simply phenomenal! Vinny is true professional. He will sit down with you to figure out exactly what issue(s) you are having. He worked out an extremely fair quarterly rate and did a fantastic job fumigating my condo. I HIGHLY recommend On Target Pest Control! 
21692 1 I'm surprised how overly sugary a lot of their donuts are. I prefer Tim Hortons or Voodoo Donuts even though they use a lot of sugar too, at least theirs taste better. 
21693 3 I just went to Sip for the first time yesterday & I was SO PLEASED. Amazing menu, affordable prices (i.e.- buying my daughter a smoothie as well didn't totally break the bank), and my smoothie was delicious! I will definitely be stopping here more often. 
21694 4 I love this small winery, A great place to sit quietly for a good bottle of wine. 
21695 3 Our server Brittany was the best. Made our experience great! We ordered a local batch and hated it. We were ready to leave. When we tried to pay, she brought us several more options that fit our taste. Best server around. Thank you Brittany! 
21696 4 Good low-key breakfast spot, with free Wi-Fi. Owner is bright and cheerful, and the food is delicious. 
21697 4 The front office staff is friendly, the dental hygienist was super nice and did a very thorough cleaning on my teeth, and the dentist was a pleasure to deal with also. I will go here forever and so will the rest of my family. 
21698 2 We went there for lunch today, and ordered a mix ceviche which was delicious, & the fried seafood platter which was not. If you go I would recommend sticking with the ceviche and not the fried foods. The fried seafood was extremely chewy and hard to swallow 
21699 4 This restaurant is the best restaurant that I have been to in the Portland area. The food, drinks, and service were the best I have experienced and I will be a frequent visitor when in town. 
21700 0 I think the Ga. Gov. need to drive north on 400 every day at 5:00 to Cumming Ga. For one month. Lets see how he would enjoy his one hour drive. 
21701 0 We did not like this place. The people are not welcoming and the enthusiasm to receive customer at one's business which prevails in the hospitality business did not exist here. Food was mediocre. I suggest to find another Indian restaurant where you find better services. 
21702 3 They had amazing live bands and it was on a Wednesday! Bartenders are very cool and laid back, drinks aren't too expensive, definitely a good spot. 
21703 4 Best Japanese restaurant in Boston. I have lots of Japanese friends and they all agree. Great prices as well. 
21704 1 service is not good their food not really good restaurant look nice we are the people working there is not a smile 
21705 3 Exciting menu, lots of creative fully loaded pizzas. Healthy, organic ingredients. Knowledgeable and very courteous staff. 
21706 4 This was my first experiencing Ethiopian cuisine and being a vegetarian i was amazed at the options.This place has a cute setup coupled with great food and very quick and good service.complete win win win! 
21707 3 Wasn't given the pedicure options so Amy said "basic" which was just taken off polish, cutting my cuticles and very briefly passing the sponge on the bottom of my feet. 
21708 4 This is my go to starbucks, all day every day! Since it is so close to me! I love the ladies that work here. I love it! My go to holiday drink is the chestnut praline latte ! 
21709 3 Small cute ramen shop Flavorful broth Good value and good quality ingredients. Excellent service. A cheery welcome from the staff awaits the minute you walk in the door. So nice to feel loved! Highly recommend. 
21710 4 Great place for lunch (and probably dinner, too!). We got the prosciutto pizza, olives, and oysters. Amazing quality and service was great. Food came out quickly. The Cab was awesome, too! Atmosphere was rustic yet welcoming. 
21711 4 This is my go-to place for an oil change. The staff are extremely friendly, thorough and speedy. Highly recommend! 
21712 4 Maki is the best! He did my first tattoo and it won't be the last! He is always looking out for his clients best interest. And such amazing work! Bravo 
21713 4 On time arrival? check Polite and pleasant? check Working fast? check (1-2 hours less than their estimate) Quick, efficient, asking questions along the way to clarify what gets packed, moved, placed in the apt etc. Could not have asked for more. 
21714 1 This place has a confusing decor, but the food isn't bad, just more expensive than it seems it should be. 
21715 4 My husband wouldn't have come into this restaurant if he would have known it was vegan. And he never did realize it! 
21716 1 Slowest food truck I've ever even heard of. 40 minute wait?!? Never again. He was offended that we even brought it up. Only go here if you care to wait and wait and wait. And it wasn't even busy. 
21717 4 I have an interview tomorrow. So yall pray fr me.It looks like a beautiful place to wrk. 
21718 2 My first BBQ place. The beef ribs were decent. Price was rather high. Overall good place for no lines and no sold out. 
21719 4 Really good food and very courteous staff. Loved the spicy eggplant dish the most! Reservations are a necessity though, specially if you're in a big group as we were. But still waited for half an hour or so. 
21720 4 I got the best Brazilian here from Mackenzie. She's amazing! Not only did she give an amazing wax, she even took the extra time to tweeze every single ingrown hair I had from a previous not-so-good wax. Would totally recommend! 
21721 3 Judy was great! I had a lot of knots in my back and she applied some major pressure to help loosen me up! 
21722 4 Best Cuban sandwich in Atlanta! Love the atmosphere. 
21723 4 First time I ever tried a macaron after hearing they aren't that good and this place was good AF. I would definitely recommend anyone to go here and eat them. They are pricey but worth it. 
21724 0 Just terrible! The coconut ice cream was tasteless. Way too expensive for a kid's scoop of bland ice cream. The place was empty on a hot evening-for good reason. The star is for the staff. They were friendly and attentive. The shop could use a good cleaning. 
21725 4 Coffee lovers paradise. The coffee is excellent and the space is amazing. They have plenty of food options as well! 
21726 2 Take the OPEN sign down (turn it off) if you aren't taking clients at 8pm "if the clients that you have will take you past 9." 
21727 4 This is a long time favorite. Consistently high quality food and service. Fire and ice cocktail is a winner. Love the sea bass and duck as well. 
21728 3 Excellent lunch buffet! I tried everything. Chicken tikka masala is always my favorite but I also really liked the saag paneer here. My friend says it's the best/most authentic Indian restaurant in North Austin. The service was very friendly too. 
21729 4 I just stopped in Knuckle SAndwich for the first time. I got a brisket sandwich and I'm seriously impressed. The sandwich is amazing. The staff seems pretty nice too, the girl at the counter is friendly and helpful. This is a cool new place. I'll definitely go back. 
21730 3 Great burgers, don't waste time with the more expensive fancy ones. Just get the basic burger with fries. 
21731 4 This place is awesome! It has a great atmosphere and the food is some of the most delicious I've had...EVER. The menu is authentic, the drinks are great, and my server, SAM, was very knowledgable and helpful. Everything about this place is on point. 
21732 3 I really like the beer battered cactus appetizer! Great menu choices, good wait staff, but slightly overpriced. I found the live country music to be obnoxious, but take into consideration that I don't enjoy country music - it would have been more tolerable if it weren't so loud. 
21733 0 Waited 1/2 hour for fast food noodles. The staff seemed to be working as fast as they could. Yet there where not that many customers in front of me. 
21734 2 This is a solid pho place. I had gyoza and satay pho, both are pretty average. I wouldn't go out of my way for this but if you're craving pho in this area, you'll enjoy this place. 
21735 4 The food, ambiance and service were all excellent. I highly recommend the lobster bisque and crab cake bites as starters, they were delicious!! 
21736 2 It's okay. Fast, good, inexpensive. You get what your paying for. I found it good to fill a craving, but won't be making a return trip. There must be better. 
21737 0 Drive right by and go elsewhere. service, food, qualityhas been consistently poor. Menu seems stuck in the 80's. Only reason people go is the location. Easier to stop for dinner, than sit in route 20 traffic, perhaps? 
21738 1 We ordered take out and it took over 30 mins to get it. Food was not as good as we expected. Also could not use Groupon and Hibachi meals were not on take out menu 
21739 4 This Dunkin Donuts is attached to a Sunoco so that gives it a higher level for convenience.. get your gas and coffee fix out of the way in one fell swoop. Seems pretty practical to me. 
21740 4 Comfort food galore! I love that this German restaurant is thriving in the middle of German Village. When we have gone to German restaurants in other towns, they have often seemed dead. I foresee us going back often. 
21741 4 Great interesting dishes which are great to share. Perfect place for a small group dinner with rounds of tapas and drinks. Our service was spot on, and the atmosphere is perfect with the great deck. 
21742 4 Never seen so many different types of plants with such a great variety in a single place. Not too pricey, cute pots and plants, and great service. 
21743 4 LOVE this place. They make everything, from their hamburger buns to their yummy ketchup. Their meat is ground there and is all-natural. Their fries are amazing! They have milkshakes. They have a bar. What else is there??? 
21744 4 Great night out at Marlows on our 2nd try. Amazing food, atmosphere and drink selection! Def worth a visit! Ask for May, she's the best server! 
21745 2 Meh. The food is fine with some potentially great items. However, there are identity and service issues that must be worked out before this place will ever be successful. 
21746 4 Their Vegetarian Combination is awesome. Best Misir Wot in MA. Only downside is the amount of oil used, but what can you do? You can't have it all, I guess. 
21747 4 Best Indian food in Boston. I have been ordering from this place for almost four years and every time it is great. 
21748 4 Best breakfast in town! Always busy on the weekends so get there early. They don't have s hostess desk which is a bit awkward...usually have to track down a waitress to put your name in-worth the wait. 
21749 4 This place was awesome. Nice small wine bar. Excellent recommendations from the staff, great wines, and great food. The place you would rather not tell people about because you want it to your special place. 
21750 4 My favorite bbq in Austin! Maybe Franklin's is better, but you won't have to wait in line for hours here. And it still has the picnic table and paper towel setup of true bbq stops. 
21751 4 Amazing spaghetti and meatballs. Best Italian restaurant in pdx. 
21752 4 Flavorful breakfast at a reasonable price. The wait staff was very friendly and willing to serve. I look forward to returning. 
21753 4 Tucked away near gastown, the best porchetta sandwich! Food - Super! Service - Fast Ambiance - Trendy Worth the money - Yes! 
21754 2 A dive bar in Beacon Hill...but without any deep fried goodness? It was a good place to stop for lunch and food was just ok. 
21755 0 not recommended！I just had a house special ramen and the soup makes me wanna vomit！ The customer service is good！ 
21756 4 Loved the food! The calamari and pork tenderloin was awesome! It was super crowded so glad we went fairly early. The music was a little too loud to have a conversation but the atmosphere was fun! 
21757 4 Alison is wonderful!! We cannot say enough about how impressed we were with her services. She is professional, always very responsive, and just great with our pups. We will be using Dingo Pet Services again very soon. We highly recommend Alison :) 
21758 4 Amazing. Tasty food, good waiter recommendations, good service, fair prices. If you're in JP and craving Indian - come here. Or if you're in Brookline, Cambridge, Somerville...jump on the 39 and get over here. Get the chicken curry. Another recommendation is the duck on the chef's special list. 
21759 4 Hands down (pun intended) the best massage I've had. My husband and I came in for our 4th anniversary and we had Carol and Sherri for a couple's massage. They were the sweetest, most attentive massage therapists ever! 
21760 4 I eat at this wonderful restaurant frequently. The food is always delicious and very fresh. I often try new dishes and I'm never disappointed. The service is great and the atmosphere is also very nice. 
21761 4 Great place for healthy food. Juice and smoothie combinations are delicious and the salads, berry bowls and veggie burgers are soooo good. All the food is made from scratch so don't expect fast food service. It's worth the wait though!! 
21762 4 Friendly staff and a unique selection of smoothies and juices - healthy as well! I enjoyed walking around and looking at candles, incense sticks, blazer pins etc. I haven't seen many juice bars in this neighborhood and was glad to run into Half Fool! 
21763 4 This place has stadium seating inside, a lounge area, and a rooftop seating area. Drinks are great, food is better than decent for a true bar. Come early if you want a to watch a specific game/tv. 
21764 1 Usually a solid place we take the family but tonight- fail. Very slow and nobody seemed to care. 
21765 4 Enjoyed a great lunch with colleagues this afternoon. The service was awesome as well as the food. I will definitely be back. 
21766 3 We recently moved & started using their delivery service. Has been great!!! With two young kids (both under 3), it's just so much easier to have the clothes come to me. Everything comes back clean & ironed perfectly. 
21767 3 We are ALWAYS pleased when we get to Bread and Ink. My children dive on the bacon and cinnamon rolls, I love their black bean and polenta breakfast. Parking can be a challenge in the rain, but it's a great area to shop and explore. 
21768 3 Easy carry out option for Chinese. I have been here several times and never had an issue when carrying out. 
21769 4 awesome!!!! my sns nails are on point. pedicure good, and waxing, of which i haven't done in years as my usual is threading, was good as well!!! pics to come! 
21770 4 Love this place!!! Everything was so good, service, food, atmosphere. I ordered the waffle combo where you can choose 2 of waffles in the menu loved that flexibility because it was so hard to choose only one. 
21771 3 A must do for amazing cinnamon rolls! Great old fashioned breakfast! Super busy & generally packed house. 
21772 4 The coffee here is delicious. Baked goods are amazing - banana bread, biscotti. MUST TRY the Meatball Sandwich - there is cheese inside.... mmm. Friendly owners and cozy atmosphere. Just love this place! 
21773 2 Went there at 9 am Sat morning. This placed was packed. Good -friendly service. Ordered Sweet potato pancake (photo uploaded) was not impressed. Nothing "sweet potato" about it. Pretty disappointed. My husband ordered buffalo chicken omelette -very good and big portion. 
21774 3 Didn't love the dumplings, but fish and eggplant was great. Fast, quick and friendly service. No wait on Saturday at 5pm, but the place was pretty full with young kids. Staff was incredibly accommodating and kind to our 8 month old. Great place to come with babies and kids! 
21775 4 Best burger I've ever had. The staff was super friendly and made the long line enjoyable. The shakes are killer and the green chile fries are awesome. Hopdoddy is legendary friend 
21776 2 Where's the beef? If you like vegan then this place is for you. But unfortunately I like meat so they are not going to get a higher review than say from someone who is into fake looking shrimp. 
21777 2 Best ma po tofu in Boston, but home style bean curd is too salty and t dòu sī (spicy potato dish) is not very good. Service could be better and good luck getting across the concept of veganism. 
21778 2 I like it ! It has booze. It has a pleasantly lit interior. It has enough cashiers to make sure the line up doesn't last for days. I'm easy to please :) 
21779 3 Good stuff. The carne asada taco was really good - not too greasy, stuffed with toppings, and wrapped by a soft flour tortilla. The chips & salsa were great too. Look forward to coming back whenever I'm in the mood for a cheap meal. 
21780 4 The food is delicious and fresh. The hummus and tahini sauce are fantastic, and the falafel is made to order. Can't wait to try their shawarma plate! 
21781 3 Depends on what you get, but I have yet to find a tofu saag as good as Bukhara's. Prices are a little steep for me, but it's the only place I get take-out in JP. 
21782 3 Wonderful Japanese take out for lunch. Always a lineup, but it goes by pretty fast. The food reminds me of the japanese train station cuisine. Fast, fresh and tasty. Great for the always on the go person. 
21783 4 Hands down the best Moussaka I've ever had! Staff is friendly, ambiance is perfect, and the deserts are delicious! The lamb kabob is simply amazing, as well, tender, marinated lamb with no gaminess whatsoever. If you've never had great Greek, this is the place to go! 
21784 4 I got so lucky finding this gem for my first wax. Alisha was kind, funny, and really easy to relax around. I was concerned about the pain, but she was up front and comforting. This is 100% my person for anything I need waxed. 
21785 1 Not impressed. We stopped in for a quick drink on Saturday night, and found the bar too crowded and pretentious. Plus the well drinks were way too $$. The service was good, but I can't imagine going back. 
21786 0 The worst ever. I normally use Enterprise and there's a reason why. This place is a scam and scummy. Hidden fees, long lines and frankly atrocious. Don't go there, seriously don't use them. 
21787 4 Bomb carnitas tacos! Tex-Mex for the win! Super cool staff too. -SSM Sergio Flores 
21788 3 The tuna burger is the truth and the light. Sushi-Grade Tuna, sprouts, teriyaki, honey wasabi, nori chips, pickled ginger, and mayo on their homemade buns. On the way home from lunch I was on the phone with the wife talking about how I wanted to come back soon. 
21789 2 Not great service but can't ask for too much with such cheap deals. Tuesday's are 55 cent traditional wings. Happy hour begins at 9. 
21790 2 Nice, clean, and swanky. No real dance floor to speak of, though. And the music is.. yeah. I'll leave it at that. 
21791 2 This place has gotten to be less of a value and food is disappointing if you do not indulge in the desserts. Especially, cabbage, greens and green beans were fairly bland in taste. 
21792 4 The Broken Yolk has the same old lady there every time. The food is really good and pretty cheap. 
21793 4 Stellar customer service and super friendly doctors on staff. Great for contacts or eyeglasses. Highly recommended! 
21794 0 The resturaunt is a wannabe Indian food joint. If you know anything about Indian food is, this isn't the place for you. Good ambiance and a fancy name for the place!! 
21795 3 This was a good breakfast with big portions. Nothing fancy. All tasted good. It was very busy, but we were seated right away when we arrived. My son was talked to directly and I really appreciated the server did that. All around a good experience. 
21796 4 They did an amazing job grooming our 9 month old Wheaten terrier. Very friendly, very professional & we will be returning here for many years to come. 
21797 4 One of my favorite places to go to get a frozen treat. Always friendly and always have a great selection of flavors to try. 
21798 4 As a true multigenerational Texan from the west part, I approve. Nothing snooty, Reo's cooking is just the way it's supposed to be. Atmosphere is close and friendly. Love this place! Thanks for bringing the south to the coast, Reo 
21799 4 We just went for their Monday night special of $5.00 Cheese burger and fries and it was delicious. We really enjoyed and will definitely be going again!!! 
21800 4 Great selections of all types of alcohol. Beer, wine, whiskey. Wonderful place to shop. Helpful and kind staff. 
21801 4 Wow is all I can say. I haven't had a donut for years and decided to splurge while in Portland- so worth it. Try something different, you will be glad you did. Loved the maple bacon and the blueberry bourbon. 
21802 4 Tacos are delicious, huge, cheap, and totally worth it! Parking can be a bit of a hot mess though. 
21803 4 Delicious food! Amazing service! Great fancy place but we brought our 2 year old and 2mo old and they still treated us wonderfully!!! Exceptional! 
21804 2 Small portions for a big price. When we got home with our takeout order the family laughed at how little food there was for nearly $70. Food tasted good, but poor value in portion sizes. 
21805 4 If you are in Orlando, this sushi place is a must. Huge variety of rolls, so creative and all delicious! 
21806 4 I am just waiting to go back. I have been waiting to see the level of jam-session and artistic level I witnessed in this place since... 35 years!! 
21807 4 I am reviewing on basis of Sunday Brunch at Taj. Sunday Brunch at Taj is Very good. They have everything that you want. 
21808 3 Here for work. Nice selection of sushi! Staff friendly. Tempura was a little bit over fried. 
21809 4 The BEST chicken and rice soup I have ever had. Also, one of the daily special sandwiches had crushed up potato chips. Amazing. 
21810 4 omg-the BEST fried chicken I have ever had! Super crunchy, flavorful and simply moist on the inside! I devoured 3 pieces in less than 4 minutes. Their collard greens and Mac and cheese were delicious too! 
21811 3 The owners are really sweet. When I came during winter, they relocated the heater fan next to my table :) 
21812 4 Execellent and great location Would recommend you make a reservation ! Fabulous food 
21813 4 One thing i can appreciate is that there donuts are always fresh... Sometimes if u eva been into a 24/7 dunkins there donuts are stale... Not here always fresh...! 
21814 1 This place was a nightmare on my last visit. It was so crowded that it was very hard to even get in the parking lot. Hard to navigate the isles and check out. I would avoid this place unless you can get here in off peak hours. 
21815 4 Super good food. Fresh and well seasoned. Place was not crowded on Friday night so order came out fast and delicious. Definitely coming back 
21816 4 Best beer selection in town and knowledgeable, cool staff. I'll be back every time I visit Austin in the future. The wine selection is small but well-curated and interesting. We only ate pretzels, but they were awesome. 
21817 3 Outra grande experiência tomar o sorvete do Mickey, bem como a "pia" de sorvete com vários sabores a sua escolha! 
21818 4 They have a huge collection of Japanese whisky! Their sushi is one of the best sushi I've tried in Boston. They oyster spoon is amazing! Must try! 
21819 4 Great beer! It's kinda out of the way but worth a visit. Food is decent as well. Feel free to bring the puppies to the dog park. Can't wait for the summer when the patio opens up 
21820 4 One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in PDX! Love the chicken salad and the mushroom quesadilla with goat cheese is AMAZING! One thing... beware of the chips and salsa!!! It's so good that I fill up on it before my meal arrives. Don't miss happy hour! Great deals. 
21821 3 I had a great sausage breakfast sandwich and latte here! I loved that they fried the egg fresh rather than using scrambled eggs and the sausage seemed homemade. Small place, packed with tourists heading to the Old North Church 
21822 4 Great cupcakes! I tried several flavors (the carrot had a bit too much cinnamon for me, but most people like that), and on a whole I found them to be comparable w Sweet, which heretofore has been my cupcake standard in Orlando. 
21823 3 Great food and amazing drinks! Totally check this place out! The service is a little slow, but probably just because they are busy. As long as you know that going in (don't come starving :-) the cocktails are fantastic, a little pricy, but worth it for such amazing food/drink. 
21824 3 I LOVED their New England Clam Chowder! I also got a veggie burger which was good. The atmosphere is great ( I went for lunch on a weekend). The decor is perfectly historic. 
21825 4 There's a reason why people have been coming here for 20+ years. I'm glad my parents took me here, so I knew. Just go and see for yourself. It's just good. Good prices and good food. Never a disappointment. 
21826 4 Amazing food!! The sangria is absolutely the best!! Phenomenal service!!! Highly recommend!! 
21827 4 Great produce selecton, low prices. Plenty of parking amd friendly staff. Snack and cleaning products good prices as well 
21828 4 Great cajun place near Austin, nice fresh seafood, extremely friendly service and overall good value to boot. 
21829 2 I don't golf, but I do enjoy driving carts and drinking. Airport Golf Course allowed me to do both. I paid $4 per 25 oz can of Foster's and was awarded a free koozie with each. Win! 
21830 4 There Health Score is 96. The app What he Health needs to be updated!! The restaurant was clean and very quiet, which was very appreciated. The cashier was nice and friendly. He Strawberry Poppyseed salad was cold, fresh and delicious. My first time here but I will return. 
21831 4 I'm vegetarian and I love good beers, so this is the place for me! I have tried a lot of options there and Ioved all of them! 
21832 4 We have stayed here every June for 33 years. It's our home away from home. It's well kept and very clean. Staff is always polite and efficient. Check in is always quick. Can't beat the location. Highly recommend!! 
21833 0 This bank has stolen more from me in terms of fees than I could possibly imagine. Don't go WF, they will rob you 
21834 4 Saus was awesome-saus!!! Definitely some unique options. We both got the Sloppy Jacques! Delicious! I got regular fries but we also ordered the poutine & that was delicious as well! Super small place but super great!! 
21835 4 Friday night tasting menu + splitting a bottle with a buddy = awesome 
21836 4 Late and a chocolate chips cookie. It was wonderful. Grab a coffee and go to chill in Boston Common! 
21837 4 Best place in Vancouver for home style greasy spoon breakfast food. Diner has a great vibe and is a repurposed house. Always have excellent service. 
21838 3 Pork carnitas tacos - great rich flavour, moist meat and big enough to keep you satisfied. Queso and ground beef dip - quite rich but very tasty. Plenty big enough to share as an appetiser. 
21839 3 Ordered the chicken mole and it was seriously the best tasting mole in town! The fish taco was good also You can order online now to skip the line ups though they are very speedy here with your orders. 
21840 4 Omg! Did the trial free class for kickboxing! Walter was our instructor and I seriously felt motivated and pushed to work hard the entire hour! I left feeling exhilarated and excited! I am definitely going to pursue a membership with X3! Goodbye LA fitness! It's time for some REAL results! 
21841 3 A great place for our family where everyone can find something they like on the menu. Service is a little slow depending on the night but food is great!!! 
21842 4 Great support. They are certified NEST installers, so they came out and diagnosed my NEST issues in addition to pointing out other obvious problems with my HVAC. They were even able to show up late at night when I was home from work. Would highly recommend to others. 
21843 4 I love Wally park. This is the only place I park at when catching a flight. They run a tight ship. Has always been a pleasant experience. Quick and efficient. 
21844 0 Its a sad day when I have to resort to eating at this place. Like my mom just died = crap I have to eat this soggy bland sub sad. No-Go 
21845 4 New location. Very friendly staff, great service, fast inspection. They made sure I had a cold bottle of water while I waited, and did a perfect job. 
21846 0 Made an appointment to avoid the wait. Sat 20 minutes with no indication they would get to me soon. I asked how long it might be. Again no response. I'll never come back. This is a mill. 
21847 4 Nice food and nice setting! We came at the grand opening so it's a bit crowded here, but nothing much. The menu is huge and it's hard to choose from different items. Overall, it was great! 
21848 1 I've had better service at waffle house. Overpriced, mediocre food and as a sushi fan I was overall underwhelmed. 
21849 1 Food is ok. A bit overrated and over priced. Cactus seems to be better atmosphere. Portion is small. Waitress was only attentive near the end when the bill was ready. Will not go back. 
21850 3 Service was great. Antipasto board was great as well as the misto. My boss had the flounder which he liked. I loved the baccala. We split the pappadelle, duck and mushroom. I wish I lived close to one... 
21851 4 Delicious breakfast , very good Latin twist to it, highly recommend this place. I would come back here repeatedly! 
21852 4 Incredible seafood pesto! Amazing Caesar salad and tiramisu. I don't understand the low ratings -this place does not disappoint in any way. 
21853 3 Fun place. I met a customer here and found it a great place for a impromptu business discussion. Old building that is really cool ambiance. Pies looked amazing, I'll have to return to give them a try. Staff is friendly. 
21854 3 I liked the service at this subway location. Jenny was efficient and quick to get my order completed even though it was in the midst of the lunch rush It is one of the smallest subways I have seen so not much seating but good service Recomm 
21855 3 Since this place is new, it has that "new" smell to it when you walk in. The lights are nice and bright. Tables and floors are gleaming. Servers are super excited that you're one of their first customers. No complaints here...yet. 
21856 3 I really wish we had a Sprouts in Chicago because I really got to like this place when I was last in Boulder. I guess It's a chain but it doesn't have that corporate feel. 
21857 4 蠻特別的地方 結合BAR和保齡球 氣氛非常好 就算沒有要打 也可以玩得很開心 有酒喝 也有許多螢幕轉播各種比賽 值得推薦 
21858 2 The hotel seemed fine when we checked in... But when we got back from Epcot there were bugs in the room. The employees fixed it all but still bad experience overall. 
21859 3 My favorite Mexican food spot in Austin. Service is hit or miss. Food is almost always great though. 
21860 3 Cool place, pricey as hell. Sorry to the other gym patrons for screaming/grunting during squats. I usually try to go early in the AM, so I can't distract anyone. I will wear a muzzle next time...woof woof. 
21861 4 The food and service was Awesome. The truffled Sea Bass was wonderful. Highly recommend! 
21862 4 Incredible massage! The facility is beautiful and extremely relaxing. I did the fusion with Ashiatsu and Swedish and couldn't be more pleased with Samantha. The front desk is warm and welcoming with tea and water and essential oil options. I highly recommend! 
21863 0 This is a Drug purchasing spot, and A Gang hangout location. This place need to be Closed Down! Even the employees are selling drugs out of this location. But I will give them one star for the good sweet tea. 
21864 0 Was literally the worst tasting food I've paid for. I ordered noodles with shrimp. The boxed stuff at the dollar store has better quality. 
21865 1 The woman working there was unfriendly and strange. We had to practically force her to acknowledge us, then to explain things. It's also expensive, and it was meh fun. 
21866 3 we see Dr Elliott. he's great! only negative was the wait the first couple of visits. other than that i love this office 
21867 4 ABC has a broad selection of Bourbon including a very good price on Makers Mark. Friendly staff that bends over backwards to help. 
21868 1 This aquarium was pretty mediocre. There is not much to see. However, the Baluga whales are cool! 
21869 4 Very professional and does amazing work! Highly recommend, have used many times and always down a great job. 
21870 2 It's also a convenience store and they don't participate in certain promos.. like the T-Mobile Tuesday gifts 
21871 3 I needed my Lasagna fix and left a very happy (and full) customer. I stopped in on a Wednesday at 5 and was seated with no waiting. Food was great and price similarly to restaurants in the area. 
21872 4 Best authentic belgian waffles! I also shared some fries with friends and the truffle ketchup was AMAZING. 
21873 4 We have an amazing experience every time! This is one of the few restaurants where the service is as good as their outstanding menu. I love their shishito peppers and their chicken sandwich and veggie burger are lunch staples. One of my new favorites! 
21874 3 Really good! I would definitely eat here again. Brussel Sprouts were SO good! Mass Pike pizza was amazing! Staff was very friendly. Good find. Wish I lived closer! 
21875 4 Great plumber he saves you money and comes by in a pinch. Re piped my whole house. Highly recommend. 
21876 4 It really is as good as a donut gets. Had a lemon cream filled donut and would love the recipe for the delicious filling that was obviously made with fresh squeezed lemon juice and top notch ingredients. 
21877 3 Food was ok but the service was fantastic. Kelli and Austin, both bartenders are amazing!!!!!!!! Very 5 star when it comes to genuine care for their guest. They both symbolizes what RC is trying to project. Well done! Well deserve! 
21878 3 Fried green tomatoes!! I haven't had these done well before and this place has a great sauce to eat them with. The fish basket is pretty good here as well. It filled me up and wasn't super bad in price. 
21879 3 This restaurant is very quaint; if you do not have a reservation don't even bother. I throughly enjoyed my experience tho' ; Ordered a the CRU Porno Drink it was amazing it was great for the price. I would come back again for the atmosphere and drinks. 
21880 4 Best acrylic and gel in Columbus!! I've been to a couple of other places and none compare to central. My nails look beautiful and my gel lasts at least 3 weeks. There is generally not a wait and the techs are very friendly. Tips are cash only. 
21881 4 You people are incredible! Loved your food and our service person was exceptional! 
21882 0 Visisted here from California on a family vacation.... first and last time ill come here food was not even good and no aguas frescas .... 
21883 4 I went to the salon today and Im so excited about new hair. Hugh did the great job on my hair and my hair color is incredible. Will come back again ! 
21884 4 This place is easily one of the top five best restaurants in Portland..... the sushi is some of the best in the city, and the wild mushroom congee is truly incredible 
21885 4 Very romantic! Came with my boyfriend for a late night dinner Friday evening. Ambiance is cozy and dark. If you order a bunch of apps and you'll do just fine (and save major bucks!) terrific fondue with beef and insanely good cavatelli pasta. 
21886 3 Great location, conveniently located near public transportation which is minutes away from PDX. A short walk to restaurants and shopping. Complimentary breakfast is good with warm and cold food selections. 
21887 4 My wife and I come here fairly regularly. Birthdays, anniversaries, or random nights on the town. We love everything about it. The wine list is complete. All of the food is fresh and delicious. Service is always impeccable. 
21888 2 I have used this company in the past twice. They are very competent and nice, but I have to say they are overpriced as far as extra fees and freon cost compared to other companies I checked with after using them. 
21889 2 Stopped by for an appetizer and happened to be there during happy hour. Good Rose' champagne and the mussels were perfect. Had pulled pork tacos good meal and they recommended crostini which turned out to be more bread then topping. Chill place and service was good. 
21890 0 they will sabotage your vehicle so, u can return for service. stay away from this dealer no stars 
21891 4 Excellent Mexican Restaurant!!! The food is authentic and fresh... They have an extensive variety from typical enchiladas to steaks and seafood... They also have amazing micheladas and fresh flavored waters! The place is super clean and the service was perfect!!! Will definitely come back :) 
21892 4 Great experience! Haven't been here in a while, but I will definitely visit more often. Food was on point and the customer service was surprisingly amazing for a very busy Friday night. Shout out to the hostess Dominque and the manager Torica. 
21893 4 Went for a weekday lunch and was very impressed. Food was outstanding, portion sizes were perfect, and the service was quick. Couldn't have been better. 
21894 4 Found this place on yelp looking for some good soul food and the reviews didn't lie! The food was delicious!! I had the fried chicken with cream corn and Mac and cheese. If you're in the Atlanta area definitely a must!! 
21895 3 Definitely recommend the tortilla chicken soup...and the cucumber margarita. I would definitely come back for the nachos appetizers and drinks. 
21896 2 a fancy dine in restaurant inside an airport terminal. food selection is good, Bias as I really like Japanese food. my coworkers were a little disappointed with the food taste though, they said I 'hyped' it too much. oh well, they are correct. 
21897 4 I went there last weekend with my classmates.The location was convenient,at 88 food connection.Salmon sashimi is my favorit ,amazing and fresh,and everything else was delicious.The service was incredibly fast and good.We will be back for sure. 
21898 4 Not that this brilliant restaurant needs another endorsement but... The food here is so good. It's really more of an experience rather than just dining out. The dishes are inventive but familiar. Top restaurant in Vancouver easily. 
21899 4 You can't get a much better burger around here than the Big Kahuna burger. The owners are very friendly. Not only is the food delicious but it is also inexpensive which adds to the overall value. 
21900 0 Traumatizing experience putting down my dog here. Do not recommend for this type of service, it was rushed, awkward, and awful. 
21901 2 i used to love this place, the first time i ate there was about 7 years ago and i loved it, but i just keep going back hoping it will be as good as the first time but it never is!!! 
21902 4 Great burger, just the way I ordered!! I had the Sicilian Burger, minus the arugula! Service was good. The bartender was my waiter. I would highly recommend this place. Tracy, the manager, came by to see howI liked my food. He is very personable!!! We certainly will return. 
21903 4 Great service. Guacamole is amazing. Great portion sizes, huge menu with good portions. Would absolutely go back. 
21904 4 Amazing! Original, innovative, and a must activity for fun loving portlanders! 
21905 4 Every time I'm in the area, the bipartisan cafe is a must! Their coffee is good, there food is very good but their atmosphere is so phenomenal! It's a true Portland coffee shop. If you're in the area and missed your coffee that morning, this place is a must! 
21906 1 I hope what I had a dish today is mistake just for today. I ordered sandwich and omulet and kids meal. Omulet and kids meal taste like refrigerator... 
21907 4 Just the kind of bookstore I like. Variety of books, well located, cool. Smart people to give you advice. I loved my visit there, too bad I couldn't stay longer. 
21908 4 By the time we got to the bakery, a lot of items were gone. I got cream cheesecake, deluxe strawberry cake, berry tale, hokkaido cheese tart, taro Danish. Everything is delicious and fresh. Customer service is exceptional. Prices are good. Well worth the drive here. Very unique bakery. 
21909 3 went there one day after work. the food was ok. but i gotta say they had possibly the best damn pecan pie i ever had 
21910 4 If you haven't tried the Mexican Meatball, you are missing out in life. Hands down, one of the best pieces of culinary art I've ever experienced. Do yourself a favor and drop whatever you're doing to indulge yourself with this godly sandwich. 
21911 3 This place by far has the best breakfast sandwich! The shop location is sketchy,I'm not gonna lie...but the sandwich is so worth coming here...the only thing that sux is it closes early sometimes even @ 2pm. But definitely a got to spot if you're craving a breakfast sandwich :) 
21912 3 Food was great! Service was fast and very friendly! Restaurant was very clean. 
21913 4 Great authentic German food and even better service. We would definitely go back again soon! Yummy Famous Dill Soup 
21914 3 Great service. Probably one of the best UPS stores I have been to. The woman working even taped up my box for me. I have actually been charged $.50 at other locations. Fast and friemly. This is my go to UPS store. 
21915 3 I don't know why they want to tear it down... ITs great for football games... If you take marta you'll cut your time in half... 
21916 3 This place had a really cute, casual atmosphere and I went here after a hike. The cashier was extremely kind and the food itself was simple but filling and tasty. It's a bit far from downtown, but if I'm ever in the area then I would definitely visit again. 
21917 4 Delicious food, good staff, and great selection! We were looking for something new to try, having been all over Longmont and most of Boulder....Niwot Tavern was a great find! We'll be back. 
21918 4 Great restaurant! Even better food. The steak was delicious and extremely savory. There is no other place I would have wanted to spend Father's Day at. The service was exceptional. On top of everything being great, I received a complimentary slice of cake for celebrating Father's Day there. 
21919 0 Awful!!! Always out of something, terrible customer service and poor attitudes by staff. Something is always broken or they just don't have it. Worst store I have ever been to. I will stop wasting my time going here. I sure hope someone turns this place around. 
21920 3 Great local drinking hole/eatery the dining room isn't massive but the food is good. My recommendation is the fish and chips. The fish is lightly breaded and delicious. The service is great and the staff is very friendly. 
21921 2 Whoever installed the changing table in the women's restroom must have been 6'4". It's not even safe for the baby because I have no leverage to keep him from squirming. #fail 
21922 3 Oh, Shawarma King, we had an intense affair for almost three months, where I had you two to three times a week, and you were damn good. Then I got bored with you and moved on. The end. 
21923 4 Dr Park is excellent. The office is beautiful and the staff is so nice! I've only been in treatment for a limited amount of time and I'm already seeing results. Definitely glad I chose this office to do my orthodontic work. 
21924 3 Nice atmosphere and staff. Fish tacos were second to none. If the wether is nice, it's a great place to chill on the wharf. 
21925 4 This coffee shop is very pleasant with great atmosphere. Be sure to get there early if you're planning on sitting because it get crowded with professionals and college students. 
21926 3 This place has really good chicken. I've had several of their sandwiches, but what I go for most of the time are the tenders. Really good Nashville style hot chicken. Get it spicy or XXX with their jalapeño / habanero sauce they finish off the chicken with. Awesome!! 
21927 4 Excellent service. They are truely a family run business for over 30years. They were featured in Boston's own Phoenix as offering honest service and were ranked #1 out of numerous other shops 
21928 4 One of the only places in town that makes a great hamburger, from scratch. Awesome chef. Great service. Great bar atmosphere. Got to check it out! 
21929 4 Huge fan. The sandwiches are amazing, and the frites are fantastic. The samurai sauce on the fries was awesome; just the right amount of spice. Also, talked with the folks working there, and it sounds like they're getting a liquor license shortly. I'll be back a lot. 
21930 3 One of the best sub shops downtown. The italian combos are great. 
21931 4 Love this place. The shrimp and grits are yummy. The eggs Benedict was perfect with a crunchy English muffin and only slightly overdone egg, but still.very nice. The Hollandaise is good. However the ham was so salty it dominated every other flavor. Good coffee, good service. 
21932 4 I have visited this pub twice and both times had a great time! I haven't had the food yet, but the staff and atmosphere have been awesome! Really fun and engaging everything an Irish pub should be. 
21933 4 As a beginner when it comes to tea and tea blends they were really helpful to a newbie like me. The variety of teas had my head spinning. The teas are somewhat pricey though depending on what you get. 
21934 4 If you are looking for authentic pan Asian cuisine, come here! The staff and bartenders are super friendly. The sushi is really good, pho is good, but they need to put the Thai iced tea back on the menu! Also Tues, and Thur it's half off sushi and sake. 
21935 3 A very cool bar with a Rockabilly feel. Make sure to dress in all black because you almost feel like Johnny Cash when you walk in the place. It in an up and coming area of town and is a great place to drink a few cool ones! 
21936 0 I ordered pizza that was supposed to be delivered at 1:20. I didn't get it until 1:50 and I got no explanation ir warning that it would be late. Everyone in my office didn't get food on their lunch break because of it. 
21937 4 Great food and awesome service. Definitely a place to go for happy hour. A good place to meet friends not loud where you can't carrying on a conversation. Will come back again. 
21938 0 WORST DUNKINS EVER!!! Always get my order wrong, rip me off, and give me cold raw sandwiches. The people are nice but do your job right!! I've given them several chances and they always mess up!! They don't answer the phone either... So unprofessional they should be shut down. 
21939 3 I come for their toro sashimi or toro nigiri. It melts. Somehow they have really good toro. The rest is also good as other sushi places. But the toro is really something else! Totally recommend this place for the toro! 
21940 3 This is one of my new favorite lunch spots when I need to meet with someone. I had the Ahi Tuna the first time which was great and then a lunch special with swordfish. Service was great, prices reasonable, and overall a nice restaurant. 
21941 3 Loved taking my dogs here. Often the park would be really muddy. Need some sort of enforcement of rules in regards to picking up poo and leaving with your aggressive dog. A dog wash is a must add!!! A fun time for the whole family. 
21942 2 The food was good and the service was OK. But the owner has a temper and pretty much alienated our group. Which was odd, since the restaurant was pretty empty for the whole time we were there on a Saturday evening. I wonder why it was so empty?... 
21943 4 Update: I've had a few more appointments. The verdict is in: Shadrick is an awesome chiropractor. What I marvel at is how I got so lucky; the best chiropractor and the best dentist have their offices next to each other in Davis Square. 
21944 4 This is a great museum not only for Mariner history and China trade but also to see the incredible paintings and antiques Great location in downtown Salem and a great place for children to visit 
21945 4 Perfect Italian neighborhood restaurant and good selection and expansive wine list as well ... won't break the bank either for good food !! 
21946 4 One of my favorites from when we lived in Texas. Never disappoints! Best chips and the creamy jalapeño sauce is a must. Feels like a little bit of home in Ohio!! 
21947 0 Lame - don't bother their people aren't engaged -the service is poor the facilities are not clean - they all wear black - its' depressing. 
21948 4 Love this Hotel will come back again with my Family it's like a little apartment fully furnished it's a great place home away from home going to book again for Thanksgiving maybe Christmas and New Years 
21949 4 What a wonderful team at Dr Sherrard's dental office! From the greeting to the wave goodbye I felt very comfortable and welcome. Dr Sherrard is an amazing dentist very talented, caring and gentle. 
21950 0 Wish I could give them NO stars! Sucks ass! Charge my credit card twice and told me to take it up with my bank! 
21951 3 Really wasn't planning on doing this but it wasn't bad. Number one complaint was the engine noise was so loud it was hard to hear the tour guides. Staff was friendly. 
21952 1 Don't get b fast after 11 home fries have been sitting and where dry and burnt. The waitress however was understandable and gave a discount on the meal. 
21953 1 Old facility with unengaging staff. Locker rooms are smelly and relatively dirty. Equipment is becoming dated. I'll not renew unless there are improvements. 
21954 4 Love this place. Michelle is a wizard who giggles maniacally as she snaps all your vertebrae into place. I've gotten messages with both Jessica and John. They're both fabulous. Try the hot stones add on. -Anissa 
21955 3 Onsite at airport. Easy pick up. Easy drop off. Great rate through Hotwire. So much easier than shuttling offsite. I'll use them again. 
21956 4 I've literally eaten my way through Texas on BBQ. This place is one of the best....get there early! It goes fast! Great sides and I loved the Brisket and Turkey! -Aaron 
21957 3 Finally, a decent sports bar in Boston. Plenty of TVs and much better food then I expected. A step up from the burgers and sausages of the area. If you are going on a game day - go early! 
21958 4 Authentic Venezuelan food! Legit. The Tequenos, cachapa, cachito, and empanadas are outstanding. Everything is homemade, and staff truly cares about the customers. I also love the cubano sandwich. So good!!!! 
21959 4 This was one of the best dinners we're have ever had. Our server, Shane, was fantastic! The food was perfect and even our picky eater cleaned her plate. We will definitely be returning and highly recommend. 
21960 3 One of my favorite Korean places in Vancouver located on Robson (Denman area). One of my favorite dishes has to be the black bean Ramen. 
21961 4 Hands down best maragitas I've ever had. The food is excellent every time! Always packed and they dont take reservations so get there early. 
21962 4 This is such a gem right in the middle of Austin!!! Vintage bar stools at a bar with malts and burgers makes you feel like you are back in the 50's. I had the pimiento cheese with chips and it was delicious! Fun experience for kids 
21963 4 Since this review, we've gone back to this place several times and it's turned into a neighborhood favorite. I can honestly say that the first time was a fluke, and it's usually great service and food. Keep it up Shigezo! 
21964 4 Went to Portland for 4 days this summer just to walk the city and eat. Went to some street vendors and some expensive restaurants, but this place was by far my favorite meal of the trip. 
21965 4 Whhhhat? I forgot to review this place? I went about 2 months ago and it was so good. We got 2 types of 'omakases' and it was awesome. It's been too long for me to remember. But I'm going to go back and will update my review 
21966 4 I'm so impressed with the customer service here! Easily the BEST AND QUICKEST Brazilian! I cannot wait to come back :) 
21967 2 Solid dependable inexpensive food and great for a quick breakfast and lunch. I had the chicken salad sandwich (takeout) and the breakfast burrito. Both were satisfying. The waitstaff was friendly and courteous. I would recommend this place. 
21968 0 One star is enough. All entries (10) are terrible. Recommended by our friends, we have high expectations.. The dishes are disappointing, many of them are too salty, while the rest are too sour. 
21969 4 Great breakfast spot. Friendly, fast service and amazing food. The pancakes are huge, fluffy and fantastic and the western sandwich was delicious. We will definitely be back! 
21970 1 Great if you're super drunk and super duper hungry. Not recommended for sober people. I got a Margherita pizza and although the diced (yes, in large cubes) tomatoes was cold + it didn't have basil, the dough was surprisingly soft and tasteful. Last resort type of eatery. 
21971 1 Almond chicken was very bland and wasn't expecting the same kind of chicken as the sweet and sour, piece of plastic in chicken fried rice, steamed dumplings were soggy and falling apart, but the egg drop was good? 
21972 2 So, so. Nothing special. Overpriced and overcooked seafood, but friendly servers, nice view, fun crowd. Not cepprtain that the latter overcomes the former. 
21973 1 How do you run out of fajitas??? There is a Giant Eagle right next door. This location used to be great, but it's really going downhill. I walked out without ordering. 
21974 4 Santarpio's has no competition. God help me, this is the best cheese on a pizza I have ever tasted. I remember reading that it's a blend of three types of mozzarella. No contest. 
21975 2 Good service, good food. Found a food wrapper in my Togo box so quite displeased overall. 
21976 3 This place is great. We have been here so many times and have received not only great comfort food but great service as well. The kids love the little country store full of classic candy and trinkets. We love it! 
21977 4 Nice Austin-funky feel to this coffeehouse. Love the burgers! The Bahn Mi is pretty good too. Very friendly and quick service. 
21978 4 Received a box of assorted chocolates for Christmas. Absolutely delicious, especially the coconut items and the truffles. Ordering again for myself. 
21979 2 Great coffee and treats in store. So we decided to order a celebration cake from them but sadly it wasn't quite up to the standards of the treats in store! The cake was nicely presented but really dry! 
21980 3 Both times I went were awesome. I love the cool hip ambience. Super casual, but great food and cocktails. The tuna caper sandwich and burrito were worthy of ordering again. Loved our servers. 
21981 4 My wife found this place and it is a hidden gem! It's clean and the service is amazing. Highly recommend this place. 
21982 4 Yum! I had a great experience here and found my soft serve to be fantastic in its flavor, texture, and creamy goodness. I ended up selecting a salted caramel and chocolate flavor topped with marshmallow sauce and waffle cone pieces. The logo for this place is super cute too! 
21983 1 Love the beer, servers are super. Just remember, buyer beware and check your tab or I guarantee that $7 beer will show up as $8 on your bill! 
21984 3 yum love their homemade bread and the sandwiches are so so good. try it! 
21985 4 What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. One of my favorite lunch spots. Hot dogs are awesome. Burgers are good here too. Nuff said. 
21986 0 Motel is lipstick on a pig. Old outdated rooms and facility. Wouldn't have bothered writing a review except the maids took/stole over $200 worth of vitamins and supplements Do not stay here! Oh and the tv didn't work. Holiday inn please feel free to reach out to me 
21987 4 Friendly service and great coffee. Free WIFI. They usually have a pastry or two and a few truffles, or you can get brunch from Explorers Club that runs the kitchen in Zauber's. Very nice atmosphere. 
21988 0 We gave their pizza 2 tries as we are looking for something better than what's around West Linn, I'm not sure how they get their high reviews, it's the WORST pizza we have ever eaten. 
21989 3 We chose Taishoken based on its proximity to our condo while visiting Vancouver. We both really enjoyed our Ramen. The flavor was great. It was our first Ramen experience and we were not disappointed. Good food at a great price. 
21990 3 Salads are the best deal in town. 7 toppings + 3 proteins + many types of dressing + 2 pieces of warm bread = $8.00 FREE Bread to snack on while you wait. 
21991 1 Went in today for lunch. Ordered fatuous salad and they gave me house salad. Very disappointing Pita was good. I should have gone around the corner to Byblos. I had salad there last week. That restaurant is much nicer, cleaner and the salad spot on. 
21992 0 I just had the worst burrito ever....the rice wasn't cooked, the veggies were ice cold and it was all soggy. I remember when Moe's had good burritos. ...not sure what happened? ! 
21993 4 Excellent burgers and sweet potato fries, plus the service is incredible! If you're feeling extra hungry I recommend their double patty burger. Opt for the bacon, swiss cheese, chipotle mayo, mustard, jalapeños and the grilled mushrooms. Make sure to try the chipotle mayo when there, its amazing. 
21994 4 Definitely coming back to this place, next time I'm in Orlando. Great service. Food tasted fresh. The croquetas are fantastic. 
21995 0 Just moved from Chicago hoping to find a good "neighborhood" bar. Went to this place and decided my house is a better place to drink. 
21996 3 This is probably my favorite Cuban place to eat in my area o Altamonte Springs. I had the roasted pork with congri rice and for the sides I had tostones and a side of salad. Great prices and the best part is that they serve breakfast all day long. 
21997 2 BUSY BUSY BUSY!!!! It is always jam packed at this climbing spot. There are great climbs, various difference setters, top ropes, slack lines, bouldering and lead climbing as well. You want it they have it! 
21998 0 Dysentery! I had to make an emergency stop on the way home! Make that two emergency stops! Third stop for pepto! Thanks! 
21999 2 This is attached to the Sheraton in Maitland Service was slow getting started but now is moving along ok. 
22000 4 Neat place, good for fill in grocery trips and specialty bakery and deli items. Produce is good too. Throwback typical of downtown Wakefield, rare to find in modern suburbia. 
22001 1 The food was decent the biggest problem is that it took almost 45 minutes to and hour just to get my food and since it took that long I will not be coming back here again!!! 
22002 4 There donuts add another dimension to donuts. They are flavorful and are not doughy greasy messes like most places. Worth the effort to find a Blue Star location. This belongs on my food to eat my last weekend in Oregon before moving list. 
22003 3 Food was great and service super helpful and knowledgeable. Only down point was that it just didn't seem to meet the same awesome vibe as the other Boston location. This one seemed a little more plain and corporate. Still, a good time was had by all. 
22004 3 really good food. I enjoyed this place. really good beer on tap too. 
22005 3 Came here unexpectedly and enjoyed the meal. Decent food for a decent price. Although the Pad Thai is a bit more saucy than I'm used to. We ordered: Wonton Soup Coconut Soup Coconut Shrimp Vegetable Pad Thai Yummy Thai Fried Rice I would come back 
22006 4 Very authentic Mexican food, with reasonable prices. Loved my service and food tasted amazingly good. Worth your money ! 
22007 4 Great first time experience on Saturday August 29, 2015! Had a custom-made Gluten Free pizza and both my teenage son and I loved it! Very cool, chill people too. Can't wait to take my fiance back and try some of their wine and salads, dine-in. 
22008 3 Service is excellent and the wait staff attentive.food was hot and delicious and the menu was really diverse! The only thing it was just a touch more expensive then the two dollar sign, still pretty darn good I would go again 
22009 4 Delicious pizza, tasty wings, and always friendly service. The plain wings are the best, with just a hint of spice and plenty of flavor. Can't speak to delivery, but for pickup the times are always reasonable - even on chilly Friday evenings. Great neighborhood place! 
22010 3 Let me do a quick word association- Colorful,fun,inexpensive,crowded,bursting,creative, frustrating, vast, tasty. 
22011 4 This is a great hotel, but if you come to this hotel make sure that you book a room with a savannah view. 
22012 4 I have been using Dr. Allen for over 15 years and cannot give her enough praise. She is truly an animal loving, compassionate soul. She is also a very skilled Veterinarian and all of my dogs/cats have loved her over the years. 
22013 4 This place is phenomenal! Chipotle ketchup yes please! This is my new favorite burger place HANDS DOWN! I cannot see myself going anywhere else for burgers honestly. They have UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS MILKSHAKES, a full bar with fantastic specialty drinks, and needless to say great burgers. 
22014 3 Recent stay at this hotel was very enjoyable. I would say though that check-in was late and front desk somewhat understaffed. But all the workers there were very nice. 
22015 4 Really fun place to have some beers. Excellent selection with true local craft brews. 
22016 0 Terrible customer service. I had at least 3 people say someone will be right with me and then walk away to do something else. If you can go to a different location do. I will be going to round rock they are great. 
22017 2 The quality of the wings is no better than your local Zaxby's. If you are looking for cheap wings, you can get them here. 
22018 4 Ordered their woodblock mocha. Smooth chocolatey but not sweet, just the way I like it. This is at their PDX location. Mmm. ;P 
22019 4 Very nice place. Brett was SUPER professional. I will definitely be asking for him before I make future reservations. I'd trust him to take care of anybody I send over. Great view of the lake! 
22020 4 The coffee is delicious, the service is great, and the lemon poppy donut will change your life. 
22021 4 Katie is the creator of the best brow wax I have ever had! I am perpetually sensitive to all types of waxing and as an esthetician, very picky about shaping. Katie gets the shape every time and I never have any scabbing or redness after. 
22022 1 This place simply wasn't that good. The food was mostly bland. Specifically the pork BBQ was dry and tasteless and the fried okra were oily. Nothing tasted great. 
22023 4 Dr. Forster is the best! He is very knowledgeable and friendly. It is always a pleasure to come here and my kids love coming here. The staff is always friendly and great too. Definitely recommend it to everyone. 
22024 3 Great food. Nice people. Slow service. If you're not in a hurry, try it out. The dressing they use on the salad is worth it alone! 
22025 3 High quality atmosphere when I walked in. Order the chicken chili and it was great. Service a little slow. 
22026 4 This is the best place for take-out Thai in the metro area. Large portions and top notch quality food with speedy delivery. 
22027 4 Excellent customers service. Great selection of bikes. Close to trails. I highly recommend the activity. 
22028 4 Very closed by to my work so it is very convenient for me to stop by at my lunch time. The staffs are so nice and very friendly always greet me with smiles. I always make a little chitchat when I ordered my sandwiches. Love it! 
22029 4 Full disclosure: I volunteer here and one of the reasons is that it's the best shelter i've volunteered at. Consider doing the same -- you'll have a great experience here whether you're trying to adopt an animal or help one out by volunteering. And most importantly, they're no-kill. 
22030 2 Its alright. I miss the old Amrheins. The food was ok but very expensive for a local Pub. Overall Grade: B- 
22031 3 great food and service. wanted to try crab cakes and they were worth going 
22032 4 Without a doubt the best coffee shop in Vancouver that has both great food and service. Unique and delicious pastries and desserts that you're not going to get anywhere else (pistachio and white chocolate croissant), they're amazing. 
22033 0 Worst service ever! Enough people work BUT, TOO MANY ON THEIR PHONES, while working. My visit was tonight at 10:40pm never again. And their score is a 83 B 
22034 4 By far the best burger I've ever had. Delicious!! Music is a bit loud for me, but I can look past that easily because the food is so damn good!! 
22035 4 It's a beautiful space with a wide selection of frames. The staff is very personable and helpful, and seem to really enjoy working there. A very pleasant experience, and I'm happy with the glasses I picked. 
22036 4 Very cute atmosphere! Very generous portions of house wine and sangria! The veggies are fresh and the prices are fair! Check this place out! 
22037 4 An absolute gem. It's your basic Red Robin. Very new interior, and a great staff! Even though I came during the busy lunch rush, the staff made sure my entire visit ran smoothly. I'll definitely be back. 
22038 4 I'm not a big Atlanta fan, but what they do really well, is upscale restaurants. This was a new stop for the s and another home run!! Excellent food service and overall great stop!! 
22039 4 We love this place! Best guacamole I've ever had, hands down. Complementary chips and salsa are fantastic. Veggie enchiladas are delicious and everything is fresh. Service is excellent. 
22040 3 I haven't tried everything on their menu but everything that I've had so far has been pretty good. The service is always good too. It's small but it's still a very inviting place. It's pretty pricey though. 
22041 4 What a wonderful cafe! If I lived in the city this would be a weekly stop. The food was amazingly fresh and delicious. The staff was friendly and efficient. It offered a cozy place to start our day during the Nor'easter. Definitely a must when I'm back in the city. 
22042 2 food is OK. could be better. wait staff is good. prices are be expected. very nice wine selection. 
22043 4 I ate here while on business travel. I loved the food. The stuffed eggplant was fantastic. The cabbage rolls were good. service was fantastic. The waitress was attentive, knowledgable about the menu and sensitive to the customers needs. 
22044 3 Not bad all. Came here the other day and there wasn't much people. Ordered the winter melon tea and it was quite nice, not too sweet and not too bland either. Never had winter melon tea before so it was a nice first experience! Will come back again sometime! 
22045 3 Cool atmosphere... Delicious wings, burgers and ribs! My husband had the fish tacos and felt they were just "ok".. Def the place to come watch a sports game... I would recommend this to others visiting universal. 
22046 4 I love this place in general but I tired the banana nut muffin for breakfast and was very disappointed. 2.49 seems like a lot for a room temperature muffin. I have had a warm version at a different location and it is a night and day difference. 
22047 4 Excellent authentic food, local place. Cheap and fast. Tried the torta. Would come back for sure if staying again near universal studios. 
22048 1 My best friend recommended this restaurant after I was craving goat. The service was so slow that I had to think about how long I was willing to wait before walking out. Once my order was finally taken, service was cordial. The food was great once it arrived. 
22049 3 Nice clean place, our waitress Monica was wonderful. A little slow on the food but everything was hot. 
22050 1 Due to the fact we eat there only about twice a year or so. My last experience w/ D.C was not A+ the waitress was rude, the food was cold, and the time before that I had shells in my dish. Aside from that love the atmosphere (decor) 
22051 4 I absolutely love the feel of this place. It's just a lively and yet cosy Cafe with a great soundtrack! 
22052 4 Bella Italia is consistent - always great food, friendly staff, enjoyable atmosphere. We haven't been disappointed with any of the options we've tried. The owner is always onsite and makes sure that every guest is happy. While that's not necessary, it sure does add a nice touch! 
22053 4 Peter and Leo really made my day and my meal today, going above and beyond with my order. They accommodated my weird requests with enthusiasm and hospitality. Thanks again guys!! 
22054 3 Obsessed with this food truck. It brings me back to my time in college when I actually had no money and it was my late night go to. Definitely recommend for someone that wants a quality and tasty snack. 
22055 3 Haven't been here in years but the pizza back when I was in little league was amazing when its fresh out of the oven 
22056 4 What a great hotel! The staff really goes out of their way to make sure you have a great time. We attended the Ryan Deiss content and commerce summit and the hotel staff really helped pull this off as well I will stay here again soon. 
22057 4 Started this review months ago and never finished. Awesome place! Do not pass up an opportunity to get a sammich here! 
22058 4 Great smoked pork, beef and chicken! The MAC and cheese was excellent and the pot liquor greens were super spicy! Never had greens quite like it. 
22059 4 We were in town for graduation and ran across this place. They have the most AMAZING gyros ever! I live in California and can't wait to go back to Boston to eat another one! I have been craving one from this place for weeks after I got home. 
22060 4 its the best pizza hut i'v found in florida always got great deals & offers the staff are very friendly & make you feel welcome and if you have children with you they make them feel extra special & welcome them in a huge way too 
22061 3 The crawfish combo is amazing! I don't think I even came up for air until the plate was empty. 
22062 4 Consistently great pizza, burgers, subs. Very fast delivery. Very friendly people. Not at all expensive. Love Boston Pizza in Norwell! 
22063 4 One of the best things about the Magic Kingdom - Sad that it is leaving next week. Wish I could go back to see it one more time! 
22064 2 This place offers decent american burgers but nothing too fancy. Don't expect a goat cheese and porcini burger here but at the same time, it's a step above the burger you'd get at a greasy dinner. Fast-food syle joint pre-McDonalds days. They serve beer and wine and pretty good milk-shakes. 
22065 4 Budget Blinds did an excellent job with consultation and installation. In particular, installer Will was very careful to get everything just right and make sure I understood the warranty and service info, even while still being highly efficient. 
22066 3 Our favorite Farmers Market! A must-stop-at booth is Rose City Pepperheads. Fantastic, tasty pepper jellies from mild to wild, and the gal that runs the booth is great with suggestions for pairings. We've been a fan of theirs for a long time! 
22067 3 Wonderful Greek food, every dish is excellent and the service is amazing. A place to go for a romantic dinner or just hang out on their heated terrace. We love to come back here time and time again. 
22068 3 Don't order your usual sushi when you come here (Dynamite, Alaska, etc.). Their deluxe rolls are delicious and creative. Their sashimi is fresh. The rice and noodle dishes taste average though. Definitely go for the sushi and sashimi when you're here! 
22069 3 I've never sat down to eat there, I've always gotten my order to go. The pinto beans and rice is a cheap, addictive dinner when you're feeling uninspired. It's comfort food, Cuban style. The rest of the menu is good, hardy Cuban fare. 
22070 2 This place is pretty chill and I like it but my girlfriend won't go here with me cuz y'all serve your beer in shaker pints and she doesn't think that's right. Please step up your glassware game so that I can drink here more often. Thanks. 
22071 2 The pizza was nice and greasy (pepperoni and mushroom) and the onion rings were decent. We walked in and ordered to go - service was pretty fast. 
22072 4 A great new coffee shop in the Cully neighborhood. I have been waiting for this place to open and stopped by on their first day! Good coffee and great service. Welcome to the neighborhood! 
22073 0 Over rated. Selection is strange. If you want a pretty normal dog it move on. Mine were dray and not at all what expected. 
22074 4 Great food and service... Multiple people checked in on us. Clump crab cannelloni, and the eggplant parm rocked. Tiramisu was phenomenal, super moist and saturated in dessert liquor. Will most def be back. Ask for Rob, he was outstanding! 
22075 4 Hands down the best doughnut I've ever had. Made to order, great service, and a great atmosphere. A must have if you're ever in the area! 
22076 3 Good authentic Mexican food. Local and definitely not a chain. 
22077 1 Food was pretty good. The service definitely was the weak point. Never got a greeting for at least 5 minutes and once we did they took out order and disappeared after that. And then only checked on us after we were through eating. 
22078 3 Tastiest broth I've ever had. However, they don't trim even the slightest bit of fat. A tiny bit excessive. Overall fantastic pho. 
22079 4 Wow!! What an amazing place The broth has so much flavor, the noodles are bomb - and that garlic kick they add is amazing. 
22080 4 My boyfriend & I LOVE Cooper's hawk. We go pretty much every week. I'm obsessed with the napa salad, and he always switches is up between steak and seafood. The service is always great, and the wine decanter are really cool! Highly recommend, especially for date night! 
22081 3 It's worth trying once - I'm not exactly itching to go back as soon as I can though. I have to agree that it is a bit on the tourist trap end of things. It is on 6th street after all. 
22082 1 Ordered a veggie sandwich online arrived a bit early for pick up and they quickly made my sandwich. Sandwich was made incorrectly... asked for light May and onion and received a heavily mayonnaise's sandwich with oil that I didn't ask for. Needless to say my sandwich on wheat was soggy 
22083 3 The spicy Shrimp in the appetizer was packed with flavor, probably my favorite shrimp dish, but the bed of greens was out-of-the-bag salad with julienne cucumber, very pedestrian. 
22084 4 This was our first time here. The staff was super friendly. It's a cool environment, much cooler than a normal pizza place. Nice bar area. The pizza was very good. 
22085 3 Solid hotel with a good south central location. Friendly staff and clean rooms. What you expect from a courtyard. Night auditor wasnt available once when we needed an extra blanket but i think he was just taking a smoke break so no big deal. 
22086 4 Top Notch fresh food it was wonderful. Josh was our server he was very helpful and had a lot of attention to detail 
22087 4 Tried the gyro last week for lunch. OMG!! Sooooo delicious! The sauce was great. I plan to try the Greek salad next visit. 
22088 4 Damn. Good. Pizza. I love getting a personal pizza customized the way I want it. And that crust is ridiculously amazing. This will become a usual stop for me. 
22089 4 Great restaurant with delicious food and drinks in a fun atmosphere. I had the Rosco Old Fashioned and the fish and chips. Both were outstanding. I'll definitely be coming back. 
22090 4 Very cool place. Hip, friendly staff. Excellent food. I'm partial to restaurants in houses so I felt right at home. Only issue was that they didn't take debit cards. I'll be back for sure. 
22091 4 Very good coffee and solid crepes. I would admit the branding of this store is a bit confusing but once you get over that you will find good coffee and crepes, the products and services are what mattered in my opinion! 
22092 3 My boyfriend and I went here for Valentine's Day dinner. I had the crab crusted haddock and thought it could use more crab. Besides that, the food was good. The waitress we had was very nice. I would definitely come back. 
22093 3 Cabbage rolls bomb.com! Buffet is pretty decent, too. Definite recommend. Come to eat, it's not a light meal. 
22094 3 Great food and good selection for American food. Try the steak tips they are awesome and reasonable priced! 
22095 0 Got a phone call from manager would stated that take out flavor deteriorates over time. Also stated that they recently changed their recipes for two of our items. Wanted us to come taste test their latest menu. 
22096 3 Great atmosphere and delicious food. I was there for Sunday brunch and the chicken and waffle sliders were fantastic! I'd definitely recommend them. The staff was friendly and polite and service was pleasant. I will be going back for more at The Bishop. 
22097 0 Atrociously long line. One person working. We walked out. Nice atmosphere. It's connected to a lot of smaller stores which are fun and funky. 
22098 0 , 140$ , - rmv ( ). rmv , , , , , rmv. 
22099 2 Great place for some cheap Chinese comfort food. Service is minimal. Tea isn't always served pipping hot. The restaurant is somewhat clean but could use a deep scrubbing on the tables. The congee and noodles are solid choices here that I like to order. 
22100 4 Literally made a Yelp account to give this place 5 stars. The food is amazing and if it's not busy try to strike up a conversation with rick. 5/5 food | 5/5 conversation. 
22101 4 Scenic Courtyard. Great Service. Wonderful Experience. 
22102 4 We absolutely love this place, homestyle MEXICAN food. I don't think we've ever had a dish we didn't enjoy. Perhaps a little out-dated but it's homey and is Rosie's. The staff works hard and provides superior service. Our favorite time to go is breakfast with Senor Fox. "Fill it up!" 
22103 4 We are coffee people. Clive is coffee. Investment coffee, but if you are looking to upgrade your grinder, tamper, espresso maker, etc, go here! Staff is incredibly knowledgeable. They carry high quality product lines. Very friendly and helpful. Ask for Chris, he's the best. 
22104 3 What is a Chinese street sandwich? Delicious, that's what it is! Just picture a handmade flatbread wrapping device enclosed with a chicken so lightly fried you almost think it's calamari. Then add pickled peppers, greens and sauce. You now have the Chicken Po Boy in your hands. Eat and enjoy. 
22105 4 I love this place!! Great toppings, very fresh and an overall healthy snack. Wish I had some now. I usually get the pomegranate yogurt or swirled with the original flavor topped w/ strawberries, kiwi and nuts...awesome!! 
22106 2 Would not order again, but was edible. They were fast, but for a supreme there was not a lot of toppings. They delivered to the hotel so that was nice. 
22107 4 This place is delicious. Perfect almost. Sat down fast, food came fast. Will come back within the week. Woo hoo. 
22108 0 Beware! Very unprofessional came to my home when my wife and I were not present and proceeded to perform work without our authorization. They expected me to pay charges for work without any proof that it was even performed due to me not being home when they supposedly did it. 
22109 4 My energetic dog goes here twice a week and she's completely wiped when she comes home. Thank. God. The staff is great, the space is huge, and my dog is happy! What more could I ask for? 
22110 4 Go with the house special with banana peppers and extra sauce. And always ask for it to be well done. Best pizza in town! 
22111 4 I absolutely love this place. Whenever I want to get out and have a guaranteed great time and great food I come here. Def 5 stars. 
22112 3 What a great place! I was at The Press Club last Thursday night to hear Swing Papillon, but didn't know they served crepes and sandwiches. I tried the brie, brown sugar, walnut and pear crepe - incredible! Cool little place with lots of vibe in the Clinton area. 
22113 4 Staff is super friendly. All emergency rooms are slow as all heck. This one is no different. Clean and kept tidy for sure. It's also in a great location 
22114 4 Amazing pizza. Super friendly staff, laid back atmosphere and basically anything you'd want in a spot here in Portland. Not pretentious and just enjoyable. Go. 
22115 4 Just had the best ahi tuna ever..this little place is a hidden treasure....All you can eat for florida is rare for fresh sushi...Totally loved it..The appitizer menu could use some upgrades like lettuce wraps and mussles,but the awesome rolls totally made up for it...good quality great sevice..I highly recomend it!!! 
22116 4 Not sure how you can't love Johnny D's. Great place for brunch, great place for a casual dinner, good place to take a date, and a great place just to get a drink. Good food, good prices, good music as well...Johnny D's excels at all facets pretty much. 
22117 2 Good but too expensive for my taste. I choose Coco donuts. 
22118 4 This is one of my all-time favorite happy hour spots! Everything roKs here... 
22119 4 How can you not give Nancys 5 stars. The food was great. And the portions huge. Got the omelette and the biscuits and gravy. Will definitely be back. 
22120 4 Had an issue with the bracelet on a Movado, he fixed it and replaced a battery on another watch in 5 mins, all while having a nice chat about the best ski options in bc. $20 price was amazing too, 5 stars all day Will be back 
22121 4 Professor Corrine and professor Tabbie were a blast the entire time, they really set the atmosphere and kept the pace brisk. But the real star of the night was the zombie, the late Dr. Natalie. This was a really fun night. 
22122 3 "Hole-in-the-wall". That is the way the concierge at the hotel described it. "....but good" Ok why not give it a try and I'm glad I did. If and when I'm in town again I will come back and eat here one again and again and again. Good, fresh and friendly. 
22123 4 I've been ducking in this spot for several years now. I've always enjoyed the food and service here. It's the only place that gets the number 27 with noodle right (wink) 
22124 3 What is there to be said about Blue Star? After a while, it gets to be too sweet- but sweet it is. Enjoy the simpler doughnuts on the glazed end of the spectrum. For the dollar, the Sesame Donuts chain is equally good and the coffee is better. 
22125 3 We come here sometimes after church on Sundays for breakfast, a very busy time. Just a simple place serving typical breakfast food with lunch offerings as well. The service is pretty quick and the staff friendly. 
22126 1 Went there for an early dinner and the decor is very beautiful. There is a lot of detail from the etching on the floors to the cherry-blossoms mural but that's about it. The food was ok? We had: -stuffed avocado with crab (appetizer) -dragon roll -Kobe roll -tuna and avocado 
22127 4 Great service. Definitely worth the wait. Bring cash. Best of the Ham. Great food!! Come check it out. Huge portions. 
22128 3 Finding #latenightgems is #mything and there are a few of them in this area starting @juniorcolombianburger_ and yes for the last time #iordered and #iate everything JR HOTDOGG W/everything on it and JR CHEESBURGER w/fries wit it great customer service 
22129 4 The nicest doctors and staff! Everyone is wonderful both in pediatrics and orthodontist areas. They were also very cooperative when working out payment plans. 
22130 2 A lot less chaotic than the FL Mall location, but still chaotic. The staff is also a lot more friendlier and helpful. A nice store to pick up some cheap trendy clothes for both men and women. 
22131 4 The best Chinese food in Orlando. We had Ma PO Tofu rice vegetarian noodles. Staff was very friendly and courteous and offered all necessary help. Special call out for Heidi and Ryan both very friendly. Must visit for every tourist visiting Orlando. 
22132 2 Thiiick marrow Ramen soup. Quick. No frills. Nice staff. Long line waiting, so they're doing something right 
22133 4 I am also so grateful to BeFIT for the role they play in our community. They are good citizens and I'm so happy they are in Lake Mary! 
22134 2 Came for brunch and had 2 mimosas. The first one was great but the second one tasted like copper, or a penny or blood...irony. Either way I hope it was nothing too big a deal. The atmosphere for brunch is nice and relaxing. 
22135 0 I used to like Paneer biryani at this place. Yesterday when I ordered, we found that panner quantity was reduced by half and paying $12 just for few pieces of paneer and rice was not worth. Disappointed! 
22136 4 These donuts are so good I got the creme brulee and bacon donut. The creme brulee donut has a little dropper where you pour all over the donut! 
22137 3 Really like this place. A bit overpriced but you get a lot of food on each plate you order. Lunch specials seem to be much more affordable. Great staff and I enjoy the atmosphere. 
22138 4 So delicious and unique savory, sweet, and dessert waffles. First tried at original Hawthorne window and fell in love. Like going to alberta, it's much closer to Vancouver! 
22139 4 Haven't been inside the mansion yet, but if you have an out of town guest, or a Portland Newbie, this is an excellent spot. Bring your date, have a picknick on the lawn. 
22140 4 The caramelized honey gave me a deeply spiritual moment. My favorite ice cream hands down! 
22141 4 THE MOST AMAZING PLACE IN THE WORLD. OMG IS LIKE HEAVEN HERE!! Such nice people and a devotion to amazing food. Met one of the owners and I'm very happy that we went into this place is one of the nicest places to go. 
22142 3 Went here while I'm vacation. Cute place, good food. Was very busy while we were there. Decent coffee. I'd go back if I'm ever in Orlando again. It's nothing special but nice for a quick breakfast. 
22143 0 One of the worst Indian food I've eaten in a long time... Place is dirty, servers appearance and clothing looks dirty Service is Horrible horrible. I wish there was 1/2 of star I could give them. 
22144 4 The wraps are tantalizing and delicious. I personally like the wakame, spicey kale, nori roll & okra dish. Its the bomb! I eat here at last 3 tunes a week. The vibe of the environment is fulfilling. The people are Robust, lively and great company. 
22145 3 Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. I had the best chicken and dumplings meal today, a choice of small or large size. Glad I ordered the small, that was plenty, perfect portion size 
22146 0 Avoid! Positive review here doubtless written by the owner. These guys sold us a defective refrigerator. The brand and model they sold us has had class action law suits against it. I would not recommend this place. 
22147 4 I came in on recommendation from my insurance after a small "tap" that took out a headlight cover. The people were so helpful and were honest about what would save me money. 
22148 3 The chicken lazeez was awesome, the lamb was tender but bland. Hookah was great, and the staff was very friendly. I would rate them four on five because of the price - its quite an expensive place. 
22149 1 brought a pair of shoes and they forgot to remove the security device. i have to bring them back the other day to get it removed. waste my time. 
22150 4 this place is great overall. from the historical atmosphere and the food. i had the Lobster mac n' cheese, which has a really rich and cheesy flavor. Also they had a very great service and staff. 
22151 4 As always, I come for the ambiance, impressive array of brews, really good food, and a friendly, professional staff. It has a Cheers kind of vibe to it, you know, where everyone knows your name. 
22152 0 We ordered mocha and vanilla latte. Mocha tastes like chocolate milk.... and it was wasting of money!! Also barista gave us BAD service! 
22153 0 Worse place ever. They treat their customers horribly and are rude. Even the manager was rude. I hope this place gets shut down and taken over by those who own patio. Don't go here don't waste your money!!! 
22154 3 Our meal at Harvest was delicious and wholesome, with pleasant and skilled service. There's no way this place could get as few as three stars, in my book; the food was too good and the concept was too unique and too worthy. I'm looking forward to going back. 
22155 4 Amazing food you get what you pay for love the all the sides really really ... We order the family deal lots of food also we order a rib yummmy 
22156 2 Hankering for steak we checked Yelp and found this place. But it was a mixed bag dining experience. Food was good, not incredible. Service was very slow but pleasant. Not sure I'd bother again, pretty pricey for mediocre experience. 
22157 4 It's always a good day when I get my Kilwin's. I also love that I consistently see the same nice people!! 
22158 3 This place still delivers. It is quaint, quiet and food is still as good as it can be. Tan Tan noodles, hot and sour soup, cod with seasonal veggies, etc... 
22159 4 Linda is one of the best massage therapists I have ever encountered. Her deep tissue skills are excellent (not too soft!) and she gives sound advice for working through troubled areas. Best of all, she allows you to choose your own music from Pandora. No more endless Enya! 
22160 4 The expanded patio is awesome and now makes the place good for parties of up to 8 on nice weather days. You have to get the onion dip with your chips - out of this world! 
22161 4 I just saw Dr Sheila Reddy for the first time and she was awesome! Perhaps now I will find an answer to my stomach pains yea!! She was very knowledgeable and thorough and I look forward to her findings and hopefully a cure! 
22162 4 Best hot pot in town. Delicious broths, especially the malai(spicy). Broad selection of proteins and veggies. Speedy service. Best food deal in town. Only negative is parking, but then again, you're in chinatown. I'm surprised by the 3.5 star rating in yelp. Should be at least 4. 
22163 3 Love this place, I'm so sad they're closing! My favourite seats are the ones by the massive pannel windows, summer breeze and people watching at the intersection is prime. Most of their foods are sourced locally. I especially enjoyed their planks, pairs well with their beer flights :) 
22164 4 Ok,so just to add on to this, I tried the omusoba last week and it was probably one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life... Pretty sure this dish will be a staple for me every time I go in now. 
22165 3 I loved the Cuban pig and the picnic chicken. There is a "hidden" kids menu. A little pricy for the kids portions. The margarita kicks! It's pretty good! 
22166 4 Great food for a great price! A variety of desserts, sushi and seafood! Food tasted fresh and hot. Was skeptical at first due to the location but was very surprised. Will be back! 
22167 4 Casa Del Matador is the best place for Happy Hour....every day from 4-6 and then again from 10-12pm I believe. Great food, great atmosphere...In the heart of NW Portland...who could ask for anything more.... 
22168 4 Just really great burgers, easy and casual. Good beer options and adult milkshakes. It's a weekly stop for us! 
22169 2 Decent pho. Didn't seem super fresh or authentic- but a close and quick option for pho in Chinatown. Smaller and more intimate than Pho Pasteur next door 
22170 3 Great food, Great service!! The location is much too small for the amount of business they get, i cant wait for them to expand!! Its a small cozy restaurant and would be fine if the traffic was slower. 
22171 4 We are here for the World Cup, great seats to watch games, lots of screens. The Hurricane Cocktail tastes great, and we are being served with an amazing free dessert after the purchase of our meals (Yelp Check in offer) 
22172 0 Staff in front desk are lazy and not nice. May be they dont get pay enough. Staff on the phone, if you happen to speak to one about your bill, they are not nice either. They are rude in the phone and lied. I will look else where next time. 
22173 2 Drinks - music - classic Mediterranean dishes - dancing on tables - belly dancing! This place is good fun! 
22174 3 Nice ambience, service was excellent. Loved the duck salad, worth every penny. Drinks were good too, little pricey but you pay for the experience. Would go back 
22175 4 Killer meal! Had the fried green tomatoes, charcuterie, steak special , and burger between the wife and I for our anniversary dinner and all were fantastic! The drinks were yummy and the comped desserts were a wonderful touch. Thanks for making our night very special! 
22176 4 I came to Sunbusters because of good reviews on Yelp. Customer service was great. Their work was very detailed and high quality. 
22177 3 Place was fun and friendly as for the sushi I have had better I'm not a sushi expert by any means but it was definitely lots of fun and cool to try several of their inventive plates Ambience was cute and romantic with lots of good energy! 
22178 2 Average food at rock bottom prices. Not fine dining, but there's rotating specials and sports TV. Steamed potatoes and salad with your burger, so it's a little bit healthier than your average pub food. 
22179 4 Quick & Fantastic. Reasonably priced. Go see Yolanda! 
22180 1 pizzas good, people who work there suck and cant keep a game face when things are semi-busy on a werk night. caesar salad was boring and sad. 
22181 0 First all the women with the nasty teeth is so rude. I was tryin to get my order rite an the women taken the order was very nasty the tall old lady. I will never go there again -1 
22182 0 I don't know what these other reviewers are used to but I found this place to be disgusting! There were two buggers on the bed cover and a period stain on the bed sheets. I am seriously thinking about sleeping in my car tonight....I know it will be more sanitary! 
22183 4 Fantastic live music venue where you can catch many local bands on their way up in popularity. The bar is nothing special, so the shows aren't as crowded as they should be, but still worth stopping by for a cheap show. 
22184 0 The wait time is crazy 3 1/2 hours!!! They need to develop a better system than to have people wait in line. I even watched a lady pass out from the heat! The burger is good but not a 3 1/2 hour wait kinda burger. 
22185 0 Went here for Oktoberfest. No one was there. Paid 7.50 for a terrible brat with yellow mustard on it. 
22186 1 The vegetable they use in the noodle is not fresh, it's overprice with that kind of quality. Their pork gzoya tastes fine, but other than that, nothing was that impressive. 
22187 2 Good Spot: Get a steak with onions and mushrooms with extra wiz. The only downside is the bread could've been fresher. 
22188 3 OMG. Super good. Went during restaurant week. So good food so good beer. I will totally be going back. 
22189 4 I really love the taste after its being toasted. They got deals from $6-$19. After you choose the slices, they toast it in their oven and and absolutely delicious. 
22190 2 So far my quest for a good chinese place continues. The porf fried ruce that my husband order was delicious but my beef fried rice not so much. The lo mein was good and the chicken wings were huge. I will try them again. 
22191 3 So far no bad experiences for me. Is the perfect place to go and pick up an affordable meal late night. I like their burgers and milkshakes and their meals under $4. Not a fan of the hot dogs though. 
22192 4 Way better than the cafe that was here before. Friendly staff. Jammed and packed every time I stop by so may be hard getting a seat. Try the nitro for something refreshing and different. 
22193 2 Overrated. Tastes decent but tastes more like cake than donuts. I like that I don't feel like I'm about to go into a diabetic coma after. But I'd rather stick to real, old school donuts that are more comforting and aren't "inventive". 
22194 4 What a sweet store this is! If you're looking for unique, artisan-made jewelry at affordable prices look no further. The only trouble I had was narrowing down which pieces I had to have! A Sellwood gem! 
22195 3 Went here for a birthday dinner. Service good. Food pretty good, obviously it's a 'pretty plate' so you get enough for a taste but not to fill you up. It tasted good, but there was just not quite enough to fill me! And I am a small 120 pound girl! 
22196 1 The rolls are warmish. We didn't get our appetizer. They ran out of a house wine. The pizza okay but didn't taste brick oven. No wonder there are so few Bertucci's around. 
22197 3 Get the Burnside crew get something else to split theses samnies are numny. The Bahn mi really good and the damn chili. I'm Coming Back Soon 
22198 4 Really good cocktails & tapas! The paella was divine. recommend if the weather is nice to sit on the rooftop you'll feel like you're in California. 
22199 4 Amazing car wash, everyone was very professional. Best car wash my van has ever had! Even wiped down the tires. 
22200 4 Enjoyed having you @ OCLC in Dublin Ohio today - do you have a broadcast or schedule for when you are there? 
22201 4 Excellent Ethiopian food! Pretty popular place too! 
22202 4 Kilwin's makes the VERY BEST ice cream and fudge in Florida, hands down! Make sure you try their seasonal flavors; they never disappoint. Right now it's sea salt chocolate caramel! As you are approaching the store, be sure to savor the incredible smell of the waffle cones baking :) 
22203 4 Love this place. Awesome staff and the best coffee on the North Shore. Hiighly recommend going here. 
22204 4 I go to this Joe's periodically. I love it for someone who doesn't particularly like chain or restaurants. They make one of the best sirloin steaks and at a great price. Their clam chowder and margaritas are excellent as well. The service at Joe's has always been excellent. 
22205 3 Food was very good, but not quite what I expected for this price range. The facility is beautiful and location perfect. Hopefully they will work the kinks out of the recipes; I'd love to go back. 
22206 2 This was has good coffee I got a Carmel latte and really enjoyed it They don't have a great selection on bake goods 
22207 3 great neighbourhood(Multnomah Village) resturant. Fresh food prepared really well. From the soup(Dill Pickle!!!) to the desserts, great flavours. Great service too. Will definitely go back next time we're in town. 
22208 4 A hidden gem. Service was great, staff is friendly and extremely polite. The deep fried banana with honey and ice cream is AMAZING. The portion is huge for only $5. I definitely recommend!! 
22209 4 After moving up from the bay area I struggled to find a place that does a good job. This is the place. I've had my hair cut by John and Serena (sp?). Both have done stellar jobs. In addition, they seem to be very good about scheduling I recommend highly. 
22210 4 Miso rekka with thick, firm noodles, rich broth, standard lard and a soft-boiled egg. Really like the level of spicy since other ramen spots are not spicy at all for me even tho I got the "spicy" choice 
22211 4 Mario was terrific. He fixed a drainage problem we had been having for a year in about 30 minutes; thoughtful, and knows his stuff. Could not be happier! 
22212 3 Get the shrimp fried rice lunch special with your choice of hot and sour or wonton soup and egg roll and Buddha's delight (mix veggie in brown sauce) lunch special and add fried tofu to it for $1. Crab Rangoon's are good too! 
22213 4 Sushi Katana is the perfect place for your Japanese food experience. Nice food selection, prices are right, great service and quality. This was my best Japanese experience in Orlando! 
22214 4 I don't know why we waited so long to try this. Absolutely delicious. The reviews are spot on. If you don't know where to start with the Tibs! 
22215 4 After eating Jim Jim's you won't ever settle for a regular snow cone again. The ice is infused with flavor via whatever voodoo magic they do in the back. The result is pure deliciousness. My personal favorite is the Mango Water-Ice. You can't go wrong with it. 
22216 4 This place is absolutely divine, great atmosphere, food is amazing and staff is well supported. Their beverages are just as great as their food, love the patio area and the interior is amazing too. This is the absolute perfect place to dine for breakfast or lunch 
22217 4 We finally made our way into this place and it's awesome! What a great surprise when you walk through the door. The staff is very knowledgable and helpful. Don't pass this place up if you're looking for a good liquor store! 
22218 0 It's rough, nevermind the bad food or horrible service. The thugs that hang out outside and inside are enough to send the average person right down the street to quiznos. At least at quiznos you can have it your way and actually get the food how you ordered! 
22219 0 Read several reviews about the bad service here... unfortunately it is spot on. We have had extremely rude service several times, mainly from the same blonde male bartender that is there and it will not be somewhere we stop on Rock Rose again. Great food but bad service. 
22220 4 Steve from Dallas Texas was awesome and was one of the kindest, nicest people I have ever met as a flight attendant. He was so compassionate - if you ever get a chance to fly with him you'll be in really great hands! 
22221 3 Love their margaritas! The chipotle mushrooms were delicious. Only gripe is that is can get crazy busy and feel super crowded with the layout. Otherwise, great dinner in a great location. 
22222 4 The best brunch in years. Duck confit is probably the best I ever had. Yolks are bright orange colour and eggs are pouched perfectly. Frisée dressed with yummiest dressing. Totally French ambience :) 
22223 4 Great place for breakfast. Super good coffee, yummy Rio bowl and owners are the friendliest we have ever met! Can't wait to go back. Only wish this adorable place was bigger! 
22224 4 I wish I had a picture of the short rib I ate.... The meal was amazing and our waiter, Brandon, went through the entrees with wine pairings for us. Had a great time and will absolutely come back! 
22225 0 Worst place to order delivery from. Put an order in through Yelp. Waited over 2 hours and food was never delivered. 
22226 2 Average ME food. Lemony aftertaste to many of the dishes. Good spot for a quick unassuming meal near coolidge corner, but multiple better options in the vicinity. 
22227 1 Every time I come to this location I'm always so disappointed and frustrated with how slow the service is. This location really needs to focus on their service to accommodate their huge lines. 
22228 4 This bar is a hidden gem. Great selection of wine and beer. If you need recommendations, the bartenders are more than willing to offer you great suggestions. Sam the bartender was very knowledgable of the wine selection and is definitely the nicest bartender who has ever served me 
22229 4 Cute show. Poor Donald always getting into trouble. This show is also great if you need to sit down after a long time of walking. It's also very funny and worth seeing. I would definitely give it a try. 
22230 4 Camarone Rellenos, jalapeño maize chicken, honey glazed lamb, and Jacey as your server make for a great evening! Of course ranch water (non sweet margaritas-- hard to find bc sugar is cheaper than tequila) and fire in the hole shots are the bomb! 
22231 2 chicken wings and coke was great and getting to know the bartender was great 
22232 3 Delicious. Yes, a bit expensive, but also much better than the typical chinese food you'll get. 
22233 4 It was my first time there and I doubted the restaurant seeing the location and the exterior. Don't get fooled by it. The interior is good and so is the food. Plenty of vegetarian options. Nice thai iced tea. 
22234 4 Such a great Austin eatery. Excellent service and ambience paired with a delicious menu. The Pressed Watermelon Salad with Arugula, Feta & Mint is a 10 out of 10, perfect on a hot Austin night. 
22235 0 I pulled in the parking lot at 8:48 it is definitely not 9pm yet and it's closed....extremely disappointed! Why say that your open until 9 if your not going to stay open until 9, someone else also tried to get in so you lost 2 people's business. 
22236 2 Good food but not perfect. It is southern food but I'm just not a huge fan of this place. It isn't always the cleanest place and the people aren't very friendly. 
22237 2 Not as impressed as I thought I would be. The basic pancake order was so large, if I had eaten just half, would killed me. The service was good, but not the friendliest. Worth another visit when not so busy. 5 days ago...Saturday. 
22238 3 Typical sports type bar, but the food and drinks are cheap and the service is good. The nachos are really good, definitely my go to here! 
22239 4 Never fails! It's always a great, fresh salad bar with the best soups, breads and desserts ever! 
22240 2 Average, average and average. These chain restaurants are all over the city, and I must say that they are becoming more and more uninspired, pedestrian and nondescript. The food is always decent. The service is usually decent. The price is decent. What more is there to say? 
22241 2 Food is good, but the environment of the one on 192nd is much better 
22242 4 Honey wine and meat combo is my team's go-to combo. This is one of our most favorite restaurants in Cambridge - don't miss out! 
22243 4 Yummy! I got the fish and shrimp and it was delicious. The Mac and cheese was so good loved it. Hope they keep it as a side. 
22244 2 Pretty decent spot for some Pan-Asian cuisine. You may need to break out some Siracha or salt to add some punch to a few of their blander dishes. 
22245 4 This place is amazing for both service and food. The food is fresh, healthy, and delicious. The service is outstanding, the manager comes to each table and asks how your food is and if he can do anything and interacts with the guests on a personal level. 
22246 1 So, I really love this gym. It is a convenient location, and they have everything I need for a well rounded work out. However, their pool hasn't been cleaned in months. It's gross. 
22247 3 Muy buen lugar, tienen un buffet de ensaladas y carnes frias muy amplio. Los cortes de espadas de muy buena calidad. Algo caro e costo es de 50 dls por persona. El servicio bueno. 
22248 3 The service maybe haphazard per the other reviews; however, their chicken biscuit and coffee in the morning actually beats Chick-fil-A. And I'm a big Chick-fil-A fan.The staff I have dealt with have always been very courteous 
22249 3 Very good. Tasty. Healthy. Only downside is the tortilla chips are so freaking thick, they hurt my teeth to bite-- fearful I will break a tooth so stopped eating them. 
22250 1 It's my least favorite restaurant in Disney property. Their vegetarian entrées are bland and way over-priced. 
22251 4 This was a tuff year for me as I lost my pet to Cancer. I wanted to drop a line and say how amazing everyone here truly is. It's old time familiar faces that make this place what it is. 
22252 4 I love this place! Get there early, it fills up quick then you are left to stand around awkwardly waiting for a table to open up. Highly recommend! 
22253 2 They have a good solid burger but in general it is another one of those over hyped eateries in Austin. If you catch them during a non peak time it's worth stopping in. Definitely not worth waiting when the line stretches out the door. 
22254 4 First try. Bacon and cheddar panini is great. Little smaller than I expected, probably get a side if really want to be full. Otherwise, bread, eggs and bacon were all perfect! 
22255 4 Excellent food and service. Giuseppe's is a family-owned Bexley institution. The lunch menu includes outstanding food at very customer-friendly prices. The bar is among central Ohio's best. We try to get there at least once per week! 
22256 4 If you need something shipped this is the place to go. Excellent customer service. 
22257 4 Ariel was excellent as a server the filet was perfect. Andrew was very knowledgeable regarding the wine list. Highly recommended! 
22258 4 Amazing place! Highly recommend it. They made the entire place private for us, a group of 6 people before a graduation ceremony. Very friendly and helpful staff. We will be back! 
22259 4 Best apple fritters and butter milk bars! Very friendly owner! Always lets kiddos go behind the counter for a closer look at what they want and gives a few donut holes for kiddos too! Best donuts in town by far. 
22260 3 Some interesting house specialties. Very tasty, comfy chairs but on the pricier side of sushi. Friendly staff and probably a good bet if in Kerrisdale. 
22261 4 really easy to find with plenty of parking. I enjoyed the many different trails we could take. The view was amazing from each angle. I would love to come back when i have more time and have a pinic and just lounge around and soak up the sun. 
22262 4 Amazing food -- the jerk chicken is spicy, smoky, and perfect. Authentic Jamaican like I've not had in the US before. Highly recommend! 
22263 4 Food is amazing all the time. Never disappoints It can get packed so I would definitely advise making a reservation. Their salmon is amazing. So crispy ob the outside. Their bread, the butter, the drinks. I clearly need a minute..... love this place. 
22264 4 Props to management for getting the browns game on live stream. Above and beyond. Thanks buddy!You made my Sunday. 
22265 0 Awful. For cloths that are second hand, their return policies are crap. So word to the wise..you better love it or leave it bc once you buy it there's a good chance you'll have to keep it. 
22266 2 Good price for the meze bar which allowed me to try a bunch of things and stuff myself for about $8. Food was ok. Have to come back and try a wrap before giving it my final judgement. 
22267 4 Wonderful Boston Italian restaurant. I had the Cape Oysters and they were excellent. Nice selection of wines and not over priced. 
22268 0 Closed at 10pm, 1 hour earlier than it should be. No any notice on Yelp. Drive 40 min to this place without tasting it. Food might be good, but not interested anymore. 
22269 4 I love that every Mod pizza i have been to has such good food and service. You don't see that consistency in chains too often anymore. Quick enough for a lunch hour. The mini pizza is filling and the calories fit into my diet. 
22270 3 Both the Porcetta and BBQ Beef sandwich are delicious and the service is fast and very friendly. Big thumbs up! 
22271 4 Always warm and pure yum. You can tell they love food and really giving you a full plate. My fav: meatloaf and green beans (and cherry cobbler). But honestly, they have so much more - and it's all so very good. 
22272 4 I had surgery at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. The doctor was great, the anesthesiologist department was great, and the nursing staff on all shifts were great. I can't give enough praise. The kitchen was good, great place to go. I would recommend this hospital to anybody. 
22273 4 Jason worked on my Trooper a couple of times, I found him very easy to deal with, his quotes accurate, his prices more than fair, and his turnaround time very good. 
22274 4 The only bad thing about this place is that its closed on Tuesdays and they only take cash. Other than that, you can't go wrong. As others have said, the dun dun noodles are wonderful. Atmosphere is very ordinary, but you should come here for the food. 
22275 4 Fantastic place to spend a day. Took my toddler there and spent a huge chunk of time walking around the Japanese garden, which was totally gorgeous. It would also be nice for a date. Or to go alone. Basically, it's just awesome. Plus...it's FREE. Come on, people. 
22276 3 Stopped by after visiting the USS Constitution for a little brunch. Food was good and service was great. Room is a bit stuffy but that's its charm. We had an above average lobster, so good onion soup and a very good breakfast burrito and breakfast fajita. 
22277 4 I dine at Lucca on a fairly regular basis and have never been disappointed with the food or the service. The wait staff is great and always have excellent recommendations on the food as well as wine. Great food at a reasonable price and comfortable atmosphere. I highly recommend. 
22278 4 All of the food was great, appetizers, main(loaded BBQ baked potato) and the signature margaritas are strong and refreshing! 
22279 4 I moved right after Thanksgiving (early Dec 2011), and I have yet to find a hair stylist as good as Colleen at Horizon's. 
22280 3 One of our all-time favorite Thai place we know of in US! Their take on tom yum soup is very awesome (with flames and all). Bit pricey but food is awesome. Service was great too! Try their lotus root fries. It's my favorite. 
22281 4 I found this place by accident, and I'm so glad! It was the best raspberry donut I've ever had. Worth the drive from Natick! 
22282 3 Stir fry and fried rice were good. Didn't care for the sauce for the fried rice. Shrimp tempura roll was excellent. 
22283 2 Love my apartment. Not so impressed with maintenance. Constantly having to hound maintenance to do the jobs I request need to be done. Other than that I love the location of my apartment and the leasing agent was very nice and professional. 
22284 3 This was a great place to visit to check out all the ways to make great coffee. No Mr. Coffee machines sold here! Super knowledgeable and friendly people work here. Good coffee house right next door. 
22285 4 Perfect spot for a quick martini and a dip. Love the ambiance. One of my favorite to go shops 
22286 4 The porchetta is really good here. Sometimes during holidays they have special features but they sell out really fast 
22287 4 Best Praline Patties and chocolate delights, excellent service. Always smells of freshly made waffle cones. 
22288 4 Best pizza in East Boston!! A really welcoming place that everyone in Boston needs to try at some point. 
22289 4 Perfect date spot. Especially if you snag a space at the bar. Good food. Some menu rotations. 
22290 4 We love the food here, wine, and the service. Strip mall location is shakey, but inside is a great spot for a special date night. 
22291 2 Not as great as other Japanese restaurants in the Vancouver area. The prices are pretty reasonable. The service was dicey. On a Saturday night you'd figure it would be really busy it wasn't at all. Parking is difficult to find but it's expected for most establishments on Broadway. 
22292 2 It was alright. Nothing special. I'd order from there again but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there if there were better options immediately available. The one plus is that the delivery driver was fast and nice to deal with. So that's a bonus. 
22293 4 Best breakfast place in Columbus! Love the French toast, eggs and home fries. The Mediterranean omelet is amazing as well. The staff is very friendly and fast. Stacy is super sweet! Recommend George's Beechwold Diner to everyone 
22294 4 Wonderful spot. Great stop after a relaxing bike ride. Beer is yummy, pizza perfect & most importantly, very friendly team running the Tilikum Station. I'm from Florida so not sure when I'll be back, but a great Portland memory. 
22295 4 I recommend going during the week, late morning time. Its very peaceful, few people there. Great value at $2 for austin residents, $1 for senior citizens - great place to take parents to! 
22296 4 Fast, courteous, affordable, and friendly! 
22297 4 John is a straight shooter and found my husband and me an adorable apartment in our price range when all the other realtors I contacted said it wasn't possible. He was professional and incredibly efficient and I was happy to pay for his services. 
22298 0 Every time I have ever had food from here doesn't matter what type of food it is it makes me poop non stop. I don't know what they do to it but it's like a cleanse for your bowels. 
22299 0 I set up an appointment but when I reached there they told me to wait an hour because no one was free. This was after I called two hours before the appointment to confirm. Horrible service. 
22300 4 Completely agree with the "best falafel in Texas" reviews. 
22301 4 The best tofu soup you will ever have! It is full of depth and flavor. So delicious! Come during an off time or you will be waiting for a while. During dinner time, there is a 30-1 hour wait. My favorite place to come whenever I'm in Allston. 
22302 2 Eclipse de Luna is a Tapas bar , a fusion of Latin American, drinks from all over , name it I came here for small bites and wine down night 
22303 4 The BEST authentic Mexican restaurant in town! Soft shell, hard shell, burrito, tamale.....you name it, they got it. And it's really reasonably priced. It's on our list of rotation. 
22304 4 One of our go-to spots. Some of the best burgers you'll ever have, and truffle fries and shakes are amazing! 
22305 4 Really friendly and good work! I got my car detailed and they offer a discount for Apple employees. Even dropped me back to work and picked me up when it was ready. Definitely will be back! 
22306 4 Visited this location with a group of 10 co-workers. Great big shoutout to Melissa, a seasoned and exceptional server that went above and beyond to take care of us! Everything was delish! Try the spicy green beans and carrot cake--wow! Thank you! 
22307 3 Really tasty chicken. It's succulent, savory and yummy! The tortillas were very good, as were the accompanying sauces! 
22308 4 Spectacular small plates (try the pickled veggies for sure) and interesting cocktails sure to delight. The patio is also very dog friendly. We have visited several times with our dog, and the staff always goes out of its way to offer a warm welcome. 
22309 2 We came here late in the afternoon. There weren't too many selections left. I got the chocolate almond. It was average. Donut is great when it's fresh. So go early. 
22310 4 Great food and great vibes. Wait staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating, and the sushi chef treats everyone like family... Fish is consistently fresh and everything on the menu is worth trying. Bibimbap and ttokbokki are my favorites! 
22311 1 They didn't accept restaurant com coupons. 
22312 1 Roast Beef, Too expensive. Cheese Fries not very good and too expensive. Kelly's Roast beef in general is OK, always thought it was a little pricy though. 
22313 4 I am in love with the nitrogen cold Nutella milkshake with burnt marshmallows. I would rank it as one of the best shakes in the country. 
22314 3 I love the German atmosphere. Its a great place to go for special events and you CAN'T forget to get a cream puff! 
22315 3 This is our Tuesday night spot... It dose get busy, so service may be a bit slow. the wings, soft pretzel & beer make it worth the little wait. 
22316 4 Great service. Price quoted was exactly what I paid even when they found hidden damage underneath the bumper. Price was really reasonable! Car looks like new! Will definitely go back again if I need work done. 
22317 4 Omg the macaroons are to die for....also love their shaved ice. It's a great place to go for desserts...spacious parking not like paris baguette. 
22318 4 Wow. This place was amazing. Was just passing through Boston, and luckily found this place before an interview. I have never seen someone so meticulous as Ernie. Perfect job. 
22319 2 i wasn't too crazy for their green curry, but the spring roll was good after reading all the reviews on yelp, so i gave it a try. next time i'll try something else on their menu. i had it deliver, it was pretty quick 
22320 3 Great service, good craft beer selection. Server inadvertently dropped remainder for a to go box so she asked the kitchen to create a replacement meal from scratch. What a great customer oriented solution! Appetizer selection is nice. Great food and environment. 
22321 4 The food and service are great! Family owned and run. Very friendly even though their English is limited. Been there twice and will be back! 
22322 4 They have great cheese steak subs, but there meatball subs are the best and the world. Great food. 
22323 1 Prices just got so ridiculous. How can you charge $21 for an oxtail plate. This is my last time coming here. I'll go to Paulee's place instead. 
22324 4 I am picky about sushi. Wow this place is great. Very fresh. It is in the food court at the mall. Who would of thunk it. Go and try it. Nice surprise and good prices. 3 rolls and a salad with drink at lunch for $12. 
22325 4 Sam has courteous friendly and outgoing customer service skills and fixed my situation for me in a jif! Thank you again Sam! 
22326 3 Great food...very clean and good service...Japanese suchi very nice...Mongolian BBQ also very good...fried desserts also nice...would recommend 
22327 4 What a thrill to taste gourmet mac and cheese again after years of foregoing it on behalf of the suffering animals. This place is a treasure! 
22328 3 For the price the place was good. Clean rooms, heated pools, friendly front desk. Very close to shopping and disney 
22329 4 Date night! Loved everything I tried! Staff was friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back! Crab cake, fish Pontchartrain, steak, Tabasco cheesecake were all very tasty. 
22330 4 This place was fabulous! There was an awesome set of options and better yet EVERYTHING is fresh! The salad was incredulity, house hummus was awesome, service to great! The belly dancing entertainment - SO MUCH FUN!! 
22331 3 This was my first Irish pub. Was a good experience. There was good music. I ordered the bangers and mash and absolutely loved it. I tried the Shepard's pie and it was good. 
22332 4 Such a great place staff was awesome will be doing the rest of my a fishy business with them better fish for maybe a few cents more than Petco and those other crappy animal stores 
22333 4 Enjoyed the blackened fish on salad! Generous portions and so well seasoned and cooked! 
22334 4 Sweet is SWEET! They have decadent simple cupcakes with an american twist. The buttercream frosting is PERFECT and it goes well with the moist cake below it. Job well done!!!! 
22335 4 I wouldn't trust my honda in anyone else's hands but these guys. they are super friendly and knowledgeable and coming from a girl who doesn't know all that much about cars...they go out of their way to explain exactly what they're doing and why. 
22336 2 Meh, nothing special. Just another froyo shop. It had fun flavors and the lady working helped us decide on something good. The fresh fruit on the top made it for me - that's always a bonus. 
22337 3 The best fried rice I've ever had. The Pho was top notch too. Nice atmosphere, kind and attentive staff. Highly recommended ! Ps... Hai Ky down the street, not nearly as good, and the staff there a bunch of aloof hipsters. drive the extra few blocks and come here. 
22338 4 The best place for coffee and organic pastries. Small batch high quality. Great staff. 
22339 4 I love the shroom burger with a side of parmesean fries! 
22340 3 Hot and crispy. The sides are done right. The chicken itself is yummy. It has some spice in it already which is great because no one likes bland anything. 
22341 4 Guarantee an amazing restraint cooked with perfection 
22342 2 Pretty mediocre but very cheap; I got both what I expected and desired. 
22343 1 Went in one time for happy hour with a coupe friends and I have to say there was nothing happy about it. We ordered a couple different appetizers and they were both sub par at best. The service wasn't that fabulous either. Just an overall crumby experience. 
22344 2 Lovely site but breakfast was lacking. Slow service and very average yoghurt parfait made what should have been a great experience only worth repeating because of the great view. 
22345 3 Clean and not busy. Seemed to have a lot of stores. They're theatre has lots of space and usually not packed. A place to go watch movies and not worry if someone is sitting next to you. 
22346 4 This place is what dreams are made of. Fun, delicious donuts and a tasty staff. The donuts come in crazy flavors like maple bacon and raspberry rosemary. The staff is great and seem to have a lot of fun while they work. 
22347 3 Amazing empanadas! Menu items are all pretty much under $10. My kids like to try new things even my 6 year old loved it. 
22348 4 Awesome burgers! Backyard taste, perfectly seasoned, toppings were excellent! We also had the pork burger which was a treat as well. Fries are made to perfection and the interior and the patio are inviting. 5 stars at its best! 
22349 3 Red fucking Velvet cupcakes, people. Yum. Yum. YUM! However....at $2.50 a pop (and they are smaaaall) a wee bit over-priced, I think, but it wouldn't stop me from getting more of their delicious cupcakes. 
22350 3 They maintain my lawn and they do a very good job they are nice and friendly i appreciate there service. There price is good. Thanks a lot. Marleen Wehr 
22351 0 Very run down, smells terrible and extremely rude staff. Pay a little extra and stay somewhere better, I wish I had! 
22352 4 Service is great, fast and food very fresh. I mostly go here on weekends for Dim Sum. I love this place and have to keep myself from going both days of the weekend. If you have not been then it is a must to partake. 
22353 4 We had Matthew to show us around Harvard and he was hilarious and awesome! Loved learning the history and highly suggest taking the tour if you get the chance. 
22354 4 The food is authentic and good. Some dishes require acquire taste. I enjoy the atmosphere here. 
22355 4 No wait, awesome food, and super fast service. For Chestnut Hill, this was some pretty good Mexican food. Guac was great and tacos were great as well. The skillet tacos had the most delicious queso I've ever had and I highly recommend ordering it. 
22356 0 The nicest thing about My Cousin Vinneys is the awning. Had a stake bagel and tasteless croissant there and will never stop again. 
22357 0 Boo drive all the way down to south austin and you are closed!!! Posted hours until 2am... won't be back. 
22358 3 So delicious. But when they say spicy, they mean it! Delicious nonetheless. Ask to have your spring rolls deep fried. Decadent and amazing!!! 
22359 3 Service is great. Quick, knowledgeable and you feel like they actually have your best interests and that of your car in mind. You don't leave feeling ripped off. 
22360 3 Good food, good atmosphere. Service was a little scattered (it was slow, but maybe it was a shift change or something), but the staff was really kind. 
22361 1 Not a fan! Pizza ok but chicken parm and garlic bread were super soggy. Ok to bring kids for there $5 cheese pizza 
22362 3 Found this place on google and thought we'd give it a try. Really nice place, small space but great service and great hookah. They offered many different flavors and we're doing a special with half off of hookah. Would definitely recommend and also try their milkshakes! 
22363 4 We recently had this company install a horizontal fence and we are SO pleased with the professionalism of the whole company from the owners through the installers and any followup needed. We highly recommend this company for a great job for wooden fencing. 
22364 3 What I love about Cherrywood: * Hickory burger * Blueberry blast smoothie * Good quality house coffee * Really cool employees It's an excellent place to study, especially during the warmer months when everyone else is hanging outside. 
22365 3 Great new addition to the Andrew Square neighborhood. Coffee is good. Food is decent. Will definitely be coming back here for a cup of coffee or quick breakfast. 
22366 4 Best chocolate chip cookies in boston! The mini size is great for sharing. 
22367 3 Good "fast" food. The menu creates a cluster as far as people ordering though. I have a rule that if more than 5 people are in line @ modmarket I move on because I just don't have enough time to deal with a the indecisiveness their menu bestows upon newbies. 
22368 0 Gilt thinks they're a Las Vegas nightclub. You are not. You suck. Good day. 
22369 0 Went for Sunday brunch.....11-04-2012....Terrible wait.....food never showed up after 1hr...the French toast and bacon still weren't ready.......asked about the food and was told it would be ready shortly......20 minutes later, still no food......we left $5 on the table for the complimentary "NO-mosa" and left...... 
22370 4 These guys have the best breakfast food and the friendliest staff. The decor is quirky and fun. I love this place! 
22371 2 A few visits to Big City on my behalf, however I always knew people going there to play pool. Honestly, that place is just a hazy blur to me. 
22372 4 Just had our first visit to the place. Absolutely fantastic! Wife had Gooley and I the Buffalo. Delicious, very, very fresh. Quick- nice hot crepe, savory. Getting back in line now for desert. This is a no-brainier, highly recommend! 
22373 3 A decent Japanese restaurant that makes the effort. Food style is genuine, produce are fresh and well prepared. It's solid and very fairly priced. Service is too, from the heart. 
22374 4 Attention to detail- excellent, both in food quality and service. Unique & varied menu. Enjoyed emmensely. 
22375 2 The superstore In Everett will bump them down.. There Belgium beer selection has dwindled over the years..... No real need to go there as frequent..cept maybe a hard to fine brew, if your lucky.. Belgium beer shelves half full. 
22376 4 I have never had bad takeout from here. We have been ordering for 4 years. Our fav is chicken in black pepper sauce. 
22377 2 A glorified motel. But, it's Disney and some people want Disney at a lower price. Very basic room. Good shower pressure. No hot tub. Large pool. No poolside towels though, so tote them from your room. 
22378 0 Horrible horrible service. They made us wait for 10 min for them to clear off a table. Then they pulled a reserve sign off of a table and gave it to us. After another 10 min without even being offered a drink, it was time to leave. Never going again. 
22379 4 The FOOD was GREAT! Baked honey bbq wings were crazy good and authentic with real honey and the white pie pizza was pretty good. Dope spot, definitely a new go to. Came during the mid day of a Saturday. 
22380 1 Overpriced restaurant and poor service. The lobster bun costs $16 which is way over priced. The soda comes with half glass of big ice cubics. I know the rent could be expensive near the mall, but seven lamps is ridiculously pricy compared to other restaurants in Lenox. 
22381 0 Sign says closes at 7, however they kicked us out at 5:30. Poor customer service, yelled across the store. 
22382 4 Food was much more than I expected. Server a young girl was on point and informative. Prices were great! Food was great! Beer and wine selection great! Hidden treat inside Independence. Check em out you won't be disappointed. Grilled cheese on steroids! 
22383 4 Italian sausage omelette was incredible. Big portion with delicious home fries. Make sure you check out the bathroom! 
22384 4 Seriously great food. I had the salmon burger, and it was perfectly cooked (not overdone) and well-spiced. They had a chile sausage soup that was INCREDIBLE, also. Good selection of drinks, and nice outdoor seating. 
22385 3 Beautiful decor. Food was delicious. We ordered the chicken and cream cheese pizza and the seafood risotto. Our server was very nice and helpful. Very pleasant experience. 
22386 3 Great night hanging out with friends, price was right, and my rice bowl was just enough food to fill me up, great job BT! 
22387 2 A perfectly good neighborhood cafe. Stumptown coffee w/ free wifi, like a lot of coffee shops. The staff was friendly and the crowd was in their 40s and 50s. I'm in my 30s. In 7 years I will give this place 4 stars. 
22388 1 I was really happy with the service and ambiance but I thought the food overall was overrated. All of the seven plates of food we ordered were just "okay." I really wanted to like this place, but I probably won't go back. 
22389 4 I'm so excited that this place opened in Allston. My co-workers really like their whipped cream cake. Their cakes are moist and pretty, never too sweet. My go-to place to get cake for office birthdays. 
22390 4 Great staff...great service comfortable ambiance... I understand it's under new management....it's clear that their doing a great job.... The food is very well seasoned Fresh .....awesome portions ...i will come back...for more 
22391 4 Best shrimp & grits of my life. Delicious & refreshing cocktails & mocktails. What more could you ask for on a Sunday morning? 
22392 3 Ate here today and the food was great. Got the beef Chimichanga and was really delicious. The Guacamole was fresh and free chips and salsa were great. I wish they offered a mild salsa, but whatev. Service was good. I'll come back 
22393 1 The price has increased but the service has not...just went there today and one of the waitress looks like she steps in poo. I walked in and she just walked by me and ignored me!! What kind of service is that.. 
22394 2 Limited selection, nothing we had really seemed special enough to warrant being one of the few items on the menu. 
22395 2 Polite, friendly waitstaff and decent food. Rice was a little dry for my taste and the goat in my curry was a little fatty, but sauces and appetizer were spot-on. Very good naan also. 
22396 4 i went in for an annual eye exam. Service was timely and friendly Dr Yip was friendly and made me feel confident. He explained the entire process and suggested processes to promote healthy eyes, after the exam. I liked the experience 
22397 3 Went with the family while visiting Vancouver this weekend and enjoyed a great Chinese meal. Hot and sour soup, shrimp spring rolls, honey garlic spare ribs, shrimp and black bean sauce, lobster, chicken chow Meir and rice for all... a happy family time. 
22398 4 Just ordered a large meat lovers pizza and bread sticks. Both were really delicious. Probably the best pizza I have had around here. The employees on the phone were very courteous and so was the delivery driver. I will definitely be ordering from here again. 
22399 4 This is a great hotel. We have enjoyed our time here. Our room overlooked the commons and was very comfortable, spacious and clean. I recommend it. The bar is a great place to have drinks. It is conveniently located on the commons. 
22400 4 Looking for something unique, obscure, adventurous? Come here! If you don't know a thing about beer beyond MGD and are looking for a low-key friendly environment where you can get all your questions answered, this is your place. *Lower price for cash pmt. 
22401 3 Have been to a few japanese steakhouses before they are typically known for the atmosphere and entertainment more so than the food. Not the case here the food was great!!! I had the filet and lobster tail - both were high quality and cooked perfectly. 
22402 4 It's hard to find a good gyro with the creamy cucumber sauce. This place nailed it! Greek fries are the jam! 
22403 4 Great haircut by rodrigo ..fast no nonsense efficient and great barbering ..will definitely go back. 
22404 4 Great vegan food not only for vegan people! Everything I try was delicious, friendly Staff. Really recommend this place. 
22405 4 Great location, good food, clean and good ambience! I ordered tomato soup and masala dosa, both were sufficient in quantity. Reasonable prices. Would surely come back! :) 
22406 4 I went to the Decatur location and got a fresh cut from Geno. I will definitely be going back. If you are need of a cut go see Geno. 
22407 4 Great sushi! A place with a comfortable ambience, and first rate service from Khiet, our waiter. 
22408 4 I love this place. If I want to have a night out with my friends, I pick this place. The Juliette pear and goat cheese flatbread is something I dream about. The meatball. OMG. And make sure you get a flight or two. Crowded, but so fun. 
22409 1 My ice dream was a nightmare, there wasn't anything in the middle. The center of the cup was empty. 3 mistakes in one visit 
22410 4 Best place in portland to stay..tony..and all her staff rocks! We stay here every week and are treated so very good!!! 
22411 3 You all are sleeping on the steak and cheese. And the hushpuppies were so good i kept eating them even when i thought i couldn't eat any more. 
22412 3 Super consistent menu, everything is solid. Great Italian atmosphere, great family setting. 
22413 3 I could hardly believe how big this restaurant was. From the street, you think its a little bar that maybe serves some food. Walked in, turned a corner and boom, very nice space and restaurant with very good food and reasonable prices...will be going back...enjoy 
22414 4 Definitely the best Thai food in Vancouver. Refined, sophisticated and very original, I love Maenam, have the tasting menu. For 30 or $45 you will be blown away with the variety of flavors and amazing meals. Great staff and service, love going there! 
22415 2 The food was ok, not the best in Orlando as alot of people will say. I got more bones than meat:/ 
22416 3 I don't know what a legit NY style pizza would taste, but this is the by far the best! The flavorful sauce and the tasty crust. The toppings were generous 
22417 1 The place looked great and customer service was great as well. The French toast was horrible; tasteless, flavorless etc The eggs, sausage, and grits were nasty as well. The pictures definitely look way better than what the food taste like 
22418 3 I go here twice a month. The Monday lunch special is great. Had the Grouper last time and it was fantastic. 
22419 4 Best kabab I have ever had. I only make it to Austin once a year but always make sure to visit Kabobalicious. They need a St. Louis location pronto. 
22420 4 Excellent fried fish/shellfish. The place is a dive, but a very good, fish based dive. 
22421 0 Came here the other day and had my worst dining experience ever! Our server was awful but the management was even worse. Our food came out cold and everything took unreasonably long. I would give this place zero stars if I could. DO NOT RECOMMEND! 
22422 4 Delicious food! And amazing drinks-the avocado Margarita is an all time favorite, (even there alcohol-free avocado drinks are amazing, so far as I'm concerned)!! Just a couple miles south of downtown and a third of a mile from South Congress, Curra's is also in a great part of town! 
22423 3 Haven't tried the pizza but the salad. If you want a meal from a salad, do not get a small! Get a medium. The Chinese Chop salad was very good, but the dressing was a little spicy for me. 
22424 4 Small little place but extremely friendly staff, delicious poutine, sandwich and dips for the fries. 
22425 3 Lamb Schwarma Wrap and the Lamb Feta Fries is all you ever need in life. SOOO GOOD!!! 
22426 4 Nice, relaxing atmosphere, great food, fast service. Order was on point. 
22427 0 Terrible breakfast. everything was either overcooked or tasted like it was sitting in the food widow for 3 hours. staff was ok. I voiced my concerns to the manager and the response was, " oh thats how its supposed to be" enough said. 
22428 3 Love the wings and quick service! Drink specials and they're pretty good. They don't taste watered down or like juice. 
22429 2 Good food for the price. Decent Service. Bland atmosphere that could use polish, but still clean and pleasant. 
22430 3 Had brisket, sausage, Mac and cheese, green beans, all were good. Brisket was very good 
22431 3 There was nice weather outside so the seating by the open windows was great and the food was very good. 
22432 3 Marulilu Cafe is special. The space is tiny and self-seated. The few times I dropped in for lunch it has filled up quickly. Yet before late-comers have the opportunity to leave, someone offers to share their table! I think that's awesome. 
22433 3 Yum! The food is really great here. It is small so you should definitely make a reservation if you can. The wine list is great and not expensive. My risotto could have used a little salt but all-in-all great place! 
22434 4 Nice service. Clean. Many flavors. $0.40/oz takes credit card/American Express. 
22435 0 Absolutely will never go here again. The woman did not know what she was doing, no experience and super slow. When I told her I didn't like the paint job on my toes and I had them repainted again but refused for her to do my eyebrows. 
22436 4 Super good food gyros or fish or wings with good prices also they have s drive thru or go inside and watch tv and enjoy!!! Moroco ppl run it :) 
22437 3 Got me a chicken burrito and granted that the scoop was I guess smaller than usual, food was still bomb as hell. Glad I found this location much closer to home than going more outer area. 
22438 4 One of my favorite places to go whenever I have to be on my computer all day. Great coffee, people, and lighting. Lots of huge windows so when I have to read or do work, it's easy on my eyes. Love the design and intent behind this community! 
22439 2 Slow, slow and slower on service. love their food. The titantic roll is awesome. Service has to improve 
22440 3 Some of the best sandwiches in Columbus. Great place to sit outside on a nice day. Sandwiches are a little pricey but they are so good that I never seem to mind! Definitely recommend! 
22441 3 Really great veggie burger and Eggs Benedict Florentine. 
22442 3 Great food. I absolutely adore the salad bar. I knocked off a star because the past two times I've come, the chicken noodle soup was watery and tasteless. Be weary of coming on Sunday afternoons, though: this place gets PACKED. 
22443 4 Hella goood wings. Best in the city. Both locations are consistent every time. The homemade ranch kills it. Service is good. Even take out holds good til you get home. Thanks Tom. Oh and the pizza.... cheeseburger whaaaaaat? 
22444 4 I had a great experience with Austex Sprinklers. Roland kept me informed about his arrival time and did a thorough inspection. He was also able to program my system to run efficiently and ensure full coverage of our lawn. I'll definitely use them again for help with our sprinkler system. 
22445 3 This place is so much fun! Bottle service is on point and they love having girls so if you have a big group of girls then it's perfect you'll get free drinks and bottles of champagne. The dj was my favorite part. 
22446 4 Small place, but well decorated and clean! The space has been well thought-through, so it feels more cozy then cramped. I ordered a cappuccino and honestly, well done Spella! It was rich and flavorful, and I really liked the dense structure of the foam on top. I enjoyed every sip! 
22447 4 This car washer it's amazing! At Palms they do an excellent job for a fair price,the staff is nice and helpful,they really make sure that you leave satisfied. I recommend it 100%. 
22448 3 I ally get the grouper sand who with chipotle mayo and I have it grilled and blackened. Both are delicious. 
22449 4 I've only been to the airport locations and these are seriously some of the best doughnut flavors we have ever tasted!! My husband had us run to our gate just to make sure we stopped at Blue Star before going through security. They are worth possibly missing your flight :) 
22450 4 If you want old fashioned customer service this is your place! From the girls in front to the staff out back. Your investment in tile and countertops are in great hands. 
22451 4 Exceeded expectations and looking forward to coming back! I had such an amazing, unique green curry with scallops dish and my dining partners all loved their entrees. Looks like they have a great happy hour too. Can't wait to try it. 
22452 4 Best donuts in Portland. The consistency and flavor is great. They are very moist and not dry. 
22453 4 Excellent service!!! Ask for Kyle, he's super helpful and a pleasure to work with. Fast and efficient, he helped me reduce and consolidate my shipment to save some bucks! Awesome! 
22454 3 Though a chain, it was a very pleasant place to have lunch. Nice views, cozy atmosphere, and affordable lunch specials. Reasonable portions - my fish was good. 
22455 3 Great wing specials on Tuesday evenings! Pound of wings and a pint for $5! Get the habanero wings! 
22456 3 Finally popped into NICHE, and what a wise decision on my part. A fantastic, quiet spot -- packed to the gills with vivid, sweeping art. The proprietor was a joy to chat with. Quite fortunate NICHE is tucked away in my neighborhood; definitely plan to return. 
22457 3 They had the best shepherd/cottage pie I've ever had. The potatoes were fluffy and the meat wasn't over seasoned. Perfect. I had some steamed veggies with it and it was perfectly steamed. With a nice Bass it was a the perfect Irish dinner. 
22458 2 There was no cream in the Portland cream! I don't understand. And the homer was square... not round and the voodoo doll looked whack..... quality control is snoozing. But donuts.... so yum. 
22459 3 Good environment, cozy place with nice service, I like their cocktails, relaxed and enjoyed the time there... will come back again... 
22460 4 Went with a larger group of non Chinese people. We were treated well and the food was outstanding! Will defiantly visit again. 
22461 4 Y'all....these doughnuts! I happened to walk by on my way to a thrift shop. They were about to close so I hurried and ordered. The clerk gave me to bonus donuts- a maple and a blueberry. We cut each of the donuts up and shared them. Pure heaven! 
22462 4 I love the coop!!!!! Haven't had a bad meal and experience. They recently started offering breakfast everyday until 2pm and me and my friends find ourselves skipping the yummy but pricey briarpatch, and head here instead!!! 
22463 4 The food! The atmosphere! The wine! All good. Husband had the cheeseburger. I tasted, and had to concur with his enthusiasm at every bite! I had tge lobster roll and WOW!!! We enjoyed talking to people as we sat by the firepit!! This is definitely one of our favorites now! 
22464 4 Delicious and very friendly owners! At the recommendation of my waitress, I had one of their specials - layered three cheese quesadilla with steak (can't remember the name of it), and it truly was one of the best things I've ever eaten. I'm not exaggerating! 
22465 3 Good food, went with my Eritrea friends and family and I was very pleased. Will go by my self whenever I need to. Fantastic experience. GREAT COFFEE too!!!! 
22466 4 I love this salon! It's convenient, the people are friendly and laid back, and David always makes my hair look great. I started coming here a few years ago at the suggestion of a friend, and now I won't go anywhere else! 
22467 3 My food was delicious ( I ordered buffalo chicken nachos as a meal) and the beer selection was good. There were a few things listed that were out but the two guys behind the bar were friendly and knowledgable so the trip was worth the 4 stars! 
22468 4 I love coming here! So many beautiful treasures and so much fun to look through all the little drawers to find them. I find all the supplies I need here too and I appreciate the staff's helpful assistance whenever I need advice on how to do something. 
22469 4 I really appreciate everything about this establishment. The food is wonderful, on par with some very high end places in Boston. The service is warm and welcoming. I highly recommend eating here. 
22470 0 Went there this morning expecting good things. Terrible under-cooked food(twice we sent it back) not a good experience. We ordered Ham and got some space age meat like substance. Never again. 
22471 0 Brought friends from UK, sang sweet Caroline not loud. It was 7 pm told to quiet down 54 years old. Ridiculous. Never would go there again. Smug not snug! 
22472 4 Excellent food...expected it to be a little greasy because you know...it's a donut. But it wasn't. Everything was delicious. 
22473 3 Food is awesome but the service poor. 
22474 4 I was there before open, the postmaster was happy to see me and helped me with everything I needed. I have had very bed experiences at many postal services and this by far has been the smoothest and best. I will be sending everything from this location from now on! 
22475 3 Delicious! Seafood lovers will be glad they stopped in. Had to order before I sat down, so I felt a little rushed. Other then that, everything was great! 
22476 4 Nice and friendly staff. Would recommend to anyone looking for a dentist in the North Shore 
22477 4 Delicious donuts. Lots of different flavors, and the guy that worked there seemed really excited about his job (I mean, who wouldn't be??). I would have to rate them above voodoo for their flavors. And we didn't have to wait in line. 
22478 1 Quality dropped... noodles are not as great... kisurage chicken is tasteless ... servive is ok but compare to other ramen shop...its i expect better... 
22479 3 Good seafood (loved the rock shrimp!), clean casual atmosphere, friendly staff. 
22480 0 They are always closed. Weekends, weekdays, afternoon, evening, late night, does not matter. They are just never open. This is the most understaffed restaurant I have ever seen. I honestly have no idea why they haven't just closed it down already. 
22481 1 The space, drinks, and service were great. The food on the other hand was TERRIBLE. INEDIBLE. TASTELESS. And for $23 and $26 entrees, it was absurd. If you do need to eat, stick to the burgers and poutine. But again, poutine was tasteless and I've had much better elsewhere. 
22482 2 Decent chain restaurant BBQ. Not the best in town but at least its consistent. 
22483 3 Been there twice. Best chicken gyros I've ever had. Best Octopus I've ever had. Best price for both. Large portions. Believe what you read in these reviews. Gastro Mania knows what he's doing. 
22484 0 Never answer their damn phone? Y'all close at 5 right? Worst automated phone system. Not helpful whatsoever. 
22485 3 Joined a friend for lunch here. I was happy to know that they had options for vegetarians. The food was so beautiful and flavorful. The portions were just right. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Price is good for special occasions. I'll be back! 
22486 4 The food here is fabulous. It's so hard to find good restaurants in this area. Hopefully this one sticks around. The hummus, beef gyro, tabbouleh, and chicken shish kabobs are great. Everything is made fresh daily and the owners are sweethearts. This is one place that I hope sticks around. 
22487 3 Great food, fast service a winning combination for a quick lunch visit. 
22488 2 Good for quick bite if you're craving for a rice bowl. Nothing special. Pricing is okay for what you get. Service is decent. 
22489 4 Hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten! The employees are very friendly and the service is great. 
22490 3 Blankets, free popcorn and free hot butter if you desire. I pick the margarita of the month, bc they are always excellent! 
22491 4 Awesome hotel close to campus. Clean and modern with terrific breakfast. Jake the manager runs a terrific operation. Job well done. Can't wait to return again in August 
22492 4 The staff is so friendly and helpful here, I never knew how cool this place was. I will go back for gifts and maybe a little something for myself:) 
22493 3 YUMMY. Great patio, kid friendly, full bar and awesome pizza. My only complaint is the price, but I will keep going back! 
22494 2 Great rates and nice vehicle. Only issue was the shuttle driver and his terribly scary driving. Ran one red light, took corners like we were in the Grand Prix. Not a comfortable ride. 
22495 4 I was recommended to this place by a coworker 2 years ago and have been here 4 times since! It hasn't let me down, great food, service, atmosphere, location, and a perfect selection of beer!! I love this place!! 
22496 4 I tried their morning energy juice today and it's DELICIOUS! To me, it's a little sweeter than the Liver Cleanse (still my favorite) but just as good. I am going to go back to try their other juices if I can't resist their delicious Liver Cleanse! 
22497 0 Pharmacy is terrible. I have had an issue the last 6 times in a row going here. They are not helpful and half of the time it has resulted in me not getting my prescription or having to go back several times to get it straight. 
22498 4 Kristy Costanzo is absolutely amazing!! She fixed my hair and is now my new hair stylist. I highly recommend her for any hair needs you may have! My hair has never looked so good! 
22499 4 This week was my first time at Corazon. My drink, appetizer, and entree were all excellent, as was the service. I've rarely rated Austin restaurants five stars, but this was a very nice experience. 
22500 3 Agree with Pete G. on all fronts. Great drinks. Cool environment. Tends to be a good crowd. Because of the small space, often gets too crowded. I miss when they served food a few years ago : ( 
22501 4 Supremely knowledgeable about his craft, sartorially inclined, always friendly, and always does impeccable work. Definitely one of the finer tailors in Vancouver, and I would highly recommend this place to anyone. 
22502 0 Enjoyed the theme and personality of this business. Unfortunately, I found the chili inedible. 
22503 4 888 has an excellent selection of food, from pho soups, to clay pots to curries. There service is good, it's always lively and the prices are reasonable. 
22504 4 Fizz factor five! These tasty sodas have lots of "pop" and I like that! So much better than than the big boys! The apple soda is great, but the standard cola is breathakingly delicious. I love supporting local business too! 
22505 4 My girlfriend and I had our first date night together after moving up to Portland. We had a great time, the service was great, the margaritas were on point, and the food was good. Would gladly go back 
22506 3 I will 100% be back... Love the idea of the food truck outside. The selection of beer and wine was outstanding and the style of the whole place is perfect. If I could say anything to improve, get some air conditioning... But on the scale this was low... Great time 
22507 4 A fun, interactive dinner for all to have. Ask for some instruction if it is your first time, but don't let it deter you. Barry the manager is hilarious and very friendly. Clean restaurant, and it's BYOB. 
22508 2 Pricey and uppity but food is yummy and the happy hour food prices are very reasonable. Drinks were were good enough. 
22509 1 Blah food, dirty tables, please show a little hustle. I wanted to like this place because it's close to my house. On to the next spot. 
22510 2 The place was nice, clean, and comfortable. I have to give this place a 3/5 because the food was alright. I feel like I could just make the hot soup at home. The food was okay and wasn't worth the hype. 
22511 4 Love POUR! Great services from bartenders and staff. Sat at the bar and tasted some really great wines, for a good price. Also thoroughly enjoyed the bar snacks/food. Highly recommend whether you're looking for a quick night cap, or a nice environment to celebrate a special occasion. 
22512 4 These donuts are flawless. They might be my favorite on earth. 
22513 4 I Was in Needham for a business meeting. Stopped in for the lunch buffet at Masala Art today and was pleasantly surprised. Great variety and price. The food was excellent. Love the Chicken Tikka Masala! I would recommend their lunch buffet any day. 
22514 4 Relaxed atmosphere with fresh tasting thin crust pizza made right in front of you. Both kids enjoyed it & the serving staff was pleasant. 
22515 4 Undoubtedly the BEST airport transfer shuttle I've used ever, anywhere! Prompt , courteous, excellent service ! Hawar , the person who drove us, was very pleasant. We used this service for our ride back from PDX in snowy Dec. Would recommend this business anytime. 
22516 0 I got the khao soi and chicken pad thai. You can't even call this thai food. It tastes like something you heat up from a box. I'm from Seattle and I have yet to find a thai restaurant with real thai food down here in Portland. 
22517 4 This place has the best selection of Indian food in the Denver area. Tons of dishes you won't get anywhere else in addition to the usual standards, all prepared very well. The dosas are really interesting, as is some of the other street style food. Highly recommended. 
22518 4 Wow. So much fun! Our jet boat driver, Thomas, gave us an awesome adventure filled with laughter, speed, 360 turns and interesting tid bits about Portland. Highly recommend this excursion! 
22519 2 Good standby. Reasonable happy hour. A little tired and the food is not up to Portland foodie standards, but a fun place for a little Portland swank. 
22520 3 Gotta say, I'm loving this place. Ordered from here twice and it was spot on both times. We ordered a ton of stuff both times, but the crab rangoon and brisket pho really stood out. Well done! 
22521 3 Friendliest group of ladies ever! It's the nice staff that keep me going back. The Brazilian wax is painless and thorough. The mani/pedis could use some improvement so I only ever go there for waxes. 
22522 4 Best steaks tip I've ever had.......if you come to Boston you have to try this place!!!!! 
22523 0 Please note if you are Tibetan and are planning to travel to Tibet/China, do not make any plans to go there before July 15, 2015. I heard that Tibetans are not allowed into Tibet before that date. The visa office will not tell you this information. 
22524 4 What can I say. Authentic Mexican food. Everything is good. The guacamole and homemade chips are to die for. But #1 is the owner Gabriel. He's special. Definitely check them out. 
22525 3 Delicious restaurants - beats North End. Love sitting at bar and having Short Rib Papperdelle. Dining area is a bit awkward (tables ontop of eachother), but always bustling. LOVE this restaurant. 
22526 4 Totally worth the type! On a road trip through PNW and had to stop here. Rosemary Raspberry buttermilk donut is truly unique and delicious! Coffee is great too! 
22527 4 Best pho in Vancouver! We love the soft shell crab, chicken satay and the calamari. We always eat out in portland, so it was nice to find something closer to home so we didn't have to drive so far for good pho. 
22528 4 Amazing BBQ! Ate there 2 times during my week stay in Austin and will definitely return when I make my way back to Austin. 
22529 4 YUM! Huge variety of delicious dishes. Superstar service. Can't wait to eat here again. 
22530 1 Nails are okay. Not very thorough, I wouldn't come back. And crew is not very friendly. I can see the difference between the first coat and second coat, which I'm not very fond of. The decorations are nice though. 
22531 4 Just moved here looking for a new eyebrow lady and gave this salon a try since it was close to my house. Super quick in and out and she did my arches perfect!! Better than my original girl in Cali! So glad I found her! 
22532 2 The food is good. The Bianca and Hawaiian both have some fairly spicy sauce. Meatballs taste like Spaghetti O's. Soda fountain is pretty cool with all the flavor combos. Biggest issue is I was kind of surprised at the cost. 
22533 4 Fabulous donuts.So good I had 2! Clean fast and a delight.I tried the powdered donut with lemon, Meyer lemon custard filling it was so good, I hopped off my stool and ordered another 
22534 1 Bad food. Indifferent service. Overpriced. Only upside is that they have Big 10 Network on their TVs. This place could be great if they just put a little effort into it. 
22535 4 This auto repair shop is by far the most accommodating auto shop in the area. They are super friendly and you don't feel like you're getting ripped off. Would highly recommend!!! 
22536 4 really yummy potato and chili burrito, great yummy chips and salsa...love eating here, really nice service too 
22537 4 Freshness, quality, sues smile at the right price. That's what keeps me coming back. Can't find cold cuts like that anywhere else in town. Love ya sue! Great mozz sticks too. 
22538 4 Things are fresh and good here. The menu is a checklist and the wines are admirable. 
22539 4 Love their fresh salad and yummy soft bread. We have eaten there twice and both times it was quite good. 
22540 0 Terrible terrible service. Food was not that great either. Wings were mediocre even though they were supposed to be the best thing there. Took forever to flag our server down. I wouldn't return. 
22541 4 Great location! With in store seating and on the corner of a park or on the docks. Amazing smoothie selection and delicious frozen coffee! Friendly staff. Dog treat available! 
22542 4 This is my favourite brewery! They have such delicious, unique and flavourful beers. I also love the arcade games they set up!! Always fun! 
22543 1 Too much dressing on the salad, and too much bland sauce on the fettuccine alfredo. Everything was drowning. I will give it a few stars for service and price, though. 
22544 0 I end up getting blonde hair from them and when I tell you it's HORRIBLE it's horrible !! Please don't waste your money, I spend 271 dollars on some hair to shed like crazy and tangle up ever time you move !!! I will never give them money 
22545 0 There need to be some mass firings at this location. I waited 30 minutes for fast food, there were at least 5 patrons in line ahead of me and a line stretching around the building for the drive-thru. Totally incompetent!! Don't attempt to eat here even during non-busy hours! 
22546 1 Came to this restaurant tonight with a friend. Deco and service is good. Dragon roll is pretty good. Tempura is ok. Lamb is fine. But the terriyaki beef sucks. Whoever made that dish should be fired. 
22547 4 They did the best job ever on our wedding cake and cupcakes!!! They were beyond willing to work with us on every little detail. We even had them make wiener dog bride and groom cookies for wedding favors. Everything tasted spectacular and looked fantastic! 
22548 3 They are crazy fast! My coffee was being handed to me even before I could get my wallet back in my purse!! 
22549 2 Food was good. Service was very slow to nonexistent. Waitresses were hanging out talking at the service station. No one on the floor. 
22550 4 Favorite restaurant in the world! Service is excellent. I recommend going with the chef's choice. Never disappointing. Desserts are particularly delicious! 
22551 3 Service was very good. Vi represented public storage in a very professional manner. Very pleased with the whole encounter. 
22552 3 About to grub down with some Grub Quite crowded for a Friday night but everyone is just enjoying their food. 
22553 3 Island burger was fantastic! BBQ+teriyaki=ZOMG Shake, not so much. Fluffy, crispy fries--a little dreamy. Came via entertainment book, will def be back for tasty burger and fries. 
22554 4 Jon and his crew do an amazing job. I could rave for paragraph's about the work they do; but really the shine on my car speaks volumes. 
22555 1 There's no way you can be a genuine Jewish deli if you don't serve any beef brisket at all. Did they just forget? 
22556 4 Love this place. Open late and food is always real good. Best customer service in Austin! 
22557 4 OH LORD THIS IS AMAZING. There are pickles in the falafel wrap and oh what a combination. Definitely the best falafel in austin. nobody even comes close and I loved Moaz! (vegan and vegetarian food truck) 
22558 3 There's only one good reason to go here: Scorpion Bowl. Imagine a 50 ounce mixed drink (big enough for 3-5) for just $18!!! Iced margarita that tastes like Kool Aid. It's always time for boat races. 
22559 2 This pizza was good but the crust was not.. they need to cook the crust for another 5 minutes.I would go here for lunch over dinner. Area four around the corner is way better. 
22560 4 Always a line and now I know why! Visiting from Hawaii we don't get this type of food at all. Everything was savory and tasty. Honestly this place made the most impact on my taste buds during my vacation. As they say, eat where the locals eat! 
22561 4 They have poutine now! It's easily the best poutine I've had outside of Quebec. 
22562 4 Honestly 10/10. The decor could be a little better but who cares when the food is so good. 
22563 4 Definitely spend the extra to upgrade your French fries to poutine. It's busy, but if you manage to get a seat, you'll enjoy it. 
22564 0 Skip it! Skip it! Skip it! Olive Garden is better and cheaper. Sorry for anyone that likes Sysco pasta from the Olive Garden 
22565 0 I ordered to go and was told that it would take 10-15 mins. I waited for almost 45 mins and plus staff was very disrespectful. 
22566 4 Woah! Bewildered, blood sugar dropping, bad weather setting in, I took solace at this cart - fabulous vegetarian falafel, perfect french fries! 
22567 0 Don't bother making reservations here since they don't really honor it anyways. It's first come first serve even though a reservation is made. We waited for about an hour even with a reservation... Other than that, the food is alright. 
22568 4 Went here for lunch today. Really good! Like the first reviewer the burger was a little on the too pink side but edible. We walked in for take out and it was ready in 8-10 minutes. Everything else was great. Will absolutely be going back! 
22569 4 Followed my hair dresser April (who is awesome) here and have tried a pedicure and massage both which were pretty darn good. 
22570 4 Absolutely recommend these guys. Purchased an IWC from them...seamless from start to finish. Quick and reasonably priced shipping, and great prices on watches. 
22571 3 I'm really into pressed beet juice right now because of all the competitions and training that I'm doing. Whole foods has been a reliable place for me to get it while I'm travelling all over the US. I just wish they'd start stocking the Blueprint beet juice. 
22572 4 I love Crate Escape! My half Australian half Cocker Spaniel goes a few times a week and has a great time. The staff is great and I think they're a really good value for the service they provide. 
22573 4 Best Donuts around! hands down,better than Linda's donuts in Belmont or Kanes donuts in Saugus.I've tried them all and Anna's is most definitely my favorite,a great donut light enough to indulge in without sacrificing taste or give you that bloated oily donut hangover. 
22574 4 Great service! 5star. Major had my tire repaired asap! Super customer service! I will be back here when I purchase new tires. 
22575 4 The best steaks in Atlanta. The Lobster Mac n cheese is the best I've ever had. Worth every dollar. The atmosphere is cozy & laid back. No rush to dine or order. Cocktails were great also. 
22576 1 Meh...Ceasar was weird,pizza OK, frozen custard good. Not a place I'm inclined to go again. 
22577 3 Japanese American Ramen. Next by the Japanese supermarket.Easy parking. Ramen is tastey. Very good service ‼‼ love this place. 
22578 4 That Venezuelan burger is delicious and huge. When I saw 5 star reviews for a small burger joint I was dubious but they weren't wrong. Check this place out. It's a little pricy for a burger place but after you take your first bite you will realize it's worth it. 
22579 2 MAX trains on one side, buses on a loop in the center, WES train on the other side. Easy to navigate, thats all I look for in a Transit Center...well, that and not getting robbed, thats a plus too :) 
22580 4 Mike is always quick to respond and attentive. I highly recommend AC Electric! 
22581 4 It was delicious. The pizza was really good and the service was really fast. The meat sauce was also really good. The sauce had pulled beef instead of ground. I would definitely recommend Bambolina Restaurant. 
22582 3 I'm always hankering for some legit Italian food, and my two friends took me here for a pre-graduation dinner. Service was great, food was even better. The place is small, but it's a family-run restaurant and I ended up bringing my parents here. 
22583 2 Food is ok Parking is tough Staff is ok Inside is dark and small You're not missing anything here 
22584 4 Loved this place after first visit. Low key, no frills, fresh food and great coffee. Not a lot of space, but who cares? Take it to-go if there's no seating available and walk outside! ;) 
22585 0 Never have ice cream. Huge ad campaign for dipped cones and yet the ice cream and shake machine are repeatedly out of service. Why bother coming here if you can't get everything you want? 
22586 4 So glad TVG recommended this place for my Volvo when I was rear ended 6 weeks ago. They hooked me up with rental service so I could drop my car off to start the repairs. Communication is great! Now my only nightmare is the other insurance company. 
22587 3 Food's nothing to rave about. The place rocks because of their cocktails, bartenders, and neigborhood-vibe! I recommend sitting at the bar and asking for the full cocktail menu. Lots of friendly patrons with an overall ambiance that is great for havin a drink solo or with a friend! 
22588 4 I LOVED this service. Loved loved loved loved it. Great value, super nice guy, super professional service, and my house was sparkling! I will absolutely use them again and refer them to anyone looking for a great, trustworthy, cleaning service. 
22589 3 Always enjoy this Mexican Restaurant. It is a sleeper for Sarurday or Sunday morning breakfast. The sauce is delicious and the migas are great. Once again it is one or those excellent local stops located in a no frills strip center next to Big Lots 
22590 4 I've never been disappointed her. The pastry are delicious and the sandwiches are really good. The service is great and always super friendly. The outside seating area has been great during this hot summer we have. I always come here when I come to clackamas mall. 
22591 4 Yesterday I had the pleasure of working with Diane LaGrippo, design consultant with 3-day blinds. I needed window treatments for my new salon in Georgetown. She was very knowledgeable, thorough, and had great ideas. The process was very easy. Very good experience. 
22592 4 Didn't know what to expect going in but theming was really well executed and the bartenders were personable and excellent. Total unexpected gem! 
22593 0 Good luck getting your tires checked. 3rd time this week. 1st time insufficient air put in. 2nd nobody helped me after 25 minutes. Today.....25 min and counting 
22594 4 I love Tomorrowland. There are lot of cool things to do a ride on like, Space Mountain, Peoplemover, and Buzz Lightyear and other ones. If you are at the Magic Kingdom, you definitely need to visit Tomorrowland. 
22595 4 there is no finer. when i die, i want my ashes scattered in the "true crime" section. 
22596 3 I shared the Casablanca with 2 strangers I had just met at Barkitecture and I would definitely do it again. Roasted Garlic Sauce, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Mushrooms, Artichoke Hearts and Parmesan are my new Best Friends! 
22597 4 Always so yummy! Still need to try more flavors. The staff has always been super friendly and helpful. They have always went out of their way to make my experience great. 
22598 0 Worse Starbucks ever! Logistically poor placement with awful exit and entry. Always a line out into Ashford Dunwoody Rd. Needs to be closed!!!! 
22599 3 So delicious! The deviled eggs are great, but the tacos really steal the show. Didn't try any large plates this trip since we wanted to make our meal more like tapas. We can't wait to go back and try even more! 
22600 0 Very cool spot, very horrible door staff. There's better bars literally one block away. Save yourself the headache and skip the prentension. 
22601 4 Yum. Chicken burger. Fry sampler. Turtle milkshake. Wonderful service. Just perfect. Thank you Flip 
22602 4 Nice casual atmosphere and pretty good size so there is never a wait. Excellent food, excellent service, excellent margarita's! Need I say more. 
22603 4 Tried their buffalo chick pita today with a side of fries. The pita was meaty and the sauce was delicious. Fries were hot and fresh. Excited for them to show up at our office again. 
22604 4 First time trying this place and it was worth the 40 plus minute wait. I will be coming here every chance I get when I'm in Austin. 
22605 3 Tried this place for the second time and I'm not mad that I did. I always fall in love with the patio in the back. The Baja & cauliflower tacos were good! Loved the guac too. It's a bit spicy, so be aware. 
22606 4 Love Melissa! The staff is always so friendly, the place is stylish and Melissa gives a great haircut. Definitely recommend the place! 
22607 0 Understaffed, food is slow af, nothing is clean in this restaurant, and worst out of all I had little pieces of rocks in my dumplings... will never come again 
22608 4 Great salad and pizza. Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere. Looking forward to returning. 
22609 4 Yogasakti offers a great variety of classes not just yoga, love the TRX and barre classes 
22610 0 Staff is so rude. Spilt a drop of beer and the waitress screams "are you kidding me!!!!! R u gunna clean It up??????" NEVER coming here again. Ever. (Brunette waitress working on 11/18 btw. PS some girl just fell to the floor and got no baCK SASS. MINDBLOWN. DONE 
22611 0 gotta love hearing pharmacy associates loudly and boisterously making fun of people who have to take medication and mentally handicapped people or, in their words "retards." saying things like "i take medications to make myself more retarded!" and such. if i could give this 0 stars i would. 
22612 3 Delicious! Usually my husband and I can agree that one of us had the better meal. First time in a long time that we each thought we got the best dish. I had the black cod. Cooked to perfection but more interesting was the pairing of pork belly and mussels 
22613 4 This restaurant is top notch all the way. What a beautiful interior design and the service was awesome. Our lunch selections were delicious from the appetizer spreads to the white bean salad with grilled Shrimp on top. We will be back. 
22614 2 the staff make this place. love them all. also love the bacon! and the egg and chive and cream cheese scramble! 
22615 3 Delicious Filipino baked goods! Pretty sure this is the best siopao in the city. The suman and pandasal is also awesome. 
22616 3 Modmarket is a go-to place for us when going out for good, fresh, gluten-free food. Love that they are local and organic. I highly recommend the pizza and salads. 
22617 4 Babica Hen has the best brunch in the Lake Oswego area, hands down. The service is friendly and quick, the menu is unique + full of delish options. Such a huge step up from the myriad of family restaurants in the area dishing out truck stop slop! 
22618 3 Has great food. Lots of tv's and plays every sport and no cover for UFC fights. Only drag is that the close extremely early. 
22619 4 I love the Burren. why? well - good food, excellent beer selection, and really, really great live music. If you want to hang out in a chill environment w/ good people - this is the place. 
22620 3 Really, really yummy. Great spring rolls. Great noodle dishes. I can't wait to try the soup next time. Almost the best Thai in Austin! 
22621 3 Not my favorite Starbucks around but the new Clover machine earns this spot an extra star. I really like being able to try different coffees with the Clover instead of having to pick between either the Pikes or the bold pick of the day. 
22622 4 I would definitely stay here again. Very quiet and clean. Love listening to the chickens every morning. Awesome breakfast! 
22623 4 This place is uh-amazing! The couple is great company and even better food! The tabouli is to die-for.....definitely will never eat Mediterranean any where else 
22624 2 appetizers were better than the actual entree, especially for their price! would recommend the jalepeno corn poppers. that was our favorite. our waitress wasn't so friendly, she actually threw one of our appetizers at us. chicken was real dry and ribs aren't flavorful. it was tender.... but eh.. 
22625 4 Excellent food. The service was great too. Justin our server was very friendly and made our experience so pleasant. We love you guys. 
22626 4 Delicious food, perfect wine, impeccable service, and a quiet adult atmosphere....just what the Dr. ordered for a much needed date night. I know that we will go back to this place again and again. 
22627 4 Amazing Xi'an noodles that are better than the ones I got in Xi'an. Very reasonably priced, too. I envy those who work nearby. 
22628 4 Stopped in before my shift! This was super fast & so delicious, exactly what I needed before a long night at work! Highly recommend the wings & the must is great. 
22629 4 I think this is the best fried chicken I have ever had. We ordered 12 thighs and ate all of it! I love this place!! 
22630 3 love rosebud! The best place to go on the weekend for brunch~~food is great and the portion is so large that I have to take half of them home! 
22631 3 I have to say the burger was very tasty and cooked properly. The fries were basic. A tad pricey and the ambiance was ok. 
22632 4 To be 'mall food' this is excellent fare. Hummus app, quesadilla app and Cali Club pizza were all fresh and so amazing. Quick service and nicely plated. Will definitely be back! 
22633 4 The absolute BEST restaurant we have been to on Disney property so far. Amazing service everytime and the food is out of this world! The teriyaki chicken, the shrimp and scallop pasta, the honey chicken, and their specialty drinks like the wild berry daiquiri and strawberry daiquiri are crazy good! 
22634 2 Bad service, good mixed drinks, poor uninspiring selection. Food seems OK. If you have no time to spare, do not come here, service is very slow. 
22635 4 Dear Mr. Pink, I'm sorry to write this to you in a letter, but we're through. Mr. Myagi and I are getting married... xoxo Very cool Torchy's. Love the decor and open feeling. Best queso. EVER. 
22636 3 Grilled Cheese Monday tied in with happy hour means a long wait! None the less it is so worth it. Grab one of the tons of variety of beer or liquor they have available and you can't go wrong. 
22637 4 Wonder wonderful wonderful parade!!!!!!! It's a good length & the characters interact with you in the crowd! You'll definitely see every character in this parade. & of course it's a Christmas parade (I love Christmas), so it's very festive, which I love! 
22638 4 This by far is my favorite Mexican restaurant.The food is fantastic,service is 5 star,everything about this place is great.So if you are looking for good food,great service and super friendly people check this place out you will not be disappointed. 
22639 3 I love your buns. They're so light and fluffy, chewy and just a little bit sweet. I only wish you could relocate so that I can have buns EVERY DAY. 
22640 0 Plenty of better places on 6th street to go. Douchebag door guy are standard in a lot of places, but these guys take the cake. I recommend you go somewhere else. 
22641 3 Brunch was good, the dinner even better - with decent wine offerings and flavorful dishes prepared by what appears to be a competent and caring chef. Cozy setting, as well. When next in Boston I will return. 
22642 4 OMG so divine! But also the two young men serving were just beyond helpful, friendly! We shared a couple. Don loved the Blueberry Bourbon Basil...me the Creme Brulee!. Can you say sugar high????? Woohoo!!! 
22643 0 Terrible terrible service. The server didn't even glance at us. I ordered a salad (don't judge me) and they should probably name it lettuce instead.. Very disappointing! 
22644 4 Love this place! New discovery......strayed from the usual suspects to......steak and cheese omelet. SO good. 
22645 0 NO! I hate this place and the parking and the loudness and the plastic cups and the decor or lack therof. It reminds me of a crappy Harper's Ferry. 
22646 4 The table was graced with pink petals when we arrived there. The view of Harber made a day special. The passion fruit flavor tea was good for girls although I like white and black tea usually. Great service and great afternoon tea worthy trying. 
22647 4 Ive never been a big greek fan, but this place gets my approval. Came here once with coworkers, and then brought my family today. Their gyros and chicken gyros are delicious! If you like greek, i am positive that you wont be disappointed. 
22648 3 Good a$$ black and bleu burger! Side of fried okra (whole pieces) was an added bonus. I will say....while waiting for my food at the bar, I heard ay least 2 parties of differnet sizes complain about the slow service 
22649 0 Awful..cheeseburgers probably the worst I've ever had! Chicken sandwiches not much better! Make another choice!! 
22650 4 Let me start with the Irish Coffee... deliciousness!!! Holly lets the Jameson pour A must try the Shakshuka, especially on cold weather. Meriah was great with everything. Baileys French toast was amazing & so were the homestyle fries! 
22651 3 Good food served fast. The employees are friendly too. Lunch time is busy, so try and get there before 1130. 
22652 4 Most pizza joints are just so-so, but the sauce on Milano's pizza blows all the others out of the water. We first discovered it when dipping pepperoni pizza rolls into it. The pizza rolls are the best in town! 
22653 4 Really enjoy this place! I was a Catacombs fan since my college days in the 80's, and I love the new changes. The bartenders are wonderful and make some of the best drink creations in Boulder, and the food is excellent. Live music too. My favorite Saturday night hangout! 
22654 4 This place never disappoints. We have come here for date night and with small children and teenager. It makes everyone happy and is small enough that you feel comfortable and at home. The flavors are amazing and variety does not disappoint. 
22655 4 Orange juice was fresh and delicious, The staff was very courteous. It was down a quiet street but stil close to the commons. Good spanish music was on the radio and the people there also spoke Spanish. Perfect place for breakfast. 
22656 2 Disappointing. I've read about their burgers and was anxious to try. The burger was adequate and the fries were limp. Sorry to say I agree with others that they're over priced. Won't be back. 
22657 4 May I begin by saying what a fine establishment this is! The sandwiches are unmatched anywhere in Austin. The atmosphere is so relaxing and a true Austin establishment. Definitely one of my favorite places to grab a bite. 
22658 4 I have come here once almost every weekend for the last 4 years for soup for breakfast. Why do I keep coming here? Because even with a variety of 2 soups per day it is so good it never gets old. I wake up wanting the Vietnamese coffee, too. 
22659 3 Sadly, Buddha's Delight is now closed. It has been converted into My Thai Cafe Vegetarian, which also has a location in Brookline. (Actually, the Brookline location was originally Buddha's Delight also.) My Thai is pretty good, though their service is atrocious. 
22660 4 Tacos are the real deal empanadas are the bomb stuffed potatoes with meat and cheese chicken tamales are good as well make sure they're fresh make sure everything's fresh and you will be alright 
22661 2 TTs is a decent place to go to hear local music for a decent price and okay drinks. I love that they're hosting the Rock n' Roll Rumble this year, and they have the awesome Heroes and Xmortis dance nights. Yay! 
22662 4 Great place and nice to be able to support a local business. Love the selection of hardware like nuts and bolts People working are very friendly. 
22663 1 Same great espresso and baked goods as the Port Moody location, but not the same service. Staff in Port Moody have always been friendly and helpful, 2 days in a row this weekend staff in Coquitlam location were unfriendly even after leaving a 20% tip. 
22664 0 "free hot chocolate with purchade of quesadilla" No hot chocolote.... "Chips and choice of salsa roja or salsa Verde included with each order" No chips or salsa... Just false advertisement. Even the quesadillas were rather dissapointing and the place is literally called "Quezzallavile" waste of $10 
22665 2 Meh. I personally didn't see what all the hype was about. Pizza wasn't terrible but I've had better elsewhere. Bartender was super friendly and it was really cheap compared to city prices. 
22666 4 I love this place, oh thank heavens for super torta, seriously. It's my fav guilty pleasures fast and delicious. The hard shell tacos, oh yes + an al pastor burrito, oh yes! I got five stars on this place, love it! Boom 
22667 3 Had a great dinner here with my boyfriend a couple days ago, and we will definitely be going back. Great service, GREAT food, great atmosphere. He had the carpetbagger, cooked perfectly. I had the duck, also cooked perfectly. Fine dining at an affordable price, without pretension. 
22668 3 Yep. I love it. Well located. The sushi was yummy and fresh. The curry was pretty good as well. Pitcher of Sapporo (Japanese brand YUMMY beer) for 10.99$ beat that! The keg is definitely fresh. Every time. Four stars cuz it's super busy and loud sometimes. Aligato!! 
22669 3 This place is the bee's knees, ESPECIALLY if you're a vegetarian who likes to have options. Try their vegetarian Mongolian beef! Just as good as Harmony! Also they serve beer & wine and have a super friendly wait staff. Will definitely be back. 
22670 4 I get my hair done by Andre and I always leave very satisfied. I have blonde hair and she is very good at matching up the roots. She takes pride in her work and it shows. 
22671 4 Still great in terms of food and service! We love stopping by here whenever we're in the area. Also, give the baklava a try! Its really good and so much better than safeway baklava! 
22672 3 Good food, great craft beer, fast friendly service, lunch specials, and the best Chicago BEEEFFF in Orlando. Good place to hang out and watch the game on one of the 20 screens. 
22673 4 This is a hostel that has single room!! The environment is excellent and the breakfast is delicious, but it is noisy. The smell and wifi is good enough for me. 
22674 3 I only came here for appetizers, and they all tasted great. They do a really good job with nachos. Great atmosphere. 
22675 2 took the family out to eat here last month. The steaks were amazing. A bit of a wait to get a table, but the food is worth it. 
22676 4 Our restaurant ordered all our bread from Iggy's, and you know what, at least once a week a customer would ask where the bread came from. Their sourdough is great, nice and dense, and crusty. 
22677 0 This place is not a good place to go with a big group. They will force a big amount of gratitude per person along with the total cost of the order when the services was not something special. It will be my last time there. 
22678 3 We ordered the vegetarian pizza and the eggplant sub...both were delicious! Great service from everyone...prompt, friendly, chatty. It was perfect weather to sit in their open patio area. Will definitely be back with friends! 
22679 4 Family photographer. She's very prepared with a nice touch with the kids. She worked quickly, finishing our session in under an hour. 
22680 4 A whole grocery store of vegan food?? Dream come true! Has everything I would ever need, and the staff is very friendly :) I make the drive at least once a week from LO just to come here and take a peek around the shelves. 
22681 2 Went with a group for dinner. They also had a great live band. The food was wonderful (I had the duck) but our server kept forgetting things that we asked for. Overall I really love this place but the server last night could have been better. 
22682 0 Service was terrible and there was a piece of raw meat in my salad 
22683 3 Thom kha was a little salty, but everything else was delicious and the service was excellent. We had spring rolls, pad keep Mao and the chow mein. Will definitely be back! 
22684 4 I thought the food was really good. One of the better Chinese places in the area. Fast, affordable, with decent service. 
22685 4 Our pups love this place and the employees love them back. You wont find a better place to leave your fur baby. 
22686 2 Really warm and inviting atmosphere but the coffee wasn't hot and it's nearly impossible to find a seat. It looks like people come and camp out all day. I might come back at a less busy time. I visited on a rainy Sunday afternoon. 
22687 2 Pretty much a stock Mexican restaurant. Nothing special, nothing terrible. 
22688 4 The absolute best tacos in Orlando (trust me I've done the legwork). Very affordable, great late night food. I always get carnitas and carne asada tacos. Sometimes I like to get a carnitas burrito. I probably go here at least once a week to be honest! 
22689 4 I had an amazing experience with Florence. She did a really great job and was extremely professional. I will certainly love to have her come and help me with my home again. 
22690 3 Wings are always good & they give you plenty of fries. My only problem was the fact that the $2 brownie wasn't homemade but was a pillsbury store bought brownie. 
22691 2 Just okay. Sad because this is walking distance from my house. Everything was fried or over cooked. : ( 
22692 4 This place has been a regular visit of mine since the first day I ate there. I fell in love with their grilled shredded pork and noodles in the B1! Great business, great people and of course great food! 
22693 4 I live in Midtown commons and this place is exactly what we needed from iced/ hot coffees and a wide variety of teas ice cremes and pastries. Everyone that comes here is sure to find something they will enjoy and the prices are reasonable for this area(: 
22694 4 LOVE egg harbor! I went to brunch with a friend Sunday and the wait wasn't bad, the food was great and our waitress was super nice. the lemon poppy seed pancakes are amazing. 
22695 4 2 years later and this is still my go to place! They have made some upgrades over the summer and it looks great! Winnie and all the ladies are always so friendly and I'm not sure how but my last gel manicure lasted almost 3 weeks! I still highly recommend! 
22696 4 Looking forward to my first appointment there! Great vibe! 
22697 4 A stop at curra's is always on my itinerary when I'm in Austin. It's one of a kind! Great food and Rita's 
22698 4 Great location, clean, quiet, nice ambience, free wifi, fast service, at a price equal or less than Starbucks for breakfast. Order your food at the counter and seat yourself. 
22699 4 How can this bar be so perfect? There is awesome service- very impressive. The food menu is super cheap and yummy. And there is vegan variety on the menu. AND the giant picture of Ledger. The music was enjoyable too! 
22700 4 Amazing ceviche! So fresh and delicious. A generous portion for a very fair price. They even gave me extra sweet potatoes for no charge and were very quick and polite. I love this spot for ceviche and can't wait to try more 
22701 4 Wow! They start with the freshest farm-to-table ingredients, cook everything with care, and serve it so it looks as good as it tastes. These people know what they are doing, and they do it superbly. 
22702 4 Dr Rayne and her office staff are great! She is always in a good mood and explains everything thoroughly. 
22703 3 Started coming here primarily because of the Waffle Window (you can request a Waffle Window menu inside the cafe). I have enjoyed all the other (non-waffle) dishes I've had here as well. A little cold and drafty, but still a good place for brunch. 
22704 3 We just went for drinks and appetizers but had a great time. Our server was extremely helpful and the restaurant was very nice. Our out-of-town friend was very impressed with the options available for vegetarians. Will definitely go back. 
22705 3 Great place, nice people. Jen & Adam 
22706 4 Be adventurous and try the bone marrow and snails dish! The scallop and gnocchi dish is phenomenal! 
22707 3 Decent apartment with an excellent location for a great price! I only paid $800 monthly for 6 months lease this year. That is practically a steal. However, the apartments really need to be updated. I hope they're reading the reviews and realize this. 
22708 3 Old school diner. No frills / locals joint. Prices are reasonable, staff attentive, clientele vibrant. Don't expect farm-to-table locavore food. Think twin-peaks double-R diner. 
22709 4 This is my fav place in Boston. I love the ambiance, decor and more than anything the food. I am obsessed w this place hope the food and service continue to be outstanding 
22710 2 Food comes out fast and hot and it's pretty tasty. Great portion sizes. Just doesn't taste quality hence loss of a couple stars. Quick good eat for cheap, does the job for that. 
22711 4 The best dumpling in town! the fish soup oh man I keep missing it! one of the best chinese food I been in Vancouver. definitely a must go place! 
22712 2 I live right next to B Street and I go there probably 3 times a month. It's my favorite quick breakfast sandwich stop. I am gluten & dairy free and this place is accommodating to both! Just a heads up. It usually takes FOREVER. 
22713 2 Food is good here. They try to hard. Too many hipsters have invaded this once grand Austin eatery. Kerby Lane is just as good and half the price. 
22714 4 Just a great casual bar with tasty bites. I absolutely love coming here for a burger and glass of wine with a book. The staff and regulars are super nice and fun. They take beer seriously and offer a variety of food options at different price points. Love! 
22715 4 These guys are great! Fast, friendly, competitive prices! 
22716 4 first thing.....save room for dessert. the mini indulgence's definitely cannot be beat!!! the warm butterscotch creme brulee literally made my my pallet flip. the perfect place to look into the eyes of someone you love and eat till you feel like a pot bellied seahorse without the calories killing you. 
22717 4 This bookstore is great! Plenty of study areas, lots of school supplies and things college students might need, and of course a great book selection. Awesome hang out for college students. 
22718 0 Sadly will not go back, first time in and find them owner/ help to be very rude and unfriendly. Not worth their time. 
22719 4 I love the food and the service at this restaurant. It's great that the staff is Japanese as well makes the food so much better than Korean "Japanese food" or worse Chinese "Japanese food". 
22720 4 Def The best need Bahn mi in chinatown. The shakes at dong khan are better. But I ALWAYS come.here for bahn mi. Always. 
22721 4 Dr. Gellman is by far the best chiropractor. Him and his staff are very knowledgeable and patient. After my auto accident I was in so much pain and he was great atoning sure I was getting better and better after each visit. I recommend his practice 1000%! 
22722 3 Wasn't sure about doughnut burgers but this was awesome. Had the El Camino and am looking forward to trying so many others. Nice outdoor space and solid beer selection. 
22723 4 The tastiest burgers and the most variety I've seen so far (especially vegetarian options). Delicious fries too though slightly expensive. Funny sign boards and logos typical of interesting Austin. The nutella shake felt like heaven!! 
22724 3 My favorite Indian buffet in town; not a huge selection, but everything's good and it's reasonably priced. Only available at lunch unfortunately. 
22725 4 Melissa gave a fantastic massage! Front desk girl was so sweet & helpful! Great experience! 
22726 4 The restaurant shares the same chefs as the one in Chinatown and Cambridge. I'm really glad I don't have to drive to Chinatown and can have the same food in the neighborhood. I came to this restaurant on a quiet afternoon so the service is quite good. 
22727 4 I really appreciate this place. Every time I've come here, the service is fast and the food is excellent. It's incredibly affordable for what you get and the quality doesn't get sacrificed. I'll continue to come here when I'm in downtown for an awesome breakfast at an affordable price. 
22728 4 Owner is a super nice and chill guy. Drinks are amazing! Love their fresh fruit drinks and will always come back to this place! 
22729 4 Really cute place. Had an amazing brunch here. Got the cowboy hash? I think it was called... girlfriend got the fried chicken Benedict with half Benedict half gravy. So good. 
22730 4 I am in love with Kava and this place. Mellow vibes, interesting people. Great Owners. One of my new favorite places to meet clients, friends, and family. 
22731 4 I've been in many times and love the rainy day happy hour. Amazing mac n cheese complemented by large tap selection and great bartenders. 
22732 0 Absolutely the worst biscuits and gravy I have ever been exposed to. Offensively terrible. Shit tasted like Chinese newspaper soaked in rainwater. 
22733 3 I went to this restaurant couple a month ago with my grand mother. We love it there. There food taste so different then other Chinese restaurant i been to. I recommend you to go there, enjoy the food there. 
22734 4 The pizza at Press Pub and Press Grill is excellent. This location is excellent because you don't have to deal with the parking issues of the Short North location. The space is more upscale. Love it! 
22735 4 Shaun showed up on time and did an amazing job with my makeup. She paid attention to what a wanted and created the perfect look for my tv appearance. I would recommend! 
22736 0 If I could give a negative star I would. Worst airport food ever. Not to mention a complete ripoff 
22737 4 Haven't had a roast beef sandwich like I had here in years! Absolutely incredible roast beef, roasted bin and perfectly cooked fries. Served by friendly, prompt staff. All the roast beef places in my city disappeared, this place brought me back! Thank you Maks and staff! 
22738 0 Very disappointed, the person assisting had attitude making the sub, had to asked several times to add vegetables. At the end he threw me the sub. The vegetables weren't good either 
22739 4 Hands down good! Great service and outstanding food! Do not go to Salem without eating here. Best pizza we've had in the New England area 
22740 4 I must concur with everyone else here. This place is awesome. Staff is extremely friendly. Must Have: Bhindi Masala 
22741 4 This is such a cute little cafe! I've driven by this place many times and hadn't noticed it until today. Glad I stopped-the famous chicken waffle was delish! 
22742 4 Absolutely love this place. Such a unique experience with the cats. Very helpful staff. Also a mean cup of coffee. I will be adopting here soon I hope! :) 
22743 2 Ordered orange chicken with white rice for dinner. The food was just okay. My husband likes that they offer an option for brown rice. This restaurant has plenty of seating and our server was good. 
22744 3 Not too salty. Good firmness of noodles. Better than the first time. Good job Jennifer! 
22745 3 Good little restaurant in the Whole Foods shopping center off Ponce. The wait staff is always friendly and attentive and the food fresh, well seasoned and affordable. Overall, a great value. 
22746 0 Very rude manager working there, she berated a worker in front of all the customers because he rang something up wrong. But I guess I shouldn't really expect much from an DD manager. 
22747 4 Fast and friendly service! Love the menu, great addition to N Druid Hills area. Stop in on Fridays for $6 lunch deal- 2 tacos (yes, tacos!) and a soda. It's a savings of about $2 and the tacos are great. Love the build out and vibe 
22748 4 This was my first time here and I was very pleased with the quality of food and great service. it was very unique to be able to meet the owner and even get the back ground on how they originated. I recommend this place to everyone. Its top notch!!! 
22749 0 Horrible experience, rude staff, very disappointed! Being a card member doesn't help either. I am so glad that I no longer have to deal with Alaskan again! Not worth the bonus or the miles program! 
22750 2 Solid three star Hillsdale Thai food. It's where you go when you don't want to cook and don't want to drive very far. 
22751 3 Great food, reasonable prices, fantastic view (sit upstairs). Had raw oysters, Baja Fish Tacos and Lobster Scampi, everything was wonderful. The service was a little hit-or-miss and the oyster selection was light (only 3 available), otherwise would have been 5. 
22752 0 Don't waste your time here! Run down neighborhood. No available units and they have no models to look at. This place is wack. 
22753 4 Amazing food! I had the cinnamon roll French toast while my breakfast companion had the lemon poppyseed pancakes. The service was warm and friendly and our food arrived rather quickly. The attached, free parking garage is an added bonus. This restaurant will definitely be added to my Buckhead breakfast/brunch rotation. 
22754 3 I love the Mexican vanilla and chocolate cake ice cream. The cashier was friendly and funny. I always appreciate a happy person with a good sense of humor. :) 
22755 3 Great food, great staff! My food came in after my families...they felt awful and took care of my bill which was awesome! They were only 4-5 minutes late! will definitely be coming back! 
22756 3 Big Lemon Thai fan. Spring rolls and massaman curry are money. I like the country style pad thai, which is a little spicier than the typical version. We usually order carry out, so I don't have much to contribute about the ambiance. Good, affordable Thai in a Somerville neighborhood. 
22757 3 Great food! Rest rooms could be cleaner. Don't let the outside scare you! Close to the airport so this will be my go to when we need dinner after flight 
22758 3 Food generally ranges from good to really good, as do the prices. No real regional specialties, just your basic taqueria. Ambience is a little dingy but the service is always good. I love that they have black beans and the egg torta is always a hearty, tasty meal. 
22759 4 OMG, I have lived in Columbus most of my adult life, how did I not know about Hound Dogs? Best crust in the city. Get the Smokin Joes butter garlic version. Service was super too on a Saturday afternoon. Go there, NOW. 
22760 4 You said you'd be open March 1st then April 1st then the 20th, then may 20th and now June 20th. Ridiculous. I know how remodels work but come on. People love your food. Why not open a second establishment?! 
22761 4 The food is delicious, very filling portions, excellent and amiable service, reasonable prices; if you're looking for a delicious and enjoyable breakfast or brunch place I recommend Kekes! 
22762 4 Fantastic experience: great, friendly service, wonderful food that reminded me of being back in Athens, and they even had Mastika! 
22763 2 Service is okay. The food isn't that good. If you want to try different pastries with chicken, you'll see that they all have the same taste. I've been to better Brazilian bakeries in Somerville. 
22764 1 Traveled over an hour to eat here. Wait time average. Staff friendly. Food however was a disappointment. The fries were cold, not even Luke warm and my hamburger was raw. Most people like it so if in the area would try one more time before writing this place off. 
22765 4 Can't wait to try it! I heard of it through Facebook. My Dad LOVES BLUE CRABS! We are going there tomorrow!! 
22766 2 Very cute and comfortable. Great food, but expensive! I've also heard amazing things about the pies, haven't tried them, but they look really good. And Dark! So dark... why are you so dark RO? It makes me so sad. 
22767 4 The food is amazing! Very authentic and delicious Asian food I had a car drive of 30 mins from Boston all the way to Dorchester. And it's so worth it. 
22768 2 Decent beer selection. Typical bar food. Can get crowded at times. Staff is generally friendly. 
22769 2 My entree wasn't good but my husband said his was very good. Dirty martini wasn't dirty! But the main reason we wouldn't return is the BLASTING music which included rap! Not really enjoyable with dinner! 
22770 4 Great mocha. Surprise find in a cute neighborhood. Friendly staff. Parking is a little bit of a hassle. Best Columbus mocha...so far. 
22771 4 I just had the "mac the knife" wow!!! I also had the stuffed dates which were amazing! So wish I lived nearby, this would be my new place! Service was excellent. Great little place! 
22772 3 Got a good haircut here, friendly staff. Ill definitely be back. If you park in the garage, they will validate you which is cool. Not much more to say! 
22773 1 This gym has a great set up but the lack of airconditioning in the summer is brutal and they don't seem to care about it. The staff isn't the most friendly but given the options (limited as it is) it is worth a go. 
22774 3 Taco Tuesdays! $2 taco that are legit great. I had the fish taco and it was yummy with fresh salsa and veggies, special aioli sauce. 
22775 4 Very good place, 100% Colombian taste and the menus has a lot of good options. I would recommend this place to anyone 
22776 4 It's the best thing in the world seeing a Chick-fil-A after being in a place with no american food. Give me that fried chicken and waffle fries! 'Merica! 
22777 1 The place is conveniently located. The ambience is very plain. The service is good. The food is below average. I had the grilled chicken, totally tasteless and the chicken was stale. The prices are a bit high for an average place. 
22778 4 Love this place. Great Thai cuisine and excellent service even if it is a bit pricey. Worth it. 
22779 4 wow... now i understand why the north end is THE place to eat. the wine and drinks list is fantastic and all 4 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 5 deserts I sampled were amazing. make reserservations in advance. 
22780 2 Definetly a good place to go watch a game. They have some hella nice tvs in there. I havent been here in the summer but I heard they have a cool roof top setting. Might be worth checking out. 
22781 4 Looking for a unique dining experience? Oley's fits the bill. The oxtail was tender in a rich broth and the jerk pork was seasoned perfectly. The staff was friendly and the prices very reasonable. If you leave hungry, it's your fault. 
22782 4 Ordered food thru UberEATS. Absolutely fantastic. I'm going to have to visit and check out the music and the rest I feel the menu! 
22783 3 Great breakfast tacos. Fresh ingredients, very flavorful, good salsas, clean establishment, kind customer service. Outside seating to trailer. They lost a star for long wait and expensive for breakfast tacos. 
22784 0 Please, please, please stay away! Had a simple lunch of Margarite flatbread and Caesar salad. Multiple trips to bathroom to expel this horrendous crap from my body! Sorry for being honest, just wish they were. 
22785 3 As a sandwich connoisseur, I love their yummy sammies. I don't even like carrots very much, but they seem to taste different when they're shredded and on a sandwich. My only complaints? Lack of ambience and they only accept cash. What decade are we living in??? 
22786 3 If you need a nice, clean spot for a date with a very nice waiter who will gladly answer all you questions, this is your place. But it ain't Austin, and it ain't Thailand, either. 
22787 4 This place has delicious food. My favorite slider was a pulled pork one. The atmosphere inside is nice - it's a renovated older house. They staff was very friendly and helpful. 
22788 3 Cool place for breakfast. The stuff I ordered was very spicy, despite the fact that I told them not to add too much spice the second time around. They had fun drinks like that cream soda but I think it's gone now. Americano was good. So were the waffles. 
22789 4 Got a Chenery Cheetah Burger, onion rings and a 6-piece Death Defying boneless buffalo wings for dinner tonight. The delivery took 10mins longer then they quoted, but the food was great as usual. My girlfriend got a quart of their magical chicken soup also. Such good stuff. 
22790 4 Bob's makes me want to move to Medford. Obviously I love sandwiches, so lets talk sandwiches. AMAZING. I like the proscuitto sandwich with buffalo mozzarella...to die for. Also the frozen ravioli is amazing, I always promise myself I will go fine food shopping at Bobs. 
22791 3 First time here and such a great experience! Foie gras over the pound cake was delicious! It was nothing I expected! We will be back to try other food on the menu! 
22792 4 Great service. Courteous, quick, professional--no problem. And, contrary to what one reviewer stated, they do take credit cards. I had five knives sharpened there yesterday (08/29/2015) and paid with a credit card. 
22793 3 I thought the place had a great vibe. I loved the small plates. I even thought the main course plates were small, but a perfect size to follow the small plates. 
22794 4 Best sandwich in Columbus! Get the club everytime, never get sick of it! Staff is great too! 
22795 3 I had a great time here; brunch with a bunch of friends after a waterfront run! Good bloody marys, excellent food, great service. 
22796 4 best fish tacos, skinny margaritas and Mexican food in the Austin area. I drive a long way to eat here! oh and OUTSTANDING service staff! Everyone here takes the restaurant business seriously. 
22797 2 Not bad, not great. Fun and friendly staff but the cupcakes are nothing special. The location is in the thick of Harvard Square and the setting is well done. Too bad the cupcakes aren't tastier. 
22798 4 FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my wife and kids went there for lunch. We cant say anyhting bad about it. it was great and the food and service was very good and will be definately be going back. 
22799 4 Based on the price right now you can do in Boston, this place is cheap enough but also very good for the service and attitude. Really recommend this place even though this is my first visit. 
22800 4 My dog loves going here for day care. The whole staff knows his name and even recognize him away from the day care. The place is clean with tons of room for dogs to play. Take your dogs here for a great treat. 
22801 4 Best sushi place. Been a regular for years. Highly recommend the Chicken Kaarage Bowl 
22802 3 Love Lady Siam! The staff is great, very friendly, and they always remember me even if it's been a while between visits. The food is great, and very consistent. I also love that they deliver to North Cambridge! 
22803 4 Everything you could want from your local dive. Great atmosphere and an eclectic mix of patrons. No nonsense, no bull, just cheap drinks, pinball, pool and life size jenga. 
22804 3 This place is really fun. The servers were totally friendly. Good drinks. Good snacks. 
22805 3 Cozy and delicious, albeit a little overpriced-- like any other Todd English restaurant. Quite an impressive wine selection, and my friends and I are somewhat obsessed with their beef carpacio. Who knew raw meat could be so good? 
22806 4 I love the earth n turf burger on the gluten free bun. They have beef fat fries, sweet potato tots and a kale salad. Several really good shakes. 
22807 4 What can I say? I've bought and sold through her and the level of service, knowledge, advice, being either the seller or buyer advocate, emotional IQ to know just how to serve me - she's set a standard I don't ever expect another realtor to match. And she's funny. 
22808 0 I was so excited after I bought a Groupon- but Maisie never emailed or called me back...I left multiple messages. Finally, Groupon refunded me. So disappointing :/ 
22809 0 Real bad service takes forever to get food and it's only Monday!!! On one cook and one server from what I can see this restaurant suxs never again.. 
22810 4 I work across the street from here and I love their chicken and waffles and their bbq chicken salad. Always friendly, always good, and the manager there always takes good care of my food. I would definetly bring people here. 
22811 1 I ordered the immunity one. The juice tasted good overall, but I'm not stoked about the prices not displayed on the menu. 10.00 is a bit steep.It makes me feel that they know it's pricy and try to disguise it. 
22812 1 Live down the street from Zoe's for a year. I have to say I did not miss much. I ordered a salad that was the size of my hand. Quantity quantity, QUALITY! Just like Johnny's. Now they leave you feeling full! Won't be back I am afraid..... 
22813 4 The best tasting flavors and selection of toppings of any self-serve frozen yogurt place I have been to yet. Most definitely recommend! 
22814 4 I had the Austin for brunch which was excellent. The service was great also. It was a great find before the longhorns game. I will be going back to take my wife. 
22815 4 I can see why people like this place--the location is nice and the coffee beverages are quite good. I had a latte, a cup of coffee (Colombian) and a pastry. I'll certainly be back. 
22816 3 Looking for interesting and unusual, you will not find it here. It is not as good as La Provence but much better than Babica Hen. Great Hollandaise. Solid. 
22817 4 First time trying Venezuelan food and we loved it! Food was delicious and waiter was very helpful and friendly. Will return soon!! 
22818 4 Fantastic service! Quality food with incredible ingredients. I loved everything about this place and highly recommend. 
22819 4 Absolutely amazing. Friendly staff, great food, superb service. There is a free parking lot across the street which is always a plus. Plenty of tables, so we didn't wait at all. Although we didn't order drinks, there was a full bar. Menu had many, many options 
22820 4 This my second time back. I always receive excellent customer service. They never let me leave with an ugly looking pair of glasses. I usually wear contacts, but after getting two pairs here I wear glasses more often feeling confident that I look great in them! 
22821 4 I've only been here once, but I'm planning to go back! My filthy car looked and smelled great and I really appreciated their attention to detail. Great price, people and results! 
22822 2 I gave Paley's only 3 starts because last night I had the vegetable cassoulet and I was disappointing with so many beans and very few vegetable. Everything else was fantastic! 
22823 3 I had the taco of the month, a jackfruit BBQ concoction, it was my first vegan taco experience and I was not disappointed. I would definitely recommend this place. 
22824 4 The food was amazing and service was great, get the pork chop or rockfish you won't forget!! 
22825 4 Always the best nails and best experience. No matter what crazy design I ask for they manage to do it perfect. I drive an hour to come here and love the outcome every time! 
22826 4 What's not to love? Great food, no grease, clean dining room, friendly staff, wel priced. Has the feel of a locals-only diner without the attitude. You'll love it! 
22827 3 Zen is my staple for sushi, which is always fresh and delicious. The Spicy Avocado Salad is amazing! I also love the Unaju dish. The only downside is the lack of parking... 
22828 4 Fantastic staff. Very accommodating to us, with our toddler on a busy Saturday night. Food was great and the portions are very generous. It is no surprise why there is a line out the door. 
22829 4 I used Auto Bliss in late 2015, early 2016, to fully detail my BMW 325. They did a FANTASTIC job. So good, in fact, that we are having them detail my wife's BMW 335 next week. 
22830 3 Excellent service price was great all problems solved, ran around to many different places and waits and prices were crazy in and out 20 mins new screen on iPhone 6. Would recommend to anybody. 
22831 3 Very good food..great prices..fast service..I'll be back very soon..Owner was very nice and staff very attentive 
22832 3 My favorite pizza place in Portland. Great place to stop in for a slice. Crispy, thin crust with delicious ingredients. Also cool that the offer homemade sodas with unique flavors. 
22833 3 The food is great but a bit pricy. However, you do get what you paid for. The mussels are fresh, salads are great, and drinks are yummy. 
22834 4 The food was nothing short of amazing! We ordered several different rolls and everything was very fresh and tasty. The sushi chef also took time to answer questions we had regarding the menu. The Shiro roll was our favorite roll. I will definitely visit again and recommend to others. 
22835 4 Grass fed beef burger with fresh jalapeños, pickles, lettuce, tomato, and a fried egg. So good. 
22836 3 Great views and can also watch the sunset in the evening. A fun hang worth checking out. The margaritas were great, esp the mango margarita. They have a couple of good veggie options too. 
22837 3 Massage was relaxing and nice.. The pressure applied was alright too.. But I think more reflexology points could be covered in the massage.. 
22838 0 Arrived promptly for our reservation at 7:30 pm. The restaurant was half-full. First three rolls arrived at 9:15 pm, by which time we were the only customers left in the restaurant. Abandon hope, all ye who enter here. 
22839 4 Wow, fast clean... Huge portion... Really pleased with my meal... had the chicken teriyaki! It was delicious 
22840 1 Needs vast improvement. The menu is beautiful and the food is good... salty and not appropriately priced, but good. Service left much to be desired. The poor bartender was tending bar and waiting tables. Has great promise but needs better management. 
22841 4 Just go! Seriously. You're on Yelp looking for the best Italian sub in Orlando, and you've found it, so go get in your car and get your ass to Laspadas. 
22842 1 I had the peanut butter ACAI, the service was wonderful, the acais were not. Not very flavorful and all the toppings were just crammed on top. Very aesthetic but that's it. 
22843 0 Eggs were like chalk I will never eat there again. They brought me the wrong food twice. Can't stand corp places like this. 
22844 3 The staff was super quick, accurate and friendly to boot. Atmosphere was clean and clutter free. However the tofu in my bowl was burnt to a crisp. Maybe I just caught them on an off day. I'll give them another chance since everything else was great. 
22845 4 The food was fantastic! Loved the fried goat and macaroni and cheese! This is going to be my new place to eat! Yummy yummy! 
22846 3 The breakfast portions are huge and for good prices. The place is clean and neat. Food is fine but not great. Convenient place to have brunch if you live in the area 
22847 3 I am lucky to have this little jewel in my neighborhood. We have been eating here since it opened. The pasta is fresh and the service is on point. They have a beautiful patio and a good happy hour with a great wine list. 
22848 3 My friend and I went over at lunch today after catching a movie and had the stuffed bakers with pulled pork. Very fresh and tasty! Reasonably priced and service was great! 
22849 3 Very good quintessential hole in the wall. You know what I am talking about - hidden, in not necessarily desirable neighborhood, cheap food, but most importantly: amazing food. Pupusas for days! Check it out! 
22850 4 Got my first tattoo here, it was nice and clean and the staff was friendly which was good because we where asking way to many questions. My tattoo didn't take long and was painless i recommend 
22851 3 I like this place. Had breakfast there yesterday and and after eating dinner we went there for dessert. I got a Berry Bliss waffle and asked them to put ice cream on it, I quit enjoyed it. 
22852 4 Very friendly and prompt service. Courteous and explain things clearly. Dr. Loehr is very personable and so are the dental assistants. Bonnie at the front desk is a pleasure to deal with - helps you informed of your schedule and very flexible. 
22853 4 Good food, great people, fair prices. Our new favorite. 
22854 4 Great food and great atmosphere. Tapas are great and share with the table. Make sure to get a reservation. 
22855 4 My source of dinner weekly when I lived at PSU. They have very tasty daily specials and they usually have a featured Sicilian for lunch. What I love the most is the Caesar dressing, tangy and lemony. Perfection. 
22856 0 I came back here a couple nights ago and was disappointed. My espresso cup had grime on it, my server never came to check on me at all, and the octopus tasted different. 
22857 3 Always excellent.. A must do! Yummy... killa soups, and thai dishes 
22858 4 Shout out to my girl Hannah, who was working super hard today. Despite how busy the day had been, she served my friend and I with a big smile and a "happy to help" attitude. Rock on! 
22859 3 best milkshakes. hands down. 
22860 0 Worst taco bell I've ever been too by far. Had tacos bean burrito and nachos and its plain garbage taste nothing like tacobell in california or illinois. 
22861 1 I have been here far to many times for after work drinks, but would probably not do so otherwise. It just has no character or anything special to make you want to go. The food is so so, the drinks are fine, and the decor looks like every other bar. 
22862 2 Nice interior, atmosphere and service. The ramen and maki are not bad, but not really impressive either. 
22863 4 My new favorite Asian/ Vietnamese. Will update later. Stuck waiting for a table right now!!! 
22864 2 The donuts were pretty good but not worth the price at about 3-4$ a pop. Coco donuts has been my favorite donut shop in Portland since living here. 
22865 4 My children love this place. We all had a wonderful experience here. See you in six months for our next cleaning. Best dentist ever! 
22866 4 I love Ethiopian food and I LOVE this place! Super yummy vegetarian items, very polite staff and clean. This joint gets busy so arrive early on weekends, if you have a larger party. 
22867 3 I actually really like this place although as others have said, it tends to be a bit over-rated. It's a big tourist spot in the summer, so might be avoided at certain peak times. Good seafood, especially the clams. And oddly, I had one of the best burgers ever here! 
22868 3 Best Shrimp and Grits I've ever had! Service was good. Our booth bench was dirty and showed wear (cream colored faux leather). The croutons are home made and amazing. I was surprised upon being charged for a coffee refill. 
22869 4 These guys are super nice! I have been there twice and both times they were able to help me figure out what I needed and find the most cost effective way of getting it. I love this store! 
22870 3 I am the guilty recipient of a sushi boat from this place that ferried me to a blissful food coma. Great selection and reasonable prices. Ikura with quail egg was some of the best I've had. Salmon and tuna was incredibly fresh. Eel avocado rolls were generous and rich. 
22871 4 Very friendly and accommodating staff, clean rooms, and great rates. They made my business stay very comfortable. 
22872 4 OMG, mini Powell's. It's quite a bit smaller but I find just as many great reads and gift ideas here, and the staff is just as amazing. This is for sure a fun place to browse if you're looking to kill time 
22873 3 Their fries are delicious, whether with the variety of dipping sauces or Poutine, which has a gravy and cheese curds on top of fries. The pork belly sandwich was bad though. The meat was all but pure lard. 
22874 0 The description online is all hype. The mansion furniture was not from original owners. They are from someone else's house. It was a let down. However, the view was beautiful. Save your money and skip this one. 
22875 2 Good ideas, good coffee. I really wanted the donuts to be warm, especially when I heard they were made to order. Really the donuts are made earlier and then dipped to order. 
22876 1 Nice staff. Subpar food for the price. 
22877 4 OMG so good. the roast beef is so tender the meatball grinder is really good and the pastrami was amazing. We will definitely go back when we are in that area again. 
22878 3 Great neighborhood bar, reasonable drink prices and fantastic front patio. Didn't try the food but it all looks good! 
22879 3 My son is always happy here the staff are very honest and knowledgeable. He always finds what he needs. 
22880 3 The (all day) breakfasts are great -- fluffy pancakes, perfect eggs, yummy hash browns. The club sandwich is good. I would sugguest staying away from things like fried chicken cutlets which is greasy anywhere. I find the atmosphere friendly and comfortable. The service is great. And the price is right. 
22881 4 Comes as a choice with the trolley. This is a great route to choose. The presenters are fabulous! They know their information, obviously love what they are doing and do an excellent job getting the audience involved. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. 
22882 3 Friendly staff that is wiling to help and ensures you are enjoying your time. Fun routes, it seemed as though some were incomplete. Price is good. Rental shoes are terrible - should buy your own if you think you'll be frequenting. 
22883 3 This place never disappoints! Authentic Cuban food with very affordable pricing. I am a huge fan of the daily specials. The service is friendly and efficient. Wish the location was larger since it can get crowded. If you haven't been to Papi's it is a must! 
22884 4 Loved my instructor, love the 7pm classes, it goes by so fast, no one's judging you, no pressure, no 'skill' level, no competition--just go to work off your stress and you can book online! 
22885 4 Absolutely phenomenal food and service every time. The grilled mahi mahi is perfection and the mussels appetizer was excellent. Love this place! Always surpasses expectation, the chefs obviously know what they're doing back there. 
22886 4 This 3D movie experience is amazing! Best 3D experience I've ever had. I wish I had only done a bit more research on this one prior. I would have done it a couple of times. My 4yo LOVED it. He kept trying to grab for things. 
22887 4 The subs here are delicious. Definitely a step above subway while still being affordable. They have spa waters and organic soda. 10/10 would recommend and come back. 
22888 4 Only eaten in this place once, but I get takeout at least once a month. Great food at a very reasonable price. Friendly staff. And the delivery is very quick too. I would recommend this place with no hesitation. 
22889 4 Damn. What a dive. Wild Irish Rose. Black Label. A run down looking patio. You folks have to check this out for yourself. Despite the area, parking has never been an issue, thankfully. Maybe Im going in at the right times. The penny countertop is great. 
22890 4 Another amazing dinner at Brutole. Both hubby and I had the clam chowder and it was the best I have ever had. I had the chicken marsala and hubby had the veal parm, both very good. The apple crumble was a great ending. Service was excellent. 
22891 4 What more can you ask for in a Chinese Restaurant. They are friendly, the food is great, and delivery is CRAZY FAST. They are very accommodating for order changes and alterations as well. Best place in Tucker for Chinese food hands down. 
22892 4 Lucas and Victor did a stellar job -- arrived at the starting time on the dot, were fast, efficient, and courteous, and the company charged a fair rate. Would definitely work with them again and recommend them to anyone. 
22893 3 This place used to be a what one might call "sketchy" however it has been under new management for a few years now and it quite a fun local spot. Good to catch up with friends and watch Sox games. 
22894 4 This place is amazing. Very traditional and fresh seafood with very friendly service. I had the fried seafood platter and it was extremely fresh and delicious. 
22895 4 Recommended from the front desk clerk at our hotel. Did not disappoint. Excellent Hawaiian food. Best fish and chips I have ever had! Worth the 30 minute drive across town for this one. 
22896 0 Horrible service from Tati and manager Barbara worst customer services I've seen... should be fired. They take no responsibilities for their actions. Nothing but attitude they rather talk and joke around with co-work instead of helping paying customer. 
22897 4 We were seated quickly and our waitress helped us decide what to get - I got the Mi Casa salad with carne asada. Honestly, it was one of the most full and flavorful salads I've had. Overall, a really pleasant experience! 
22898 3 Very good. Menu, service, food, atmosphere-- all around just a good job. Not formal dining, but a bit more upscale than the other restaurants in the Waterford area. Have been here many times and never been disappointed. 
22899 3 This cafe is really close to where I'm working, so I've been going here for a few months. They have a decent selection of sandwiches and salads. The soups are delicious! Definitely get the baguette to go with it. Everything is relatively low priced and the staff is really friendly. 
22900 4 I love this place. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. The food is amazing. Some of the best chicken tikka and saag paneer I've had, even in comparison to pricier Indian restaurants. 
22901 3 Great food and good service. Owner even asked us how we were. The katsu was superb and rice was cooked to perfection. Great lunch deal! 
22902 3 The sliced beef curry with extra potatoes is the best meal they have. Service and atmosphere isn't 5star, but you don't go here for fine dining. so good! 
22903 4 I love this salon. The entire staff is professional and they love what they do. I've been getting my hair colored by Jenny for many years and she has never disappointed me. If you're a blonde she is your go-to-gal! 
22904 3 We were looking for something different than your typical chain. We found it here. Great service, great food and fair prices. My friend is gluten free, and they even had menu items just for her. Great experience. 
22905 3 They have fantastic views of Boston, the bar has a great selection and the service was friendly. They have a wonderful outdoor deck, but the inside seating has great views as well, with sliding glass doors and lots of glass. The food was excellent!! 
22906 4 First time visiting here with my family. This location is alot smaller then the ones I am use in Broward, however the staff was friendly and welcoming. 
22907 3 Went in for an early breakfast on a Monday morning. Ordered the western sandwich on a sesame bagel. Service was quick and sandwich was perfectly toasted. Pumpkin spice coffee wasn't as I expected - a bit too spicey but drinkable none the less. Fair prices and friendly workers 
22908 3 Good chicken prices are so high for combos now. Really fresh. The girls who work the drive thru window you can half understand them. 
22909 4 This non profit thrift store has Friendly staff and Excellent prices! And the money earned goes to a Christian based recovery program for men and women! Love it! 
22910 4 We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Slate. Concise and competent wine list, knowledgeable staff. Food was very good, service great. Would recommend this highly. A huge step up and away from the theme park restaurants! 
22911 2 I was really excited about this place. A group of us went for my husband's surprise 30th. Service was "ok", drinks were a bit steep for margaritas with cheap tequila. The food was really un-memorable. Not worth the salt the rim the margaritas with. 
22912 1 Ugh. A poor team and poor service can completely destroy an otherwise great concept. I am not sure what it going on here but they are definately missing the mark by a wide margin. 
22913 4 I had a small housewarming party. Royal Fig was AMAZING! They were professional and courteous. The food was so good. We got the Trip Tip, Bruschetta, and the charcuterie tray. It was delicious. Such high quality. I will for sure have them cater our next event! 
22914 4 I absolutely love this place. I get the buffalo chicken omelet every time. It's usually huge and service is always good. Only thing that stinks is sometimes there's a wait. But I guess that's a good sign cause it's a great spot. 
22915 4 Yummy!! I tried out their buffalo chili corn sandwich with seasoned tater tots last weekend. It was so good! The sauce was super delicious, the chicken freshly cooked & the toppings and bread were perfect! I shared my sandwich with my husband and he loved it too! 
22916 3 Delish! It's order at the counter crepe place. Think Moe's, but with crepes. Clean place. Friendly staff. 
22917 3 Great sauce and crust. Tried the Queen's Right pizza and it hit the spot. Probably to be the only place in Sandy Springs that can attempt to taste reminiscent of Antico's fresh sauce and crust. Service was very friendly. Well selected beer menu. I'll be back! 
22918 3 Went to this place for Lunch. The tacos were super good and so was the service. The rice was amazing too. I would def be back. 
22919 4 This place has the best Mexican food in town! Awesome service and food! They have the best margaritas and the best salsa! My family and I come here at least once a month! 
22920 4 Delicious South End sandwich, bottle of water, chocolate milk, Peace Orange juice, $12.50. Money. 
22921 1 With soutmob the insane prices are decent. The food is okay, but I am comparing it to Italian we get in Boston and NY. There isn't much good Italian in our city, this is one of those. 
22922 4 These guys were awesome! They were super professional and treated us like friends. They took us out to the lot and let my 4 year old choose any car he wanted. Couldn't be happier with the service. 
22923 4 We were in the area visiting from Los Angeles and wanted good pizza and pasta. We ordered the grille pizza, a pepperoni pizza and a penne pasta. Everything was excellent especially the pizza crust. Delicious!!!! 
22924 3 Family owned, very friendly. Lot's of neighborhood folks and some young people. Drinks are strong and cheap. What more could you want? 
22925 0 TERRIBLE service. Cranky bartenders. Mediocre food, at best. So many better sushi options in Quincy. I wouldn't waste your money or time. Fried apps were super oily and bland and sushi was not fresh. 
22926 4 Excellent value. Great and friendly atmosphere. Good quality sushi at a great price. This is my 3rd visit here and it is worth the drive. 
22927 2 This isn't a usual stop for us. We typically only eat here on the days after the Magic win and we use the code to get 50% off our order. Cheap, quick and no thought involved. 
22928 4 Amazing coffee! Had a hazelnut latte, wentback and got another, cant wait to go back! 
22929 4 Hot damn this place is legit!!!! Please eat here now!!!! We had the Cuban sandwich, beef empanadas and cafe con leche!! THis place is heaven! I want to kiss the cook and kiss Yelp for telling me to come here!!! 
22930 4 Food was great, waiter service was decent wait time. Ithe sausage is fantastic which I would have again and again. 
22931 0 Not particularly cheap and incredibly disappointing. The kind of food you'd get in a school cafeteria on Mexican food day. And yes, I know it's Salvadoran. Take your money to Veracruz all natural for a much more satisfying meal. 
22932 4 The food is good here. I like the palak paneer and would recommend it. The dining area is large and clean. The servers are really attentive and friendly. It looked like lot of people get delivery from here, but I haven't ordered out before. 
22933 2 The mansion was neat enough. A little run down and Christmas decorations were a little sad. The surrounding area though was really great. The views from the mansion were lovely. Make sure to leave time to hike some of the trails that surround the mansion. 
22934 4 A hidden gem on the east side. Great patio for me who has two pups.. friendly service amazing food! Ryan behind the bar serves quality drinks that get the buzz going right for a nice evening out! Highly recommended! 
22935 4 $12 for perfect texture fish and chips and coleslaw and the tartar sauce is soooooo good!! She makes everything in house! Great customer service! Highly recommend ! 
22936 4 Always very professional and timely with services. Downtown Dental is centrally located in downtown Atlanta and the staff is amazing! 
22937 3 Quick service during lunch hour and delicious food. Kind of pricy but you get what you pay for. Love going out with my girl friends to this spot :) and staff is always amazing and friendly. 
22938 4 Whitney did a wonderful job as our waitress she was very effecient and made sure we enjoyed our movie 
22939 3 Excellent Burger! The ordering and seating confused the hell out of me. They need onion rings lol 
22940 3 Friendly staff, no wait. Food came out avg time and hot. Reggae Brunch is a fav of ours. Great atmosphere and vibes. Would like more vegetarian options Breakfast potatoes were fried in frialator and not seasoned. Would like to see skillet potatoes with some flavor 
22941 3 For the money enough variety and freshly baked bread to make it a go-to place for nights when there isn't time to get dinner and go to your next activity. Especially good for breakfast. Good coffee bar, especially the coffee. 
22942 4 Best fish house in Clark County. Even my hubby who is a definite non GF person loves their batter on the fish and clams. Their chowder is out of this world. Can't wait until they get the onion rings up in this store too! 
22943 3 Free Shopping Shuttle Service Pick up at 12:25pm Return times to hotel 1:10pm, 3:30pm, 5:10pm, 6:00pm and 7:00pm Sunday - last shuttle return time is 6:00pm 
22944 1 Maybe it was just this location, but the atmosphere was very stale and it felt forced. The coffee was only decent, I would prefer something more local. 
22945 4 Excellent. Didn't wait very long. Fast and very informative. Second location to visit tomorrow for more pictures. Very helpful and nice. 
22946 1 They overcharge for all of their services such as internet, the restaurant is inedible and their Hotel is filthy. Complete sham. 
22947 4 Amazing food, beautiful restaurant. I would recommend trying the bacon wrapped eggs, they were the best meal at the table by a long stride. The menu description did not do it any justice. Would highly recommend to friends and family looking for a good breakfast and brunch cafe in Oregon 
22948 4 This hole in the wall needs a higher rating. The food was authentic. If you're looking for homemade tortillas and gorditas this is the place. I had a chicharron gordita, asada gordita, and barbacoa sope. My taste buds were in heaven. I will definitely be back!! 
22949 1 ok, the haircut wasnt that great! i went there because it was rated best long hair haircut!!!! she did nothing special....not worth the $$$ 
22950 1 Not much I can say except a lot of issues to deal with! Needs on-site, full-time management and maintenance! Do not get the value of what we pay for rent and all the other hidden costs! 
22951 3 Just like all other Chick-Fil-A's, delicious chicken, fresh toppings, and friendly staff. There was a woman outside of the line greeting everyone and welcoming them. 
22952 4 Delicious food. Fresh and good portions here. I recommend trying it out. It is a Landrys restaurant so I realize some people won't like them. You can also get a passholder discount on the entrees. 
22953 4 Does this place even need another review? Best, freshest, cleanest buffet in town. I love going here on a Paleo craze - I get tons of grilled meats, steamed/sauteed green beans and leafy greens. There's so much more to eat aside from the rice, lo mein, and saucy-looking meats here. 
22954 3 Hey, went here for lunch yesterday and it was great. Definitely had the best burger i have had anywhere. The service was good. It was busy so my only "complaint" was that it was very noisey but will go back again 
22955 4 Awesome place-can't say this place is not good-Check it out-top 5 Thai restaurant in Portland 
22956 3 A new favorite. The waitstaff is very helpful and has no problem making vegan clay pots with vegetables like bitter melon and lotus root plus tofu. A-choy and Scallion pancakes are solid choices here. 
22957 4 A beautifully decorated and sterile environment with licensed advance and very well educated nail care professionals. I love this place and I know I'm safe with all of the services they offer. The waterless pedicures are amazing and the staff are friendly and professional and appointment times are honored 
22958 4 First of all the beautiful woman running the place was so generous and kind! She really took care of us. Based upon reviews we selected the Embilta Special. Everything was delicious. We primarily eat vegetarian and so Ethiopian cuisine is perfect! 
22959 3 For a fast casual place, it's pretty good. Quick service, fresh ingredients, and good taste. I got the mediterranean chicken plate which did not disappoint. 
22960 4 This is the best place to get all local stuff! I come here to get all my local honey and mead and skin products and today, my check in got me free made caramel! This place also sells a great variety of local crafts too. 
22961 1 $9 pizza the size of a small dinner plate. $8 veggie sandwich that was smaller than sliced bread( we know. the childrens grilled cheese was bigger) Seriously... you are a grocery store. Stop skimping. 
22962 4 I usually shop at AZ, but I am now converted. Daniel was extremely friendly and helpful. He even installed my turn signal for me. I am very pleased with the amazing customer service I received. 
22963 2 This beauty supply store looks pretty dreary from the outside but it actually had some diamonds in the rough. GOOD FOR: wholesale shampoo. 
22964 4 Loved the leak and artichoke mac n cheese with fresh squeezed lemonaide. Bartender was adorable. Perfect for colt wet Portland. 
22965 4 I had a great experience here. Janae was super professional, sweet, and funny. Plus my hair came out great. They have comfy chairs and you can pick your hairstyle from a selection of images on an iPad. I'll def. be back. 
22966 1 Food was ok. Definitely better buffets around but this one is relatively inexpensive so you get what you pay for. 
22967 4 This place is great! It has a lot of character and is one of the few brunch type places in the North End. The food is cheap and delicious and the service is great. I pretty much want to go here every weekend. They are cash only. 
22968 4 Totally legit. We were the only Anglos in the restaurant. Fresh and tasty. Good price. 
22969 4 I continue to go to Leal's because they continue to rock on service and prices! When ever I find that I have a slow leak in my brand new tires ( BIG FROWN), I don't worry - I just head over to Leal's on Cesar Chavez!! Very friendly and quick!!! 
22970 4 I love this place! Enough said. The service is great. The place is small, quaint, and cozy. The food is always on point and spectacular. The wine list is great. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Make sure you make a reservation because tables fill up quickly! 
22971 0 Not that great. My lashes only lasted 2-3 weeks as opposed to another place I go to in east van which lasted up to 5 weeks. They weren't as full as I liked them to be either when I expressed how thick I wanted them. Waste of money. 
22972 4 The staff here is great!!!! Let's face it.... global banking is the evil of the world.... the reserve is gonna end us all.... BUT It's at least nice to have friendly, efficient customer service!!!! I recommend this branch of this bank. They're great at what they do!!!! 
22973 0 Belligerent, nasty to my wife. Wouldn't take more money when offered due to his complaining of their Condition. First groomer in Boulder who wasn't happy to groom them. Took them there due to convenient location. Our mistake. Life to short to deal with unpleasant businesses. 
22974 4 Service was great Started with hot towels and ended with a sushi boat rolls to get... Kirin roll, dragon roll w/o cream cheese, kodiak roll , katana roll, & cucumber natsu ... If you're stumped .. Ask ken the server 
22975 4 Wonderful service, friendly staff, amazing crafted food, and great views of Mt. Hood and the river! 
22976 2 I always have lemongrass chicken noodle at Guilford Town Center in Surrey. Their cut lemon has been soaked with honey and it makes the soup so rich. I hope they put two chickens on it! 
22977 4 El Sultan is definitely my go-to burrito cart. Their burritos are reliable, large, tasty, and inexpensive. What more could you want during a Mexican food craving? The owners are also extremely nice. Pretty good setting too. I would highly recommend. 
22978 1 OK food. Rolls were falling apart as you pick it up, and the spicy salmon roll I got wasn't fresh. They didn't seem to speak English too well. Service was OK. Good for cheap food; money and quality wise 
22979 4 Simply delicious. I eat there all the time. Try the Thai Iced Tea. So so good. The shu Mai is out of this world. A little pricey but worth it. 
22980 0 Worst pizza ever - pepperoni was like shoe leather. Returned it. Mgr apologized - replaced with 2 slices of cheese. Tough, dried terrible pizza. Don't see how this place stays open. PG used to be pretty good. Hope not all locations are this bad. 
22981 4 This Red Lobster location has the most sweetest staff. The food was delicious and filling but the service was just Wow!! Our waitress Cindi was simply amazing. Thank you. 
22982 2 Very good, but not amazing, and DEFINITELY not worth the wait for weekend brunch and it's a bit pricey. Nice food selection, but I would recommend Magnolia or other brunch places in the area. 
22983 3 We were here last night.. Steve did a great job taking care of us. Loved the dragon shrimp and the service was so impressive. We will be back soon. 
22984 4 Fabulous bento box deal! Bulgolgi is delicious and their bibimbop is great! Fun place for Korean Japanese fusion. Not terribly authentic, but very enjoyable! 
22985 3 Good simple pub food. I got the tavern burger which was perfectly cooked to my liking. onion rings were a bit skimpy on the batter. really nice waitress, good service. big space with big windows and a big round bar. 
22986 0 Rude and obnoxious. Wow! I was standing in line and can't believe how they speak to people. Won't shop at chevron ever. Unbelievably rude! 
22987 4 Every component of this ramen was perfect. The broth was delicious, noodles perfectly cooked. I ate it all. I had no regrets. The one weird thing is that this place seems to be staffed exclusively by skinny white hipster dudes. Seriously amusing people, but ... why? 
22988 3 Cute back patio with lots of greenery and ponds throughout. The front does not do this place justice. Great sommeliers who really know their stuff and are happy to assist with pairings. 
22989 3 Awesome place to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner (but the breakfast is the best). Awesome portions and a ton of different selections. Very friendly owner that is always there behind the counter cooking. 
22990 4 We live in Orchards and visit here regularly with our two dogs.Overall, its the place we drink out at most often as a family, we absolutely love this place great people great service and good selection of beer .i would highly recommend. 
22991 4 I love this place. They have a great selection of fabric, and give a discount to Laura's sewing students. I can never leave without buying some awesome fabric. 
22992 0 The food is good, but it always takes 15 minutes for the waitress / waiter to acknowledge your existence. They'll have 7 open tables and 4 groups waiting to be seated. I could take orders for 1/2 the restaurant by myself. Poor service. 
22993 1 $50 for 1 whole crab is a rip off i want my money back the dishes all taste the same..i've had better thai foods. 
22994 4 Woola, another sensational fro-yo store! First impression: CLEAN, CHARMING & CUTE! I ordered a mango fro-yo while my friend got a earl grey gelato fro-yo. Both were quite good and the price was decent. Overall, the place is pretty quiet but they seem to be doing well :) 
22995 0 Horrible service. I got rushed through my order even when the restaurant was empty. Crappy food, small portions. What a horrible horrible place. 
22996 4 Omg great authentic mexican food. Just went to eat here. Service was on par. Drinks fabulous had a michelada and a sangria. Two plates ordered chicken mole and camaron al diabla authentic and delicious. Went next door to the market and took dessert home. Definately will be back! 
22997 4 Great Food. Low priced, good portion. Sweetwater 420 bottles $2.50. I had sweet plantains and a shredded beef lunch special came with rice, beans, plantains, beef, a small salad. for $8. Atmosphere was casual. Great place. 
22998 4 fantastic brisket tacos! also had the carnitas and puffy chicken mole tacos. love this place and cannot wait to eat here again :) 
22999 4 Latte was amazing, and they have nitro cold brew on tap! Super cute, tucked away location too. 
23000 4 Cute place! Seems like a great restaurant for large parties. The shrimp taco is SO good! But also very spicy so be prepared to cry a little. Lol. 
23001 2 Pretty good selection of items. However, the lines are long and take forever. And don't even get me started on the freakin drive thru! 
23002 1 Spoke to another friend last week who also experienced Santarpio's special "Burnt to a crisp" crust ... Hello? Trouble with the ovens? No paddles to reach in and check stuff? 
23003 4 Sweet baby tuna this place is fantastic. The food tripled my magic and endurance... I slayed 46 orcs with nothing but a bonesaw and a 1/4 canteen of water. I am so powerful now. 
23004 3 Fast and and courteous was what I would say about this chain. We went because my inlaws raved and nobody wanted to cook after Thanksgiving. Good breakfast and decent portions sizes. 
23005 0 Update: All my service appointments prior were done at Central Florida Lincoln. So the battery was neglected by Certified Lincoln Technicians. I have since found better qualified service at a non- Lincoln service department. And they speak respectfully to their customers. 
23006 3 The menu is creative and I really enjoy their food! The service is a bit slow but worth the wait. 
23007 1 Good food, but they don't split cards or checks..."without getting in big trouble". It's 2014, split checks. 
23008 4 The Ice Box is where Johnny's used to be, right next to the Clam Box. Yummy flavors, good portion sizes, and happy staff! *hint* if you eat at the Clam Box ask them for $1 kids cone cards. When youre done eating head next door to get your $1 cone! 
23009 4 We visited here for my friends birthday. We had 12 people and 2 kids. We received wonderful service. I highly recommend the Violet Love Martini! Will be back for that drink for sure. Everyone enjoyed the food and atmosphere. 
23010 0 Very rude staff. I immediately found a piece of hair in my food and the cook got made that the waitress brought it back. I will never go back. 
23011 4 My wife and me had a date dinner here and loved it! Great chowder for an inland city! Great service and the price was great for two people! I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for good seafood! 
23012 4 Top 5 favorite restaurants in Portland. I take everyone who visits Portland here first! Everyone is always so mesmerized by how amazing the food is. Really cute spot and the owner is incredibly nice! There is also lots of patio space outside for when it's warmer. Check this place out!! 
23013 2 OK. Different kind of donut place, donuts were good and the atmosphere is....different. Would not take the kiddos back here. 
23014 3 Tasting/chef menu was incredible. I can't say enough good things about the food. The Brussel sprouts, Mac n cheese, short ribs, and shrimp were the favorites. I would give 5 stars but they only serve beer and wine. No cocktails. :(. It was a great place for a big group. 
23015 4 Was not a donut fun until I tried Blue star donuts ! My favories are valrhona chocolate crunch and chocolate almond ganache. They are often sold put by afternoon. So go early ! 
23016 3 Any bowling alley that offers Tropicalia is a win in my book. The wait was fairly lengthy (~45 minutes) and the prices were a little steep, but it was a great time overall. The food is also far better than anything you'd expect from a bowling alley. 
23017 2 A nice enough Dunkin. Small and clean. Nice people working there. Young kids. It wasn't busy at all when I went in, around 1:00 PM. The people working there were chatting with each other. Which is probably why there was no sugar in my medium regular coffee... 
23018 4 Great chicken sandwiches, who needs Chic fil a ? Way better at about the same price ! 
23019 2 Went to the steak in shake last night was having a great night until we got there I know they were busy but waited in line for more than 58 minutes and then the order was wrong but the manager Ben did refund our money and made us fresh food 
23020 3 I felt a bit old here, at least at 9:30 on a Friday night it must be where all the high schoolers hang out. But the I've cream was cold and the place was cute. 
23021 3 Great Thai food. Excellent service. We were there 40 mins before closing and ordered a huge meal. The service was quick and very courteous. 
23022 1 Takes forever, nice clean decor but no character in this place at all, and coffee tastes exactly like every other local coffee place in Vancouver. What's with that? 
23023 4 Best Thai food ever!!! I will only eat this Thai food it is so amazing and fresh!!! The workers are so kind and respectful 
23024 2 This is located in the Porter Exchange so if you want to shop for sports equiptment after your sushi this is the one. I've found it pretty useful for picking up winter essentials like polar fleece socks that I would normally forget if I weren't there for sushi. 
23025 2 Disappointing Sunday brunch, for the price, can do better. Staff not very accommodating. 
23026 4 Seriously this place is near perfect!!! Atmosphere, amazing food and great service. Its now on my top of the list places to go chill with friends. Great job Lechon! 
23027 4 This my #1 sandwich shop in the area. The staff if professional and always put a smile in my face when I walk in the door. High quality meats and bread, the freshest veggies make for a mouth watering sub! 
23028 4 One of my most favorite places in Austin! I took my young boys here today and we all enjoyed the great views and the fragrant purple flowers everywhere. 
23029 4 We really love this place! Not only is it great to come for dessert and coffee it's also perfect for breakfast or lunch! Their savory crepes are absolutely delicious and soups and salads are quite good as well! 
23030 4 Awesome!!! I have been to this place probably 20 times and it never disappoints! The food is delicious! Especially the enchiladas! Best in town! If you go on a weekend evening expect a long wait, but it is worth it. 
23031 4 Love the kids portion of this library. I also really appreciate all of the natural light from so many windows. Being connected to the outdoors is nice while in a library. Kids section has a lot of variety for all ages. Story times are always fill up fast. 
23032 4 We went there today and although they were busier than normal, we still got seated fairly quickly and the good was delicious! 
23033 3 I loved the rabbit ravioli. All of our entrees were wonderful. Service was just right. The charcuterie wasn't our favorite but it was worth trying. We had a souffle desert at was good but the creme brûlée tasted like it had vanilla pudding mix in it. Would definitely come back. 
23034 4 A great meal in a fun atmosphere. Our waiters brought out dessert with a candle for my birthday and sang. I felt like a kid with my family. This is another Rosi hit! Neighborhood restaurant with great drinks. 
23035 3 Dropped in for a mani/pedi while on vacation and got great service with a very long massage. Color choices were a little outdated, but I found one. 
23036 2 A-OK. Always quick delivery. Nice. Decent American Chinese food. This place is our go to Chinese delivery. Just tried the biscuits and basically they are donuts. Delicious. 
23037 4 I recently went to here for lunch, got the Good Wolf Burrito, and it was easily one of if not the best burrito I have ever had. Also, service was good and the bill was cheap, can't wait to go back. 
23038 4 Best waffles I've ever had! Usually a 2 hours wait on the weekends but totally worth it. 
23039 4 Love coming here... The atmosphere is literally amazing and vibrant it's always a great time here. Also, a big thanks to Lee for showing my girls and I a great time and introducing us to the porkbelly taco which was AMAZING btw. I'd suggest anyone to come here. 
23040 4 Barista is amazing. Thanks Billy for the macchiato, which tasted fabulous. Quality coffee and quality service! My husband and I loved everything about it. 
23041 3 If this restaurant were a car it would be a Honda Pilot. Very affordable, massive (portions), convenient (location). But certainly not sexy or the best Tex-Mex I've had (somewhat watery queso etc) but its such a good value I have to give it 4 stars. 
23042 4 OMG!!! Best Mexican restaurant EVER!!! the tacos are amazing Ask for Rene, he's Awesome 
23043 4 Great place for breakfast. I had the oyster omelet which I can only descibe as amazing. House coffee was good. Service was also good. I will go back as much as possible for breakfast when ever I am in Portland. 
23044 4 Haven't had crapes this good since I left NY. They have savory and sweet crapes. Yum. 
23045 3 This place is excellent for a brunch in gastown that you don't have to wait in line for! The service and food were great, and their menu has some unique combinations and options. 
23046 0 If I sold Hummers for a living I'd hang out here to look for new customers... 
23047 4 Love this place! They know their cocktails! I like to go early, sit at the bar, and chat up the bartenders. They have always been friendly and helpful every time I've been. My only complaint, is that I wished they would open at 4pm, at least on Fridays. 
23048 4 Mimosa: 5/5 Eggs Benedict: 5/5 Scrambled eggs and sausage: 4.5/5 Wild mushroom, peas pasta: 4.5/5 Service: 5/5 The atmosphere was added to greatly by the use of a record player. I highly recommend this place. 
23049 2 Yeah...I don't know about this place. Delivery is fast and the staff is courteous. But the actually pizza "study break" with the addition of grilled chicken really didn't have any particular flavor. Bland.com. And I'm still hungry. And the crust was all thin - so the toppings were soggy... 
23050 4 bright open building, good lighting, good coffee. limited open hours is the only draw back. 
23051 4 My favorite Ethiopian place! The ribeye tibs layered over Shiro and a *bunch* of extra veggie sides (I especially love the potato stew...atter?) we come every time we are in town and it never disappoints :) 
23052 4 i haven't read the negative reviews but I've always had a great experience here. Great happy hour food and drink. For prices and quality. and the view and atmosphere is great. One of my favorite spots for date night. 
23053 4 It's all in the broth and this place is the best! The veggie option is one of the best I've had. We keep coming back over and over. The wings are really good too :) 
23054 4 This was a lot of fun and definitely an experience worth trying out. Christian was a good teacher and incredibly good at axe throwing. It is a lot easier than it looks. 
23055 3 The lobster bisque is the best you'll ever have. I have not been in a while but I used to eat the bisque and tuna sashimi and it was remarkable 
23056 0 Interesting. I went to see my review I did a few days ago and it is gone. I don't recommend coco key resort. After prepaying online we were turned away at the gate. Very rude managment. Let's see if yelp keeps this review up. 
23057 4 This is the best place I have found. I get my nails done here, and their pedicures are out of this world, thorough, relaxing, just the very best. Hong and all of the employees go above and beyond. Thank you! 
23058 1 Pasta was just... bland. Like it was missing something. We got takeout to eat at the beach so we didn't have salt on hand but maybe that would've helped. Also found a piece of plastic in my food which was interesting. My plastic fork was perfectly intact so idk. 
23059 3 Great, modern new pizza joint in the Couv! We had the Caesar salad, Margherita pizza, the chocolate concrete and smores sundae. The chocolate cake concrete pretty much changed my life. Definitely worth a visit. 
23060 4 Blueberry Bourbon was fantastic! It was very light if a donut can be considered light. Simply delicious! 
23061 4 Go to Jenna! Not only does she know how to do my blonde so it is one point, she give an awesome shampoo and mini facial at the bowl. Oh, and she has a great personality so you're not bored while getting your locks done. 
23062 4 Unbelievable nice service and delisous food!people very friendly quick service !! Very clean store! 
23063 3 Get my car detailed there once a year and they do a great job. Very good service and lots of help. Satisfied customer. 
23064 3 Must say I was very pleased with the staff and the food was indeed amazing. If you are a little indecisive, then try the pancake flight. Can't wait to visit again! 
23065 4 My better half dragged me here and Im forever changed. The Cure is the best pizza Ive ever had (I typically hate meat lovers but this is unreal good). I've also tried their burgers and was blown away considering its a pizza joint. If you havent been here you must! 
23066 0 Just took my to-go order out of the bag. So hungry. And so dismayed. I ordered a chicken Baja bowl. And I got fish tacos. Really salty fish tacos. And I'm at work so I can't go back. Not happy. 
23067 4 This place has a great selection of food and coffee for a very fair price. It's a fun, quaint place, where the staff is very nice and worth going to if you want to support local businesses. 
23068 4 I love my hair from here they gave me a great price on my hair and I've had it for a few months and haven't had any issues with it besides bad hairstylist lol other than that the hair is incredible I truly recommend this hair. 
23069 2 This place was OK. Do not come here for the food. Just some typical barfood that someone threw together in the back. Not bad if you just want to come here to hang out with some friends and have some beers. 
23070 3 Nice place to come and hang out, walk around, and see others get on the Superman swing. Would definitely come back again. Nice family atmosphere. 
23071 3 We had the sloppy Jacque and crispy chicken sandwich. I loved the crispy chicken. Sloppy Jacque was good but not great. Good place, cool, knowledgeable staff. 
23072 1 EXTREMELY overpriced for such an average pub. Apart from some pretty good beer, everything was perfectly ordinary. About what one can expect to find in Vancouver. 
23073 4 I have only been there once, and loved it I ordered two veg. dishes to go, both were lovely and big portions Would definitely be back 
23074 2 The chicken strips are one of the best I've had! And the Mac and cheese was great too. But I was expecting the corn bread to be much better, not a fan at all. 
23075 3 Ambience service food we ordered the chef special burger ; rich flavor and great fries! Also ordered the lobster roll ...super creamy and flavorful! I like it!! 
23076 4 The look and layout are great with the covered parking lot. The store is overall one of the better looking Safeways I have seen. 
23077 3 great salon! not too pricey, make you feel completely comfortable and extremely friendly staff! great salon! 
23078 4 My wife and I ate there last Friday night, very nice experience and well worth the price. We highly recommend you try it if you're not already a fan. We'll be back. Dress casual is fine, take your time and try the corn chowder. 
23079 1 Food was just ok, service was the most un organized restaurant I have ever been in. They finally brought us plates and bread and two seconds later someone else picked them up. Zero customer cognizance and or concern of all the mistakes. Save your money go to outback. 
23080 3 This restaurant has stood the test of time in Manchaca. They have the typical Texmex fare and have quite a variety of dishes on the menu. Good service every time we've been there and they have something for everyone. 
23081 4 Loved out doughnut! We had chocolate almond ganache. So delicious! Their flavors all looked very interesting. 
23082 4 Got the meatball and "eat your veggies." Loved both, but especially the meatball one! 
23083 3 Not bad. Decent watering hole. Some interesting characters at times. I come with my husband once in a while when we are in the area. 
23084 4 Great food and great service! Happy hour from 4-6pm. The calamari and fundido de Camaron are amazing. 
23085 4 Great atmosphere! I went here on my brother's recommendation and had a great time. The waitstaff was great, and the whole place has a great look. 
23086 3 honest mechanics, if you are knowledgeable about cars, it helps. Fair prices and beats the dealer any day. Ive used them several times, no issues. 
23087 0 Update: my boyfriend woke up this morning and couldn't sit up he was so stiff. His back had bruises all over it. Looks like his back got into a fight. I'm actually glad she refused to do his legs and feet, he might not have been able to walk... 
23088 3 Great selection of offerings! The best salad bar in the area and the sandwiches are jammed packed! Also have a great soup selection. 
23089 3 mmm, my first Kalua Pig since I left Hawaii. It was pretty good, too! As was the mac salad. Price was reasonable. Best of all, it's close to my house. What's more to say? 
23090 4 Scott was thorough, affordable, professional and punctual. He's not pushy and he really knows his stuff. What more could you want? I highly recommend Blue Planet. 
23091 4 We have been using absolute for about 6 months now and love them. The guy who came to do our quarterly treatment today was so incredibly nice and sweet. Highly recommend 
23092 4 Lauren was absolutely wonderful. We came here for our friends 25th birthday (which Fell on a Sunday) and she severed is bottomless mimosas and was great. The food was wonderful and of the course the drinks were great. Bottomless for $12! But ask for Lauren she was awesome! 
23093 4 I love coming to this nail salon - great service, very friendly, responsive staff. They do a great job with my nails while making the experience pleasant. 
23094 4 The octopus was cooked to perfection. Will definitely be back for that alone. But, everything we tried was delicious. Had the Chefs special Salad. For the price, was extremely delicious and I highly recommend this to everyone to try. You will be blown away 
23095 4 Quick service, polite, incredibly easy to deal with and did a great job of cleaning our carpets. Amazing work. 
23096 4 Haven't had crepes this good since I left NY. They have savory and sweet crepes. Yum. 
23097 3 relaxed vibe, full bar, descent food. great place to try and down the street from the food trailer park. 
23098 4 2nd time here, Had the filet and creamed spinach last night, and it was outstanding again. Outstanding service too! 
23099 4 Excellent service, professional, nice atmosphere and good nail technicians. I came with my mom and aunt and we were all happy! Thank you Rose, Donna, and Sophie! 
23100 3 Had the Macha milk tea with pearls at 50% less sugar. It was pretty good. Service was quick and the staff were polite and friendly. Would visit again. 
23101 4 The staff at Therapy Austin are top-notch, and even offer affordable counseling on evenings and weekends. 
23102 4 I love all of the furniture in this store! Everyone is very helpful. Great customer service every time! 
23103 0 el peor café que he tomado en mi vida. 
23104 1 $1 burgers, not that much off the original price but place was packed on a Monday night. Service was fine after you get their attention and prices are good. They have a downstairs but extremely stuffy. 
23105 1 Food is very pricey, wait is around 2 hours on the weekend. Though download this awesome app that allows you to see where you are in line! Hyped up for sure based on its location. 
23106 4 I'm pretty sure this is the best cupcake truck - hell, the best cupcake - in the world. If you're in Austin, see the bats, then get a cupcake. 
23107 0 after many years of this being my main pho spot, this place has really gone down the drain. the rare beef is not rare and of poor quality. the tea cups aren't even clean. 
23108 4 As good as any pizza I've had in the Portland area, up there with Ken's, Apizza Scholls, and Life of Pie. 
23109 3 Oh, for pizza and a beer. Why do people even ask for a menu here? I'm so confused. No wonder they get funny looks. If you wanted something else, you would go somewhere else. I love this pizza. 
23110 1 sat in a booth for twenty minutes with three other people in the restaurant, and never asked for a drink request or stopped by to order 
23111 0 Hated it. No seating indoor outdoor. If you want Dairy Queen then it's best to go to Dairy Queen. 
23112 0 Slow service, multiple apologies, mediocre food, paper thin bacon. You can find better. 
23113 0 An overwhelmed, imaptient and unprofessional waiter. All it takes to spoil an evening. Food was OK but I won't be back. 
23114 1 The seafood bisque was like a flavorless bowl of lukewarm pink milk with some seafood pieces in it. Complained to the waiter. Didn't matter. 
23115 4 Bought my bike there a year ago and couldnt be happier. They offer service there also and they are great. Joey took care of my bike and got me on the road quickly. 
23116 0 If anyone would like to join in a malpractice suit, please contact me. Circumstantial evidence has been found, but we need more proof. 
23117 0 This place is just awful. It says something when even the employees don't pick up the clothes on the floor. Must mean they know the clothes are crappy too. 
23118 4 This new McDonalds is an interesting concept, only drive through (2 of them) and walk ups---no inside dining. It hit the McD spot when I needed it to, with a fast and friendly staff. I'll be coming back! 
23119 4 OMG these donuts are not for the health diet eating people,,these donuts are for those who can eat without guilt,,their apple fritters,,wow,,cinnamon rolls,,,all of their donuts yummy yummy feel my tummy,,,I just love their french kruller,,but its hard to get them as they fly off their displays,,, 
23120 3 Better at the original location in Memphis, but true south fried chicken in Austin in nice to have 
23121 4 This place is awesome. It's really crowded and I hate that the karaoke stops at 1:30 but overall a good time. 
23122 4 So far, in the four months that I have lived here, I have loved everything about this place. Having the garage makes going in and out of the apartment extremely easy. Neighbors are nice and understanding! And the apartment itself is great. 
23123 0 This place is absolutely horrible the management is awful and doesn't care about your living standards I switched rooms in the same apartment and they would not clean the room up after the person moved out I had to do it myself do not live here I'm in hell!!!!! 
23124 3 I dig it here. The customer service is great, and as far as pub grub goes, it's as good as it gets. BTW: It's definitely barbecue centric, so keep that in mind. 
23125 4 Best place in portland to get frozen yogurt! Friendly worker, very clean each time I come in, yummy and fresh toppings, and amazing flavors! 
23126 1 Went in today for lunch. Ordered fatuous salad and they gave me house salad. Very disappointing Pita was good. I should have gone around the corner to Byblos. I had salad there last week. That restaurant is much nicer, cleaner and the salad spot on. 
23127 3 Great Vancouver attraction for tourists & locals. Unfortunately, there is no more killer whales (only beluga's) and it is pricey (about 30$ for 1-2hrs of entertainment)! Definitely worth going once... 
23128 4 As you can tell, I have a thing for grammar. The name alone warrants a stop at this place!! And I love antiques too... 
23129 3 I ordered the chicken and dumplings with string beans. Both were seasoned nicely. There was a nice serving of dumplings. 
23130 1 Extremely overpriced for the products and service. The barista was also eating while she was working and cleaning the cafe. 
23131 1 I have eaten here twice, becuase I get my car detailed next door, and I have always been very underwelmed by their food. Don't eat here unless you just don't have a better option. 
23132 4 We've been looking for a gyro place with awesome, fluffy pita bread and this place nailed it. Their gyro is saucy, huge and delicious - great job! 
23133 4 Dr Zide and his staff are great. I schedule my appointments between meetings and they always keep me on schedule. The selection is good and the prices seem reasonable. 
23134 4 My first visit. Went with two friends. The outstanding waitress made the perfect recommendations for food (appetizers, salads and entrees), beverages, and was exceptionally attentive. Thanks Tina Marie - a memorable lunch for my my friends and me! 
23135 3 Had two great dinners. Nice specials menu. Older quiet crowd, which meant that it was possible to carry on a conversation at our table. A real plus! Convenient parking. Will definitely be back. 
23136 4 Like a Chick-fil-A but better with an Austin twist. Sauces are next level. Pricing isn't too bad, like $12 for a combo. Cool locations. 
23137 4 Delicious breakfast I had my first eggs Benedict and it was awesome with good prices everything under 10$ and nothing but quality must try 
23138 4 The general tsaos is seriously seriously good. We always do pickup and I've never had to wait. The manager always recognizes me which is nice as well. The low mein is great too. Highly recommend the whole place! 
23139 3 This place is great. All sorts of cool rarities to find. Armageddon is the best record store in the area in terms of punk and hardcore music, and rock music in general. 
23140 4 We got TTTY for my daughter's 6th birthday party and everything turned out great. Very friendly staff and kid friendly animals. The kids enjoyed every minute of it. If you want a relaxing birthday party in your backyard, TTTY is a great choice. I'd highly recommend them. 
23141 3 this city is fab! have all you need, friendly people and efficient services. 
23142 4 The pizzas were amazing, Chicago style deep pizza with fresh mozzarella! So yummy. The service was amazing our server Adam was very prompt and courteous. And if it's open until 2 am which is a plus! Would recommend to anyone 
23143 0 I cringe at the thought of ever stepping foot in here again. Everything feels artificial, TVs are blaring in an empty space, and the seating is uncomfortably low and tight. When there are so many better options all along the street, there's no reason to go in. 
23144 4 Very friendly staffs! The best bubble tea in Vancouver! Ingredients are home made and fresh! 
23145 4 Best club in town. Regular big shows come through on the weekends, best sound system in town and the drink prices aren't crazy expensive for how nice the venue is. 
23146 3 Great food & great service! I had the Vegan ingredient Salad with tofu added. It was good but I'm excited to try other things there. 
23147 1 While we had no real issues, there are better options. I chose to pay for the tank of gas but did not know I would be charged to fill it even though I returned it half full. Buyer beware. Location is convenient for drop off and pick up. 
23148 4 Greek style food in elegant vibrant setting Excellent bar Fish, steaks , and classic Greek dishes all good Reservations recommended 
23149 4 They fixed a clog and had my vacuum ready in less than 24 hours. 
23150 4 Love it! Good food, good service, fun atmosphere and very reasonable prices. It's my favorite breakfast spot around Boston but it's good for lunch and dinner, too. 
23151 4 This place is so awesome!! Can't wait till the new location opens!! This is a Must Stop on lake Travis!!! 
23152 4 I got the Hawaiian style chicken bulgogi with a cucumber salad and it was amazing! (Fries are good too!) I can't wait to come back to try more things on their menu. Great service as well. 
23153 3 Donuts here are very good, there's just a little something missing and I don't really know what. I don't know. There's just something about them that it's missing. Still very good though. 
23154 0 My husband got food posining from either the sweet and sour chicken or the chicken wings. He's never been so sick. I'm disappointed, we've had good food from them in the past. We'll have to find another spot now. 
23155 3 Off the main strip in the North End, this place is quietly awesome. Chef food for foodies, awesome gnocchi and tagliatelle bolognese 
23156 2 The place is nice. When I went a while ago, the service was slow. The food was ok. The atmosphere was laid back, the dj was good. Will give it another chance. 
23157 0 No more! Racist waitress!! Burnt buger & mushrooms! No silverware! Attitude given to us right away! Told manager and didn't seem too concerned! I liked Red Robin but no more. Will not give my business to them anymore! 
23158 4 Orange creamsicle doughnut was outstanding. Probably the best doughnut I've ever had. Light, fluffy, and not too rich. Perfection. 
23159 0 Is it because this goodwill is downtown? Everything is so much more expensive than other goodwill stores. Yes, they display quite nicely, but the products themselves are no different to any other goodwill. So why have prices of a second hand boutique store? 
23160 4 Our favorite spot in Portland. Best vegan cheese we've had and the cheese boards are fabulous! We love that you can get them gluten free too. Thank you for that! We go every time we're in Portland now. 
23161 4 Fantasyland is where you find all your characters. A lot of cool rides. Most of them you would need fast passes for. Great view of Cinderella's castle as well. 
23162 2 I love the food. I like the soup and the daikon pancake. The soup has a nice fresh broth. Nice people. I like this cafe because is a family type of a business. The price is right and the food is good. We will come back 
23163 3 Not allot to say other than its my local HEB. I'm there often and most of the time find exactly what I need with a friendly staff ready to assist. 
23164 3 This is a favorite DMV. When I was there, the ring master was humorous, present and effective. Wait short! By the way, I have had great service every time I have needed something solved or a question answered on the phone with the DMV. 
23165 4 We went to the Monday night $5 burger night. The burger was great. The service was cheerful and good. The restaurant handles the whole situation very well even though there is an overflow crowd. 
23166 3 My daughter's new favorite gluten-free pizza in town. Really appreciate their knowledge and sensitivity re gluten concerns. 
23167 4 The best gluten free pizza I have ever had at a reasonable price too. Staff was very friendly. 
23168 1 Typical mediocre overpriced wharf type restaurant. I'm totally fine overpaying for the ambience and location, but have a little respect for the plating and preparation of the seafood dishes. 
23169 4 Wow, great people, very knowledgeable and helpful, definitely the best vet experience I've had even though my cats were giving them hell! 
23170 3 Great food options but this place was incredibly loud inside. It was too the point that you couldn't hear the person across from you. I thought the avocado tacos and the T&T queso were outstanding though. 
23171 3 A unique addition to the neighborhood. Beef and chicken kebab and doner. The plates come with flavorful cous cous and rice sides. Turkish coffee and desserts round it out. Friendly service. 
23172 4 This is my favorite new Thai place. Clean, fast service, excellent and authentic food. The people really care about your experience. 
23173 2 had eggplant with spicy garlic sauce, which was pretty bland, and the chili chicken (which was very fried, but spicy and good). i will try this place one more time but i'm sad that the eggplant didn't work out. $24 for 2 dishes and some rice. 
23174 1 Much better places out there. My wife had a set of gel nails done here and they were super thick and uneven. 
23175 4 Didn't know waffle sandwiches even existed until we stumbled on this place one afternoon, now I dream of them regularly. 
23176 1 This place is good for the money but I rather pay and get the food the best way possible then save a few dallors and get freezer chicken and mild food. Next time go to the real hole in the wall places which have tasty food. 
23177 4 The dounts from this place are fantastic and the peanut butter coffee is to die for. I love it! 
23178 3 A local favourite for me. Tasty burritos, lots of options plus beers and velvet paintings. What more do you need, really? Great spot for quick eats on the run. 
23179 2 Good place for the basics. They have a credit card sign but don't want you to use it. Bring cash for less drama. 
23180 4 Needed my truck towed, for that last time to sell it. They showed up on time. Very professional. Pam who took my call, was very courteous and accommodating. Very fair on pricing for their services. I will choose them first! OUTSTANDING ! 
23181 3 My favorite place for a quiet romantic dinner or gathering with friends. Excellent food, service and atmosphere. 
23182 3 I had some time to kill before an event and I stopped in to order an Irish coffee. The service was fast and the drink was strong and smooth! No complaints here! 
23183 3 Friendly service and they almost always make my drink correctly. It's usually busy with nowhere inside to sit but there's plenty of seating outside on a nice day. 
23184 0 Disappointed. Showed up at 9:20 for dinner on a Friday night and was told the kitchen was already closed. Don't believe the hours on their website. I should mention the Mexican place next door had the same hours posted as 95 and they were more then happy to serve us. 
23185 4 Boy! When I tell you this reminded me of the sensational streets of downtown Havana!!! Todo comida bien! Food priced well, staff very friendly, and everything is tasty! 
23186 0 really expensive & not that good! :( 
23187 4 The food was awesome. This was our 1st meal here. The flavors were great with awesome presentation. We will be back. 
23188 3 Their bubbles are sweet themselves and very tasty. The oolong milk tea is great With the validated parking in University Tower Garage,parking is not a problem any more. The price is the only reason they are not getting 5 stars. 
23189 4 Fabulous quinoa salad Excellent customer service. Very knowledgeable staff. The same menu was available at the bar which made our experience quite nice. 
23190 4 Our server Sarah was so sweet and had great recommendations! We are new to the area, and she took the time to give us some fun suggestions for things to do locally. The food was great as well, and they have a beautiful view of the Colombia River. 
23191 0 My partner liked the food but it made me sick all night. Service was also odd- the server/owner was on his phone the whole time. 
23192 4 I love that they are big, have an amazing selection of Glutten free products and they have a wonderful magazine and book section as well 
23193 4 Jake F did a grrrrreat job! He is a natural at public speaking: engaging, funny, informative, energetic, silly, witty & had good volume. We really enjoyed our tour & wish him the best of luck during his time at Harvard (-: 
23194 1 My daughter and I were on a tight schedule so I called to make an appointment We arrived and waited 45mins. They were surprised to see they needed to remove gel from my nails, though I told them when I called. 
23195 0 I came with some friends today for St. Patty's day. Left at the door when we were told there is a $10/person cover charge and its cash only all night. Lame. 
23196 4 My friend was visiting from Europe and we had a great experience with everyone at this location, great people! Very helpful, Thank you Brian and staff! 
23197 2 Decent food at reasonable prices. Ambiance is odd though. 
23198 2 Living in Dallas and Phoenix, I should have known better than to eat at a Mexican restaurant in Boston. The atmosphere was nice, the service was friendly, but the food is not authentic and not very good. The best part was the white sangria...that was tasty! 
23199 4 Great store. A ton of gaming items you won't find everywhere. Has all the usual suspects GW, Board Games, X-Wing but if you are a modeler/gamer this is the place for you! 
23200 3 I love it here! My girlfriends and I come here for drinks and appetizers. The list of drink options are always fun to choose from too! I love the chicken quesadillas & spinach and artichoke dip! 
23201 4 Lovely experience. Great young couple that runs the restaurant. Yummy drinks and the food was superb. Ordered a multitude of dishes because all sounded so good. Loved the decor as well. Something Newton really needed. 
23202 4 Love them. Everyone is so friendly. Atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. The food is perfect. Everytime i go I try something new and I am never disappointed 
23203 4 Great gelato flavors! We came here after we ate Gio and it's a great dessert place. Many different flavors to chose from too! Will be back 
23204 0 Went with 9 people and the only good items were the french fries and the drinks. Service was also excellent. 
23205 4 Just got my teeth cleaned by Jessica. She did a great job and, as usual, I left very happy ! Everyone here is friendly and helpful. If you're looking for a dentist, this is the best practice I've found in the years ~ 
23206 4 A hidden gem. Friday night bite before a movie. Excellent service. Nice music. Cool vibe! Lobster bun is to die for! Jamaican rum drink is delish also! 
23207 4 Loved it! Great fries and even better home made sauces! Plus a good variety of beers on tap. Just know there is not a lot of seating inside. 
23208 4 Food was amazing and the service was wonderful, amazing Manager too! Our group of 5 was immediately taken care of and was seated right away. Our waitress was attentive and cordial. Food was delivered in a timely fashion and was very tasty! 
23209 3 We love going here on weekend mornings with our one-year old for a very yummy and cheap breakfast. We never wait for a seat, and the staff is really nice. 
23210 2 Kaiten sushi is pure fast food, instant sushi...instant satisfaction! Quality is good for the price and staff is friendly (and cute.) I would be in heaven if they opened up in L.A.! Bottom line...cheapest place in the Pearl haha 
23211 4 Wow their ramen is unbelievably good. Loved their Sapporo-shio ramen. Their hand roll tuna and avocado sushi is also da bomb! 
23212 3 Been here a few times. One of the better individual hotpot places around the lower mainland. Portions are good. Price is decent considering you are cooking your own food. I always leave full. Light years better then firepot in burnaby. Definitely a try if you like hotpot 
23213 4 This place is better than Mike's Pastry. Their cannolis are way more fresh! Also, you don't need to wait because there are no lines! Avoid those lines in Mike's Pastry and go to Parziale's; it's cheaper too. The service is really nice, good attention. 
23214 0 This place is a joke, run by incompetent lying floosies. Even though this is Oregon, there are other, BETTER, options for you to choose from. Steer clear of these turkeys. 
23215 0 The absolute worst service I have ever received. Arrogant and incompetent wait staff. Avoid like the plague. 
23216 3 Snack sizes to try a flavour? YES! Lots of fantastic unique flavored such as maple honey, blueberry honey, Parmesan and herb? YES! Chicken was cooked perfectly well. Will I come back again? YES. Better than pocha and a thousand times better than dasarang ( who gave me raw chicken). 
23217 1 Not a fan of Chipotle. Food is never hot. Tortillas ar always sticky. Cumin is used way too much. Sad excuse for Mexican food. I have never been able to understand the attraction. 
23218 4 Excellent service and pricing. Make sure to bring cash, although you pay when you pick up so they'll let you know how much you owe. I'm a repeat customer! 
23219 4 BEST massages my husband and I have EVER had! Simple as that. (NOTE: My husband had Monique, and I had Alicia.) 
23220 3 Sushi was really fresh - had the "sex and the city" ,"twilight ", and "lady in red". All 3 rolls were delicious. Drink wise, had the lavender fleur and the sweet mule and both were great!! Will definetly come back! 
23221 4 Best beer bar in Portland. Great back patio. Rotating sampler tray everyday. The Italian food cart in back is a nice addition.
