1 4 Great inspection sticker experience. Didn't spend more than 15 minutes total and I was out of there. 
2 4 Really enjoyed my food. I will be back. Reminds me of the Lebanese food from Ohio I miss so much. 
3 2 Had sleep number beds which was interesting if you didn't know your number (i did).. Average hotel. Plus thing was the YMCA that was adjacent that had work out facilities. 
4 3 One of my #1 places for brunch! LOVE any of their options with lobster, almost always paired with a mimosa :) Great spot for dinner too, their staff is always great! 
5 4 I am pretty particular when it comes to my fish and chips, this place is by far the best I have tried anywhere around Portland. We will definitely be returning. Everything made fresh daily. 
6 4 Hands down best Bakery I have been to so far. For the past year I have come in at least once a week for lunch, and they never disappoint. Food is always fresh and delicious. Yum! 
7 4 These guys have amazing food, and also just added an amazing iPhone app for ordering!! 
8 0 The pizza was not very good. The crust was burnt. The bread rolls are flat pieces of burnt bread. The guy who answers the phone for take out is really rude. 
9 3 Excellent service and delish food. Good size portions and yummy. Friendly staff and excellent service. Yummy! 
10 2 Server forgot multiple items: soup, cocktail etc. food was good but not great. Normally tuccis is top notch. I'll be back 
11 4 This place rocks. Vegetarian options are all good, especially the falafel wrap, tofu stir fry, veggie burger and fries. Service is always quick, I go often on my lunch break from work. 
12 4 Excellent service. Food perfectly cooked, ropa vieja is awesome. Tres leeches is a must to tastes. 
13 0 cheap with the food is high in price 
14 3 I gave 4 stars for food, entertainment, and drinks the service sucks like hell!!!! We paid $5 to only have to wait 30 mins for food appetizers and drinks smh. 
15 4 The customer service team quickly worked with me to better understand my concerns and they took very solid and clear concrete steps to fix issues. This team clearly cares and seem willing to do what is necessary to make iPic the best movie watching experience in town. 
16 2 Food is awesome!! I love the avocado margaritas!! The service is not so bueno. 
17 2 Service was pretty good. Friendly enough. Wings were terrible. Quesadilla was average at best. Beer was cold. Shots were generous. Race cars looked cool. 
18 4 It feels like an authentic french bistro. Excellent for brunch, lunch and dinner. I've been here several times and always exceed my expectations! I never eat my meal and dessert at the same place but their desserts are very very good. 
19 4 Delicious food with huge portions. I got the crispy chicken rice plate and it barely fit on my plate with rice, chicken, dumplings, salad and fries. Reasonable prices too. Go here! 
20 4 Great tasting hoagie s stuffed fully 8; 10; 12 inch. Little on the pricey side but worth it. Good fries. Philly theme decor throughout. Not fancy. But good food. 
21 1 Average food and atmosphere. Good service. Basic Asian food. The ramen was nothing special although the noodles were good. Probably good if you live at Mueller but not worth a trip from further away. There are far better options in Austin these days, especially for the price. 
22 4 Monica has been visiting my cat for about 18 months now, whenever I go away. She is so sweet and my cat loves her. I am truly sad that I cannot take her with me when we move next month. Irreplaceable! 
23 4 This place is often packed. So come prepared to wait in line for a while. But the service and the food are both superb! 
24 0 Started out really good Not the quality it was at opening. Kissimmee was good originally too. Can't keep up with the food. What is there for long time is cold and in the danger zone! HACCP! Same that the quality has diminished! 
25 4 very nice person！ love it , a little bit expensive , my tattoo costs 100 dollars.... 
26 1 Having to walk down an alley to what felt like a basement was very odd. The food is ok, but their prices are too high. My margarita was tiny and they wanted $5 (or maybe it was $8) for a refill of chips?! 
27 3 Generous portions; prompt service; hot food. Busy place even in the middle of the week suggests that the locals really like it. 
28 0 I use to like this place but the last meal got me sick for a week. Avoid the pakoras like Ebola. 
29 3 I'm very happy that I've found this place. The staff are friendly and my nails always look nice. The salon is clean and conveniently located for me. 
30 4 I love the hookah lounge. Am going to be a reg every fri you an find me here. but I come before it gets pack. My fav is the ice Hookah. 
31 3 It's a really good place for pho soup. Nice and clean and nice sized portions. It is close and convenient to the office. I come here at least once a week and have never been disappointed. 
32 3 Nice store! Every few months my mom will take us here and we'll get craft supplies. The checkout employees are always ready to help. There is a whole aisle of stickers (my favorite part!!!). There is a huge selection of beads. This is my favorite craft store! 
33 4 Best cup of coffee I have had in a long time. Got a large vanilla latte and it was the perfect temperature. The atmosphere is very Portland to me and I like that. Casual setting with different chairs and couches. I will be back. 
34 3 Always stop in each season. I usually find something to buy. Not trendy clothes but comfy clothes. 
35 4 It's all about the doughnuts here. Very friendly staff, and did I mention, very delicious doughnuts. The coffee isn't bad either, but again, it's all about the doughnuts. 
36 4 So good!! Biscuits are homemade!! Wish I'd tried the jam that another reviewer had mentioned lol I think from my whole Austin trip this was one of my favorite places we ate at. Small menu but it was all so yummy! Must try! 
37 4 Love this place!!! Have been here many times. It's an Atlanta must-do!!! Very intimate setting and eclectic performances. The food is amazing as well!!! 
38 4 Amazing service, great atmosphere in a great neighborhood. The food was hot, we had the buffet. Great authentic German fare. Would recommend it to anyone who's into German good and culture. 
39 4 An Amazing staff. Travis is AMAZING!!!! Miranda was sweet. I have my gourmet drink and I'm ready to go out and ride.... #prettyjuls #castcompliment 
40 4 All I can say is try the Gnocchi Quartet with red pepper sauce and you will know why I gave this 5 stars! The service and ambiance are perfect and remind me very much of a chic Latin American cafe. 
41 4 Hands down BEST Mexican food I've had in the Boston area. Enchiladas Verdes are PRIME- get them almost every time and they've never been anything but delicious! Beef tacos were excellent as well- potatoes in the bottom of the shell made it! 
42 4 Wow! My friends and I just ordered a variety of doughnuts, talk about jaw-dropping. I ordered a Miss shortcake and though I couldn't eat it all, the half was just the cherry on top of a nice night cap! 
43 4 Best Mexican style tacos I've had in this area by far! Will definitely be coming back for more and to try the other items on the menu. Good Mexican food is hard to find! Also, good variety of aguas frescas which is always a treat! 
44 3 Classic local diner kinda place. Coffee ain't Peet's but above average trick stop blend. The pancakes rock. The huevos is my favorite. The breakfast burrito is above average and large. Main thing here is the service. Fast. Pleasant. Love it. Oh, and it's a clean joint too. 
45 3 Very good, thin, not-at-all-greasy brick oven pizzas. Good salads too (although salads are not dinner-sized). 
46 3 This place is dark. This place is jazzy. It's a great after-work place and a great date night place. The service is up to par, but I wish they served food! 
47 1 Went to the lunch buffet today and was extremely disappointed.Service was good and it was clean. But the food was not as good as it used to be. Will try them for dinner but no longer my lunch go to when craving Indian food. 
48 4 Highly recommended. There's no man v food dish on the menu anymore. Quirky setting that adds to the atmosphere. comprehensive menu, delicious food and complimented with a funny lady bringing us our food. All round amazing and worth a visit. 
49 0 Our bartender Erin was super rude and the beer was warm. Music was so loud that you can't speak to anyone. The decor is from the 80's and it's pretty dirty. Won't go back again. 
50 4 Since the long remodel, this place really upgraded. They have an exquisite beer list, good cocktails, a big covered patio and live music. The crowd is pretty posh for Alberta neighborhood. And you have to have their lamb dirty fries! 
51 3 Visiting Orlando we found this place on yelp. Had a craving for wings being from Buffalo I have to say they were very very good the mahi-mahi appetizer was excellent, two-for-one drinks, final word, recommend this place great if you're in the mood for a good All-American meal. 
52 3 Have had the blessing to have eaten here a couple of times. Really good food and service (by the owner and his wife is the cook). Very pleasant dining at reasonable pricing. We are going back!!!! 
53 4 Everything was wonderful! The food was so delicious - I had the grass fed burger, it was so tasty! Went again a few days later and it was just as good. Service was awesome, and there's a great atmosphere. 
54 4 Every single time we go to Beaches, the employees deliver. It helps that they know the majority of our group.. With that being said, they are all very helpful, nice, and the food is always amazing! This is our go-to spot after work, or on weekends. Love the staff :) 
55 4 This place is fantastic. In an converted victorian, it's barely signed form the outside. Inside you'll find alphabetically-themed dessert and drink menus, a grand piano, and lots of cosy tables. Kick off your shoes and spend an evening here! 
56 4 food is amazing. Lots of vegetarian options. I do take out most of the time, because the restaurant is usually packed full of people. Take out is usually pretty quick. 
57 4 This place is hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is phenomenal and the service is fantastic. I love their jalapeno queso and fried fish tacos. I have not had such great Mexican food in my entire life and I'm not a fan of Mexican food. 
58 3 It's great! I found out about it on FotoFood - Boston's Facebook page (facebook.com/pages/FotoF...) after they posted a picture of food from the restaurant. It was GREAT. The wait staff was a little slow, and one woman was rude, but overall, it was a good experience, food-wise. I'd recommend. 
59 4 It was my first time dining at this restaurant. The food was exemplary as was the attentive wait staff. Margaritas were delicious and the flan was sweet and savory with just enough cinnamon. Will recommend to friends and family. Will add this restaurant to my favorites. 
60 4 Spent the day in the city and wanted to try something new, so glad I did! We got 5 small plates and everything was amazing! Will come back again 
61 1 They never have any open check stands. I always have to use self checkout which gives me issues and then I have to wait forever to get help. 
62 3 My favorite of the 3 pizzerias in Bexley. Pizza by the slice, and a nice assortment of pizza types. The staff here was extremely friendly. I will definitely revisit and try some of the different selections they offer. 
63 4 This is a great atmosphere spot. The severs are all nice, upbeat, and attentive. At some point we were greeted by Chef Steve Nichols who was informative and friendly. We stopped in here while traveling and we're NOT disappointed!!!!! Try the Brie Fondue while you are at it :) 
64 3 Reminds me of my moms Tortas growing up except the portion is much larger. Very delicious and authentic. I would certainly be returning soon! 
65 3 Love this place. Old school - reminds me somewhat of the Northend joints in Boston. Very good food and very good service. 
66 3 This place is yummy. I have eaten here for brunch, lunch and dinner. My favorite meal is the migas they serve during brunch. The people watching from their over sized windows out onto Congress is very entertaining. I look forward to my next meal here. 
67 4 Friendly folks, jammin salsas, good simple food, pretty dang cheap. Grabbing Casita and then going to Irie Bean for coffee before work is the best breakfast in town. 
68 3 B&G is delicious. I went with my parents and got the Lobster Roll. Pretty pricy but the seafood is very fresh. Props to Barbara Lynch. 
69 3 The shrimp pho is FANTASTIC! My favorite pho ever! The vermicelli bowl with pork and spring rolls was delicious too, but the pho is the best. Atmosphere is a bit like a cafeteria, but the food is great! 
70 4 My Brothers Place is my favorite pizza place in Wakefield. I like most of their food, but the buffalo chicken is the standout in any form - pizza, calzone or wrap. I've also recently tried the falafel which is really good when I want to mix it up. 
71 4 Came in with no appointment and they were so accommodating amd nice. Thank you so much for the amazing service ! 
72 0 Food was decent but the server was practically abusive - whatever you do don't get chris c. as your waiter. 
73 1 Looooong wait for Denny's quality food. No explanation for a 40 minute wait for 2 kids meals and 2 salads. Restaurant was not even half full, a Wednesday night. Will not be returning. Definitely not your average Joe's... far below it. 
74 4 This place is just amazing. Delicious and fresh. Their drinks are unique and wonderful. Great for a date night or a night out with friends. 
75 1 too many people working there walking around and asking if i need to be helped. pay attention and realize that 6 other of your co-workers have surrounded me asking if i need help. i am fine. go away. let me peruse the booze. 
76 4 WOW !!! I would give this place SIX STARS!!! Fridays in Lent are no penance if you can enjoy their blackened Haddock a REAL mash! And be sure to get a cream doughnut or cream filled eclair with chocolate. Oh, and do have a nice cup of tea. 
77 4 Happy hour was great. We had the Derby nachos. The chips are dusted heavily and are medium spicy. If you bite into jalapeño it becomes spicy. I loved it. My wife thought it was too much. Great beer selection. Great atmosphere. Incredible staff. I will be back for sure. 
78 2 Very decent facilities, one person only... The privacy is nice but lines are a potential downside, coloring and decoration scheme remains, solidarity is nice. 
79 3 Very good food. Only issue is ordering food. People at restaurant seemingly avoid answering the phone to take orders. But when you get the food, it's very good 
80 4 The staff are super friendly and the food is amazing! I had the crab linguini and I highly recommend it! If I lived in Portland, I would be back! 
81 4 Nice guy, great pizza! Really good crust, I loved the pennybacker. You will too if you like pep and bacon! 
82 4 This was a great hotel, located in the heart of Buckhead. The room service was delicious- the staff very friendly, and the lobby bar had a great atmosphere (and really yummy flat bread appetizers!) 
83 4 My friends and I went to Columbus to celebrate a birthday and wanted to try The Melting Pot. Everything was perfect. Food was delicious, we ordered the White Chocolate Creme brûlée as our dessert and it was outstanding. Definitely request Brittany as your server, she was wonderful. 
84 4 One of my favorite spots to unwind after work. Tammy is a delight as well as all the onther ladies :) 
85 4 What a clean and friendly place. Coco was great. It was the best experience I have ever had at a nail salon. 
86 4 Amazing classes with highly skilled teachers. Cleanest gym I've ever been to. Love that there is no cell phone use allowed in the gym and that there isn't blaring music playing over the loud speakers. 
87 4 Absolutely great food. The spicy box is real fun with the flavor. On a cold afternoon, enjoyable hot, spicy food. Need some such food trucks back home !! 
88 4 Had pizza from here last night. Delicious tandori chicken pizza, really like the jalapeños too. Great flavor. Also really enjoyed the pepperoni pizza. Overall, great pizza crust, sauce, cheese and toppings. Must try especially if you want some unique pizzas! 
89 2 plain cheese pizza well done was the only thing i ordered. it arrived 25 min late (as in an hour and 25 min from when i ordered) close to cold and barely cooked through. meh. 
90 1 Not a fan-felt rushed, pad thai was just odd (had whole eggs and tomatos?). Wouldn't go back. 
91 4 I've been rocking with Onyx for years. My boy Yahdo over at the Northcrest shop always hold me down ..thanks. 
92 3 I've eaten at this restaurant several times during the past two years. The food is good quality, service average. I was hassled about not leaving a tip on my last visit...which will be my last visit. 
93 3 They have pretty creative dishes that taste great and can be enjoyed in an upscaled ambiance. They also have excellent service, although that evening there was a new and unexperienced waiter who had coordination issues pouring water into our cups. 
94 3 Had the grilled Caesar, was excellent. Staff was great and the place looks very nice, will definitely be back! 
95 1 Mary Chung is OK. Only go here if you don't feel like going further off Mass Ave to get to Mu Lan. For what its worth none of the Chinese people I work with like Mary Chung. 
96 4 The food is great and plates are shareable. Really likes the spices and flavour Of our food... the music was good and the atmosphere was upbeat! Will definitely go again! 
97 3 Great chill spot to grab drinks with friends. So many options on Rainey but this place had a great vibe. Nice bartenders and good stiff drinks. A great Austin bar. 
98 4 This is my favourite out of all the parks in florida. The roller coasters are brilliant, and seeing the dolphins is just amazing. Make sure you buy some fish to feed the dolphins, its unbelievable having them that close and eating from your hand. 
99 2 It use to be called Safari. They renovated, but it's like putting lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. The rooms are average. I had a view of a parking lot. The air is a wall unit. 
100 1 Experienced the Mango/Carrot smoothie. Will not waste another $5.95. The after taste is bitter. The size is huge, so I feel guilty to throw it away. Suggest a smaller size. 
101 2 Neighbors has a great porch for hanging out and drinking. The inside of the bar is pretty gross. But there is a shuffleboard and there are darts. The food is surprisingly decent for such a gross interior bar area. 
102 4 Great Portland style coffee shop on the westside. Great atmosphere to work independently or with a small group. They have a meeting room you can reserve if you are meeting a group of 8. They use local roasters and bakeries. 
103 4 I miss blossom tree! I used to go here all the time for lunch when I went to GSU! Great food for a good price. I really enjoyed their tacos. Always friendly girls at the register. 
104 4 Sheryl, the supervisor was amazing. I will totally be back! Place smells of a great burger and Kate, our server, was awesome as well. 
105 1 Here is my suggestion for the owners. Go to Press Club wine bar in San Fran. Try to duplicate by the glass quality and value, and then you'll be able to call your establishment a wine bar. Mediocre wine at premium prices. 
106 4 Brand new Columbian Coffee and Coffee Roaster in Lake Mary. Excellent coffee! Lots of unique brewing methods and you can buy fresh roasted coffee on the spot. Limited pastries however other breakfast food is apparently coming soon. 
107 3 Cool little place! Smoothies were pretty good but not any better than what I can make at home. Still, I really enjoyed it during my trip to Orlando. Love the location! 
108 2 Went several times,used to like it, BUT recently the sauce became too watery, just not enough flavor. Disappointed, hesitate to go again, hope there will be some improvement. 
109 3 This is a great, comfortable spot with nice drinks and good food. On weekends it can get ridiculously crowded which for me, so ain't worth it. Great on Sunday evenings or mid-week, even Thursday. But I'd avoid it like the plague Fri/Sat. Nice staff, too. 
110 0 While I love the product, the service is deplorable. Negative attitudes, and the cashier never looked at me while she took my order. Pointedly looked anywhere BUT at me. Is the management that desperate for help? I work in a service industry and rarely find myself appalled. 
111 3 Casual little Italian restaurant. You can seat yourself at a table, bar or even at counter top in front of the open oven pizza stoves to watch the chefs prepare the food. The food was top notch and easy on the pocket book. 
112 4 I've been here a few times, each with a different employee. Each experience has been great! I never remember the names of who helped me but everyone is kind and great at their job! 
113 3 Went for lunch. The food was really good and tasted very fresh. Had the chicken sandwich. My only complaint was the food took a lot longer than expected. Very nice presentation, especially the tea selections. 
114 4 I just found this place it's me second time in three days I really like the sushi here good prices and nice to pick up quick to bring home and eat like a fatty such as myself. 
115 4 Best non-traditional breakfast in the city. Arrive early and be prepared to wait in line. Try the cassoulet, lavender lattes, and the waffles. 
116 4 This place NEVER disappoints! Great quality food at reasonable prices!! Sad they took out the arroz con pollo off their menu, it was amazing!! 
117 4 The pool is amazing! They need to add a fob entrance to the gym on the pool side. But the people are amazing and we have had no issues that were not resolved immediately. 
118 2 We stopped here for lunch. The Chilean Sea Bass Bento Box was pretty good. You definitely get your moneys worth. For $10 I got a lot of food. The miso soup was cold, but tasted good. The California Roll was really good. I would go here again. 
119 0 This motel was disgusting! Immediately reeked of cigarettes and had multiple and I mean multiple stains on the comforter!!!! Nasty as hell yall b advised!! 
120 4 Awesome Chicago style deep dish pizza! It takes about 40 minutes for the pizza to get cooked; However it is so worth it! Will definitely come back! 
121 4 So delicious! I went there for brunch and had the hash. It was perfect. Great vibe & great food. Can't wait to try dinner there too! 
122 2 Great atmosphere but service was slow at best. Ordered same drink special twice to have it made two completely different ways. Waited 15 minutes to get drinks and only two other people were upstairs with us. Great place to watch a game though. 
123 4 Best fried chicken and cobbler--no bull-- At this joint with a neighborhood pull. Hard to say which is sweeter, The tea or the greeter; Your gut and your heart will be full. 
124 4 The Spella macchiato, my favorite cup of coffee in a town full of great cups. 
125 4 We love this place! Been there twice and both times the food was great and service phenomenal! 
126 3 Came here several times both for dine-in & takeout. Good portion and quality for its price, especially their mala pot. 
127 0 This restaurant is the worst I have ever been to. The service was nonexistent, we finally got salads, then we were never offered entrees. A while later someone came by and offered us dessert, I said we didn't get entrees I'll take the check. 
128 3 Fun, lively place with good music. Great to take visitors to, right on the water. Can be hard to hear and is always crowded, so expect to wait. Lobster with a clambake (mussels, corn, potatoes, clam chowder added to your lobster) is always a good choice... 
129 4 Yum!!!!!!! Is all I got really. Lol! Got the pork belly, Mac n cheese, mushroom salad, sausage, 2 macarons. They were all so good! We were full otherwise we would have gotten more. This is the kind of place that makes me wish I live in Vancouver. 
130 4 Is by far the best restaurant we have ever been and always is a pleasure the food the service and everything in general is excellent 
131 4 This place is among my favorite restaurants in the area. The food is great- the best Singapore noodles I've ever had. Service is fast and extremely accommodating. 100% suggest going here. (Side note: come here with 5 people or less, it's not really a place for more people than that.) 
132 2 Good RB, but it did not live up to the hype. Good in a pinch. Fries were lousy. Roast beef was overcooked, did not look anything like the picture. Kelly's is better. 
133 3 Really good quick service - everyone who was working there was quick to take a plate or bowl and replenish our drinks. The pho was as good as the next guy, same thing with the price. I primarily like them because of the great service! 
134 4 This place is amazing from the friendly service to the fantastic food to the breath taking views. 
135 0 Horrible service, I had to repeat my order multiple times and the people I was with didn't get their order. The server left "early" so our table was left to no one. Taking my food to go next time. 
136 3 This is a fun creative place to go for super sweet and gooey donuts. I had the captain crunch vanilla donut and it was amazing and super sweet! 
137 4 AMAZING! The food is delicious and all locally sourced if not from their very own farm. The atmosphere is wonderful as well and the servers are very attentive. The menu is varied and the sommelier is helpful as well. Make a reservation; it gets crowded! 
138 4 Went with my brother and cousin and each of us enjoyed the food tremendously. I had the breakfast burger + fries and it was great. Friendly staff and a chill environment. I will definitely go back! 
139 0 Todd Jefferies is a dumbfuck. Conservative rhetoric regurgitated from the asshole of Rush Limbaugh. Poison audio. 
140 4 they have the best sesame chicken i have ever tasted. and the thai drunken noodles are the bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
141 3 Great food. Love the teriyaki sauce they use on the rib dish! Also like the choice between white or brown rice. A nice go to for lunch in downtown Vancouver. 
142 4 Worth the trip, even on a hot summer day. Migas taco was my fav. Cucumber aquas fresa was refreshing a light 
143 4 The carrot cake French toast is LIFE CHANGING! At this moment I want to do a praise dance. BTW our server Mark was awesome and worked with us on our strange dietary restrictions. 
144 4 Great luxury and friendly staff! I love the luxury setting and the comfort it allows you to splurge on! No other theater will ever do! 
145 4 Great Service. They are professional, prompt, and deliver as promised. I had a great experience here with service on my Jeep. I had heard good things about them before, and I was not disappointed. 
146 3 This is a great local spot in Southie. Large U shaped bar with attentive staff. Great food - pot pie, nachos, any special dish! 
147 3 Burger was a solid 4. Service was a 10!! Emiani and Alex were outstanding!! Greeted me at the door and continued from there. Never waited for anything. Definitely recommend. 
148 4 The food is soo good & the staff are very friendly & do really know what's in their menu. 
149 3 Lovely selection of traditional Spanish tapas. Great menu to order multiple items and for sharing. Nice wine list. Laid back atmosphere. Certainly worth the visit. 
150 3 If you're in the mood for some papusas this place will meet expectations. Good. Affordable. Great place to meet up with a group of friends for drinks and filling food. 
151 1 Not impressed. The food was not so great. The service was not upbeat or fast. I was really disappointed. The prices were way too high for then quality. 
152 3 Bring your dog! They have a dog menu, so cute! A clean and well lit restaurant with a huge selection of breakfast foods. Cute chicken decor all around. Staff was friendly and provided great service. Lots of business people on a Friday morning. 
153 0 "We'll call you if anything changes and we can't make it." ...4 hrs later, no electrician has showed up, no call, and no return of my call. I could make it to the job site on time-- why couldn't they? 
154 4 What's not to love? The guys that work this cart are great and friendly. The steak burrito is by far my favorite. Add a lot of hot sauce and guacamole and you have the best lunch! 
155 1 Extremely hot!! One of the reason I got a gym membership is because is too hot to run outside.. This place is ridiculously hot.. Don't get a membership here!! 
156 3 everything in one place. My husband loves Demi-Sec champagne. It's hard to find. But Kappy's always has it. Along with anything we are looking for and some other things that are much more rare. What DSW is to shoes, this place is to alcohol. 
157 4 Great food... Classy feel with the plates and silverware yet comfortble like a nice good family diner. Amazing music if your a fan of Indy. Perfect portions. 
158 2 These guys make a mean tuna roll. The filling: tuna, mayo, relish, tabasco, onions. Yum. Besides, Monty worked there way back when. 
159 3 Just back from taking a group of 21 for a lunch. Service and food were excellent. We got charged a 17% service fee for group which they clearly explained ahead of time. 
160 4 AMAZING burgers ! Great environment, great staff, a little hectic/ busy but I can definitely see why, Jose did awesome serving us ! Will definitely be coming back and highly recommend ! 
161 3 Great breakfast place with quality ingredients. The San Antonio Skillet was great. Another person had the eggs and pancakes. That was a great choice! I would like try brunch. 
162 3 The new S&S in Roslindale is sooo much better than the old one that was replaced. It feels good to have a nice place to shop in your community. Although this S&S is not a Super S&S, they do have a bakery, and a decent deli. 
163 4 Such a nice man and my clothes came back perfect. The cherry on top is how inexpensive it is-- ideal for a student budget. Will be very sad when I have to move and find someone new because no one will ever be able to live up. 
164 3 Ordered to go and picked up for my family while on vacation. Excellent chinese food the fried rice was super soft and very tasty. Lo mien, and hunnan beef both terrific as well. I'm not even much of a Chinese food fan but I enjoyed this. 
165 4 Love the congee and the fried donut. Huge portion. 2 of us barely finish 1 order of the congee set 
166 3 Why not. The waiter/bartender was super friendly. The food was okay, but really cheap! Scorpion bowl and platter of fried food should be something you'd crave for. Their $1 happy hour menu was good too. 
167 4 It may take a while to get your food but it's sorta the ambiance. Burgers very good and reasonably priced. Will sell you beverages in line. just saying. 
168 4 Really cool and unique location. The setting is just awesome. I had a Diego bowl and it was absolutely fantastic. These guys know what they are doing... 
169 4 Very new but a nice little spot where one can get some tasty Halal options without having to go too far. 
170 0 Manager looked like he was 15 years old and was a huge d-bag. Would never go back to this ABC, how about you hire people that have a tiny clue about the products they sell or how to be nice in general. 
171 1 The food is good here, but I have had nothing but bad experiences with their waitstaff. I will not sit down to eat in this place, but i still really enjoy their food. Great for take-out, but I wouldnt come here for a dinner with my friends or family. 
172 4 Love this place! One of my favorite spots in Boulder...great cocktails, excellent food, perfect ambiance and super friendly service...definitely worth the trip! 
173 0 Oy. Food poisoning two times in a row, months apart. I won't be coming here again for any of the sandwiches. I'm sure the soup here is still fine, and the chicken pot pie too but avoid this place unless you want to take a risk. 
174 4 Incredible I've been frequenting the chestnut hill shopping center location for almost 20 years... And have owned the cookbook for almost a long as I'm not always close. Thanks Rosie 
175 0 Zero star. Three person per party. Deceptive. Be aware of this restaurant. They charge tax and tip on your final. And collect additional tips. Go elsewhere where the restaurant owners do not take advantage of their customers. 
176 4 I love this place! The tikki masala is addicting...seriously! Great quality and price. 
177 4 Yummy tacos and chips, salsa & guacamole. I particularly enjoyed their Shrimp Tacos! My hubby loved their Carne Asada Tacos. Great vibe in this place. We will be back! 
178 1 Not impressed with the burgers at all. There was absolutely no flavor in the burger. The only reason I gave them 2 stars was for the quickness of the service. There also several option to add to a burger that has no flavor. I was so hopeful. 
179 3 New takes on classic comfort foods that were well executed, particularly the mac and cheese. Minor criticism is limited beer selection and more of note, noise that can at times be deafening and make it impossible to speak with your dinner party. 
180 4 Excellent service and caring physicians. Got in quickly and was given valuable information during my visit. Highly recommend. 
181 4 The food is great! Had the boss hog and a bloody mary. Shit so good you want to slap your momma. I finished my food and ate more. The service was great and drinks were kicking. Best bloody mary I have ever had. Try to get amanda as your server. 
182 4 Every time we come here the place is great. The service is perfect and the food is fantastic. The place looks nice and it is a lot of history being in College Park. 
183 3 Good sandwiches and usually quick. Solid spot for lunch although they can get busy so I usually just call my order in ahead of time. 
184 3 Hit or miss on the food selection but overall pretty good. The servers are SO friendly here. And for the amount of food I usually eat, it's worth the price. Come hungry. 
185 3 Some of the best burgers you will eat period. Only knock on any of their locations is the seating. Great food, service and speed 
186 4 Great food, prices, and service. The waiter told me he loved me. I told him I loved him too. Not too heavy on the potatoes, which is great. Great nan. Comfortable. The owner came around and personally checked on us 
187 4 Thanks Darcee and Cracker Barrel for a wonderful experience! The breakfast was excellent as well as the whole staff on arrival and departure from your restaurant 
188 3 After having breakfast at some of the top rated breakfast restaurants in Vancouve and being very disappointed, this was a pleasant surprise. Great breakfast and service. 
189 2 Really thin noodles which look kinda like instant noodles. Not as chewy as the other types of ramen. Quite pricey considering how much meat and noodles you get. No line up, so I guess it's A-OK if you're hungry and craving for a hot bowl of Japanese noodles. The end. 
190 4 Brought this box of joy home this morning! BEST CREAM PUFF EVER!! I'm sure other pastries are good as well. I'm definitely coming back for more. If you love pastries. THIS IS THE PLACE! The price is as good as the food. 
191 4 Delicious, moderate priced food, great music and quick service. All in all, would recommend for quick yummy lunch. 
192 4 So impressed by the friendly staff and amazing food. I ordered the scallops and glad I did. Expect to wait on your food but you should anyway if you are going for fresh! Excellent excellent service! 
193 3 This place is super close to Northeastern and has really good desserts. A huge peanut butter cup, all warm and gooey. Delicious. 
194 4 I love this place and my kids do, too. Cheaper and healthier than snacking at many other places with great flavors and many toppings. I recommend them! 
195 4 Honest, great people!! They always help me out when we are stuck. Thank you! 
196 4 came here because it was really close to home when i thought i had the flu. the staff was awesome and really nice and they saw/treated me right away. the facility is ridiculously clean as well which is a HUGE plus for me. thanks guys!! 
197 3 Great, original food. Cool ambience. Fun location with lots to do close by. No sushi on the menu though if that's what you're looking for. I would highly recommend to any foody portlander. 
198 4 Really happy a neighborhood breakfast place opened near this area that we can walk to on the weekends. Food & service were great. Excited that it's here, sad because it's so good it's going to get popular & crowded fast. 
199 4 First time in today!! JT was awesome! !! Place is definitely I'll go back to!!! Great experience 
200 3 friendly atmosphere. live music. killer location. great prices. nice range of beers. lot of rock music and super fun place to hang around or to pub crawl. 
201 3 Good tasting pho, adequate portion, pleasant service, good decor. I eat pho 2 or 3 days / week at numerous establishments. I recommend this place. 
202 4 Great night tour even though it was raining. Our tour guide, Kaitlin, was awesome! Spoke clearly with theatrics, loudly! Definitely would recommend this even if you already toured in the day time 
203 4 Went on a field trip with my son and it was very entertaining! Love the costumes and very informational. The people were great and very funny with the kids. Loved the set up and the ship, wished we could of stopped at the gift shop, maybe next time! 
204 1 I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak without bell peppers. It was a $10 sandwich, tiny and dry. The meat was chewy and overcooked and there was barely any cheese. I was expecting a cheesy, juicy sandwich on a nice toasted roll. What I got was nothing close to my expectation. 
205 0 This place is NASTY! Complete with rats running around inside! If you value your health and well-being stay away from "merengue restaurant"!!! 
206 2 Decent food. Great concept. I'd love to try a few more items. I wasn't over impressed though, but shall return for a visit. Service was great. 
207 4 cmon. the best grilled sauges ever. Talk about old school you gotta love this place. been eating here for years 
208 4 Service was quick and the food was fresh + so tasty ! Love the vibe and would definitely come again !! 
209 4 Get the Lava and a dipping sauce or the combo with two. My wife loved the cabbage rolls and my chicken kabobs were wonderful. Busy upscale look with fair prices. 
210 4 We were in from New york and heard about the food truck scene. We came in from the east and CB's was one of the first we saw. Had chicken skewers. Tender. Tasty. And just the right amount. $4 each. We'll be back. 
211 4 The kid's menu pizza is a great value and you can't argue with a playground to keep them entertained. The best part of the meal was our service. Rylee greeted us with a smile, seated us immediately and then proceeded to provide excellent service. Thank you Rylee! 
212 0 Only one person for returns and booking, one hour waiting, 5 parties still before us to pick up. Avoid this place. 
213 0 Came for an eye appointment today at 1pm. They were already 30-45 mins behind. A bit frustrating. Especially for a Monday. Suggest going to another campus if you can. I ended up not even being seen until almost 4pm. 
214 4 Very good chat 5 for 5 best I have had in greater vancouver so far didn't try much of their other stuff 
215 2 Mediocre service and pizza was a bit too salty (ordered #25, the biotech). If you're a local perhaps it's worth supporting local businesses. However, if you are touring around Boston, I'd probably invest my money and time elsewhere a little more satisfying. 
216 3 Burgers were out but blue plate (fish-n-chips) were tasty 
217 4 Great museum! A must for history buffs and political junkies! I was impressed at the quality of the presentation and the clarity of explaining the course of JFK's presidency. It is housed in a beautiful building as well, with views of the harbor. 
218 2 The most overpriced rabbit food in the lower mainland. Good for a self esteem boosting smoothie from time to time but I ain't paying $15 for carrots in a bowl 
219 3 Very unique way of dining. Delicious food! Expensive Ethiopian beer. For 3 of us with $16 meals, the bill was $120 total with a total of 7 beers. 
220 4 I have used them as a wedding cake bakery. My cake was delicious and very moist. The staff was very easy to work with and really made my wedding day special. 
221 4 Robyn is packing them in at the bar today, Veterans Day 2016Not a seat to be found. We called to make sure she was working today. Great hospitality, service and food. Yay Robyn! 
222 1 Great coffee. But staff has a "Too cool for school" attitude. Completely distracted by each other and careless resulting in orders being forgotten and drinks taking way too long to be made even when quiet. Maybe drop the attitude, keep the smiles and laughs and step up your service game. 
223 4 Food is good as long as is cooked at the moment. Loved the soup of the day, the large portion is huuuuuge! Definitely will be back 
224 4 Dog friendly which is a great plus. They have a smaller version of the grant park farmers market on Sunday mornings and service here is excellent. The inside is very spacious. 
225 3 The place itself smells pretty funky, but the portions and taste from what I've tried so far is very good. 
226 0 Kept me waiting 40 minutes for a takeout pizza. Once the befuddled counter man found my pizza it was of course cold. I got my money back and refused a free pie. A bad operation. 
227 4 Recently came in because I was craving a gluten fix. Pizza is by far the best I've found locally. Crispy thin NY style crust. Love being able to pop in for a fresh hot slice. 
228 4 The bartender David is awesome!! Makes the best drinks! Fun and attentive and great customer service!! I order the "it's all in the hips" and I loved it! Very cool bar and venue! 
229 4 We loved the shrimp-wrapped scallops, but next time I might order a side of noodles, as the portion wasn't large. Also really enjoyed the rigatoni with Italian sausage. Lastly, the complimentary cheesy bread was great! And the $40 sangiovese went nicely with the meal. 
230 3 Great location of this awesome sandwich chain. 
231 4 Bret was awesome! Spoke when spoken to, I like it that way! Very good therapist! I'll be back soon! 
232 3 This place has great sushi! So I give them a 4. They have recently moved to a new location, and no longer offer half off sushi on sundays....total disappointment Nevertheless the new location is beautiful, more attentive servers...good spot for a casual date night 
233 4 Great food and wonderful service! We are repeats customers. Bonus is that their outside patio is dog friendly! 
234 4 My husband and I were excited to try the new Barrel and Boar for our birthday. It did not disappoint! Service was quick, the food was outstanding, and the drinks were on point. We spotted the brunch menu on the back and made a reservation for the next day! 
235 4 tapas style, urban contemporary atmosphere. Excellent dishes. I suggest the rare Wagu Beef on the hot rock, for the taste, and the experience. Overall great location. Be advised they only serve beer & wine, no liquor as their is no full-bar. One of my favorite places in Austin. 
236 2 There is a minimal vegetarian food. The only true opinion is Lo me in btw please taking down my Hindu gods as your decorations 
237 1 First visit will be the last visit. Bartender was friendly, fun environment. Tab was $25.44 for 4 beers. 2 Pearl Snaps and 2 Stash IPAs. Over $6 for one beer!!! No thanks. 
238 3 Well kept, open, peaceful one of the North Shores best natural places. 
239 0 The food is bland. Ive eaten here 3-4 times over the years and it's always the same. I have a friend that moved her from Cuba and he has the same opinion. 
240 4 Wonderful, traditional desserts. I've visited 4 times and gotten something different each time. You'll be able to tell the difference in the high quality and fresh ingredients used in the desserts that you often don't find from other bakeries. 
241 4 We ordered the Gnocchi with butternut squash which had a savory and sweet flavor. A must have! The meatball and sweet beets with goat cheese was the perfect start. We were served in 20 minutes! 
242 0 Called Green Cleaning for the past two weeks to make an appointment and didn't get a call back. I called amazonlocal, where I bought the coupon, to get a refund. Awful way to run a business. 
243 4 Nick is knowledgeable, wonderful, diligent, responsible...outright amazing. Nick managed a bunch of work for us as we moved in to a new office. Choose Gage. No question. 
244 4 Had a great experiences from start to finish. Larry make great recommendations based on my home theatre budget and everyone was prompt and professional from start to finish. Great service. 
245 4 Fantastic coffee with very friendly service. Great pastry options as well. I love the seasonal hand-pies and the Nutella pastry. It is a bit pricier than Starbucks but everything tastes better. 
246 4 excellent small family owned Greek restaurant. I've been to Santorini Greece several times and can attest for the authenticity of this place...not to mention the warm welcome we get every time we walk in the door. 
247 4 Cleaned dryer vent which goes through the attic to the roof. Crawled up into the attic and had to disconnect the ducts to get the job done. Lint was pretty clogged after 10 years. Dryer works better now. Thanks Dustin for the coffee mug too. 
248 4 I so love this place. Been going here for over 10 years and it is always the best. I do not mind driving into Austin for their great food. 
249 4 unique and delicious food. good drink selection. all at great prices. friendly staff as well, which is hard to find! 
250 4 This is my favorite Starbucks! All of the employees are very welcoming and make it a point to get to know you, beyond just your drink. I have been coming here for 5 years now, and although the staff has changed, the overall spirit has remained high. 
251 2 Meh! Breakfast was ok. You get a tiny serving of potatoes and a huge serving of runny refried beans on the side. My coffee tasted burnt. The tortillas made up for the runny beans. Service was great! I'll give this place another shot and try lunch next time. 
252 1 After being seated, we waited over 40 minutes for our meal. Watery coffee didn't help the wait. Considering how small the restaurant is (maybe a 30 top?) It shouldn't be this difficult to eat breakfast. Especially scrambled eggs. I won't be returning. 
253 3 The views are awesome. The food is good, a little pricey. Staff is great. Definitely a good local seafood restaurant. 
254 0 Awful. Rip off artists and sh!t food to boot. Stay away at all costs 
255 4 Awesome I love they have more than 1 location now. The cream puffs are great BUT Paris Brest still the best! Michelle was so helpful with where to eat in the neighborhood!!! Great design in this location KEEP THE STORES COMING 
256 4 Tried this place for the first time a few days ago. The lemon bundt cake was delicious. It was so moist, falvorful, and it was beautifully made. Can't wait to go here again. 
257 4 Excellent place for some authentic asian food. The hand chopped noodle taste really good. My favorite dishes are - Beef noodle soup, Dim sum and green onion pancakes. 
258 3 This is the best Brunch.. I have ever eaten. Great food and service hands down to South Congress Cafe.. I will see you soon to explore other items. 
259 3 Alright service and prices. More casual and sporty compared to finding something really edgy or elegant. Pretty comfortable and decent quality. Organized and clean price and a pretty well decorated store. Nice simple or brighter colours are available 
260 4 Such a gorgeous store! I always bring my out-of-town friends to check it out. It's a must-stop on Mississippi. 
261 4 I love Seaworld I have been here so many times that I can't even count them they always add new and exciting rides the Manta ride is a killer ride ( in a good way) The crew keep it very clean even there restroom 
262 3 Service is good. Its one of the coolest dive bars. The customers are in control of the music, so come prepared w cash to put into the machine lol. FOOD IS GREAT for a dive bar 
263 4 green papaya salad. is. to. die. for. seriously, plus the waitstaff are extremely polite. 
264 4 The best pizza around! And great that they have vegan options. Friendly staff and excellent service. Delivery is awesome too. 
265 4 Friendly people. Good service. Fresh salads seasoned just right. My husband and I enjoyed. Happy hour 3-6. 
266 4 Both egg sandwiches and latte were great! I highly recommend rosemary frittata with spinach. A nice place to begin your day! 
267 4 We love it here! Rolls are so good. Husband says the ribs are the best. I enjoy yhe grilled chicken salad. Often we do take out here but when we do dine in its been good service. 
268 3 Very nice and clean place to eat. Loved the atmosphere and music. Service was great and the food was the best part! I wasn't sure my kids would like it but they really loved the food! 
269 1 I had brunch here... and it was just okay. Over priced. Too long of a wait. They are doing well because of lack of competition. A place like this would have to step up their game if its located in portland or nyc or sf. 
270 4 Just stop reading now and head over they before they close... I take a trip down to Portland just for this place...try everything at least once. You'll never go back to any other island food... Everything on the menu is on point. 
271 4 This place is awesome. The restaurant is classy but not to formal and the service good. I had the Chicken Tikka Masla and some assorted breads, both were amongst the best I've had. For dessert I had the slightly expensive cardamom ice cream it was worth it. 
272 3 Awesome atmosphere. Food is limited, but atmosphere makes up for it. Really enjoyed the hotel bar and games. Really a fun place! 
273 0 I doubt the pharmacy staff are IDIOTS, messed up my perscription TWICE IN A ROW!!! 
274 4 High quality sushi for cheap. Try the Pineapple Express roll. I'd never had pineapple on sushi and it was great. The soups and entrees are good too. The best thing about this place is the speed though. They get to my house in about 20 mins every time. 
275 3 I go on Monday nights and sometimes on Sundays for poetry nights. Great vibe and the owner is really cool with great music. The jerk chicken is really good. 
276 1 The only cool thing about this bar is the roof that can open at night. The drinks are exorbitantly expensive for Dirty Sixth and unless you want to listen to nonstop EDM, this is the wrong dance club for you. 
277 3 Nice little hotel. Rooms kind of on the small side, but well taken care of and clean. Desk staff was helpful and kind. Great free breakfast and a really nice surprise of free dinners with beer and wine. Overall, I was very happy with my stay here. 
278 4 Good food good service the atmosphere was a nice service with timely delicious array of selections 
279 4 Really enjoyed this little place. Simple if you want, more complex if you want. We got some sushi and then a maki (the "amazing roll" I believe) that had mango, salmon, avocado, eel. Delicious. Gyoza dumplings good too. 
280 4 This place is the real deal. Amazing service and you'll feel like you're in Japan. The freshest fish and most amazing udon. A must in Austin!!! 
281 3 Currently awaiting my yummy nachos! If youre not ordering the nachos you should be ordering the cheddar jalepeno fries! Good service, creative appetizers, cheap drinks (even top shelf) makers mark is $5! Go! Just make sure you go in the right door, its basically unmarked haha. 
282 4 Wow! Authentic Greek experience in North Austin. Nice family atmosphere and great food! Highly recommended. 
283 4 Justin is great. Several friends also go to him. Manicure was so so - wouldn't go for another mani there. 
284 2 This is just an average Irish pub with average quality drinks and foods. Salmon was good but green beans and spinach was over cooked. Tomatos in the chicken quesadillas were old and didn't taste fresh at all. I will be back for drinks and apps only. 
285 0 35 dollar corkage fee? Insane? Or just bad customer service? Thus the one star Why would anyone pay that? No one wants customers bringing own wine, but they do it as customer service 
286 3 Great place to go on a warm night. Love the super chill vibe of picnic tables and live music. No food experience. Beers are cheap. People seemed pretty cool. They have bathrooms (warning if you're really tall...you will tower over the doors on the stalls). Overall fun atmosphere. 
287 4 Their chicken plate is the best thing in atlanta. Seriously I would say best chicken in atlanta hands down. I always take visitors here because its an amazing restaurant that's intimate and great service 
288 4 I had a really good time here. It was my second time there and I enjoy the nice wait staff and attention to detail. The food was great and at a good price. Thank you Gusto, I'll be back. 
289 3 Salmon tempura is soooo delicious! I also had the crab meatballs and fried cheesecake- all extremely tasteful. Drinks are strong and they offer a great variety-flirtini is my favorite. Only downfall is limited parking on the street, especially with the snow. 
290 4 Amazing Thai food and the decor is really well done. I ordered pot stickers and the house curry and both were amazing, better than anything I've had in awhile. Will definitely be coming back and bringing friends! 
291 4 Linda is a gifted, caring, talented and knowledgeable masseuse. Her place is lovely and peaceful. I get a lot of neck and back tension and I can always count on her to help relieve the pain. I also love that I can book my appointment on line. 
292 4 I love the weed here, top quality, friendly staff, fast service. Great edibles as well :) 
293 1 Ordered a kathi roll to go. Very undercooked veggies were almost raw and crunchy to eat. 
294 4 I love their food, spicy Chicken wing is my favorite! We were there on Saturday night, they have live band which is really cool. We had Emily as server. She is sweet and friendly. Will come back again when we visit our family in Norwood 
295 3 Sushi, salad and cookies are delish. They are not rude or irritated when I have a complicated order due to my pickiness. The wait can be long so I usually order ahead for to-go. 
296 3 The Pho is really good! The only downside to this place is it can be quite noisy, sort of a cafeteria atmosphere. 
297 3 It is located at German Village,which has great bratwursts and cream puffs.Servers are enthusiastic, good for both families and friends. If you want to experience authentic German culture, there is no better way than eating in a German restaurant. 
298 4 Amazing! So happy that this place has opened. Friendly staff, cheap and TASTY tacos, and wonderful atmosphere. I will be coming back to bartaco again and again! 
299 2 Unique donuts, but I didn't like them that much cause they weren't as flavorful as they sound. Like lemon poppyseed - poppy seeds on top, but not much else. They're on the crunchier side, rather than soft just fyi 
300 4 Best Steak in the city. We go to fish bones at least once a month! 
301 4 This is the absolute best restaurant in Winter park! Not just the best Turkish, but the best, food and wait staff around! The food is exquisite, the service better yet!! You will not go wrong with a stop here! 
302 0 My first time not happy with the service I received when I brought my car to get cleaned today. I have an suv, and when they were vacuming the inside, they didn't vacuum the backtrunk area at all. 
303 4 I love their food specially wide noodle dish. spicy. The owner and her family is amazing and they treat their customers like family to. If I can afford I will go their every day. By the way don't forget to order mango sticky rice soooo yummy.... 
304 1 You can always find a seat in here, perhaps because everything is so pricey. The WiFi is a complete ripoff: $5/hour and it is super slow. Coffee is okay but not as good as the pretentious baristas would lead you to believe. 
305 4 Hands down the best gelato in town :) Will be back to try the amazing looking desserts soon! 
306 3 Great gluten-free options for the gluten-free foodie. They have a section of gluten-free dried goods and also frozen goods. Prices are fairly reasonable (or at least on par with typical gf prices). Usually they have some great discounts for gf foods. 
307 4 This place is so good! One of the best vibe's in Boston, really takes me back to my days in Spain. The retro decor and oldie music makes for an amazing time! Not to mention the food and drink are great! 
308 4 Fantastic service. Really good food. Salmon was excellent. They have there own smokehouse. Multi grain bread is fabulous with smoked sea salt 
309 4 They exceeded my expectations! Quality job done right, quickly, and for a great price. The staff is very friendly and helpful too. These guys ROCK!! 
310 4 I'm so unbelievably happy I stumbled across this food truck. Those Firecracker fries with buffalo wings? Stop it. 2 die 4. And the Staff members felt like family. Will absolutely be back next time I'm in Austin. 
311 4 I went to a wedding here - unbelievably beautiful. Great views and about as scenic as New England gets. 
312 3 Spacious, decent parking, and good tea. The place shouts Decatur coffee shop. But not literally, cuz it's pretty quiet. It's the kinda place where people actually get work done. I do wish they had more power outlets. 
313 4 Best rotisserie chicken mashed potatoes and coleslaw I have ever had. Staff threw away my left overs and gave me a whole new meal to take home. Love this place we need one near maine!!! 
314 3 First time visit for us. We really enjoyed the food. Husband thought portion size was a little smaller than he's use to. But overall the food was delicious. We definitely plan on going again. 
315 4 Richard is extremely knowledgeable about the all natural ingredients that he uses and the health benefits that each ingredient provides. Fun, good for you, and delicious. 
316 0 Not even 1 star. We were waiting for 25 minutes, nobody asked us or updated us about the waiting time and when they found a table a man came asking about the number of our party and placed other group with 1 more person. Can't be less professional. 
317 3 My family and I have been coming here for years, and have never had a bad experience. Drinks are a little on the strong side, though. I also love that they have salsa dancing upstairs! 
318 3 Food was delicious and service was great. Little neck clams had a little sand in them but not enough to ruin the taste. The steak tips were fantastic and cooked perfectly. Great meal at a great price. 
319 0 Got my Reuben sandwich and a turkey sandwich with combos at 8:30 pm and they were meh...bread was awful and dry. At 8:50 I went to refill my soda and those bastards closed up shop already. Definitely will not be going back. 
320 0 You're paying a minimum of $20 to stare at a highway, grass, a lake, and a bunch of hotels. I can't believe anyone actually buys this garbage. This is Central Florida, not somewhere scenic. 
321 4 Always a good time! Came here for a big day brunch with the family and ni one had any complaints about the meal. Stellar service and the biggest breakfast tacos ever! Love that you can add veggie chorizo to anything! One of my favorite breakfast spots 
322 4 My favorite restaurant in all of Disney World, it's exotic & fun with some great food! Surf & turf was amazing, chicken tikka Marsala delicious, & service friendly. They're desserts were the best I have EVER had! Ever! A must go in Disney World. 
323 4 The service here was amazing. Oh yeah, and the food wasn't too bad either. My favorites were the fried artichokes, the shrimp in hot garlic oil, the creamy potato/spinach/kale croquette and the flan. I'll be back! 
324 4 Great view with historical relevance. A must see for tourist and a great place for a picnic on a nice day. Totally worth the drive. 
325 3 My wife and I have never had a bad experience here. We love their breakfast menu and their bloody mary's are pretty tasty! 
326 3 Good. It's cheap. And portions are monster-sized (as in bigger than my head). I was obsessed with the tofu spring rolls and the spring noodles. 
327 4 This place is fantastic. Everything I've tried is delicious, and it's all you can eat, brought to the table. Don't expect a menu - there isn't one. The owner is a little bizarre, but every time I bring someone new to this place, they're addicted. 
328 4 AMAZING! They are always so nice! My husband likes a drink that is not on the menu and they always make it for him without hesitation. The drinks are so good, I have never been disappointed! Chai latte hot or iced is the best around! 
329 4 I love love love calamari and pad thai and basil pad thai, red curry as well. The host is very nice and welcome. I love dine in as well as order togo tons of time. Recommend! 
330 4 The food here is indeed very nice and well prepared in a certainly fancy way. Sure, I don't like dress codes, but the staff and food quality is too exceptional. Nicely done my friends. 
331 4 I work down the road at Unitus and we LOVE this place. Rachel has been nothing but friendly and welcoming. If you are near N Williams, this is a must stop and buy! 
332 4 Best fried rice in Atlanta!!! Only been here about three times but the service is amazing, I haven't had anything bad yet still going through the menu. 
333 2 I ordered the colossal cobb salad and was not impressed. The ham felt like I was eating hard wax, which made me sick to my stomach afterwards. I really want to like this cart, and plan on getting something else next time. 
334 3 Finally, a restaurant on the Drag that doesn't suck. Daito is among the best Japanese food in the city. They specialize in udon, which typically gets overlooked in the shuffle between ramen and pho offerings in town. The sushi here is well prepared and the sake options are many. Kampai! 
335 2 Pretty nice joint. I've never had a great experience here but it isn't awful either. Usually crowded on weekends. Food is ok. Staff are pretty nice. Vibes are kinda bro-ey. Drink list is lovely though. 
336 4 A masterful fusion of east and west. The Kobe dog was great juicy but not salty and no filler crap 
337 4 I have been to this place for drinks, lunch and dinner on multiple occasions. Cocktails are creative and there is a solid wine selection. Try the carbonara, octopus and Italian kale pizza with garlic. Hope to head there for the outdoor seating soon. 
338 4 Had fresh beef noodles, crispy seafood noodles, seafood soup, and salad rolls. They were all really amazing. The freshly made beef noodles were especially good. Would definitely recommend. 
339 4 They took a nail out in minutes! Their service is Fast and inexpensive. Free coffee as well! 
340 0 They NEVER seem to get our order correct, service is crappy, food is inconsistent and has gone down hill steadily in the last 6-9 months! WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN! 
341 1 $41 for a medicore mani/pedi. I'm newer to the Chestnut Hill/West Roxbury area.. does anyone recommend a better place. One that actually CLEANS your nails? 
342 1 Probably one of the worst ones I go to. The ONLY Starbucks that makes you wait 25 minutes to pour an iced coffee....all other Starbucks have their cashiers pour it to mitigate the wait time....and it makes sense. 
343 2 Expecting the exceptional, that Tucci's has delivered before, I guess shouldn't be the expectation for 'carry away' food. Next time, I'll dine in. And I'm sure I'd get my 4 star feelings back. 
344 4 I stumbled onto this Family Optometrist practice and I was blown away at how friendly, knowledgeable, and professional the doctor and staff were! If you're in the Buckhead area and need glasses or an eye exam, then you must come here! 
345 4 Love love love this place! Alex is very helpful & super sweet!! Stephanie is an awesome esthetician & definitely my fav. 
346 3 Good flavor but I like my acai bowls COLD, especially in the heat of Austin. This tasted great (I got the Chuck Norris) but was more like acai pudding. :( Fruit on top was very good & fresh. 
347 4 Yummy and probably the best thai food in Austin with tons of vegetarian choices. Our server was super amazing and friendly. Will keep going back...we ordered everything our waiter suggested - Vietnamese coffee to tom kha to C1 and F1 to sticky rice with mango. 
348 4 This is the best ice cream in the country. My favorite is Mexican vanilla with peanut butter cups mixed in with bananas on top. The scoopers are always friendly with big personalities. Whenever I am in Austin, this place is tops on my list. 
349 3 Crab Eggs Benedict Florentine... was OK could not eat potatoes way to hard and over cooked... best part were the mimosa and time with mom... breakfast for two $50... t 
350 4 Tarantos has, hands down, the best gluten free pizza I've ever had, and I've sampled many! Texture was just right - I wouldn't have known it was GF if I hadn't ordered it that way. Only wish I lived closer... 
351 3 The pan seared corvina was really good. My chanchito was pretty tasty especially the fatty pieces. Ceviche clasico was too acidic though. 
352 4 Really good beef kebab and amazing baba ghanouj, I might have dinged them a star because the gyro meat was a little dry and "crispy" but the flavors of everything were really good. The garlic sauce is mmmmmm to die for... 
353 4 Just left Subway in Kyle and was very impressed with the two young men working the counter. They greeted me when I came in. The both worked on my order and got me out and on my way home very quickly. Thank you, Subway! 
354 3 Nothing special but good enough. I like another one much better in Dorchester, but hardly get to that area, so Le's is my goto place for Pho 
355 3 Fast food and you know your getting with Chick-fil-A 
356 4 This is my favourite Starbucks in Vancouver, the staff is amazing! :) 
357 2 We never got the wine book, the waiter was always in a hurry, rushing us. Need more items on menu! Server shd treat all customers equally! We felt very out of plce & this was our 6th time!( not consecutively). We wont be going there any time soon!! 
358 1 How could you have stale bread on the second day after opening? HOW?! The burgers looked so good on that banner before it opened.I wouldn't have thought it was possible to replicate paying to see The Blair Witch Project with Burgers and fries. 
359 4 There serves was phenomenal they were just the best they did my niece nail and was the best thx so much 
360 4 Best Congee I have tasted in a while. Price is reasonable and there are plenty of other options 
361 2 I tried the moon latte but I wasn't impressed. It was really sweet, and I don't see how is it better than normal latte. Maybe I just don't get the hype. 
362 3 Drinks were amazing, food was really good/different. Downside: pricey! (like $100/person for 5 course and some drinks) Special occasion restaurant only, but it was fabulous. 
363 3 Great atmosphere and delicious food. Bartender lied to us about their being no happy hour or I would've given it 5 stars 
364 4 Awesome food, best Asian Food around! Everything I have eaten has been incredible and the staff has always been great and the food even better. I don't even have a favorite as literally everything I have had has been the best. 
365 3 Great food and wonderful service. Hubby and I only tried buggers but with such an extensive menu we have many reasons to return. Wish I remembered our server's name but she was such a joy! Love when good food is accompanied by a great experience. 
366 4 Awesome liegeois waffles. Would like to go back to try their pomme frites. Will be back. 
367 4 I love the pizza here - unique topping combos and a slightly charred chewy crispy crust to die for, at a very reasonable price. Yummy. 
368 4 I'm originally from Cali and I've resided in Houston for some time. I come out to Austin just to eat and this is by far the BEST Thai restaurant I've ever had. You must try it!!! 
369 4 Thank goodness for this place!!! Great selection, sensibly organized. Not just quilting fabrics, this is a real fabric store from the good old days with "dress making" fabrics for all occasions and applications. 
370 4 Do yourself and give this place a visit. Very relaxed beach atmosphere. Get the pirate taco it's shrimp and steak and order two and you will be thinking of you should order a 3rd one. Flavor across the board. Drinks are solid painkiller and nice craft beer selection. 
371 4 Genevieve officiated the most beautiful and customized ceremony for my husband and me. She was heart felt and professional from the moment we asked her to be our officiant until the certificate was signed and submitted. I cannot recommend her more highly! 
372 4 I love a good burger, and these are some of the best and most unique burgers in town! This guy is A burger artist.... Apple slaw on the side... yum! 
373 4 Beautiful restaurant with wonderful staff. The charcuterie plate was amazing. The waitress Meghan is absolutely wonderful and the bar manager Rob is also wonderful. If you want a great cosmopolitan please go here. And if you want good food come here! Good night. Good people! 
374 4 Had the lunch buffet on a Thursday with my husband. Everything we had was very good. Service was fast and friendly. Food was slightly spicy, which was great! We will go back. 
375 4 Awesome hotel...old Boston charm with great customer focused staff. Had a firewood butler deliver my choice of wood and started the fire in our in-room fireplace! 
376 4 Open on Sundays and 24 hours a day. Always a long wait but better than not being able to be seen at all. Very low cost and they were nice to my pet. 
377 3 Ordered fish and vegetables dumplings steamed 4 stars Peppercorn shrimp 5 stars Egg pancakes 4 stars Pan fried pork and shrimp dumplings 4 stars Pork soup dumplings 5 star rating Service is super friendly and fast served in 4 minutes Definitely going agai 
378 4 We just ate lunch at Eurasia and, again, fantastic! i had the lunch special with tree Classic Rolls. All great! My wife had the sesame chicken. It was the best sesame chicken I have ever had. The spicy edamame was awesome and the so was the miso soup 
379 4 Bonjour Paris!!! How did I end up here in the middle of Vancouver- what a delight!!!!! 
380 1 Pretty nasty. We ordered sweet and sour pork, scallion pancake, noodles and hot and sour soup and... It was all bad and tasteless 
381 2 I really wanted to like this place - the interior is modern, lovely outdoor table set up. Wasn't impressed with the lemon tart I got - was too sweet. Don't know how good the food is but don't really want to come back to find out. 
382 0 Changed menu inside but not on board outside. Completely different. Bad services ended up leaving server never came to table. After 10 minutes Don't waste your time. 
383 4 Excellent! We tried the chia pudding and acai bowl, both were delicious and beautiful! We also tried the kale salad and several green juices. They pay attention to detail and it shows. :) Expect a little wait because they are making everything fresh to order! 
384 4 Amazing people and family..I bring my daugther with her friend both 12..and Andres and his wife were so nice and pay attention to details...I really enjoy the experience .. 
385 0 Bad service. Waiting for long time to order while the waitresses just heading down playing the phone and chatting with each other. No one come to add water. Waitress speak to customers in bad manners and seems angry all the time about something. Didn't enjoy at all. 
386 3 Had to give it a 4 because I grew up in Paraguay, South America and Ive been to Argentina. I really liked their empanadas. I want to try the milanesa napolitana next time. 
387 4 I am a fan. Comfort food for sure which isn't my style but damn it's good stuff. 
388 4 We ordered the Miso soup and for entree, the U.N. and Chanel rolls. All of the items were excellent. Our drinks were also very good: The Mule, Apple Old Fashioned. 
389 3 Love this new restaurant in our neighborhood. Great food, friendly service and when the weathers nice their outdoor seating doubles the restaurants size. They bake their own bread and offer wine and beer. 
390 0 I love Chick-Fil-A. Their restaurants are always clean, with fast, polite service, and the food is yummy. This particular CFA fails on every count. What a dirty, confused, mess of a place. Meh. Go somewhere else. 
391 3 Having tried a number of chowders during our trip to Boston, this little Irish pub surprisingly had the best one. The music was festive and the beer cold, and isn't that all that you can really ask for from a place like this? 
392 4 Best dimsum in Austin! I'm a transplant in Austin and have tried different dimsum places and Chinatown is the cleanest, yummiest and the friendliest servers for a chinese restaurant. Although very pricey, i would rather pay more than deal with subpar dimsum places elsewhere. 
393 3 Went there the other day and ordered a couple of Shrimp Tacos and a burrito. Real good Mexican street food. Service with a smile. I wll be back soon 
394 4 Amazing pizza! We are new to Belle Isle and don't go anywhere else for our pizza. Highly recommend the Bruschetta Pizza. 
395 4 Absolutely awesome! Great food, service impeccable and waiter super friendly. Will for sure come back! 
396 4 This business is great!! They have the best customer service and will take care of your vehicle properly. They have serviced two of my cars already and both were done successfully! Give this company a try next time you need any window repairs/replacements. You will not be disappointed! 
397 3 Plan on going after the show starts at the Fox. Then tables can be had pretty quickly. The pizzas are excellent! 
398 4 This is my favorite Mexican Restaurant and it is also great that it's nearby my house. My favorite is the spinach enchilada dinner that includes pico de gallo, black beans and chips. The service has always been friendly, fast and courteous. I highly recommend this place and it's family friendly. 
399 4 Awesome food. Best indo-chinese I've had (in Boston), yet. Krishna attended to us and he was very nice and it was his first day. 
400 4 Had a great time at Fuji! The wait was long but once we got seated, our server Helen was great and very nice! She had great recommendations for food and drinks! Would come again just to see her! 
401 4 The people who are giving this ride one star reviews must be angry or bitter about Universal creating great rides, because KING KONG is as good as it gets for new, immersive family fun! So much better than that weak Avatar Boat ride at WDW! 
402 3 Went for the monday special dosas.Got the gunpowder masala dosa. It was quite good. Service is fast too. 
403 1 This restaurant has great food, but music is way too loud for the lunch crowd. My husband has sensitive hearing and we were told the music has to stay at a certain high volume or turned off. 
404 4 I just returned and got the steak focaccia. Fantastico !! What a gem Great stuff here. I had a very special focaccia bread and a gelato. The chef / owner is very friendly, generous and committed to his craft. I look forward to exploring his menu more soon. Highly recommended. 
405 0 Usually have very good experiance at joes, but my friend's turkey burger was wrong and undercooked (pink) 3 times. Unacceptable in my eyes, and I wont be back at let to this location. 
406 4 The pork belly unforgettable and the burger was delicious! The service also stood out. The esquite corn appetizer was phoeominal. Try it! 
407 4 Nice, super nice! Food and drinks were perfect. Atmosphere was wonderful for date night. Ordered Old Fashions, oysters, beet salad and pasta. Hubby had the steak. I also tried the Lions Tail, reminds me of a whiskey sour. 
408 4 I just bought three bar chairs from here, and my sales rep, Ryan, was extremely friendly and professional. Great price and service. 
409 4 OMG - Best facial ever. Joan is amazing, she totally knew what my skin needed (extraction and deep clean) and even some of the bad issues that I had she cleaned. She truly knows her job and provided great service but most importantly my skin looked and feeled fantastic! 
410 3 Had a leak in my tire and thought I needed a patch. I called ahead. They had me and out in the time they told me. They did the patch, didn't try to sell me anything, and didn't charge so I think they are great. 
411 2 Food was salty and over-seasoned. The staff was attentive. Atmosphere was loud and difficult to hear conversation across the table. Would benefit from offering a kid's menu. 
412 3 Bring your student ID for a 10% discount! A penny saved is a penny earned ;) 
413 3 Amazing Donuts, but long lines. Its hard to improve upon their model, but if they could make the donuts slightly cheaper and shuttle people thru a little faster during rushes i would visit more often. 
414 4 The wings are awesome! Not breaded Hot and Lime rocks! Upstairs is lovely. Our server Jayma our server was amazing. Very attentive and helpful. 
415 3 I had a poached egg on portobello mushrooms and truffle-lemon hash browns with hollandaise sauce. It was very tasty but a bit expensive. My friend had the chicken and waffles, and she thought it was alright. Tables are a bit crowded, but the place is clean and nice inside. 
416 0 My french toast came with a hair on it. The replacement had one less piece and wasn't cooked all the way through. They didn't even offer to take it off the bill or compensate in any way. 
417 3 i LOVE bluehour! everything was amazing from the foie gras to the perfectly cooked salmon to dessert! i am from california and nothing compares to bluehour. portlanders are bit harsh when it comes to yelping restaurants. :p 
418 4 Experience has been great thus far. Barbara at the front desk and Gabriel at the bar have provided exceptional service, being patient while I asked questions, and going above and beyond to help make my experience more enjoyable. 
419 2 Food was really, really good. Service was not good. We had a large group and the server was obviously annoyed... May be a better experience in a small group. 
420 4 This place is an amazing spot for a date night!! The atmosphere is very romantic and the food is perfect for sharing and experiencing new exciting dishes. My favorite was the "hot rock" that you sear your own meat at the table. 
421 2 This place keeps going up and down. I'm hooked on their shrimp dumplings. And their new salads. And great servers. Not a bad spot for lunch. It's just that like everything in this mall food wise, it will be hit or miss! 
422 4 The food was delicious! Chips and salsa were the best we've had in a long time! Chicken flautas were fresh and tasty, along with the rice and beans! Next time we're in town, we'll be back! Friendly staff! 
423 2 Pretentious beyond belief! $17 for a small chicken pot pie with excessive gristle and salt. Excellent carrot soup served with creme fraiche and toasted cashews but comes at a price of $6 for a cup. Server was dismissive. Clean and attractive surroundings in a comfortable Mt. Tabor neighborhood. 
424 4 You have to try the Rock Shrimp! Does that sound strange? They are the sweetest shrimp you can imagine, dipped in the melted butter and they taste like lobster! 
425 4 Simply the best kabobs in the city. Tender, moist, and perfectly seasoned. Fresh vegetables about - plus great prices to boot. Who could ask for more! 
426 3 An adult hot pocket... I love the concept. I had the Cuban and it was really good. The staff was very friendly. The owner of the establishment took my order. I'll definitely be back! 
427 3 Tin Shed is now one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast in the US. Decent prices, good music, perfect portions, and damn delicious food. You will most definitely run into a 15 minute wait, but it is more than worth it. 
428 4 Excellent food! The ceviche was on point, the shrimp Mofongo is to die for, the crab empanada is excellent, the tres leches and Colombian coffee top it off perfectly. The waiter, Roy, gave us excellent service, and the owner is super friendly. All in all, I highly recommend it. 
429 4 Love! Everything was delicious. The service was friendly and informative. The falafel was the best we have had, schwarma was delightfully spicy. 
430 2 I have usually had a good experience here , and maybe it was because it was late but that's no excuse for my "salad" to be just lettuce and they put the dirty receipt IN my food. Right in the hummus. 
431 4 Omg, these are the absolute best tacos I have ever had. The corn tortillas are like butter because they are home made and soft. Now have my newest favorite spot 
432 3 The Bloody Mary is DELICIOUS!!! I had the salmon burgers with brussel sprouts. The salmon was great, a little more seasoning is needed on the brussel sprouts. 
433 4 Best chicken tacos ever! The guacamole is fresh and delicious. Tamales are huge and also very good. If you are in the area this is a must try place. Tad bit hard to find but worth the search. 
434 3 If you don't order the pork empanadas you have made a terrible mistake. Great service, and some of the dishes are truly amazing. Tapas menu is awesome. Lost a star only because their cocktails aren't strong enough for my personal taste. 
435 4 Maureen Hall is the best of the best. Her customer service is second to none. I've been working with her for years and I recommend her to everyone who needs quality invitation and stationary. Go "Mo"! John Unrue 
436 4 Omg awesome gym ..... Farinaz they have all the equipments that you need with the best trainers anyone could ever ask for. Motivated and devoted to their cause and clean 
437 3 Our favorite pho restaurant! Why? Convenient location, good pho noodles, friendly service and very decent price! 
438 0 Embarrassed to have given this place my business when there are so many other options. I don't think other establishments would treat there customers so poorly. Save time and headache, play somewhere else. 
439 0 Wait time is ridiculous. Everyone else seems OK with that. Not me. Buffalo burger was bland. Service was bad. Gay/Bi bartender needs to learn to treat everyone equally. I got ignored. Reflected in her tip. 
440 4 Really good service, great food, great prices, great atmosphere. The mimosas are only $3 during brunch and they are a good size. 
441 3 Great place. Could use a little more spice on the lamb but great chicken and veggies!! 
442 2 Great sushi! Decent price! Fast service! Small place Always busy Servers are overworked 
443 2 This place is okay. The burgers are good, but they are pricey. It is always very busy. I think there are better options that are less expensive here in Austin. 
444 2 This place was pretty good. They have an amazing turkey burger. The shakes are interesting as well, not the best I've ever had, but they weren't bad. 
445 1 Ran out of food pretty quickly You have to be there early or you wont get food only sauce Food its really greasy 
446 1 The food here is great, but this is the second time that I've eaten in the bar area and been so massively disturbed by outrageously drunk, loud people who are admitting out loud that they're driving home that I had to leave. Where are the Dublin Police?!!!!! 
447 4 Sure it's expensive, but you're paying for an AMAZING view! Go for sunset! Why the hell people bother with Oasis is beyond me, the food there is crap. 
448 3 My fresh seafood go-to place. The best, best, best prices for crab in the Metro Area. I've been there when the coolers were being unloaded into tanks of crab FRESH from the Pacific Ocean docks that morning. 
449 3 Nice option for an upscale, semi-pretentious meal that's actually pretty good. 
450 4 I would rather do aqua aerobics here than sleep in, in the morning. And that really says a lot. I've made so many new friends while getting a workout. This facility is new-ish and most of the staff is great. 
451 4 One great place. Mr. Luck Bros. knows his trade and it shows. He has some new schmancy roaster set-up, so it seems he is doing well. Prepare to pay. 
452 2 Food is good, but for god sakes... please stop checking your phones while you're preparing food. The owner is great, but the young staff checks their phones a lot and I pointed out that this is unsanitary. They were offended and mopey...but tough. 
453 4 All jelly fish. All the time. Food and drink were original and well executed. Casarecce pasta was a show stopper; stick a fork in me, I'm done. Bartenders were unique, actively creating and perfecting goodies in real time. Worth all 5 stars. I'll be back. 
454 2 Decent bar food. Happy hour specials. We went there for family feud. We won! It would be great if the game had a faster pace but it still was fun. I'm sure we'll show up for family feud again. 
455 3 Went during lunch hour. Quiet atmosphere. Waitress was attentive. Food portions were OK, but the steak was AMAZING. Will come back when I need my steak fix. 
456 4 Went to Chez Machin last week and tried both a sweet and a savory crepe. Both were incredible and reasonably priced. Make sure to go to the covered patio in the back, great atmosphere. 
457 3 Service was quick. Staff was friendly. Food was very good. Serving sizw was definitely good portions. Food was very good. 
458 4 Loved it. The drinks, apps, and meals were all delicious. The fried babybels were my favorite!! 
459 0 Horrible service, dirty menus with food all over them, we are non smokers, everyone around us was smoking... 
460 2 A fascinating place because of the beautiful pond with the large koi swimming by as you wait to be seated or while dining. The food was tasty and service was solid. A great location that's right on the strip. Larrrrrrrge dining area. 
461 1 In 2006, had an emergency take out dinner here and it was ok. Not my sort of place, but it did the job. I'm surprised to see that it's still up and running in the same location years later. 
462 3 Awesome food! A quaint little trailer but worth the travel. Try the fried momo!! Be careful about the hot sauce. It is really spicy. 
463 4 i'm going to avoid redundancy and agree with all that aretha & jennifer described. aborview is professional and reliable, plain and simple. 
464 3 Went for brunch buffet. Good food all around, and attentive wait staff. Could have done with a little more spice in some of the things but being a buffet... not bad at all. Service and decor are fantastic. 
465 4 Joel was excellent and effective in his work. He quickly diagnosed the problem (my error in an attempt at a fix...shocking) and went to work on fixing it. He was very courteous and quick in his work. Thank you Joel! 
466 3 Returned today. Great service & food. Sea Scallops were perfect. Goat cheesecake was delish. Expensive but in my opinion worth it as there is nothing else comparable in the area. 
467 4 Very good Tapas. Good service. Nice place. Love the grilled octopus and the potatoes bravas. Yum! 
468 2 I give it four just because the food is amazing have yet to have a bad meal, chicken pot pie and Shepards pie unreal. The only downside is the red headed Irish waiter the guys an absolute miserable douchebag...bartenders are great to 
469 4 Orlando finally has a Bon Chon! Korean style fried chicken & much much more! I had the Salmon Ball as an appetizer. Also had Bulgogi , tender ribeye beef sautéed with mushrooms and onions. Topped off with a Riesling wine 
470 4 Love this restaurant! They have the best sushi in the Boston area. It is always fresh and delicious. Great place for a date or dinner with friends. The place is cozy, so keep your group small. 
471 4 We loved this place. Delicious food, great atmosphere, good drinks. Everything we ordered was tasty. The spicy sauce on the potatoes would be delicious on a flip flop! We will be back and definitely recommend it to everyone. Sit outside, it's lovely. 
472 2 If you have been to 4Rivers and are expecting the same quality of food from this sister restaurant, you will be slightly unimpressed. The atmosphere is fun and cozy, but the food is subpar, especially for the price. The biscuits and cornbread are amazing and must try. 
473 2 Good food. Big portions, Great salsa, but the service was very very slow. Got there about 8:00 p.m. and didn't get out until after 9:30. Almost took an act of God just to get a refill on our sodas. But in all fairness it might have been just our waiter. 
474 3 Noah provided smart, personalized, and fascinating tidbits about Harvard history, culture & academics. He's also on the football team & taught us Ivy League fun facts! Noah '19 rocks! 
475 3 One of the better motels in the area right off of I 95 good for families convenient to the Space Center recommended. Get discount at Denny's for breakfast 
476 4 Of all the restaurants I've tried since moving to Colorado, this place really is the gem in my eyes, everything they cook, they do perfectly. My go to breakfast is the Pain Perdue, it's such a simple dish but done so right, always a good sign of quality. 
477 4 Great food. Bad waitress but there are so many great servers just bad luck on ours. But the food made up for the lack of service. I would recommend this place to anyone. 
478 4 Awesome service! Beer selection is out of this world.. secret is out on the brunch.. def one of my favorites! 
479 1 This place has gotten worse with time. The pizza used to be really good, now not so much. Pizza taste rushed and the ingredients are poor quality. Nice people but terrible pizza 
480 3 Luciles is awesome!! The biscuits and gravy is the best in Denver/Boulder, for sure. The service is less-than-professional, but it's college kids and a casual dining experience, so it's okay. 
481 3 The food is excellent, the Benedicts are an amazing experience. The service was a little slow to start but still recommend it 
482 0 AVOID THIS RESTAURANT! Not only was the food horrible and horribly overpriced but I got a horrible case of food poisoning. I would say it was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. 
483 4 This is everything that Dunkin' Donuts should aspire to be, and frankly, I do not understand how this place received anything less than five stars. The donuts are gigantic, fluffy, and fresh. Coffee is very good. Breakfast sandwiches are meaty and yummy. 
484 4 Wow! The cauliflower and beet taco was awesome! But the best was the homemade tater tots! 
485 4 Turmeric fish & sides were so yummy! I'll be coming back! 
486 4 So good! Not far from the West End. A lot of options to choose from which blew my mind. I ended up choosing the buffalo cauliflower sub. Delicious! I can't wait to go back. 
487 4 I just got a keratin treatment from Elie and my hair looks amazing. I'm so happy I came to see him. He was able to schedule me on the same day I called (a Saturday!) and he was so sweet the entire time! I'll definitely be coming here again. 
488 3 Good is consistent and this they certainly are. I noticed they do party trays also, good to know. The inside is traditional. The variety is what I truly appreciate 
489 0 Probably one of the worst shots in Columbus. No consistency whatsoever. I'm a 195 average bowler in most other houses. Sawmill, I'm a 170. Heavy oil is typical. Just a bad shot. And expensive beer prices as well. 
490 4 OMG the food here was awesome! We spent the day in the park and were exhausted - they had an Ahi nacho kinda thing that we enjoyed thoroughly. Dinner was amazing, service was Disney Excellent - we are going back! 
491 4 Twelve of us had dinner and the entire dining experience exceeded everyone's expectations which were very high based on enthusiastic recommendations from friends. Amazing food and great service. Thank you Chewies ! 
492 3 The food was great and very affordable for late portions. Additionally our waiter was amazing, He took the time to explain the various menu items and what our options were. Def somewhere I would go again!! 
493 4 My favorite brunch spot! Love the food, coffee of the day, and service. My favorite dish is San Antonio Skillet and cinnamon French toast! It's delicious 
494 4 Bluehour Brunch is amazing! Come on down and let Elija take care of you. He goes out of his way to make your experience fantastic! Great food and great service. Highly recommend it! 
495 4 This establishment is excellent. The food and service is marvelous. I ordered the Springer Mountain Chicken which was delicious. I recommend this place to everyone! 
496 4 Bacon cheeseburger. Limeade. Thank you and goodnight! Wait, it's only 1:30 in the afternoon. Love the food. Love the service. It was all of that, and I bought the t-shirt. Good luck finding anything as tasty, affordable, and Austin ANYPLACE else. Thank you Nau's team! 
497 2 This place is not bad at all. We went there occasionally for lunch but it is not something that usually comes to my mind when I want to eat pho. Service is fast and the soup is yummy as usual. The crowd comes and goes but never full. 
498 4 My favorite pub. Food, service, atmosphere, price and service all outstanding. I would love to own a pub just like this one one day. I would not change a thing. 
499 0 awful experience in this salon. they cut my skin and soak with acetone. it burning!! she not even say sorry. painting over my cuticle. never coming back here.! 
500 1 I''ve never been impresed with Maggiano's. I don't think I"ll revisit. The food is boring, seems like the sauce is of the "out-of-the-can" nature.... The service is great though. I had the funniest (yet unobtrusive) and prompt waiter there on my last visit. 
501 4 Best Ethiopian food I have had outside of Africa. Authentic menu and atmosphere. Owner and his wife (who cooks) are Ethiopian. The honey wine which is a traditional Ethiopian drink is also very good and is brewed in house. Highly recommend if you want a more authentic taste and experience. 
502 4 Never been there, just always have an order for the carrot, white choc, and caramel cake. I work nearby but cannot resist someone anyone who is going there not to get me some CAKE. LIKE A FAT KID LOVES CAKE! The best I have ever tasted. 
503 3 Brought the visiting family for a shrimp feast and everyone was happy. Delicious shrimp, chicken, crab cakes and of course the cornbread. We left there very full and extolling the virtues of Stonington's. 
504 4 Best bar in town!!! Katie is the most fun! And on a Friday wow! I would recommend and come back every Friday just for her! Busy bar which is good, you find Katie and you are set though :) can't wait to come back for the best next live band! 
505 1 Went here for drinks and bubble waffle. Ordered the oreo bubble waffle but it didn't taste like anything except the icing sugar on top. The drinks were ok, a bit pricey. Probably won't come back. 
506 0 Don't do it. Took money. No show. No response. Bad business and well known for such behavior. Contract is faulty. Don't do it. 
507 4 Had my first visit and fitting. Was a little nervous because I have been hard to fit. However, I had a very good experience with Elise and was soon fixed up with what I needed. I will be returning in the future, when needed Thanks Elise for all your help. 
508 1 Used to Love going here! Last 2 times it was not good! New owners a few months ago, now very slow service, hardly anyone working, wasnt busy and still had to WAIT and wait.makes me not want to back! 
509 4 I love this place. Historically it is a family business, they have very fresh seafood. Oysters are so tasty!!! Any seafood dishes I ate there are great, wines are also good. I recommend to everyone. 
510 2 Average donuts. Sadly Krispy creme was slightly better. Customer service was so so. They all seemed grumpy. But what you expect they been baking all morning. Buttermilk was best. Maple bars were lacking in frosting and dough bread was meh. 
511 4 Great Chef's Special at lunch. It seems they've made some price changes along with how they build their sushi rolls. Can't complain about the changes to the sushi. A little expensive for lunch, but the sushi is always very tasty so it's worth it. Great atmosphere as well. 
512 4 Insanely delicious rice box. The beef buns were also off the hook. The frozen yogurt is heaven on earth, way better than pinkberry. 
513 4 Delicious! Went for lunch today. I had the blackened catfish etouffee, which was absolutely beautiful. Add a side of dirty rice and some cabbage. It doesn't get any better. And I don't even like cabbage normally. Mais sha. You gonna done thought your belly died and went to heaven. 
514 4 This place is full of friendly folks, organicy stuff and free-range frozen texas beef. AND its local. AND I can even pull in for coffee in the mornings. AND they carry my obscure prescription meds... 
515 4 Half-fast caters events for us on campus often. They are reliable, courteous, punctual and make awesome grub! Thank you and keep it up! 
516 3 wings was great and friendly place will def visit again... i just hate it's in a ghetto area... 
517 4 I LOVE this place, but don't come here because I don't want it to get too crowded lol 
518 3 I am from California and though I haven't found a Mexican restaurant yet that measures up to what I'm used to this place is pretty close. Also the service is always excellent so points for that. My favorite is the Mexican pizza. 
519 4 Incredible food! This restaurant is kind of hidden away so it may be hard to find but their menu does not disappoint! We loved the shrimp bo boy and the philly sandwich, looking forward to trying more from their menu! 
520 4 The crab and pork dumplings were amazing and are worth the extra cost. The other dumplings I tried were also good (scallops, pork, shrimp), but no where as amazing. Okay service. 
521 4 Love the food and especially the service. They went out of there way to accommodate my mothers low sodium diet. 
522 1 Food was kinda good , but overpriced. Service was slow. Would not recommend. 
523 4 The food was very flavorful. The torta carnitas had the perfect amount of spice for me - warm but not overly hot. Really fast service and very fair prices. 
524 4 Dr. Kopman is truly the best doctor around for your pet. He is so friendly and really cares about his job and your animal. The whole place treats you well. This is the best vet around and would recommend it to anyone that has a pet. 
525 4 Super fast repair quote (like 2 minutes). 20 minutes to fix my shattered iPhone screen. Works and looks perfect. Easy peasy. 
526 4 Excellent soups and rice bowls; they taste good, are healthy and fresh. The staff is friendly, and the view is nice. I like the PSU branch, but the rice bowls at this location are consistently more fresh. Excellent work from the cook! 
527 0 They racist and there was no parking Go to Golden anchor tattoo instead. Ask for tez he's Black 
528 3 If you happen to be in Wellesley (admittedly probably not a daily occurance) don't miss out on this fantastic pizza 
529 4 The ambiance perfect The staff exceptional The Calamari starter...Great Fried Green tomatoes....way to green. Never again Chopped shrimp salad and Blackened fish salad with Citrus Salad were both amazing. We will definitely be back again. Our new favorite place 
530 4 Great food. Great concept. Great for sharing food with groups or on a date. Reasonable prices. Full bar. 
531 3 Cold cheap beer. Free range burgers and great roasted turkey sandwich. What more can you want! 
532 3 This place is worth stop. The pizza is really good. The service is great. The owner stopped by and checked on us a few times. This is a neighborhood place with just that type of feel. The pizza crust is as thin and crispy as you could want! YUM 
533 4 Tecate on draft, great cocktails, delicious food. 
534 3 Just went there for the first time and got a chicken gyro combo. It was delicious. Something I could eat every day. And less than $8 for the whole thing. And the menu is huge. Highly recommended! 
535 4 Delicious food. Great service. They don't add butter or cream indiscriminately to all dishes to make them taste good. The food really is good quality and not too spicy. 
536 3 Great Ethiopian spot in ATL. Very clean which is something that is an absolute must for these types of places (eat with your hands). The food was good. I wouldn't say great though. Portions were large so I'd suggest getting some kind of combo and sharing. 
537 4 Great find, fresh squeezed margaritas, everything made from scratch. So much better, than the traditional finds. A must try for true foodies that appreciate unique spins on traditional offerings. Mexico city influence, family atmosphere, we need to support this! 
538 4 Wanted to try this place for over a year. Finally made the time to come to North Portland. I so wished I would have come sooner. We loved it! My daughter loves the French toast and the virgin coconut mojito! 
539 4 good pizza and delicious chocolate cakedefinitively would order more often from them. 
540 4 Love, love, love it! It's like the Subway of pizzas. So many wonderful, yet healthy choices to pick from. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The teas offered are simply amazing! If you like really tart lemonade then you will love the lemonade here! 
541 4 so helpful and nice, totally pleasant eye doctor visit. and they have cool frames. 
542 4 The vision required to have preserved this much forrest this close to the city is vast and fabulous. It's astonishing, and a wonderful thing to have access to. 
543 3 The prices and portions are awesome. I've dined in once, but prefer to order delivery and they always arrive quicker than the estimated time given. 
544 3 Pretty decent thai food. Not the best I've had but it definitely satisfies my cravings. Thai iced tea is pretty good from here. The portions are decent sized and the prices are just right. 
545 3 One of our favorite Salem restaurants nice atmosphere great deck dining and service Fun all year round 
546 4 This place is worth the wait. It's not good for any group over 4 people. The food is very fresh. The omelets are delicious as our the pancakes and the home-fries! You will need to be patient. Everything is cooked to order. 
547 2 Deserves more than half a star. Went there at 10:30pm. They had good food for a good price for a late night dinner. Way better than pho99 if you used to that late at night 
548 2 Ask for extra bourbon maple syrup for the chicken and waffles- it's all the flavor for that dish. 
549 0 They have 2 huge "Open Sunday" signs in the window. Their hours (posted on the door) say that they're open 10:00-5:00 on Sunday's. I arrived at 10:10 on Sunday and they were closed. No sign/note on the door with a reason why. Won't go back. 
550 4 Simply amazing!!!! Even if you are not vegan you need to try this place. They even donate to animal charities which is another plus. The cauliflower wings are to die for! 
551 4 really great place that supports the arts and films you can't see elsewhere. good that boulder has a place like this. 
552 3 I've gotten Thai food from here a few times, delivered. It was very good, that's why I continue to order. It's also pretty cheap in comparison to a lot of other Thai places in my area. 
553 2 Shanna was an incredible server. Very attentive and always on top of our needs. We loved it. 
554 3 Yum! I always try something different and have never been disappointed! Fresh, delicious and fast. It's definitely not your traditional burrito place, so if you are a purist this may not be the place for you. Smoothies get a thumbs up too. 
555 4 Was shop at millenia mall and i found this sushi place. I have a shrimp terazaky is so yummy. They give you a lots and the shrimp so big.also the ginger salad is so good. Very different with otger Japanese restaurant i have try before.5 star 
556 2 Servers are hit and miss, food is consistent and always delicious. Price is reasonable, good vibe in the restaurant and there is a good selection of choices and salads for the omnivores in our office! 
557 4 Hands down the best sushi place in Coquitlam. Would recommend making resos on the weekend as they can get quite busy 
558 4 This is the place to go for tire repair! I dropped in over the lunch hour and was assisted immediately. Better yet, they had it fixed in 15 minutes!!! Great spot in downtown for tire repair! 
559 4 Friendly, efficient, caring staff. I experienced a very through, detailed, gentle and professional pedicure. The ambiance is a bit drab and outdated but I wouldn't hesitate to return I would highly recommend anyone to come to flexinails new west for a $25 pedicure. 
560 4 Always great for take out. I love the salads and my boyfriend gets the chicken plate with mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. Delicious simplicity at its finest with quality ingredients! 
561 1 Unimpressed and slightly ticked off. The house ramen was ok at best, and apparently if you do take-out they give you half as much food for the same price. Won't be going back. 
562 4 Stopped in for a mani/pedi while visiting a friend in Winchester. Clean, polite, courteous, and well priced. Sam did a great job! 
563 3 Great brunch. Solid cold brew ice coffee. Unreal smoky bacon! Walked right in no wait! 
564 4 Prompt; great customer service; and CHEAP tires. I was able to get two run flat tires for way under market value. Thank you Angel Tires! 
565 4 This is the best alteration place I have found in Orlando. Everyone is so nice and my items come out perfect! Gloria is so helpful! Great turnaround time as well! 
566 4 Yay! Finally got to try Pliny the Younger! Thank you Belmont Station! Wish you were in my neighborhood... 
567 4 Love this place....great staff, strong drinks (depending on the bartender), and fun place for an afternoon cocktail or a night out on the town. 
568 4 Finally, Buda has a Sports Clips! My "new" stylist E.J. at the Buda location is very friendly and efficient. She obviously has years of experience and can carry on great conversation without being distracted. I will be a returning customer of hers for now on. Can't say enough! Thanks E.J.! 
569 4 stopped by with my old lady to get a tire change, they were quick , with out an appointment and even did extra work to make sure my situation was covered! would absolutely recommend this spot for busy on the go people who got places to be :) 
570 4 Celebrated my 21st birthday here and had the coolest time doing hookah, and eating with my friends. Also had a private belly dancer which was a real treat! Everything was amazing from the food to the service. 
571 4 Tamales where so good service excellent and drink where good they kids love the light up cups 
572 4 Excellent, excellent, excellent food!! You won't be sorry! Whatever you do though, don't accidentally inhale the chili powder! :-) 
573 0 this place is terrible. for the quality there is no heart or soul that went into the soup. it's just plain salt + msg. I am pretty sure this place will be out of business very soon if they continue to operate like this. 
574 1 The reason I gave it 2 Stars is because the service was fast and not bad BUT the food is NOT Good. Today I had the Worse Cuban Sandwich ever, I will not return. The restaurant itself had a funny smell. No Way I would be back. 
575 4 I love the vibe here, and their big floral wall is totally instagramable. The coffee and tea is always on point and their staff is great. My favorite is their chai latte! I can sincerely say that Presso is a favorite of mine. 
576 1 During my recent visit I ordered a blackened tilapia and it arrived to my table soggy and undercooked. Also it was certainly not a blackened. 
577 3 We tried both their pastries and their chocolates!Hands down their chocolate is 5 star! But their pastries have a lot of room to improve! 
578 0 Worse food I have ever had.DONT GO HERE! The food is a joke. It looks unsafe and I really wish health inspection checks this place out. It's scary to eat from such places. 
579 2 Ok coffee shop, small and I didn't see too many outlets. The coffee beverages are pretty good but not the best that I've had, and I think their prices are a little high for what you get. 
580 1 Don't buy the blueberry wine- it's rotted to vinegar. Strawberries ok this year. 
581 3 Trying to find a seat is nearly impossible but they have the best beer happy hour in town. M-F 4-8, huge draft selection, half price. 
582 4 Really nice staff and great service! I've only had a couple things, but they've never let me down. I value attitudes and atmospheres like those found at Curra's Grill. Check them out when you get a chance, try their avocado margaritas! PS You can order online through Living Social 
583 3 Great outdoor bar...cute staff and even better cocktails make the landing my favorite bar in Boston! And, they even take credit cards!!! Trust me, you will not be disapponted. 
584 3 Probably one of my favorite places, I loved the brunch so so good, the service was really good too, their bloody Mary's- amazing :) I had the Brie sandwich and means my friends shared the dynamite roll and the ahi poke as appetizers and it was delish! Highly recommend 
585 3 It's a great neighborhood spot. Truly good Thai food. Imagine my delight when I found out that now they deliver. Yay! My favorites are their tom ka kai -- heavenly soup -- and their green curry. 
586 4 White Chocolate & Red Velvet cakes are incredible. Don't want to bake anymore. 
587 2 Good food and service and a great place to stop for lunch. 
588 2 A little over priced but good food and beer. It's a very chill spot and close to downtown. A good place to grab a few apps then head downtown 
589 4 Sooo trendy and tasty!!!! The corn dip is delicious as well as the chicken Caesar !!! 
590 4 Absolutely delicious. Excellent service. The food is worth the wait. Note that this is cuisine, not fast food. Tolerant of small kids. The chef visited & asked if we were pleased with the food. Good quality. Highly recommended. I felt good about taking my guests there. 
591 4 Holy schimt y'all. The BEST tacos EVER. The mud dip is my favorite and the fish tacos are to die for. I'd eat here everyday if I could 
592 4 We've been here many times...just such a great value and the food always delicious. Don't overlook the breakfast specials...an egg sandwich with a cafe con leche, awesome. Leave room for some quesitos. 
593 2 Good not great wings would definitely go back but really can get these types of wings in a lot of places 
594 2 Friendly staff, fun environment. Haven't had the best of luck with the food. Inconsistent with the calzones. Some days they are great, other times very bland. Sandwiches are good. 
595 1 Alright food. Cool weird atmosphere. But apparently they no longer take reservations. Guess I'll have to find somewhere else to have my birthday dinner. 
596 4 Great environment, super cute, amazing food, service is great and people are very friendly. Definitely recommend coming here!!! 
597 4 Robert and David were awesome guys who helped us move a small apartment to a larger house. They made the entire day as stress free as they could have. I am very happy we decided to go with Two Men and a Truck, it was worth every penny. 
598 4 Not kidding! This is by far the best pizza in town! I am always trying different pizza places so this is a high recommendation!!! The Helios salad is fantastic! 
599 3 Just ate here tonight and the food was great! I had the bean curd and shredded pork and my dad had the beef with mushrooms and bamboo shoots. Would totally go back again! 
600 4 I love d'lites ice cream! The flavors are great and it's really low on calories! I go once a week to get buy several take-homes and eat ice cream for lunch. 
601 0 Not very friendly service, had to point out areas on the outside that were missed and they didn't bother vacuuming the back seat. All in all a bad experience. 
602 4 Champagne wishes and caviar dreams! This place is f'n baller! From wrap around staircases to glass chandeliers, I felt like Robin f'n Leach or Ric f'n Flair at this place. High flying - profiling -WOOOOOO! 
603 4 Great homemade for breakfast or lunch and dog friendly. I enjoyed seeing all the doggies enjoying their food too as they have a menu for them! Bring everyone 
604 0 With customers from Mexico and an employee from Estonia. The Estonian had to get her passport to buy a drink; the Mexicans couldn't despite holding a US work visa in their passport. 
605 3 Food was great and service was good. They're still getting things settled with their alcohol supply but they have ~90% of the beer / wine on their menu. They have all the classic tapas and the kale salad is tops. 
606 3 Blue Fin is a great sushi place. It's reasonably priced and has great sushi. It was a bit crowded when we went and there was a 20-minute wait, but it was worth it. Lots of other shops to peruse while you're waiting. 
607 2 Oviedo Mall is weird looking and is so tiny all it has is a Macy's and a SEARS and a Regal Cinemas movie theater 
608 4 I love French food. They will custom make anything. My recommendations are the French toast or the steak and eggs. Mike and the staff make it feel like you are special. 
609 2 good icecream, but not worth going out of your way for. It's not life changing as other reviewers stated, and not worth the hour long wait. I enjoyed casa gelato much more, and there was no wait. Price is comparable though. 
610 3 Local Portland Brewery Stopped in for a brew on the way to somewhere else, was tasty, left and returned to have another the same night! 
611 3 I'm pregnant so I cannot speak to their drinks (soooooon!) but I really enjoyed my salad and 2 - yeah I had two! - doughnuts. I took home leftover yums and my husband was delighted. Very fun and indulgent concept. 
612 3 Brit Night on Thursdays is when I like to bring myself, and my inner MOD to The Cellar. Ok, so the medieval-like interior is better suited to a goth party, but whatev. Still fun, and that's all the counts. Drinks are cheap too. 
613 4 Awesome brunch!! You must try the apple pie as dessert. The mimosas are the best and the benedict eggs so tasty 
614 4 NTB very quick, affordable, and great service. No complaints. That new manager is making moves. - Big Sean voice 
615 4 This is a pretty new place. The staff were very accommodating and the chicken Parmesan was fantastic. 
616 4 Fantastic bagels- crisp on the outside, doughy on the inside. And their cream cheese is phenomenal! The small container is enough for 3 or 4 bagels. Definitely worth a stop 
617 4 They have the best pho chay! If you're vegetarian or even if you're not, we recommend this dish. The soup is always fresh, tasty, and not oily! We've had this pho numerous times, and it is always consistent. The spicy tofu and lemongrass is also delicious. 
618 4 I needed handy to lift and shift my stuff. I had to reschedule it last minute and Alshane was really flexible. He was able to shift my stuff with no damage. He rally saved my day! 
619 4 As good as simple fried chicken gets. I would like to add recommendations to their, menu... Mashed potatoes as a serious side and maybe even go with the flow and try Pancakes. Yummm........ Want good chicken. Nuff said. 
620 4 The food, drinks, atmosphere and service are always the best! All the staff and management are always so friendly. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some amazing food with a cool atmosphere! Great margaritas, handmade tortillas and flights of mezcal! 
621 4 I love ice cream and this is the best ice cream in the area. Fresh, local ingredients combined with handmade pure goodness. My favorite is vanilla bean. Will be back often i'm afraid! 
622 4 Top notch service, thoughtfulness, and professionalism. If I hadn't moved, I'd still be with this team. Can't say enough about 'em. 
623 4 GREAT FOOD! And the serving size is huge. Definitely a must try if you come to north Austin. Also a great environment for a date. 
624 4 Even on a crazy Friday night our server, Amanda, couldn't have been more friendly. The pork was melt in your mouth delicious. I have not been to Cuba but lived in South Florida for years and my expectations are high. Papi's is the real deal! 
625 4 Thank you John Rodriguez for your hard work and professionalism today! Our carpets look awesome and my baby can't wait to crawl around on clean floors! 
626 3 cool place for college students i had a fun time 
627 2 Lunch at Thaitation was quite tasty. I had a vermicelli noodle dish whose name escapes me, but it was loaded with chicken, shrimp, and veggies. Prices are good for lunch, and portions are generous, so no complaints! 
628 0 You get what you pay for $50 loud, cheap room but at least beds were comfortable and continental breakfast was just white bread, cereal, coffee, juice. That's it! 
629 1 Update: Recently ordered the stuffed shells, which come with a side of ziti. It was more like Ziti with a side of stuffed shells. It's not like stuffed shells are expensive to make, just give me more of what I actually ordered!! 
630 0 Great views, but food was sub par. The quality was something I would expect at Chili's or something along those lines. Prices were high. Won't return. Great tourist trap. 
631 1 The bread in the grilled cheese sandwich was mushy and the sandwich was flavorless. The butternut squash soup tasted like it was from a can. The pumpkin seeds were stale. Won't be eating here again. 
632 3 Great variety of cupcakes, and they have frosting shots! Very cute shop too. 
633 4 Very nice, very clean, and professional. There were some complications with my cat after getting shots and they were so helpful and wanted to make sure he was comfortable and that I had peace of mind. I highly recommend Thrive! 
634 4 I love Gusto. Service is always awesome, bartenders are friendly, food is of great quality! Just saw that liquor is served at Gusto. 
635 4 Fantastic salon. Professional, friendly, skilled staff. Calm atmosphere and energy. My stylist Gina is a gem. I had color, highlights, cut and blow dry. Perfection. Thank you Gina. 
636 3 Woah so good. Would eat this food every day...and we kinda have this week! Service is a little slow but the music videos in the corner tv keep ya entertained :) 
637 3 Rasberry Rosemary and Poppy seed Lemon are the best ones out of all the ones i tried! 
638 4 This place rocks. The food is authentic Italian and super yummy. This has to be one of the best food trucks in Austin. 
639 3 I came here a long time ago with some friends from work. The place is small but quaint! Live music is AWESOME and the drinks are good! What more can you ask for?! 
640 3 Super nice, great deal, fresh, etc only complaint? one of the four people chatting behind the counter when it's was slow, should clean the tables and floor..place was a bit dirty 
641 4 This is my 2nd time earing here in a week. Their rotisserie chicken and corn off the cob no cheese is magnificent. They also have the best maragritas. We seriously need this restaurant in Jacksonville, FL at the St. Johns Town Center. 
642 0 I have called this store numerous times and they always put you on hold forever .I have even been hung up on!and if you hang up and call back they do not remember helping you and are very unaware of products they have.Do not call them ! 
643 3 I had the Papis Sandwich with black beans and rice ... Very good! My Bae had the Same with the Manduros (sweet Plantains) ..she gives it a 4.5 & I give the same ... And my fish bowl blue curaçao was on Point! I will be back 
644 0 Rude waiter here laughed at me when I dropped my cellphone. Had a poor experience at the, now closed, Boathouse in Horseshoe Bay as well. 
645 4 I recently tried the happy hour here, and was very satisfied. It was a very good deal and the food was outstanding. The server was very friendly and really did a great job. I would recommend this place, and will be a returning customer. 
646 2 Friendly staff, free parking, great coffee and food. Hipster hangout, providing great people watching. Would be a higher rating if not for the screaming obnoxious music! AAAAHHHH. YAAA YAAA OUUUWWWW OUUWWWWW YYAAAA YYAAAA HHHAA.... AAAAAHHH AHHHH AAHHHHHHHHH YAH. YAYA... and so on. blegh. 
647 4 Love the Spicy Chicked Tacos ... the tingling spicy concocsion they've come up with is a must try. Slightly expensive for lunch so cannot do daily ... but yummy for sure. 
648 4 Sam Adams Brewery was excellent and free, did I mention free! Brett and Max were awesome. Tip, sit at the end of the tables for tasting you'll get more beer. 
649 4 Awesome finger food service good and lots of hot women. Drinks where good cheese plate was very good. 
650 3 Pie! Open late til 11:30. 3 chocolate creme pie was rich, crust flaky, and huge portion! Fun place to get dessert 
651 4 I really love this place. Comfy ambiance, whenever I've visited seating has been readily available, and they have a ton of vegan options and drink specials. And pie! It's diner meets dive bar in the best way possible. 
652 3 best service ever. 5 star for sushi and soup but some dishes doesn't taste as good as it should. Well, still my place for sushi 
653 4 Feijoada was AH mazing! Wonderful choices and very hearty. Fills you up and especially great on a cold winter night. I also liked the spicy coconut sauce. Yummy to the max. I can't wait to come back. Very reasonable prices, especially for what you get. 
654 4 Delicious! Meat hash was bomb. Service was great. Boozy drinks and milkshakes galore. Also have a bunch of bagel sandwiches on homemade bagels. 
655 2 NO MORE SMOKING. Patio only, it's not covered and not heat in winter. Food good. Bands are always great on Saturdays. 
656 4 Robert is knowledgable and passionate about his work. I wanted the exterior nicks and scratches erased as much as possible and the car shined up. My 2010 Barcelona Red Prius looks beautiful! This service is not cheap but you get what you pay for. 
657 3 Fuel has the all-time best fruit and yogurt parfait! It is huge & always fresh! I ordered it on a whim one day and now it's my regular order. Coffee here is definitely good, but have to give Fuel overall four stars just for being a tad bit pricey 
658 4 Been here for dinner, brunch, happy hour, and lunch. Very long list of flights to taste. I just want this place to change food menu at some point. Great for groups. 
659 4 It's all about brunch! You can't miss with the Belgium waffle or the hash, but the folks there are amazing creative and constantly mix up the menu. They also do dinner on Friday and Saturday nights with a predetermined menu. Check their website to see what they are serving. 
660 4 Outstanding service and passed the "hooters" standard with the food. Deja was my server...... She was outstanding and did her job well with a smile at all times. I will come back for sure. 
661 4 Fabulous breakfast! We got there 10 minutes before they opened, and there was a long line waiting, to the point we nearly didn't get seated. Definitely would have been worth the wait! 
662 4 James from seafood had so much patience with his customers. He was willing to go out of his way to make sure that we get all of the seafood on our list. I usually don't find this good of an experience anywhere else. I will definitely come back to Fiesta! 
663 2 The doughnuts are good, but more times than not, they are sold out. Sometimes before you make it in the door, sometimes while you're standing in line. 
664 4 I don't like pizza but my husband love pizza and we have been coming to Anthony's ever since we discovered it 2 years ago. We normally get pepperoni, sasuage and jalapeno. 
665 4 On a minutes notice and the best service anywhere. I could not be more pleased. I felt compelled to come and write this review. Use them with peace of mind. Eric Schepps 
666 4 Very good food.... Delicious!! The only problem is always busy on weekends!! But is worth the wait!!! 
667 4 Everyone was amazing start to finish! Extremely kind staff and relaxing environment. I went in for Botox and will definitely be going back. 
668 0 I don't get the hype. Yes they have interesting eccentric flavors but the donuts are way to dense and doe-y it's almost like they're wet and haven't dried yet. 
669 4 Great food, great service....ha e been there with my gf, she loved the food, the decor and the owners hospitality... We wily be back to this restaurant 
670 0 Had it at a friend house. I heard lots about ohhh how great it is. Uuuhhhhh, no Not so good Nothing truely special or different just flavorless. 
671 4 I have been going here for 10 years now... my favorite pizza in Columbus! I always get the special (runs until 9pm I believe) which is a large pizza and a pitcher of beer for $20. Perfect for 2-3 people and I usually bring home leftovers. SMOKIN' JOES. DO IT. 
672 2 Nothing special - but better than other more famous options in PDX. 
673 4 Wow! What a tasty breakfast. Definitely get the beignets and anything else from the menu. I had the French toast and it was just right for Saturday brunch. 
674 4 The battery on our 2010 Highlander was nearing it's end of life. Toyota got me in urgently to replace. It took just 30 minutes. 
675 0 Filthy. Worst Delta SkyClub I've ever seen. Floors were sticky and dirty. There was gnats around the food and dead flies on the floor. I was shocked!! 
676 4 Best Carne Asada Tacos Ever ! Great service great atmosphere, clean restaurant, first time here and love the place. 
677 4 Great to have this restaurant in the neighborhood. I don't need to drive more than ten miles to have authentic Japanese Ramen anymore! Love love love. 
678 4 I have no idea how this place only has 3.5 stars. I have been here many times and the food is fantastic! This is one of our go-to places to take family/friends that visit. 
679 3 This place was good overall, had the fried chicken tenders, mac and cheese and beans, the beans were way too sweet for my liking but overall a decent meal with good service. 
680 4 Great Sushi! Always fresh food and fast and friendly service! One of my favorite spots in Orlando. 
681 1 In the past two weeks, I've had two things come back to me dirtier than when I sent them in. Hopefully they'll improve their dry cleaning. 
682 3 Great donuts! We LOVED the apple cider fritter, and we also liked the Dulce de Leche & Hazelnut donut as well as the Valrhona Chocolate Crunch. Fast, friendly service and reasonable prices. 
683 4 Nothing fancy but the food is delicious :) only 1 drawback is no liquor license so no margerita:( they do beer and wine though. Will be back :) 
684 4 This place rocks. Their baked goods are to die for and are dirt cheap (no more than $2 a piece). Pro tips: - This place is cash only, so come prepared - Avoid anything in the refrigerator - Stock up on anything with pork floss, mochi, and coconut 
685 3 The food is so good I would give a five but service horrible. I arrived early. Waiter was chatting with others took 10 minutes to take drink order. No one else in the place. Sloooooow service entire meal. Fix your servers!!!!! 
686 3 From NC, we had a day to kill in Vancouver and asked a random local what she suggested after spending some time at Lynn Canyon. Great, hip place with very attentive service... super nice people. We really enjoyed our lunch here. 
687 3 Very busy! But the food was amazing! One of th best eggs Bennies in Vancouver! I love how they do the hash browns with lemon juice and truffle oil! Big fan! 
688 4 delicious! the triple b, bourbon, basil, blueberry donut is bomb dot com. 
689 2 Not bad, had better - good place for a quick fix - there's a large picture of the Grand Canal in Venice in the joint - not sure what the significance was, but it was uh interesting. 
690 3 Really good desserts, but probably need more chairs than tables since many of the customers can find tables but not seats. Heat lamps outside 
691 4 New chef Brandon Fuller created an excellent menu and the staff execute service perfectly. We had a delightful, light, interesting and good lunch. The outdoor seating provided a private dining space and we never felt neglected. We will be back many times. 
692 3 I had a great experience at Minero! The service was a little slow, but the place was PACKED when I went. The salsa trio with housemade chips was fantastic! My wedge salad was pretty great too. I'll definitely be going back. 
693 3 Great service. Also offers a 10% discount to students. 
694 4 THE BEST PIZZA!!! I can't wait to visit Austin again so I can have a slice of margarita and pepperoni pizza from here!! I was here two nights in a row on my 3 day vacation. 
695 3 The food here is epic. I also love the half portions if dinner entrees. Dessert was underwhelming, but I would order anything sauced on the menu and prepare to be wowed. 
696 3 Delicious sushi, but a bit overprice because portions are quite small. Very very good though, worth going. The place is extremely small so get there early or be ready to wait. 
697 4 I grew up eating momos in Northeast India and this place definitely serves one of the tastiest momo I have ever had. Try their buffalo momo and add chilly sauce if you want the extra spice. 
698 3 We got the honey cinnamon latte which was not very good, but the expresso con panna (whipped cream) was delicious. Service was friendly and prompt, and the ambiance is nice. 
699 2 Compared to the wide array of burger options in the Boston area these days, the burgers here are just ok. They are semi dry and nothing exciting on the flavor scale. I wouldn't come back unless I was desperate. 
700 4 Great affordable good and drinks! 80's butt rock, bacon everything and awesome drinks. Sooo great for people watching! 
701 3 Came here with a party of seven and ordered tons of dishes. The tandoori prawns were spicy and flavorful and the curries (Methi Chicken, Paneer, and Bhuna lamb) met my spice level (hot and flavorful). The only thing lacking was service but other than that, I recommended it. 
702 4 Amber and Chris are super nice and all around awesome! Great service, competitive prices on both truck rentals and storage space, time-restricted gated entry, and an extensive surveillance system make this place the best! 
703 3 Quintessential Portland beer shop. One of the best selections in town. The staff tends to exude a pompous I-cant-be-bothered-by-your-trivial-inquiries kind of attitude, but if you can overlook that aspect, then this place is worth a visit. 
704 3 This place just got revamped this year with a much spacious second floor. It gets crowded really quickly with many Harvard students attempting to do work there. 
705 3 Geez after reading the past few reviews I am a little scared to say that I like their chinese food! haha and since I am a kid at heart they have really good Shirley Temples. I havent been in a few months so maybe it has changed? 
706 4 I love coming when Lincoln and Charlie are working! Such a fun couple to have waiting on you, always engage In conversation and get the food out fast 
707 4 Jack was great, very thorough and professional. Easy to set appointments online. Good experience, I"d recommend them! 
708 3 Always stay here when I'm in Boston for business. Nice rooms. Decent internet speeds. Unless you want a nice dinner there is nothing to eat on this side of town after 6. 
709 3 I got the Shakin' Jamaican cold brew (unsweetened, with milk), and it was good! Perfect for a hot day. 
710 4 Stopped in for a bite before my train ride back to Seattle. Amazing customer service and yummy Wilfs salad. Shrimp, crab and great dressing. Also tried French onion soup. Very yummy and filling. Left feeling valued and full! 
711 4 All I can say is it's very lucky we don't live closer! AMAZING food and cocktails yumm! My husband had a burger( as there were tons of reviews on them) I had the pasta which is different daily. It was unbelievable. I could eat that everyday. 
712 1 Average at best. Been twice second time definitely shame on me the second time. 
713 4 Absolutely the best Hyatt place we have stayed in in a long time. The staff are so friendly. The shuttle guy is a riot. And it is so clean. I mean "eat off the floor " clean. Great location. Stayed on 10th floor, worth the extra money. Highly recommend! 
714 0 horrible customer service took a great idea and ruined it - they over charge and then refuse to properly refund claiming its because they are a non profit. do not rent here. 
715 3 We ordered delivery and everything came as expected and on time. My boyfriend got Ravioli di Aragosta and I got Pollo Farcito, both very yummy! Our meals were a good portion and it came with yummy bread. Definitely would order from here again. 
716 3 Really cool ambience in a renovated train station. Service was a little spotty but our waitress apologized for it afterwards as she WAS slammed by a number of tables at once. 
717 3 Interesting drink/cocktail choices that rotate. Their pour over was good. The space itself is also very nice, good for relaxing or studying. 
718 4 The goto place for a cake! It's a local treasure and we love to visit the airport location to buy some goodies for our family when we visit them. This is still their absolute favorite bakery! 
719 0 I placed an order via delivery.com, then waited...and waited. After an hour and a half, I tried calling--no answer, and a full voice mail box. I've been trying to get through now for more than 2 hours, and still no food or even anyone picking up the phone. Ridiculous. 
720 4 Excellent food and atmosphere. We tried indo chinese and simply spicy and delicious. Definitely recommend this place. 
721 3 Yum yum! Lovely fresh seafood. However, been here a few times and service is spotty. When service is good, this is an amazing restaurant. When it is poor service, I wish I had never come. But the food is good. 
722 3 Service is good. Food is okay. I did not like rice here, feels too sticky for me. Noodles are gone. Vegetarians be careful with what you eat, o found myself s piece of meat from others selection in my bowl once. 
723 4 This pizza is so cheesy and creamy. Every slice almost feels like there is some kind of cream or alfredo like component to it... which I love. $23 for a large 2 topping ? Me and the hubbinator couldn't be happier. 
724 3 Huge portion sizes here, you may want to share a few entrees amongst friends. Casual dining experience with friendly and informative staff. Try the Vietnamese coffee, it's a fun interactive experience! Our food was yummy and rather inexpensive. 
725 4 Amazing veggie plate and amazing veggie pattie! Great customer service and such a cute small place. Will be coming back every week 
726 4 This is a hidden gem. Quick Italian but not fast food. Good portion size and tastes great. Gives good choices and the panna cotta is delicious. A new favorite place. 
727 4 Very delicious. Highly recommend it. The atmosphere was great but service was so so. I will come back for food for sure. 
728 4 Quick counter-serve Mexican. I had the chicken burrito plate with rice and beans. Tasted great, and like everyone says the salsa bar is awesome to do it up how you like. Spent $6.38 and rolled outta there with a full happy belly. 
729 4 Came here for the first time the other night. Wait staff was exceptional. Very professional and clean. Food was delicious! Will definitely be back soon! 
730 3 I went here through a groupon and got a body scrub and facial. The body scrub was so-so, but I have to say this was one of the most amazing facials I've ever gotten, my skin was absolutely glowing afterward. I would definitely go back! 
731 2 My goodness, they weren't kidding. The stack is huge so be prepared to deconstruct or unhinge. Chicken was tasty but I'd skip the Mac salad if given the chance again. Who can complain about $3 beers? Not me. 
732 0 Hipster soaked craphole with consistently shitty service. Plus you tell me your kitchen is closed when the place is full and you're pouring drinks. Screw you and your tent-like dress namesake. 
733 4 They always take my "$150 suggested donation dog" from Austin Pets Alive on short notice and treat her like a pure bread. They seem to really care about the animals. My go to spot when heading out of town. 
734 3 Owner/Exec Chef Ron is AWESOME! A truly down to Earth guy who tries to serve the freshest, tastiest food every day. They support local and sustainable food. This place also has an EXCELLENT drink menu. Try it for Sunday Brunch...but get there early, they get packed! 
735 3 The queso is the best I've had in Austin and their margaritas are really good too! I'll definitely be back again soon. 
736 4 The best pizza I have ever tasted. Whenever I am back in Boston, I will most definitely return to locale. 5 stars for food, service, and cleanliness/ decor!! 
737 4 Amazing place to chow down on something new, Fried Okras were AMAZING!, 3 Guidos AMAZING!, funky monkey with extra bacon AMAZING! and the chicken fried chicken with country gravy and habanero jam AMAZING!!!!! 
738 4 EVERYTHING is delicious at this bakery. Homemade, from scratch taste, light fluffy icing, and great ingredients used in the baking goods. Since I've found this place I no longer eat store bought baked goods.... 
739 3 A little pricey, but the food was excellent. The salad bar/buffet was higher quality. All of the meats were delicious. The best were the crispy lamb chops! 
740 2 Food is good however the service is not great and they included a 20% tip directly on the check, which is more than what was deserved in my opinion 
741 3 Awesome food at cheap prices in a good setting and a nice way of serving! 
742 1 Nothing special. You get a over priced burrito full of rice. Kind of gross. Not authentic. Not even as good as chipotle. Won't be coming back. 
743 4 Best place to stop in Atlanta. The food is great and the portions are in line with control. The atmosphere is very cozy and posh with sophistication which you don't expect in an airport. 
744 3 Best prices for emissions test w/o skimping on service. Wait was a bit long, but papi who did my car was funny and very nice. I brought my other car the the next day. 
745 4 The most delicious and authentic Cuban food in town! I truly enjoyed the casual and relaxed ambience. The service was exceptional! I would highly recommend this restaurant. Desserts and coffees absolutely amazing! 
746 3 Surprisingly good For a theme park fast food joint, they have very tasty food, we recommend it on your visit to Universal Orlando 
747 4 This place is great! Quality food for cheap without going short on venue or service. 
748 4 The French toast was truly excellent. The halibut mushroom special was very good. It came with potatoes and fruit. No skimping at this restaurant. 
749 4 Pizza was great. Their Garlic sauce was awesome I ordered online and got great service. A must try is their Garlic Parm bread sticks. The delivery guy was prompt and friendly. I had a great experience. 
750 4 Wonderful food, great prices! Happy hour skinny drink with upside down beer was awesome!!! 
751 3 Breezy helped us with our order and made recommendations, which was very helpful as I have never thrown a large party before. There was an issue with pick up time but that issue was rectified. Would use them again! 
752 3 Ordered 1 meat bbq plate. I had the pork ribs, mac and cheese, corn bread and butter corn. The ribs were delicious. The corn had too much butter. 
753 3 We lunch outside while at the convention center for a conference. Our server was exceptional as she wanted to meet our needs. The polenta with veges and the beet salad worked well with the fried cauliflower. Nice to have the online description match the meal! Delicious. 
754 4 Excellent coffee and bagels. Will be back for the pasta! Went back a second time and ordered take out for raviolis and eggplant parm. Everything was delicious raviolis were large and yummy. Meatballs were delicious. My search for a perfect red sauce is over!!!!! Let's support this place for sure. 
755 4 Hank, the store manager, is a really friendly gentleman. All the staff is helpful and friendly. I come here because it's close to home and it's always great to see familiar faces. 
756 3 Great food only reason I did not give 5 stars is because staff was not attentive. It was a little busy but there were plenty of seating available. Shockingly it took a half an hour with seating available. 
757 3 Come for the food, stay for the head. PIGS HEAD TACOS THAT IS!!! Other than that was a huge fan of the biscuits and the crudo. The meal ended with quite the tale. PIG TAIL DONUTS THAT IS. 4/5 to the Ravenous pig. 5/5 this review. 
758 1 If you are not sitting at the bar then you probably will have a bad experience. For whatever reason it takes 10 minutes to be seated when the place is empty. This used to be a nice looking place now it looks dingy. 
759 4 Super cute brew house. I got a kick ass adult version grilled cheese and it did not disappoint. They have a great selection of draft beers too. Will be back. 
760 4 I actually found you on Groupon. I forgot to use it, lol. I read the reviews and I love to try new places! I'm glad I came to enjoy the food!!! 
761 4 Mandy and her team of Jasmine and Brittany and Noelle are Awesome Supreme customer care and kindness! Excellent regional director. 
762 3 Hair snobs unite! This is the best place I know of in Harvard Square. 
763 2 This is a decent bar, reasonable prices, clean, and it has a sick patio. They have mediocre food and service and are kind of off my normal path, but I would stop by on a bar crawl or bender. 
764 3 Very nice course conditions for late-October. Fairways and greens in excellent shape. Walked the round on a Friday in 3 hours. It does not get much better! 
765 4 Hidden spot in overpriced Boulder. Great food and great service. Atmosphere is casual and unpretentious. The Mexican hash browns are a must as is the breakfast special. 
766 4 Jack did an amazing job. He was very knowledgeable and thorough. I would give him my highest recommendation 
767 4 Omg the best Lebanese food ever , I was visiting from California and was carving for Shawrmah and falafel I tried both and they were so delicious! Very well recommended! The owner was their and he is super nice ! Will go there for my next visit 
768 4 First review ever and all I can say is Noor and Fredlin are the best servers ever! Made us feel welcome from the start and provided us with many laughs. Food is also great too! Flatbreads are to die for! Would 100% recommend this place. 
769 4 **This review is based solely on their cheesesteak sandwiches** which by the way are are so AMAZING they have to be a sin...These artery clogging sandwiches are worth every bite! Ohh! and the onion rings (how could I forget those ) 
770 1 I was so disappointed. The vegetables were overcooked. Sauces bland. Meat like shoe leather, shrimp like leather. We will not be ordering from them again. 
771 4 Fantastico. Nulla da aggiungere. Per gli italiani di passaggio a Boston credo possa essere un'ottima base di partenza alla mattina. 
772 4 I am writing this from the restaurant but honestly, this is the best quesadilla I've ever had in my LIFE. Seriously you need to try this place if you like Mexican food!! 
773 3 The donuts are delightful, but overpriced. Be prepared to spend over $20 for half a dozen. Also, it's weird that their Mississippi location doesn't open until 9am. 
774 0 Bad food And weird crowd at the bar. I felt like it was a place older people went to pick up dates Staff is really not trained well and food came out incomplete. 
775 4 Friendly staff, quick check out, car ready as reserved, convienient location, able to rent one way 
776 2 Favorite happy hour place in the area, fix the A/C please. Where will our group go? End the suffering. Great bartenders, decent food. Wing Wednesday is awesome! .50 wings garlic parmesan the best. 
777 4 Great Croque Madam and mac n cheese! The CM wasn't on their menu anymore but they were nice enough to make it for me. Great service and people. Give them a visit! 
778 4 I held a 90th birthday party for my mom here this past weekend. Planning the event, day of the event, everything couldn't have gone better! What a lovely staff and the food-- well, the food was amazing, everything was delicious, wonderful place, couldn't recommend it more highly! 
779 4 Best octopus in Atlanta. Fixed price menu is very affordable and delicious. One of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta. 
780 3 Fantastic food, great prices, perfect for watching the Hawthorne weirdos walking. 
781 4 Delicious food! Good ambiance! This was my first time trying Tibetan food, but I really enjoyed the spices and the vegetables at this place were fresh. The food also wasn't soaked in sauce, as I find sometimes Chinese food to be. Friendly staff too! 
782 2 Meh. Not a huge selection and the food quality isn't that great. Might be convenient for people close by but I wouldn't consider it otherwise. 
783 4 Our kids (14 and 16 years old) had a great experience at our recent visit to iFly in Orlando. Their instructor Dan was fabulous. We highly recommend it! 
784 4 Great place for fashionable finds! LOVEEE how knowledgable and friendly everyone is here. If you want to shop local THIS is the place. 
785 3 Super healthy Thai food that keeps me coming back. Fresh veggies and dishes that aren't dripping in sauce. 
786 4 This place is lively on a Friday at 5pm. They have toasts the bar staff make. The bar staff is friendly and responsive. The people around are fun. It's a nice bar. would be fun to stay here one night and watch travelers. 
787 4 Outside of NOLA this was the best poboy I've ever had. Shrimp and andouillie sausage with jalapeno cheese grits on the side. Spicy good. 
788 4 Alex gave me the best waxing job I have ever had done! I wont go to anyone else now. Not only is she good, but shes super sweet and really friendly and personable. I will be going back without a doubt! 
789 0 Came in, was ignored at the door for a few minutes. Finally was seated, and it took the waitress 15 minutes before she came over for our drink order. SLOWEST SERVICE EVER. The food tasted old. The service was awful. Don't go here. 
790 4 Love this place. Has some of the best strains I've seen in Portland. Plus the staff is super helpful and friendly. Definitely recommend this place to long time smokers and newbies. Thanks again rose city crew! 
791 4 Been here three times since last review. The food is outstanding. The House Fried Rice, the shrimp and chicken in black bean sauce, and the Ginger Sole are incomparable. Go here. You'll be glad you did. 
792 4 I'm giving Pho Oregon 5 stars, because I don't think you can get better Pho in Portland. The staff is nice, the food is excellent, and the prices are great. If you like Pho, you have to try it. 
793 3 I had brunch here once, and it was divine. The place is a little cramped, but you can get over that when you taste the food. I haven't eaten there any other time than brunch, so I am not an authority on anything else! 
794 0 Really? Items in this picture are SMALLER than they appear. A $5 dollar breakfast bowl with the dimensions of 4 in x 2 in. Aka SIDE item at any BBQ place. What a joke. And the food sucks too. Nasty flour tortillas. 
795 4 This is my go-to takeout / delivery pizza spot. Always good pizza and the people there are friendly. Priced reasonably, all around what a takeout / delivery place should be. I have never gotten anything other than pizza though. 
796 4 Best campus cafe. Perhaps also the healthiest. The rating would be a 4 if I rated it as a restaurant, but this takes into consideration the fact that it is not. 
797 0 I liked how attentive the sushi chef and the server were, (quite a bit more than one would expect from a sushi train place) But the fish wasnt fresh, it had all obviously been frozen before, um GROSS! Thats not ok with me. 
798 2 The food is OK, not bad, simply as expected, average level, I had something better with lower price. 
799 3 It's not a complete spa experience, but I haven't had one massage therapist that I didn't feel was excellent. I talked my husband into joining after a miserable 18 month experience with Massage Envy, and he's been very happy with the massages, as well. 
800 3 Yummy breakfast! Seating is a little crammed but the food was great and enviroment was fun. Would def love to come back 
801 3 Donuts were great. Pretty dense but delicious. There are a good amount of options that you can choose from. Pretty pricey though--about $3/donut. Not much seating in this location. 
802 3 Date night. Had the crazy roll with the happy hour special, hot sake, yellowtail and salmon spicy roll. Definitely coming back. 
803 0 Horrible setup with one way driving through vacuum area to car was line. No way to vacuum after washing without going through the wash again since there is no other way off the property. 
804 4 Good grooming place. Nice things they have to sell... leave your wallet somewhere not easy to reach! 
805 4 Everyone helps everyone I never saw an empty cup, plate, or unhappy person.I have had such a hard week but this meal experience with Katey and Rich as the manager we will not go to another Olive Garden 
806 3 The best Mole I've ever had. Seriously. The Enchiladas Alliende are no longer on the menu, but they'll make it for ya if ya ask nicely. I like to get one mole enchilada w/ chicken and one enchilada alliende so I can double my pleasure. Their margaritas are decent too. 
807 2 I would give this place 3-1/2 stars. It was good, the waiter was attentive (once he came to the table). The food was good. Nothing too exciting. Decor was nice. Not too much to say about this place. 
808 1 They only have two people working. The line is about 40 people deep, and each person demands about a dozen samples before the decide what to order. If you come, bring lots of patience. I have no clue why they would be so short staffed on a Saturday afternoon. 
809 4 Worth the wait. They were crazy busy. There was a line out the door. The mutt is my favorite. They are big and delicious 
810 4 Caporale's has a great wine and craft beer inventory, and employees that know their products. Employees are helpful and friendly,offering to help me carry any heavy purchases to the car, upon seeing my disability. Their prices are the lowest in town. 
811 3 The most authentic Italian pizza Margherita I've had in the states. Exactly like the pizza that my wife and I had at many cafes in Rome! The salads are fantastic as well with very fresh ingredients. 
812 4 Started going to John's 4 years ago & haven't looked back. He's been there 21 years. John is very very good. It can be busy sometimes, like any other barbershop. Highly recommended! 
813 4 Aimee did an amazing job making my friend and I very comfortable for our first Brazilians. We definitely will be looking forward to purchasing a wax package and seeing her again. 
814 4 I've thoroughly enjoyed every meal I've eaten here. We generally get the tortillas and guacamole then split an entree and leave full. Such great vegetables! Friendly staff. Good beer selection. This, together with their Hillsdale location, has become my favorite Mexican restaurant. 
815 4 Great Cuban food. If you're in Atlanta stop by and get the ropa vieja. The tamale is amazing! Get that too. 
816 4 What else is there to say? Great sushi, great soup, service is a little slow but worth it hands down. We come here regularly and they are always great! 
817 4 What a lovely neighborhood bar. The menu is good, bar food and fabulous prices on drinks. Great place to have a first date, meeting friends or just hanging out! Cheers 
818 3 Beautiful building and spacious. Wish more choices for food though. 
819 4 Omg this is truly worth the drive. I got jerk chicken and oxtails this my first visit and must say now my favorite.Just plain FIRE!(good) 
820 4 Enjoyed 2 large meat entrees (pork and chicken) and 6 small tapas (spinach, olives, peperoni, mushrooms, bread, and olives) for 4 guys. The food was very good. The wine list was exceptional. Service was very good. Will return and try the rabbit and trout. F 
821 3 Thought this may be a tourist trap but was pleasantly surprised with the Happy Hour menu and the food was great. 
822 0 The room was horrible and the customer service was worse. To top it off, my car was burglarized overnight and no one even offered to assist with calling the police. My advice would be to stay away from this hotel and area. 
823 1 Rowdy atmosphere. Mediocre food. Bad service. Any questions? 
824 3 Lovely lunch spot. Quaint and quiet. I was very impressed by the lunch bill, we had a party of 6 and the bill was only $80! I was reminded of England, which was nice :) 
825 4 Can't say enough about the watermelon cocktail, like drinking an aqua freasca. Jocelyn made them for us and boy can she slap the shit outta some mint. Biggest watermelon chunks in Austin - I heavily encourage you to get involved. 
826 4 The chicken made it obvious why it was world famous and the cole slaw was delicious too! Mac and cheese was a little disappointing though. Pecan pie was amazing as well 
827 4 I experienced a very pleasant time at cozy nails! Ne was very kind and payed very close detail to doing my nails! Each time I come I walk away satisfied and will definitely return! 
828 4 Quality smoothies made at quality prices. I owe part of my awesome physique to this place with the Gladiator smoothie. Thank you Smoothie King 
829 4 I love the Peabody Essex Museum. It is wheelchair friendly. As a disabled person that is a must and plus. 
830 4 Waiting in line (so popular), got served a drink. Heaven! Food was great too, had a greek burger. Looking forward to stopping by again. 
831 4 Must try this place if you appreciate great sushi. TOJO'S quality only much easier on the wallet. Signed, KK, CS 
832 1 Nice coffee, 15 minute wait not acceptable. Great setting however the whole operation feels very amateurish. Needs some life in there too! Staff half asleep. 
833 4 Absolutely amazing food. Authentic and delicious. Leave room for the dessert. Well worth it! 
834 4 I like this station for at work listening because there is nothing too heavy, but it's not old folks soft rock. I also like the fact that you can listen live for free on the website! 
835 1 Wings and burgers are on point. Here's the problem, I had 6 draft beers (Sam Adams). Price per beer?? $6!!! Yep, $6 per beer. Draft beer!! Who in the hell pays $6 for a draft beer?? $36 for six draft beers!! WILL NOT BE BACK. RIPOFF 
836 2 I give it three stars, mostly for the location. Food was under seasoned and not anything to return for. You can sit out on the patio and enjoy a drink and the sunshine though. Our waitress, Madie, was great. 
837 4 One of my favorite places to stop when visiting Columbus. Bodhi is regularly on draft, and the food menu is very good. I normally get an appetizer or two with my beer. I always sit at the bar and the bar staff members are always friendly. 
838 0 Waited 2 hour for just one pizza. Terrible services and there was no apologies from either the manager or the driver. 
839 2 Fun bar, lots of people and good music the night We stopped in. Drinks are avg, but the staff was friendly. Will come back for more music and fun. 
840 3 Great service! I really appreciated our waiter- he was attentive but not overly attentive- He let us really take time to enjoy our meal and the warmth of our environment. 
841 4 Damar, the store Manager, is wonderful to work with. He goes above and beyond to ensure your experience is great. He communicated with me very frequently during the rental process for my wedding and made the process accurate, smooth, and free of issues. 
842 3 Found cupcake wars on the food channel. I yelped gluten free and I found the yum yum truck! Yummie! 
843 0 Worst I've ever had I could of filled my cup with the grease that I squeezed out of it absolute disgusting ! 
844 4 Delicious breakfast, quite possibly the best omelette I have ever had. Fluffy eggs. Fun to watch all the pink boxes walk by. Excellent service. 
845 3 They do a good pedicure. I like a thorough exfoliation and cuticle clean up. I find a lot of other places don't do this. 
846 3 I drove past this place for years. I order take out a couple days ago This places pizza and buffalo wings are amazing!!! The mozzarella sticks didn't have any cheese in them 
847 3 My dogs loved it here! We arrived around 9:15am on a Saturday morning and there was already a line backed up for parking. Get there early! :) 
848 4 Wide selection, customer service on point and they're very knowledgeable about their products. I will definitely come back here again 
849 4 Go see Renee and Daniel! They are so sweet and talented. I will be back. Lydia took great care of my mother. This place is clean, great color selection an atmosphere!! 
850 3 Interesting mix of pan Asian foods. Surprisingly, the Korean food is mediocre (I believe the owners are Korean), but I do like their Crazy Noodles (Thai). 
851 4 I was very sad to realize a childhood favorite, Wellesley House of Pizza, had closed. But Cooks Window is a worthy successor of the space. Delicious pizza, fresh meats for sandwiches, (fantastic Italian in particular) and fast, friendly service. Fair prices too. Great spot! 
852 2 Al pastor lunch special with avocado sauce was really tasty. Fish taco's were a bit uninspired but decent. I doubt the fish was cooked to order. Black beans were bland, I'll go for refried ones next time. Parking can be tough. Service was really good and helpful. 
853 3 Good, solid italian with friendly, efficient service. Pizza, pasta, salad and a few appetizers. Nothing out of the ordinary but everything is fresh and well prepared for a good price 
854 4 Great place, friendly staff, fantastic ambience, especially if you manage to get a seat at the bar 
855 2 Pretty good prices for the serving size, but I was not impressed by the food quality. The fried rice is quite bland. 
856 4 Dedham Veterinary Associates, especially Dr. Kuo, provides excellent veterinary services for my pets. Dr. Kuo is listens thoughtfully and very responsive to my concerns. She also offers alternatives to very expensive tests for my older pets when I request. I feel confident my pets get A+ medical attention here. 
857 4 Dr. Simon was able to get me back in line after 7 years of almost constant traveling, and provides a very positive experience, really listens to where you're needing the work and analyzes the best route to take. Absolutely recommend him! 
858 4 Most amazing ppl work at this cafe. I forgot my wallet and told the super nice lady (Gabriela) about my situation and she was like dont worry about it!! Wow Boston has some really nice ppl 
859 4 Svetlana was great! We hired her for a resident event to draw caricatures of resident pets. It was a huge hit and our residents loved it! Would definitely hire her again. 
860 0 Waited for two hours. Continued to get told thirty more minutes the whole time. After two hours they said they more minutes, but we found out that the TWO tables they has for four people has just received appetizers. Ridiculous management 
861 4 Shortest waiting time out for walk in dim sum restaurants in Richmond. Loved the atmosphere and food, would definitely come again in the future! 
862 4 They were busy, but we got seated right away. Staff was friendly and fast. Food came quick and was delicious. Portions are a good size, so bring your appetite! 
863 4 By far the best dental experience I've ever had in my life! The staff is super personable and professional. My hygienist, Peggy sensed that I was nervous at first and made me feel totally comfortable during my visit. I would highly recommend to everyone. 
864 3 It is a fuckin' Wendy's. Parking does suck, but the food is as good as it is elsewhere, and the staff remembers you - that's rare for a fast food chain. 
865 4 "That was officially AMAZING!" Those were the words from my daughter. We had the churrasco, tostones, yuca frita in mojo de ajo, red beans, & black beans. The service was attentive & the Venezuelan hosts & waiters were friendly! 
866 4 Very simple answer " People wait in line for a reason! " Awesome customer service, even though they are very busy. Humble staff, Great food, nice drinks , Very nice ambience. Sitting outside and having burger that melts in your mouth! Totally worth it. 
867 4 seriously, y'all. i spent a saturday afternoon out on the patio listening to a soundtrack of kick ass country music while being helped by a most awesome barkeep. i don't think i've ever been happier than in that moment. praise the mean-eyed cat! 
868 3 Yum! Ate here for a friend's wedding reception dinner. It was quite the feast, and we got quite the show with the flaming cheese. The service was great and the food was tasty! The restaurant has some charm to it, as well. 
869 2 Worst crawfish I've ever had. Tasted like sun dried shrimp. 它家的小龙虾是我吃过最糟糕的，像晒干的虾仁。建议厨师自己尝尝。 
870 2 The best way to describe this place is average. They do have a nice selection of beers, but over all it seems a bit spendy for average pizza. 
871 4 Probably one of the only car washes I've been too that they practically wash the entire vehicle prior to going into the automated portion of the wash. Well worth the money. 
872 4 Let's just say they got a fat menu. You should be able to find something. It's great! Salads, sandwiches, breakfast, desert, burgers and more... 
873 4 My family and I eat here atleast once a week. Good and delicious fresh food. Trio tacos is my favorite with steak, my man gets the chicago burrito and of course cant forget our horchatas :)) 
874 4 Authentic Japanese restaurant. Decent food for this price. My favorite dish is the rice with tea and 明太子. Good ace for part of 3-5. Cause you can order more and share. 
875 4 I love this place. First restaurant I've tried Thai cuisine and I fell in love instantly. The corn taro fritters are fabulous and so is the soup. 
876 3 Nice atmosphere, good enough food with huge portions, definitely big enough for two. Our waitress was very friendly. First time I see an Asian restaurant bringing you bread before the meal. 
877 4 Extremely helpful, incredibly patient and entirely professional. Their selection is massive and the 1-1 shopping is excellent. I went in to browse and walked out with 2 pairs of glasses. 
878 3 Great little Chinese takeout place. Always quick, tasty, and friendly. I have lived near by for 6 years and the food as always been consistent. Very lucky to have a place like this nearby. I would definitely recommend it. 
879 3 Uber expensive, but a great place to browse for the latest men and women fashions and quirky accessories. They have a great eye-wear shop too. Fun and modern harbor-front location. Much nicer than their old stuffy Newburry St haunt. 
880 1 Food isn't the best but nice waitress. Being on the water is nice. It fun to see the boats coming and going and watch boats going by. Went for ambience more anything. 
881 3 Nice casual day time bar. Great on a summer day to just kick back, grab a drink with a few buddies, and people watch all day. It's reasonably priced, good beer selection. You can't go wrong. 
882 4 I'm so happy that I found a donut place near me. Friendly service and sweet treats make for an excellent start to the day. I cant suggest any one donut, as they are all good. 
883 4 Always have a great experience here, even though I normally come when the store is about to close. Alan is extremely helpful. 
884 4 Best in Orlando. Put modern flavor into the former peabody hotel. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. 
885 2 It is an OK place for dinner but not the best they do have great music on the weekends and a great Sunday brunch we really enjoyed our time there. 
886 0 Horrible wait. Saturday afternoon, peak summer travel, two people working and looking at hour plus wait to get a car. If going to Orlando you may want to consider a different rental company. No other company backed up like this. 
887 2 Heard the hype about blue star. I think it stays a hype. Got matcha, lemon poppy, basil with some berry, and chocolate hazelnut. They were okay... I've had better donuts in SoCal. I enjoyed the white interior though... 
888 4 Great new and used record shopping. Good use of a small space and long overdue for East Van. 
889 2 I never complain. Like never. When I'm spending $50 as an individual to eat here and they mess up everything on my brothers birthday, I'm gonna complain. Make it up to me shaking crab. Wow. Terrible. I am giving three stars because I hate to complain about small business. 
890 4 Fantastic! I got the ziti in pomodoro with sausage, Mom got the lasagna, Dad got the special, and Niece got ziti with alfredo sauce. Everyone loved it. The service was great. 
891 4 Thurns Meats are delicious. Worth the trip. Tonight picked up pulled pork, brats, andouillie, and German bologna. They had sold out of ham salad so they went in back and made a new batch for me! Fantastic service, delicious and top quality products. 
892 3 Great food, but this location is usually slammed during lunch hours. Oh, and keep in mind when you're admiring how good you've been that receipt nutrition facts can be misleading. They don't count dressing, extra toppings, byo, etc. correctly. 
893 3 very solid corporate breakfast spot. Surprisingly good eggs Benedict dishes. 
894 4 Good seafood and good service. I picked up on this place from a scout mob deal Met the owner. Friendly. Came back. Friendly and helpful staff Make meals to accommodate no seasoning. 
895 2 Pretty good quality massage but if you get a foot massage, you aren't in a very private area and the staff talks loudly in the lobby area. Not so peaceful when you are trying to relax. 
896 4 very delicious ramen. super friendly staff. super efficient ordering. awesome atmosphere! 
897 4 Just went there tonight and it was great! The service was awesome and the food was delicious. I got the gnocchi special and loved it. We didn't have a reservation but they squeezed us in. We loved that it is family run. 
898 0 I didn't see the Yelp reviews and Zagat sticker until it was too late. It seems all the good places are closed until January 2nd. 
899 1 Decent, but not great. Even though Sushi Town is closer, my boyfriend and I prefer to go to Marine Polis Sushiland down by Beaverton Town Square instead-- their dishes are something like 25-50 cents cheaper per item and the food is better. 
900 4 We have been there twice in the past 3 days! We had awesome pizza & beer both days. The wait staff has been really attentive and fast. We would definitely recommend it as a place to eat while in Orlando FL 
901 3 Great burrata ap and Meatball ap. Pizza's are solid. Atmosphere is nice good at night. A hidden treasure in the north end. Easy to walk by and not notice but worth stopping in and eating there. Enjoy! 
902 4 Service was good, food was good, you can go in there and get lunch under 30 minutes. They also make very good drinks. The Manhattan was to die for!! 
903 4 Really great fresh ice cream on a warm waffle cone! We loved both the chocolate as $&@$ and the party chocolate (which is vegan, although I am not vegan - i chose it purely for the chocolate coconut taste). 
904 0 Bad service!!! They served me this mushroom without washing. I had ask them why the mushroom look dusty (black dots are soil). They told me that they already washed and this is how the mushrooms supposed to be. This is the worst place ever!!!! 
905 4 Veggies here are very fresh. You can see the place and food is kept clean. Try he Hungarian soups from their deli. 
906 3 Excellent food and great service. Had the halibut, which was soft as butter! And a healthy side of spinach and Kale. Pleasantly surprised as dining options at the hotel are limited. 
907 0 Business Closed Purchased a living social coupon and made a reservation for Sunday brunch, unfortunately, the restaurant was closed. Several people were turned away. No sign, no lights on and no one answered the phone when we called. Many us were disappointed. It appears they are out of business. 
908 4 Great place. The bartender was one of the nicest guys I've ever met. I would give him one of my organs if he needed a transplant 
909 4 Absolutely fresh kfc. I loved it, top 3 in texas for sure. Their seasoning is well balanced as far as their spicyness. 
910 4 Outstanding original gyro for $8. 
911 1 Overrated, overpriced, with only so-so service. Why does this place get such rave reviews? Perhaps the expectations made by everyone RAVING about this place ruined me, but honestly, Farm Burger is 100x better. 
912 4 Absolutely awesome doctors and team. The professionalism, attention to detail and not rushing you through the appointments is incredible. They care, really care about your health and getting it right the first time. Thanks for the awesome service. 
913 2 Dear DJ, You said you would play "Hammertime"... You didn't... You are dead to me forever. Fun night though! 
914 3 We came here on our last day of our vacation. The decor is very nice inside and the staff is friendly. We tried the dim sum and overall about 8-10 dishes. The quality is good and authentic but a little on the pricey side. I would come back again. 
915 2 Great drinks but very rude service. Heard one bartender talking shit about another guest to a different guest. Then got rude service also that was un needed. 
916 0 This is not like other Newks. The staff doesn't care here. It took forever to get a soup and sandwhich. Newks is good - just go to another location. 
917 0 Kids meals are over priced and the regular menu prices seem high for the food value. Seems like the prices match the area of town but your paying way more for what you get in my opinion. Dessert was dry, seems it was sitting in the window for too long. 
918 4 Great class, LOVED the HEAT and instructor! 
919 3 Seems like a fun place. Drinks are good, food is like any other bar food. I guess if you wanna party you come here, since it turns into a club later at night. 
920 4 My favorite place for breakfast. Authentic, homemade food, reasonably priced, and friendly staff. Super cute kitschy decor. Like walking into a diner of the past. No kale smoothies here! Come ready to feast. You won't be disappointed. Try the cinnamon roll french toast--it's the BEST! 
921 0 This is the slowest place I have been too in my whole entire life! We waited over an house for a few burgers and a pizza. Just a total disaster. They gave us nachos and guacamole on the house to make it up What a joke ! 
922 3 The fish and grits was excellent! 4 stars for not offering at the bar bottomless mimosas...like seriously wtf?!? ‍. The drinks are good...bartender is on fire Atmospheric awesome....music something you can vibe to...changes from old school to trap to hip hop. 
923 4 Just went here last night for the second time. Awesome food, good selection of drinks and friendly atmosphere. There is a good sized section by the bar that was pretty crowded and the dining area was sectioned off so it wasn't too loud. I highly recommend the Scotch eggs! 
924 3 Great lunch with fun fab service. You can create your own pizza. We had a laborer pizza and a terrific gluten free pizza. 
925 4 This was my first time visiting this restaurant and I must say I'm impressed. The food is delicious. They have daily specials which I love. The two young ladies who took my order are very friendly. I will ear here again. 
926 4 Food is great. Selection is great. Service is great. So glad someone finally put the best meal ever front and center. 
927 0 Bad quality food. So much salt. We waited for utensils over 5 minutes after we got the food. I never come back here. I don't recommend to anybody. 
928 4 The business where I work uses Rigano's to tow cars illegally parked on the company property. They are always prompt, professional and polite. 
929 0 Food is ok. Service is poor, ladies that take your order yell at you, they look like they don't really like their job, there is no effort. 
930 4 Very good and as far as I can tell authentic food. Prices are really good for the quality and amount you get. 
931 1 Is you would like to leave a bar smelling like anything other that cigarettes, this is not the bar for you. Drinks are fairly priced, but no real deals here. Okay place to hang out for a few, but don't make a night of it. 
932 3 Had a great breakfast here and friendly service. The waffle bar was probably my favorite. I want to go back and update this review more. 
933 2 The breakfast is great. Get there early on the weekend, unless you like long waits. No wait time during the week. I'll have to try lunch sometime... 
934 4 As always, a lot of fun. I love the food. They bring plenty of bread, warm towels before the meal, and it feels like a family run place. 
935 0 I got the feel that I am not welcome there!!! Seriously!!! Worst customer services I have seen in the US... 
936 2 I'm in love with their chicken rice lunch special. The atmosphere is pleasant and casual. Staff is kind. Like the sushi bar where they prepare right in front of you. Nice touch 
937 4 I've eaten here 4 times and every time has been great. I ate there this morning with a good friend of mine as they opened up at 7 AM. Not very at that time but what I like most about this place is their unique menu 
938 3 The dan dan fries were amazing. I can't imagine a more perfect drunk food. The fried chicken sandwich was too big for my mouth but tasty. 
939 4 This place is my new go to. I have been here 3 times and have always received friendly service and my nails look great. Good selection of shellac colors. 
940 3 Had a seafood platter... scallops, crab, cod were all done up nicely. Fries were crispy. Sauces yummy. Good prices for Granville Island. 
941 4 These ladies rock! I was getting back into biking and needed a tune up. They were easy-going, knowledgable and helped me out immensely. Definitely recommend this place! 
942 4 No reason this plan deserves anything less than five stars. Everything was perfect. I will be back many times! Only chicken and waffle I would ever order again. Grit sticks are a have to try item! 
943 1 Kid's cheeseburger with fries and a milkshake cost $15.29. The milkshake was good but the cheeseburger was horrible. Not worth a return. 
944 1 breakfast was alright and the rooms were clean. microwave didn't work and neither did the fridge. they charge an extra fee for pets so be aware of that. 
945 4 Arrived 7.05am, already 10 folks ahead of me. Walked out at 7.30am. Great service throughout process. Lools like these folks are slammed from when they open but no issues for my visit. 
946 4 Beautiful views of Austin, both the skyline and the water! Less of a hike, more of a walk up some stairs! There seem to be other places where people can walk/hike but I wasn't sure. There are some picnic tables, next time I would bring a picnic! 
947 3 Great for breakfast. Chicken and waffles looked really good. But I only had the simple 2 egg breakfast which was perfectly done. No wait on a Sunday morning was a big plus too. Highly recommend 
948 4 A great place ! The bowls are awesome, priced right, and delicious. Staff was super knowledgeable,friendly, and helpful. I'm a fan. Eat in, take out all is awesome. 
949 4 Fantastic Daycare for small dogs. Sofia is the best! 
950 2 About what you would expect from a Miller's Ale House. Not really a lot to read into unless you've never been to a Miller's Ale House before, in which case prepare for some basic food and beer. 
951 4 So this is my 2nd review in the last 2 years. The H.W. continues to impress with great food, huge portions, great service and reasonable prices. If you come to salem this place is a must! Nachos, burritos, tacos or fajitas....you can't go wrong. Wicked awesome!!!!! 
952 3 Went there tonight with the family for dinner. We ordered grilled pork chops, buttered beef, shrimp and spring rolls. We enjoyed everything and the owners went out of their way to please us. Service was great. The vietnamese coffee was exellent! I would go there again. 
953 4 I had the vanilla bean at the Somerville Winter market and I've been dreaming about it ever since. Absolutely decadent! 
954 3 We ordered their Greek pizza and very much enjoyed it. The ingredients tasted fresh and the service was very friendly. We will be back soon. 
955 4 Tour was awesome and I am just a huge fan of the beer in general. But definitely take the tour because it is an experience in itself. 
956 4 had the best experience with these guys. Dave was very responsive and fit me in the next day. No waiting and excellent results. Was finished exactly when they promised. Couldn't be happier. 
957 3 The food was fine, but it looked as though vampires lived there. So, in conclusion, if you like nice food more than you like being attacked by vampires, make a reservation. 
958 4 Awesome food, enormous portions and super friendly staff. Love the Curry Chicken with Peas and Rice. Just remember that you can't possibly finish the amount of food. So frickin' good. 
959 4 Best sandwich I've had in town for a long long time Porchetta rules! 
960 4 Chill, comfortable spot with a great happy hour & great service. Suggestions from the server were excellent, the environment was romantic & food came out quick. 
961 4 Can't get enough of this place. The lamb tibs are delicious!! Been doing takeout and looking forward to dining on the patio this spring. 
962 1 Friend ordered a well done burger. It came out medium rare; took them another 20 minutes. The entire table was through eating by the time her burger returned. 
963 2 Pumpkin Spice latte time! Get it, get it hot, and get it often. 
964 4 Amazing park! Great location as well. We got our pictures done here! There was amazing scenery, didn't notice any trash or unwelcoming items. Things to do/explore for everyone! Human moms, dog moms you name it! 
965 4 I have been here 3 nights in row. Best Thai food and an incredible pho soup I was not going to come in because the strip mall is not the best but I am glad I did. Ask for Kat. Fabulous food 
966 2 Got the lychee bubble tea - waited 20 mins, was average. Nothing special. Other things might be better. 
967 0 Since they were shut down by the board of health a few years ago for having raw sewage in their fishtanks, I can not stomach this place! 
968 4 Out of town working and I stopped here for lunch. Fantastic food that is off the chart. They brew their own beer and cut their own meat. Great spot will come back. 
969 4 Wow! My sister said she'd never seen a more beautiful arrangement, and they paid attention and created what I asked for all the way down to me mentioning she loves peacock feathers, bright colors and shorter vases! I will definitely use them again! 
970 4 I've been going to this place since I was a little tyke. The fact of its continued existence over the years is good evidence that it's a yummy establishment with a good staff. The crab rangoons are crave-worthy. 
971 3 I go here quite frequently, and the wings are always great. They make your food when you order it, so expect a little wait (~10 min). I highly recommend the honey bourbon wings and the tator tots. Like many food carts in the area the service is friendly and personal. 
972 2 This hotel was clean and comfortable, check in process was quick and efficient. Rooms were very spacious and staff was quite friendly. There was no hotel dining or bar however, which was a bit disappointing. Breakfast was alright, nothing spectacular. 
973 2 Jury is out here. Been several times. Just don't understand how the bar staff cannot pull a pint of Guinness properly. At least get THAT right. And...lose the attitude. 
974 4 100% vegan, and 100% bad ass for vegan products, especially those hard to find items! 
975 4 All time favorite while working in Atlanta. Great people, food and of course great vibe. Mas hot chicas on Thursday and Sunday 
976 4 Incredible donuts. Sometimes you have to go early to have the full selection but the donuts never disappoint. 
977 1 Fresh food, but just not my flavor. Doesnt mean bad, but not my type of cuisine. Giving a couple os stars becaus e others like the fresh element 
978 3 Wow! I just had their amaretto almond and it was stellar!!!! The girl at the counter must havebeen new. She was a little slow and there was a long line but it was worth the wait! 
979 4 You are paying for stay in the biggest hotel in Atlanta and the location. It gets crowded on holidays and vacations. 
980 4 Love the dicey place. All kinds of people to talk to. Great happy hr times. Great bartenders. Food is eh. But what do you expect from a dive. But drinks are great! 
981 2 Heard about this place years ago on TV. In town for business, decided to see for myself. The green beans and Turnip greens were superb but the Tilapia was dry, too spicy and too salty. :( Thank Goodness for the yummy banana pudding with plenty of wafers. 
982 4 Food was good, place was clean. However the waitress verbally demanded for a 20% TIP, which was a bit rude. 
983 3 I have been working with this firm to process my legal documents for a few years now. They have been prompt and able to file my paperwork on time and kind to respond to my one of legal questions now and then. Good firm to work with. 
984 3 Good for a quick and low cost lunch! 
985 4 Omg most authentic Japanese I've had since I been there and its not simple sushi rolls and chinese dishes every other place has They really had Don's which is a person favorite! Going back soon ! 
986 4 They replaced our window quickly even after the glass arrived broken. Nice guys, fast service. 
987 0 Come here if you enjoy horrible service, overpriced food, and being charged a 20% gratuity fee when you have a group of four. This place sucks flaccid monkey gonads. 
988 4 The hostesses were unbelievably friendly and the food was amazing. Today was my birthday and I went here for lunch and had the best birthday of my life. Im coming back here tomorrow and the next day! 
989 2 Went here for brunch and started off with the mimosa flight. Very cool idea, but I expected the juices to be fresh for the price of $17! The food was just ok and potatoes were dry. I would give this place another chance but this experience was average. 
990 3 Love there service......they always remember my order and my name......good memory X-SITE GRILL 
991 4 Phenomenal, hidden gem if you're looking for authentic and delicious Italian food. Omg. Service was also excellent. This is a hidden gem. 
992 0 Not sure how these guys got my number but I've been receiving robocalls from them for over a year now. I've asked them to stop calling me and reported it to the do not call registry. I have no idea how to get these to stop. 
993 1 This was ok. The sandwich is cold the cheese was not melted and the meat was cold as well. The fries tasted like dirty grease and the soup was lukewarm. It was edible but will not go back. Better choices to eat nearby. 
994 4 There is no place like Voodoo Doughnuts!!! Loved the Blueberry and Oreo cookies with chocolate and peanut butter!! Open 24 hours 
995 4 Great food, great service, good value for the money. This was my 3rd time here and walked away a happy customer all 3 times. A+ for me. 
996 4 Tonight I went back to 888 and is still amazing. Low key and incredible food. I can't think of an item on their menu that isn't fantastic. I personally think their spring rolls are one of the best in town. Simple yet delicious! Kind of miss sitting outside tho. 
997 0 Food 3 stars. Service not even one. Worst service ever in a Korean restaurant. No smile at all kimchi comes later than main dish. Will never come back. 
998 3 My previous negative review of this restaurant was intended for the Northbound Rt 1 McDonalds, not this restaurant. This restaurant seems to do a good job, and has attentive and responsible management. 
999 3 Traveled with my dog and it was a great experience. Fast and friendly. The flight was smooth and stewardess were very nice. I didn't have any issues flying with my pup but the $90ish fee both ways is a little high considering he's on the floor. Overall great experience. 
1000 4 Loved the shakes! They let you combine two flavors with one topping and mix it up in a little mason jar. I wish the shakes were a bit larger, but they are still worth getting for $6. 
1001 3 I always like this place when I want some traditional food! The xiaolongbao is amazing. However, the service could be better! 
1002 3 Yummmmy. I've been there twice and it's been delicious both times. We had the O-Ring Shorty for appetizer, Oh WOW!!!! I had the turkey burger and was phenomenal. My kids love the gourmet cheeseburger and arctic cod fish & chips. 
1003 2 A busy store with a bunch of items not available, and be ready to use the self checkout machines. 
1004 4 This is a gem you don't expect from the outside. Delicious sandwiches and some awesome beer selections and oddity foods. A must go to again and again. It's yummy!! 
1005 4 Awesome place. The sausage and sauerkraut were out of this world. Fresh made applesauce and the atmosphere is wonderful. 
1006 4 Shane is and was amazing! He is very professional, personable, arrived on-time, has very fare pricing, and is extremely knowledgeable. If you are looking for a A plus experience call Shane..you will not be disappointed. Thanks Shane for helping me out - and saving the grief for my husband!! 
1007 4 Very very cozy Irish pub , upscale and delicious pub offerings. Delicious! Great Happy Hour menu! 
1008 4 This place works with ME Gene Johnson mechanics http://www.yelp.com/biz/me-gene-johnson-station-and-garage-austin. Everyone is so pleasant. They get my car in and out in under ten minutes and under $30, without a up-sell and with a smile. Get your oil change here. 5 Stars! 2 thumbs up! 
1009 4 A very nice, clean store. The staff are all friendly and helpful. The obedience classes are wonderful and the instructor was very knowledgeable. I would love to see more classes available. 
1010 3 I've been here a couple of times and just got delivery from them. Food has been great every time. Service has always been good as well. I think I have a new go-to Thai delivery place. 
1011 2 The sliders were tasty and creative, if a bit greasier than I expected. Service was prompt. 
1012 0 New management allows druggies to live in units. Complained numerous times and nothing happens. Guy sleeps outside yelling "bad people" and bangs on the walls when folks walk by. Do not rent a unit from this place. 
1013 0 So we had a decent night out until the bouncer said "get those homos out" to my friends. Not cool. At this day and age a bouncer should not be homophobic in Boston. 
1014 3 The food was really fresh and really flavored, healthy yummy breakfast.. But it took a while to get our checks unfortunately. 
1015 3 The was coffee good and had a cranberry turkey sandwich. Love the outdoor seating area overlooking the lake and hear the sounds of the kids playing in the fountain next door. 
1016 2 Food is ok, seemed like too many veggies and not enough protein. After the extra rice charge, a small lunch was $9...which is too high!! 
1017 4 Cute first time there it's kawii and I love what they have so planing to go back and get more 
1018 4 Hidden gem! It's a quaint little dessert place - all the desserts look amazing! The place has a mysterious vibe and I love it!!!! Must try for any Portland visitor 
1019 4 This place is amazing. Crowded yes, but totally worth it. Food was amazing and the drink selection was good. If you like beer they have a lot of local craft beers. Full service at the bar if you want to skip the line but mostly for parties of 2. 
1020 3 I tried their appetizer sampler, hummus plate, and scallops with risotto. Both appetizers were great. The scallops were good. Friendly service and very attentive. 
1021 4 I just ate here today and was really satisfied. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere as relaxed and the food was great! Highly recommended! 
1022 4 I'm confused why the reviews aren't better for this restaurant because I had an absolutely wonderful experience. Our server and bartender were friendly and funny. The food was spot on. Overall, definitely coming back ASAP! 
1023 3 The best pancake I've ever had. We went there for brunch and we truly enjoyed. The egg sandwich as well the other sandwiches was perfect. Great cocktails.i will definitely returned. 
1024 1 Can't imagine why anyone would think the buffet was tasty. It all seemed bland, overcooked, and a little greasy. Luckily, I spotted the sriracha sauce, ginger, garlic, and other condiments adjacent to the steam tables. Even the hot and sour soup seemed underpowered. Guess I'll have to trek to Chinatown. 
1025 2 These guys have excellent delivery and are super consistent if you want some good wings delivered check em out I'm not a fan of the pizza sauce but over all the pizza is good too 
1026 4 I have been taking my vehicles here for over 20 years. Great shop very honest and helpful. One of the best shops in Boulder County. 
1027 4 Love this ramen shop. Never get tired of coming. I drive all the way from San Antonio for them. 
1028 4 Pizza works has really good regular cheese pizza. The slices are big and the quality is very good. I would say best in the burlington area. My wife also likes the subs from there. They also have online ordering which I love. 
1029 4 Great food-super price if you're on a budget. The place is clean-service great and the food outstanding. If you're in this area give it a shot-well worth it. Only drawback is parking but I can't ding them for that. Just be prepared to park on the street. 
1030 3 Very good pizza. Not overdone. I ordered the deep dish with my own toppings that took around 20 mins. Needs 2-3 to finish. I also ordered the Sicilian cheese bread that was quite good. Not very expensive. They also serve a buffet in weekdays. 
1031 4 Great spot with excellent food and nice atmosphere. I have been to Nisa's at least five times and have never been disappointed. Try it soon. 
1032 4 Hey all of you want a great inexpensive Steak Bomb get at Market Basket for the $ Awesome.... For 3$ A Bacon burger with fries great deal .. 
1033 4 Finally caught up with them at the Atlanta Street Food Festival. Delicious! Love the blue cheese fries, will definitely eat from their truck again. 
1034 3 Nice place on park ave. seated pretty quick on a Friday night with a reservation. Our server was Turkish and was attentive and pleasant. He had good recommendations for us. The pita with hummus was awesome. Nice environment. Food was good and prices were fair. 
1035 2 great ambience, not as vegan-friendly as its reputation in my opinion. i've only been here for breakfast though. still i love the food. the tim curry is interesting for sure. 
1036 4 This is an awesome library with a great selection of books, DVDs, CDs. Excellent inter-library loan services. I love this library. 
1037 3 Food and service are first rate. Easy to miss in a strip center but with the trip. Had guacamole and trio tacos (shredded chicken). 
1038 4 My all time favorite custard place in Atlanta. Reminds me of home, Milwaukee. A wide variety of toppings, smooth & creamy custard, lots of sundae choices. I absolutely love, love, love this place. Will go back over and over again. 
1039 3 Nutella + Burnt Marshmallows Milkshake is a must try. If your in a burger mood, try one of their different creations like the lamburger or cuban. They have some great sides and a very tentative staff. During beautiful weather, there is a nice outdoor seating area. 
1040 3 People on here complaining too much. You getting probably around $50 worth of food for 25 bucks. Sure the place can be a bit cleaner but then you gotta pay more to eat here, and I am sure people will complain about the price increase if that was the case. 
1041 3 Can't go wrong with a bahama mama and finishing your meal with a giant cream puff! 
1042 1 Had great anticipation... But highly dissapeointng. The are not many ingredients in the ramen.... Most dishes taste the same, there is not any dishes were made with thoughtfulness. Not wanting to go back again. 
1043 4 Every interaction I have with Paul Barton's office is efficient, friendly, and very professional. His whole team (especially Desiree) is knowledgeable, and I know I will get high-quality help and information when I call or need assistance. 
1044 2 After my post, Peace Frog contacted me and came back out to repair the damage. 
1045 4 Kids love it, and teachers get an educators pass. The extra five is totally worth it for the preferred parking. Visitied the new penguin exhibit and the line moved pretty fast. 
1046 4 These guys are awesome. I order my pizza from work a mile away, and when I get there it's ready. They never mess up my order like other places do. They're really nice, too. Their $5.99 deal is awesome. 
1047 2 Was the food good? Yes. Was the booze good? Yes. Was it worth the 1 + hour wait on a late Sunday morning. ummmmm ..hmmm... if you're with good company then maybe. While good food, good service, cool place I wouldn't wait an hour plus to be seated here again. 
1048 2 Se voce estiver em Atlanta morrendo de saudade do nosso feijão com arroz e do nosso pastel (empanada), este restaurante cubano pode ser uma boa opção. É bem barato, mas também muito, muito simples. Vale da dica! 
1049 1 Slow service. Very loud. Not a venue for a nice dinner with your significant other. Steaks not as good as advertised. Have had much better at Morton's and other steak houses. 
1050 0 Ugh.... While visiting Orlando --worse Walmart I've shopped at. Long lines, MESSY & DIRTY!!! --Beware -- 
1051 1 the food is OK. sushi is small and not that fresh worst service i've encountered in a long time. 
1052 0 Had a breakfast burrito and it came with a white price of plastic or piece of bone.. I almost chipped my tooth.. Pretty freaking disturbing:: never eating here ever again 
1053 4 Great chicken, great service, good mac and cheese. There will be a line out the door so if you don't want to wait, call in your order and find a shady tree to enjoy your chicken. It's got the perfect "kick" in it's spice. 
1054 4 Great doctor that really cares about his patients. Takes time and doesn't rush you through. Actually tries to find cures instead of treat symptoms. If you have epilepsy, go see him. He will help you more than any other neurologist. 
1055 4 Great gym with amazing classes and extremely friendly staff. They will have you sweating like crazy! Would highly recommend for anyone looking to get/stay in shape. 
1056 4 Had dinner last night and it was great. So happy to find a good local German restaurant. 
1057 1 For a few years, I had seen this place with a packed house and assumed they must have great good. Let's just say it was a waste of my $15. They put absolutely NO seasoning (ie. Salt) or oil on my food. 
1058 4 Buffallo Exchange is a great little place to find cheap name brand cloths. Truth be told, the good stuff usually goes fast, but if you are patient, and get bored a few times a week, you can find some great catchs if you just drop in. 
1059 0 No, just no. The management change left this place unlivable. I left here o terrible terms and I will never look back. 
1060 4 Elissa was our hostess and she was fabulous! She went above and beyond to make sure we were having a good time!! Great service and great food!! 
1061 4 Simply amazing, you have to try the grilled octopus. The Waygu burger and the fries were insane, for me the burger is defined by the bun and theirs is one of the best. 
1062 4 Really cool spot. Had their delicious smoky chicken dinner accompanied by a delicious glass of weissebeir. Will definitely come back to try some of the other dishes and beers when I'm in the area again. I might even bring the wife! Plus, the food came out real quick. 
1063 3 Really cool vibe and interesting decor. Drinks and food were both very good and the prices were not outrageous. I would recommend this place for small groups as you can chat and catch up. 
1064 3 Sausage buffet... not much else to say. Best thing and best price at this place. Great atmosphere and service every time I've visited. Always a wide selection every visit. 
1065 4 PABU! Come for the Karaage stay for the Japanese-inspired bar! Great place located in scenic downtown Boston with large view windows, open concept floor plan, good music, and a large drink selection. Check it out! 
1066 4 Prawns, clam strips, mussels, bacon brownie sundae and drinks were all fantastic. Highlights were clam chowder and strawberry shortcake, for sure. Recommendations from waiters and service as a whole we're spot on and very welcoming! So lucky to stumble upon this place! 
1067 0 I tried brew 76 and it stinks like cat piss smells. Tastes like dirt. Won't ever try another Sam Adams again. Sneaky selling beer that tasts like this crap. 
1068 4 The staff treat you like family and will frequently check on you to make sure you are comfortable. If you're lucky you get free Greek beignets. The patio is awesome and they have a great and affordable menu. They served warm seasoned feta that changed my life. 
1069 0 Pharmacy never picks up the phone!! And when you tell them, they get angry and put you on hold. 
1070 4 Seriously the best sandwich that's ever entered my mouth! I had the Morrison chicken sandwich & my husband had the Tillikum & the Portland sliders. Ridiculously delish! Can't wait to come back! Since Spring is around the corner, next time I'll try it with lettuce wrap vs. the bread. 
1071 2 The food is good, I love their Naked Lobster roll. The Barking Crab ale is fantastic if you like wheat beers. It is a bit overpriced though since it's touristy. My lobster roll is 29 bucks and gets served with fries. 
1072 2 Typical noisy, hustle and bustle North End restaurant. Great location (Salem St), terrific service, and the food was good. I'd say this restaurant is at the upper end of the middle of the road. I'm still hunting for that authentic, grandma-made pasta meal. 
1073 0 omg!!! this place recently received 20 kitchen violations~!!!! yuck~!!~ 
1074 3 I've only been here once but we were very happy with everything! The service was fast & friendly, the food was super tasty and had enough leftovers for dinner the next day. Also, the decor inside is really nice, almost feels like Cactus Club. We'll definitely be back. 
1075 2 this place is good but not the best in Portland. worth having once but not the best option for vegan sushi 
1076 4 This place is fantastic. The staff is some of the friendliest out there and their service is great. Its the perfect quick stop and they can make a lot of different options of drinks and food! 
1077 4 A great small coffee house! One of the best cappuccinos I've had in a long time. Worth stopping in. 
1078 0 had a cup of "SMALL" coffe and apple tart bill came to over $8.00. Called back the next day, not for money, but just curious. The man on the phone said tha apple tart was $5.75 OMG, I know real estate & baking is expensive but that is just insulting. 
1079 3 Delicious macaron. Great dessert and you get to take a walk if you had dinner inside the market. 
1080 4 Went while visiting Portland and had the most amazing meal. I had the pork chop and my husband had the burger. We will be back. 
1081 3 Great, friendly service by wonderful Japanese staff. Quiet, comfortable atmosphere with free wifi. Breakfast at a great price. Waffles are very tasty!!! Eggs are always cooked properly, coffee is tasty. My new favourite breakfast place for sure! 
1082 4 I have been here twice and both times have been delicious. We always get sushi and I am always impressed on how good it is! 
1083 4 Believe the 5 star rating! Greg is one of the pros in packing and shipping. His service was some of the best I have ever had! Highest recommendation. 
1084 3 The supreme Stromboli was one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of eating. I read this restaurant four stars only because I have yet to try the pizza. The service was fast fun and friendly. I recommend everyone try this place at least once, to see for yourself 
1085 3 For German food and great beer, you can't beat Columbus original Schmidt's. The only reason I don't rate it a full 5 stars is due to always being bloated after eating there. For an all you can eat buffet, or great traditional German dinners, it just doesn't get any better! 
1086 4 I love the Yi Soon Bakery! It is a really authentic Asian bakery. It is like something you would find in Chinatown. All of the sweets are really tasty and the ladies who work here are so friendly. 
1087 4 Another great meal for the family! Can't go wrong with the steak or carnitas tacos! Great place for kids as well. And today we tried the buffet. It was well worth it! Plenty of great options to chose from. We will definitely be back again for lunch. 
1088 3 I would recommend. I thoroughly enjoy the bourbon and dark chocolate gelato shake. It comes in this cute glass "mason" jar. I've had it now about 4-5 times since PCM opened and it's always been a sweet delight. 
1089 4 Todd has been doin' my hair for years! Gotta love me some Todd! Wish I could fix my hair the way he does it- I get so many compliments & peeps wanting their hair to look like mine. Viva la Todd! Once you go Todd you never go back! LOL! 
1090 4 We love NYPD pizza. Our favorite is their $5 personal pizza. Their salads are great too! Whether it's getting delivery, picking up or eating in this conveniently located spot, you're sure to have a great experience! 
1091 0 Disappointing stay at this hotel. The rooms are quite dated and smell old. The bathroom was moldy. Is it that hard to keep a bathroom from becoming moldy? The only explanation is that their cleaning staff are incompetent and the manager in charge of checking their work, just as bad. 
1092 4 Amazing, great quality sushi with super quick delivery times. Always the same level of quality and very satisfying. Clean, home-cooked feel. 
1093 4 I have yet to meet Felix but when I need plumbing work done I am calling him!! I have heard about him from several sources, so he can't be influencing unfairly. Hope it's okay to pass this on to others looking for a good plumber! 
1094 1 Disappointment! Disappointment! Disappointment! Too few varieties of dish. Only pipeapple and orange no other fruits 
1095 4 Best Italian in Columbus, friendly family run business. Everything we ate was freshly prepared and high quality. 
1096 3 I've been to this place a handful of time great view of the water. Delicious seafood I particularly enjoy the salmon. 
1097 2 The steak was great quality and expertly cooked. The waiter had been initially rude then was cordial. The desserts were awful. It was clear the lava cake was store bought and microwaved. Overall, the meal was good. Come for the steak, go somewhere else for drinks and dessert. 
1098 0 Too bad service at this place, and preparing the food very badly presented. 2010 to now buy like 5 times and all the same 
1099 3 If I could give 4.5 I would.. Really really well priced. Nachos great. Tacos we tried (4) all tasty. Only one we didn't love was the catfish. Bit too much mayo based sauce on that one but all in all excellent and will be heading back to try more. 
1100 4 My childhood pizzeria followed me to Orlando. Use to eat at his original location in Brooklyn Ny. Taste the same. 
1101 3 Honey chicken is really good. Definitely recommend! 
1102 4 Purchased some hookah tobacco that tasted great! five stars for wide selection of flavors! 
1103 4 Wonderful nail salon with the nicest people !! Angel always does a wonderful job on my acrylic fills and listens to what I want. I like my nails really short and she is happy to oblige !!! Very clean and relaxing salon. 
1104 4 Very friendly and welcoming staff. Beautiful decor. Unbeatable happy hour menu. $5 special rolls! The sushi...fantastic. Very fresh and the fish is delicious. My favorite spot in Orlando. Tried the Hawaiian, Cajun, Fireball & Dynamite, all were wonderful. 
1105 4 What a gorgeous restaurant ! Three very different rooms to dine from three different parts of the world Wow I am impressed, the food was amazing Animal kingdom is just getting better and better by adding this gem. Avatar (pandora ) is set to open in May, can't wait! 
1106 4 Surprisingly excellent Mexican food in Salem! The meat was super tender and how can you beat $2 and $3 tacos for taco Tuesday? I had one of their specialty margaritas. It was delicious, and believe me, one was enough! A go to if you are visiting Salem. 
1107 4 The service we received was absolutely fantastic. Extremely friendly and helpful for my 11yo daughter who is very picky. 
1108 3 This car wash was horrible. Wash Service and customer service have majorly improved with the change of management! Mark (the new manager) is super! 
1109 3 They were good. A little slow but that was my only complaint. I liked that you could kind of custom order a breakfast. Well worth going and the patio is nice. 
1110 4 Great, friendly, and reasonably priced florist in Medford that actually delivers lollipops with their flowers. I have used them twice thus far and they have exceeded my expectations. 
1111 4 Had the food bar and the meat buffet. The salads were good as well as the hot food. The meats were out of this world good. I had to limit myself to be able to sample everything. The only thing that I didn't have was the chicken sausage. 
1112 4 Best Gym in Orlando hands down, clean, fully stocked with the best equipment money can buy, great helpful staff, encouraging friendly members, I love it here 
1113 0 If this place could receive zero stars, I would take the one above this review away. 
1114 3 Oh, and went back for a Panini. V. Good. The ingredients were very fresh and the finished product was not a smushed greasy mess like most Paninis. Try the turkey and sundried tomato. 
1115 3 My second visit to Gene's, and can't wait until My next Boston trip so I can visit again. The lamb cumin noodles are exquisite. Worth the trip -- from NY! 
1116 0 We ordered after seeing it on grub hub and the food was very disappointing and made with low quality meats similar to low grade pre packaged deli style. They got here quickly though, so that's one good thing. 
1117 1 Not super clean. Meals use to be a value. Stopped by for lunch... Meal didn't include plantains like in the past. M $ 28 for lunch?:( 
1118 4 Just come, don't ask questions. You won't be disappointed in the quality of the food. Flavor is soooooooo on point!!! 
1119 2 Pies, eh Ok. Would i come again for it, no. My pie crust is better this one was just too flakey my fork couldn't cut through it. No Bueno. Banana cream pie.. Not enough flavor of banana Like I said sharis is better still looking for good pie. 
1120 4 WOW! Awesome food. Awesome beer. Awesome view. Awesome vibes. I'm the pickiest friend in all my friends group but i will definitely be back here! 
1121 2 This place is great when you want to grab a quick bite: convenient and available parking, never too busy, and quick service. The sushi is cheap, and it's tasty, though not the best. We'd come here again when we wanted a quick, no frills sushi experience. 
1122 4 I really liked this place! Both the food and the service were good! I ordered the fish and grits... the fish was PERFECTLY fried and PERFECTLY seasoned. Phenomenal. I would definitely brunch here again. 
1123 4 Oblation is exactly what a paper store should be. Their attention to detail with all their goodies keeps me coming back for more. A must for any gift that needs that special touch. 
1124 4 I ordered thru #ubereats and I got the 10pc wings and it was good, will order again. The wings were cooked perfect no complaints. I have ordered before with good food the other times. 
1125 2 I've been here a few times and find it enjoyable. The atmosphere is nice but its a bit overpriced. Service is always good enough, food doesn't always come out the same though 
1126 3 Excellent quality and freshly baked. A little pricey though. Brioche bread to die for. 
1127 4 For all the hype, I expected a little more substantial patty on my burger, however, it was top notch as the reviews showed. Great value, very good speed, and the diner atmosphere was a nice throw back. Smells of toasting bread & grill set it off. I will be back! 
1128 2 Great location, very convenient to buy underwear, socks, gloves and basics. They need to update it to stock more fashionable items - and the layout is awful. If you can be bothered to look through all the lousy stuff, there are some terrific deals to be had. 
1129 4 A very very pleasant surprise in Orlando! This place is quite amazing. Authentic regional Mexican dishes (outstanding steak and fish dishes) at reasonable (check that - cheap!) prices being served near tourist traps in Orlando - indeed a surprise! Frescas are also amazing. 
1130 4 Spencer my tour guide was an amazing person, very informative & funny. The tour was very informative and exciting. Thank You Spencer!! 
1131 3 Good service and good food. The pretzel bites were wonderful as was the smoked pork. Definitely, stop in and enjoy a good meal and a drink! 
1132 4 I love this place.. The food it awesome and the service is fantastic.. I never like coleslaw before but when I try it with a pastrami sandwich, I fell in Love.. You should try this place you won't regret it!! 
1133 4 The lamb noodle bowl was a TRANSFORMATIVE experience! Atmosphere is simple, but clean. Very large portions. I ate the whole thing (and it was big!) Prices are fair. 
1134 3 Best club in Atlanta for EDM on Friday and Saturday nights. They have great lasers and steam machines. They attract really awesome acts like Paul Van Dyke, tiesto, above and beyond and tritonal. Great food truck outside after dancing 
1135 0 I rushed herefrom downtown to get here at 10;30 pm. It turns out they stop serving food at 10 pm :( FAIL! 
1136 3 Solid place for solid food! The Staff is attentive & friendly. The place always seems busy and it shoukd be as the food is really good. 
1137 4 I love going here!!! Last night Woodlands had the best wine ever via Camelotwines!! The Barolo was amazing! I had the best time ever. Great bartenders. + Great atmosphere. + Great Prices. + All with Great people = Lots of fun, I can't wait to return 
1138 2 Often really busy, and the haircuts range from spot on to kinda rushed, but the vibe is really solid. 
1139 4 One of Vancouver's very few (sadly) independent boutiques for women's lingerie. I love their Betsy Johnson & La Perla selection. Staff are greatly helpful and knowledgable. A tasteful, classy place to shop with girlfriends. 
1140 4 Delicious lattes, their roasted beans taste so good added flavor is unnecessary. Very reasonable prices for a coffee as well. 
1141 4 Just had lunch there. Grape leaves were the best we had!!! They were stuffed with beef as well and added amazing flavor. The lamb gyro was made with real leg of lamb and delicious! Try it!!! 
1142 4 Awesome atmosphere at River Pig with great drinks and foods. Aces over Eight and the burger are amazing. 
1143 1 Had lunch in Saturday. Sat at the bar. Food is ok but service was very, very slow. Slow to get a beer, slow to get my food. Make plenty of time if you decide to go here. 
1144 4 Beautiful hotel, a lot of amenities, great pool/spa area, great restaurants/bars on property, mostly pleasant staff, expansive property in a great location. 
1145 3 Delicious, healthy food... Reasonable prices. Killer home-made fries and barbecue. Nice micro brew list. Only negative: no AC. 
1146 4 Cheap, plentiful, and REALLY tasty! The oxtail is killer!! 
1147 3 Great little brewery- had nice IPA and lagers. 3rd floor desk is awesome with fantastic view of lake and a firepit. Did not try limited food menu but it looked good. 
1148 3 Cool place. The tea we had was a little odd and way too strong, but that makes me believe we have the chance of getting an espresso of some quality on our next visit. We shall see! 
1149 2 You don't go here for quality food, let's face it. You go here because it's cheap, there are lots of peeps here, and it's centrally located for everyone to get started on a night out. Bartending? Hrm. Had to teach bartender how to do a raging bull. Ghetto. 
1150 3 For coffee, wifi, good atmosphere, and cozy couches, there's no better spot closer to UT. It can get a bit crowded at times, but it's well worth it. They have seating both upstairs and downstairs, and the view out the front windows is nice. 
1151 4 Totally awesome salmon. Very good beer and cozy waitresses. :) 
1152 4 The Voodoo, Wipeout and Kingston tacos were all freaking amazing! Great job, the cooks are consistently great. The atmosphere is laid back also. 
1153 3 The lamb noodle soup was good, very flavorful broth and the lamb is delicious. Iv never had these kind of noodles before and they weren't really what I was expecting, but they were good. 
1154 3 We was looking for a burger spot close to our hotel. They had very good burgers but I love their shakes. 
1155 3 I have had Gus's Chicken at 4 locations including the original and the Austin location is on par. Nice relaxed non rushed location. Frequent stop when in Austin. 
1156 4 Amazing amazing amazing. I've been here for brunch a few times and never been disappointed. This place is worth the wait. 
1157 4 Highly recommend Mila for your brazilian wax. Very painless and quick. She also gave me a loyalty card that locks in the price for future waxes at $25. Best price I've seen in the downtown area! 
1158 3 It has very nice atmosphere, kind of dark and the wall was lined with wine bottles. There were plenty of seats with a few tables available outside. The service was good and the menu has a nice variety of food. All in all, it was a nice experience! 
1159 2 This Location is CLOSED! We closed on 2/27/15. The bee cave location at the hill country galleria is the closet nearby. 
1160 4 Great local bar! Food is great! Service is always friendly and Amber Davis is a standout! I would recommend checking this place out! 
1161 4 Came from Seattle, great service and the peach watermelon mint is on point. Good prices too. Definitely recommend it 
1162 3 Good food, decent prices. Definately not gourmet, but a good family style neighborhood takeout pizza and sub shop. The employees are friendly, they have a pretty good selection, and they deliver. 
1163 4 Great cold brew iced coffee and tasty donuts. The staff is very friendly and the expanded location is excellent for a quick bite or even a decent sit 
1164 3 The beef lo mein and egg rolls were to die for. Feed family of 6 for under $35 and this great for Disney World standards. 
1165 4 Ken does an amazing job!!! He is very fast, professional, and makes you feel very comfortable. I took in a picture that my girlfriend wanted my hair to look like and he nailed it spot on!! 
1166 4 Maid for Portland does a stellar job! They are very flexible with hours and setting up an appointment is a breeze. They clean everything thoroughly. Their rates are very reasonable. Highly recommend! 
1167 3 One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city. I love the buffet option and the Wonton soup. It's my favorite in Orlando!! 
1168 2 Glad I had a coupon... Was not bad- but not great. Had delivery, they were quick and courteous. 
1169 4 The best Indian food I've ever had. Period. Going here was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time. I've never written a review but this was so good it deserved the good publicity. Dinner for two was a ton of food, be prepared. 
1170 0 Mediocre food. My lamb was overcooked and the rice was dry. 
1171 3 Best thai food in the vicinity of Porter Square. 
1172 3 I think I would order this again. However, the beef shwarma that we got was pretty dry and hard to chew. A little disappointing, but they give you a lot of food for your buck. 
1173 2 Not a ton to see here and the staff didn't seem to have much patience with our group. Maybe it was a off day but that was the general vibe. The exhibits they do have have good information. If the staff was friendlier it would have been 4 stars. 
1174 3 We were very satisfied with the service and the Food, I think if they expanded the place it might loose something, I had the ribs with sides, potato salad, candied yams, Mac n cheese, string beans and cornbread. Dessert ( Butter Pound Cake ). And Peach Cobbler ( Wonderful ). 
1175 3 Not for the faint of stomach, Republic Cafe dishes the greasy, crunchy slathered-in-that-weird-red-sauce American Chinese food that's gonna land like a ton of calories in your gut. And I don't recall any signs about no MSG. I love it. The service is pretty good, too. 
1176 4 Great indoor and outdoor atmosphere. Nice staff, good food, alcohol selection, lots of tastey ciders, coffee and smoothies. Outside, there's a stage for live music and you can have dogs out there, they even have water bowls out for them. 
1177 2 I'm glad this venue exists, but it's awful small and ALWAYS seems to be overpacked. Having to wait 30 minutes to get upstairs where the DJ is playing is pretty ridiculous. Overall a cool place though. We need better venues in Portland! 
1178 1 Unfriendly service, didn't take American express. The bread was stale like it was made 2 days ago. Not a good place to study the music was so loud. 
1179 4 I love that one of our best sushi restaurants is in the airport. However, they also have really great pork belly. If you have an hour to spare in the Atlanta airport, definitely check them out! Concourse E. 
1180 0 Big crowd, overprice, rude staff.. even the flee market has more to offer than this place. 
1181 0 Terrible. What's the use of their comfy beds if all you hear is traffic noise. We got stuck in a room facing the river and it sounds like we're sitting by the side of a freeway. Never again. 
1182 3 very delicious. the spicy okra entree is the best--not gooey. a la carte dinner menu is better than buffet lunch. 
1183 0 Very unhappy with the experience. Would not recommend. I felt deceived and cheated. Stylist fresh out of school, unqualified. For a $40 haircut, I expect competence, and on this day I didn't get it. 
1184 1 They sell similar sounding drinks as other coffee shops but they don't taste as good! Iced Mocha tasted like brown colored milk without the flavor or sweetness of mocha! On the positive side, the staff was very courteous and friendly! 
1185 4 Drinks and food are amazing! The bartenders are fantastic and the manager is extremely accommodating. Even turned on the SEC championship over the loud speaker for a bunch of Georgia girls. Great bar!! 
1186 0 The guy in the truck didn't even seem interested to acknowledge me. So I went to the food truck next to him 
1187 4 I absolutely love this place. The environment is great! Their Blanche pizza is so tasty and cooked to perfection! Handmade ice cream, fresh brewed coffee, and so much more. Staff is super friendly; I don't think I have ever seen them without a smile on their faces. 
1188 4 Liliya was great! She arrived right on time and did a very thorough job. I highly recommend her. I also really like the Handy app. It's really easy to use and will definitely utilize it again. 
1189 3 Good place for cofee any time of the day 
1190 4 The kubideh is delicious. What really impressed me though was the high quality of everything else that wasn't the meat. Good rice, good salad, good yogurt sauce. Will be returning for sure. 
1191 4 Great food & service Chassidy!! 1st time in Hot great suggestions & love the coffee. Gotta try the blueberry French toast like having dessert in the morning. 
1192 1 Been here twice. Food is mediocre at best. Service was poor both times too. Definitely won't be back 
1193 4 Excellent service and amazing food. Make sure to get the shrimp and grits. AMAZING!!! Also all of their appetizers were outstanding. 
1194 3 This is a very good option in the neighborhood. The miso soup is excellent. The shrimp shumai is "good" but not great. The sushi is generally good although the pieces of fish are quite small. The donburi bowl is very good. 
1195 3 This place is awesome. It is one of the best breakfast places that I've been to. I always try to come here when I am in the area...and the line can be LONG but it is well worth it! George is an awesome guy and everyone loves him! 
1196 3 Great food, great service, hidden gem! We've eaten here twice and plan to return. Authentic Italian dishes at a fair price! We've ordered pizza, pasta, clamari (fried and grilled..get the fried) and have tried two of the house red wines. Delish! 
1197 0 This location has really gone downhill, the french onion soup was tasteless with a scab of cheese thrown on top. The boneless buffalo wings arrived cold and the nachos were burnt. 
1198 4 I love Sugar Me! The sugar is natural and much better tolerated than waxing (at least for me). All of the Sugaristas I've seen are fantastic (shout out to Robin and Jenna!). Great pricing and a awesome experience every time. Plus 1 free sugar after 5 appointments! 
1199 4 Dave is super friendly and kind showing me how to fix a broken part, definitely will do business with them next time. 
1200 3 Loved the food, glad to see that it's prepared after ordering and not just sitting in the kitchen waiting to be served! Got the lamb plate, and really decorative Turkish coffee.. Very satisfied. No better way to kill time than in a well kept family run restaurant! 
1201 4 The YMCA in Southwest had an amazing preschool program and is now offering Mother's Day Out. The teachers are extremely caring and well qualified to prepare your child for kindergarten. I highly recommend this program. 
1202 0 Purchased a cake and it had a metal or freezer burn taste. Total bummer and waste of 30.00. Go elsewhere this place has slowly done down hill and is over priced. 
1203 4 This place is the closest you will get to Italy in Lakeway. Absolutely love it. Espresso is the real deal. Tiramisu is fantastic. Try the chicken piccata. Best dish they have. Everything is made from scratch and truly authentic. A MUST TRY! 
1204 1 This place used to be good, my friends and I ordered from there regularly. This hasn't been the case for over a year now. I ate there last week, my opinion remains the same. 
1205 1 Two times in a row the driver could not find me. On phone with them telling them exactly where I was. These were major landmarks. Cost me an hour and 36 to cancel and get a new driver. Very soured on uber. 
1206 3 I've used Peace Frog twice and have been very happy with their service. My carpets always come out looking great even though I have two dogs. The technician was on time and finished promptly. 
1207 4 A girl just needs some arroz con gandules sometimes and El Oriental De Cuba always delivers. Oh and that paella amarilla! So good! Love the batidos too, although I never finish them because I'd rather indulge in my food. 
1208 4 Got the lobster mac and cheese and it was amazing!i sat at the bar and got the tapas size which was plenty. I will definitely return! 
1209 0 Wow so disgusting in my tummy, we are here last night and the people couldn't have been less into it. They were all so sad and slow. PF Changs more like PF Bad. 
1210 3 Great huge place to bowl and play billiard with large groups of friends. The atmosphere is awesome and it's a very clean and decorative place. Awesome place to hangout in Boston !!!! 
1211 3 Stopped in for a late dinner. Food was great and a very impressive selection of craft beer available. Many on tap and mostly local. Definitely check this place out! 
1212 2 Out of the same owner of Fugakyu. Somewhat healthy food - good service and fun to bring guest from out of town. Dinner is more expensive than lunch for the same amount of food and all. hot pot - not good for kids under 10. 
1213 4 The food is quite good, I finally had the sweet lotus, I wish the cut can be thicker, like the ones I had in Shanghai. Enjoyed the space, and the person 
1214 0 Fake Chinese food...worst Chinese food experience ever!!! 
1215 4 Have been there twice and both times had a fantastic burger. The first time I had the Tuna burger which was excellent. Have told my friends about it. 
1216 4 School bus food truck with picnic tables and very fresh, delicious, food! Had the Migas tacos which rate in with the best of Austin tacos. 
1217 4 Don't miss the lava bread. It goes really well with the cucumber dip. Everything here is fresh and homemade. We got the mixed grill. It was wonderful 
1218 3 Great date night location but also looks good for groups and families. Very good flavor to all of the food. Cheesecake definitely a must to get. 
1219 3 My wife and I tried 3 seafood and 3 vegetable dishes. Every one was delicious and different. The service was excellent. On a crowded Saturday night, however, the restaurant was very noisy, the only reason for giving only 4 stars. 
1220 2 Thank you for your response, I will try again, all the other reviews were encouraging. Presentation is everything, I completely understand your point 
1221 4 This review is for the truck off Manchaca in the Radio coffee beer parking lot. Amazing! I strongly recommend the fish tacos, migas, and/or vegetarian tacos. These are the best tacos I've had in Austin! Yummy!!!!! I will have dreams about these tacos, no doubt. 
1222 4 Best pho in Portland. The broth has great flavor. The quality of the food is consistently good. There is lots of seating and the service is really good. 
1223 4 i've never eaten in the restaurant but i always order fresh seafood days in advance. the manager gives you good deals and the quality is superb. 
1224 4 I love Found Underground!!!! I have found so many wonderful items! Always have a great selection of seasonal items! Nancy and her team are the best! 
1225 4 Excellent and authentic comfort food. After years living in the Middle East, I come here when I get homesick and need proper hummus or mujadara. 
1226 2 Food wasn't bad. Wings had lots of flavor. Service could be a little better, but our server was willing to fix any complications we had. 
1227 3 I have been supporting them and their competitor across Killingsworth now for several years and I still can't pick a favorite! The chille relleno burrito is my top fav and if you want to get cray order it with all the extras and smothered! 
1228 3 Frozen ice at it's best. Great flavoring goes through to all the ice. My pick is the Black Cherry. Or the Dreamsicle with cream! 
1229 3 My husband and I had our date night at Pelon's for the first time. Margaritas were great, beer selection is small. We had the queso, guacamole, shrimp tacos, and the mini tacos (pork, chicken, beef) everything was good. I'm glad we tried it! 
1230 4 Really loved this place. Not too overpriced and great frapps. They have an awesome granola mix too. Friendly people, plenty of plugs for electronics, comfy seating and a great patio! 
1231 4 Had a great time at the bars, food was great and overall great service. Give the skillful bartender in the beard a raise! Ask him about his cool bar tricks; he has a ton to show. 
1232 0 I love the clothes, but the customer service here is absolutely horrendous. Like one reviewer said below, the staff made me feel like Julia in Pretty Woman -- for no reason at all. Never going to this BCBG again. 
1233 3 The specialty tacos are great! But, if you want an every day breakfast taco your better served to go elsewhere.PRICEY other wise! 
1234 3 The ice cream here is undoubtedly good, but for me it's missing that wow factor that they've got at Rain or Shine. So if you're deciding between the two, I'd go to Rain or Shine instead. The reusable glass jar thing is pretty cool though. Yay environment! 
1235 4 As a life long lover of the Mediterranean cuisine, and self-appointed tzaziki connoisseur.. I can't give them any less than 5 stars. Been going here for years..and never disappointed. Great for dine in or take out. Owners are always on site, and very involved in their business. Support these guys! 
1236 4 The pork belly tacos really shined here but everything was delicious, if you do go I highly recommend trying the churros with the chocolate sauce those alone are worth coming here for, it's also very reasonably priced, will definitely try to make it out here again at some point. 
1237 1 Place was not clean Chicken Shawarma was good. Their tamarind juice was horrible. I wanted to try this place because I had a coupon. However, they didnt accept the coupons It should not have been featured on the site if they dont use it. They didnt apologize either. 
1238 3 Ton of food for a good price. Used the scoutmob deal and got an even better price. We split the jerk chicken and chicken curry plates. Both were great. Comes with rice and beans and cabbage. 
1239 4 Loved it! Ice cream was delicious.. my kids enjoyed the ice cream soda floats and super cute layout and rustic look! 
1240 4 AMAZING!!! Atmosphere, Food , staff are exceptional. You can't pick the wrong thing when coming here! I'd come back from Huston just to come back!! 
1241 4 Perfect stay for any special occasion. The food, guests service, atmosphere is excellent. I suggest to plan a budget prior to booking your stay because things rack high very fast. I cannot stop thinking enough how awesome it was. Go there now! 
1242 2 It's wasn't the best. Visiting from NY. Had a few other BBQ joints in Austin that were way better for half the price. The sides were amazing but they put way too much seasoning on the ribs that it was even enjoyable. 
1243 3 Not as crowded as the AMC at Disney but just as expensive, nice theaters. 
1244 4 That was some damn fine clam chowder. I'd even eat it on a hot day. 
1245 4 Love Mindy!! My daughter and I have been going to her for years! Very professional!! ALWAYS happy with my hair. 
1246 2 Some dishes are pretty good. I love the ambience inside more than the food. The pricing is not too expensive. They do take time to serve food. If you have some time and want to spend time with your loved once, I would recommend the place. 
1247 3 Kick ass fish tacos. Good drinks. Water! This place is great, the view is great. Good prices. And water! 
1248 4 One of the best 3D shows at Disney World. Without revealing anything - it showcases the best childhood Disney films and is in a great location to kill some time between It's a Small World and Peter Pan's Flight. 
1249 4 Went for our anniversary a few months ago without knowing anything about it. Loved the meal. We had a little wait but it's a small place and the wait was worth it. Everything was fantastic. Can't wait to go again. 
1250 4 Awesome experience with my gel manicure & pedicure. Everyone was friendly but professional. I couldn't be happier. I live in Winter Park and will be making the drive here from now on. 
1251 4 Amazing food. Possibly the best restaurant in all of Columbus. Great atmosphere and truly amazing food. The duck is by far the best I have ever had, and the pate is to die for!!! 
1252 3 What a fun place. Brilliant location. Directly on the water. Great views of the city. The food is delicious. Fresh, tasty seafood. The atmosphere is light hearted & fun. 
1253 2 3 stars for the service. The 2 waiters we had. weren't friendly and wasn't very approachable. Both definitely had RBF faces. The dim sum was also ok.. I wasn't blown away by the hype. We have better dim sum here in San Jose. 
1254 4 Best quick grab and nom place. Awesome gyros. These guys Crush it! Would recommend to friends and family 10 out of 10 times. Blaze and graze baby. 
1255 3 Good place for chiropractic adjustments if you don't carry insurance. Call and ask how much per visit; I think it's pretty affordable. After about 4 visits I started to feel better. 
1256 2 I sat outside and I ordered steak and sushi. There was nothing spectacular about this place or menu and I was disappointed after reading the reviews. The service wasn't anything to write home about either. 
1257 3 My new favorite nail salon.. reasonable prices and friendly staff. Everything is very clean and sanitary. 
1258 1 Underwhelming pastry. We were late in the day but frankly the 6 options we took home were for the most part so so. My friend used the team?"mass produced" and I have to agree. 
1259 2 Oh Sidebar. Your cheap wings and your nasty beer smell draw me in, while your occasional $2 beer specials make me stay. Honestly, the only reason to come here is to drink. Don't come for the wings, do NOT come for the crowd. Come for the pitchers. 
1260 4 My boyfriend finally convinced me to stop being superficial and try this place out; I can't thank him enough. I recommend this place to everyone and have throughly enjoyed myself every, single, time. 
1261 4 Long wait is a charm here...water, cowbell and free fries passing through the line always makes it worth it. Although I always get the black bean burger in the Diablo, it always delicious! 
1262 4 Great food! Really friendly owner and employees. They care about their customers. Good Turkish tea. Pleasant atmosphere. I do my best to stop here whenever I'm in the area. The food can take a little while but it's worth the wait 
1263 4 My wife went here when I took off work. She loved the job and was surprised at the shop did not smell like chemicals like a lot of nail parlos do. five stars 
1264 3 Food is awesome. Delivery is slower than slow though. Took over an hour. And when ordering in restaurant usually takes up to 45 minutes. Definitely call ahead and pick up. 
1265 2 Such a shame. Hamachi collar has not been the yellowtail fish but some other, deep fried. And the happy hour poke bowl is filled with lower quality time tuna. Not worth it. 
1266 4 Very delicious! On my dads side of the family we are Salvadorian. I grew up eating Salvadorian food; I know authentic Salvadorian pupsas & sea food and THIS IS IT! I'm a Wacoan but I travel to Austin often; I will def visit again! Yum! 
1267 4 Amazing brunch spot! Fresh, delicious food. I will be back next time I am in Portland. 
1268 3 I stumbled upon this place as I was walking to the park to watch the eclipse and I'm glad I decided to eat breakfast there! The service was great - polite and attentive. The food didn't take long at all to serve. 
1269 3 Good for neighborhood meal with the Fam. We ride our bikes. 
1270 4 Hands down best hot wings in Columbus *mic drop* the apps are mediocre but the wings will blow ur mind 
1271 2 Heck yeah I like the cream cheese and siracha dog but they are all good I'm a hot dog fan. The owner is nice and it's worth a visit. 
1272 4 This store is great. They have wonderful sales and the customer service is amazing. 
1273 4 Everything we had was nothing less than incredible! The artichokes, deviled eggs, fried chicken and pork shoulder all A++. Great job, Chef Zach! 
1274 1 Ordered a house special pho. Broth was horribly heavy on MSG and beef was so over cooked that it was hard and chewy. There is much better place nearby so I am not coming back. 
1275 4 Remember get cream puffs here as a kid! As an adult they are still awesome as ever. When in Columbus we always take some back to WV!!! 
1276 4 Awesome time for blueberries and raspberries! Strawberries still available as well. Would recommend a trip out to Krugers! Always a day well spent! 
1277 4 Delicious beers! Such high quality I would put the six seamer up with anything from trillium and treehouse. Definitely a must visit. Also go to Mystic in Chelsea down the road 
1278 4 I would easily give this place a 5. While it would not be recommended for a fancy/date night spot, the food was well prepared. I could tell that it was a local favorite with the crowd and laid back vibe. I would be back :-) 
1279 3 If you have enough time 1.5hrs, GO!!! waiters are super friendly and it doesn't even feel like you are at the airport. 
1280 2 Not impressed. Good enough but should you say that about a place with this name and rep? Lump crab wedge was good. Very fresh. Branzino was bland. As expected plates are small but also sparse. Not a fan 
1281 3 I remember great times there and when knowing what to expect its a great day out with kids or family. Prices are still reasonable and parking is no problem. Go check it out. 
1282 0 Ridiculously priced!! If you want to pay $60-80 per head and willing to go away hungry, this is the restaurant for you. Small plates priced like entrees in a normal restaurant. Don't waste your money. 
1283 3 It looks cool. Normally has long lines, so go during the week. Their season pancakes are a good choice. Better for smaller groups. 
1284 4 Landed here for an impromptu early dinner. Irene was our server & we loved all her recommendations and attention to detail. Will b back soon for sure 
1285 4 I love this place. The meats, cheeses, breads and condiments are stellar. I love the Village Addict. You can not go wrong with this place. The price is right too. 
1286 4 Amazing menu, great prices and really cute! Easy to order no fuss! Modern feel to the restaurant, and everything we tried was DELICIOUS! 
1287 4 Best donuts I've ever had. Blows Voodoo way out of the water. My personal favorite is the Blueberry Bourbon Basil, and that is saying something, as I am normally exclusively into chocolate when it comes to donuts. 
1288 3 In search of the Holy Grail of Cafe's, I stumbled upon @neverlab simple selections and amazing flavors. Definitely one of my new spots to start my morning. Ordered the "Holy Grail and and Gluten Free Banana and Chocolate muffin. Good vibes. 
1289 4 We stopped by because of the sale 40-70% off the entire store. I allowed my son to pick out two shirts that he liked. We were greeted at the door, checked on and promptly check out. It does not always happen but when it does I'm appreciative. 
1290 2 The best thing about the place is Dr. Yan Li...she is a good no-nonsense doctor that knows what she is doing..the worst thing is the other people that work there have not been nearly as professional or courteous as her.. 
1291 3 This is where all the Portlandians go to have their bowl of Pho! Really busy place during lunch!! Good prices and service! Pho Oregon Restaurant is where I go when I'm in the area and craving some yummy Vietnamese Broth! Anytime is a good time for Pho!!!! :D 
1292 3 Food is pretty pricy its kinda small but all in all kids loved it. The lazer place was actually pretty cool it just needs more space where the arcade is at. 
1293 3 Love this place. Great atmosphere. Great lunch specials. Great steaks. Nice big tvs around bar area 
1294 4 Nicest people ever! I just love working with the manager there because he makes sure that everyone does a good job. I've been there twice. Once to find out what another tire place did to my car (which was free). And the second time for an oil change. Thanks NTB! 
1295 4 Personally, I thought the service was good and the food was delicious! Will go again! :) BTW I ordered the cajun fries and a pound of shrimp (hot n hot level) 
1296 0 Awkward experience at the outside bar here. The bartender was fine to us, but was giving most of the other people out around the bar attitude to the point it was uncomfortable. Hopefully just a bad day, but from the look of the other reviews, maybe not so much! 
1297 4 I accidentally ordered the wrong thing and the manager fixed it without charging me and let me keep the sandwich. I am a big fan of customer service and this location knows how to serve customers well! 
1298 3 Great pie. I kept expecting Tony Soprano to walk in. Authentic. Family. Local. 
1299 4 The best burrito I have ever had. You can even add plantains or avocado! Good price of a really good food. Also the large burrito is pretty big and defiantly worth it! 
1300 3 Had a pretty big mishap, however they handled the issue the best way they could and gave me a refund. Their drinks and service are usually really good! 
1301 3 Great pizza, excellent cocktail selections and Frozen Custard. Not crowded and great service. 
1302 4 Great atmosphere and location. Awesome drinks that were different and food was pretty good. The owner was really nice as well he came over to our table and was accommodating to making drinks and suggesting different things. Will be back 
1303 1 The restaurant was filthy even for even those used to going to high turnover places. They advertise the use of Apple Pay but none of the machines work. I've eaten and many fuddrucker's and none where quite like this. 
1304 1 Too many smokers on the porch. Supposed to be 15 feet from restaurant entrance and this is not enforced here :( yuck. 
1305 0 I don't know what happened to this place, but the mochi was very stale when I visited. Also, the staff were really unfriendly, and I'm wondering since it's a cash only business -- is it a front for something illegal? Maybe the BBB should investigate them? 
1306 4 Awesome experience, great place to go with a group of people and talk and chill. Kava has the relaxing effects of alcohol, but does not affect motor skills the same way alcohol does. If you know someone who doesn't drink, you can take them here! 
1307 4 Best place in ATL airport by far. Great sushi and wonderful cocktails! Let the bartenders know what you like and they'll tailor a specific drink to your taste. Atmosphere is fun and comfortable. Highly recommend!! 
1308 3 Good bar food at a good price. The bartenders are great. TVs everywhere. It is a really nice sports bar with a great crowd of sports fans. 
1309 4 I really enjoyed this funky, outdoor place where you can sit, drink, and watch people. Dog friendly (max 3 dogs in the garden). Their beer selection is excellent for everyone including IPA and fruity beer lovers. My favorite was Levity. 
1310 4 Fantastic driver who was prompt and on time!! Very friendly staff who offered a very reasonable rate. I look forward to working with them again!!! 
1311 0 This place has some of the worst fried chicken I've ever had. I don't recommend it at all. There's a reason why there are only seven reviews for this restaurant. 
1312 2 I see that this restaurant has changed a few things, and that is good. They have improved since the last time I was here and it was fairly good 
1313 4 Always delicious! The staff is wonderful and always welcoming! The sushi is very fresh and tastes great! My favorite is "the special crunch" we love to have date nights at Shogun. It's a hidden gem in Conway. Our favorite in the area 
1314 4 Beautiful huge showroom in Hollywood with friendly and informative staff. We really appreciate that they carry furniture made in Oregon. We love our new, locally-made sectional! 
1315 4 Awesome dental cleanings and thorough doc exams. Dr. Levitt is awesome, his associates are great too. Front desk happily answers my questions, super friendly staff! 
1316 2 Beautiful ambiance but unfriendly staff. Appetizers were good but meals were unremarkable and we left hungry. Not worth the price. 
1317 0 I ordered the chicken wrap on a Friday night after a long flight. Service took too long probably due to being understaffed. Chips were stale wrap WAY overpriced, cold, and bland with soagy lettuce. Avoid this place. 
1318 4 Fantastic food every thing is made fresh.my husband and i visit there at least twice a week.when my family comes from South Carolina they want to always go there 
1319 4 They get the order right every time, remember our names, put just the right amount of foam on my latte, and have vegan and while wheat pastries. One of the best Peets in the Metro area. 
1320 3 Wait staff is a bit slow but the food is good and my drinks were a buzz for real lol I was only in town for the day and needed a fun place to day drink for a few hours lol 
1321 4 Divine ambiance. Red walls. Cold ones. Love music. There is no better place in the 'ville. 
1322 3 Veggie dumplings are so good!!! So is the almond milk bubble tea! Delivery was a bit long, so only 4 stars but otherwise great! 
1323 3 The corn beef and hash is excellent. Great bloody Mary as well. Staff is very friendly. More of a hipster kind of vibe. 
1324 3 Stopped in a whim to watch Sunday Football. All the games were on, and they had the volume at the perfect level. The bartenders were super nice and attentive. Great craft beer selection. They also have a nice selection of bourbon. 
1325 3 The best $4 you can spend is on a jr. roast beef at the Alamo in Medford Sq. If you want a snack, then enjoy this treat. It's worth every penny & more. Probably the best "cheap eats" around!! 
1326 4 Store was very busy but set up for good traffic flow. Ice cream ordered and paid for without difficulty. Very minimal wait for item. 
1327 3 Went here one night......appetizer, dinner and dessert. All of it was great and the waiter gave me some club soda when a drop of food dropped on my shirt.....Great service ..wonderful food. I had lemon parm salad, seared tuna and some amazing liquid brownie. 
1328 4 Omg, this is my favorite place to eat ever! Best pizza, bruschetta, and much, much, more. Soooo yummy! Servers could be better, but it's awesome food. Wine is great too! Awesome for a romantic dinner or wow whoever you're taking! 
1329 3 Food is downright amazing!! Great service when u go in or pick up.. Just DON'T bother with delivery .not worth it. I live a block away and it takes them 2 hours each time I've done it. I still eat there, just don't get delivery! 
1330 3 Very good, fresh food. Small Place, family owned, and extremely friendly. Would recommend. 
1331 4 One of my favorite bars to visit while in Boston. Extensive beer collection on tap and a great food menu as well. Many tvs available to watch sporting events and space to get together wothbfri 
1332 4 Looked this place up on yelp before heading to a show later... To adults, two kids... All loved it! One kid and one adult ordered chicken caesar, one kid and one adult got the special cheese ravioli with chicken. Plus desert! Everyone raved! Great spot. 
1333 4 Located where there used to be only nasty fast food takeout, the place is a hidden gem. Fresh sushi, bright flavors and excellent homemade spicy ramen noodles with a killer broth. Not to be missed. 
1334 4 This is a great little find! Yuji makes all of the sushi. The food is fresh and delicious. The Shiro roll is my hands-down favorite. 
1335 2 Car wash was great but the staff is soooooo slow. My 90 year old grandmother could clean windows faster 
1336 2 Environment is cool. Grits and blueberry crunch pancake were good. Veggie omelet and shrimp and grits were ok. Service was good although we had two different waitresses approach us at first. Hostess didn't eat her Wheaties that day and barely greeted us. 
1337 4 After exploring Portland's Mac and cheese options, this place is hands down the best. Well deserved 5-stars. Consistently good food, great service, and easy location. Review previous review for more in-depth review. 
1338 3 Friendly service, a fantastic beer selection, good hearty pub fare and a nice atmosphere. I love that they have an outside patio with a fireplace. It's an easy, go-to place if you're in the mood for all of the above. 
1339 3 It's a little farther than I like to drive but the pho is really tasty. Big bowls of tasty pho mmmmmm pho mmmmm so tasty! 
1340 4 Fast and taste really good ! Coming back for the Meatball sub looks amazingly good ! They have a lot of seating down stairs , outside , and upstairs ! 
1341 3 This place is amazing!!! We went for the buffet and were not disappointed! Very reasonably priced, fresh and authentic. I can't wait to try more of their signature dishes! 
1342 0 Low inventory, cannot obtain any help from staff, did most of my part research from google since staff was unhelpful and inept. You can tell the knowlegdge differences between Home Depot and Lowes. 
1343 4 Great service! I called for a quote and Chris was able to do a service call same day. He was professional and courteous- and I am happy to not have any more wasp nests around my house! Will definitely recommend. Thanks for your help! 
1344 4 Love this place, Coffee is great! Customer Service is outstanding!!! Keep up the terrific work! 
1345 4 I love this place! I ate the best Cruffin ever... filled with coffee custard. It was delicious. I've tried some of the pies too, and they are really good! 
1346 4 Zaza's is always such a treat when we are in town. They have the best Cafe conleche and Quesitas! They sometimes get really busy, so go early! 
1347 4 Awesome location, and a really clean and welcoming interior. Staff is so friendly, and very accommodating of substitutions/food allergies. The food is great, love their sandwiches and they have a great selection of pasta options 
1348 3 My experience was fantastic. Single diner at bar. No wait at prime time in summer. Nice people. Fab bartender Jim. Lasagne perfect and good size. Why complain about silly things? You are at Disney. It's magic. 
1349 4 Our favorite Japanese place. Family owned. The most friendly staff around. The food is top notch. You cannot go wrong here. The sushi is extensive and affordable. 
1350 4 Food is delicious, nice atmosphere and good service. Been there twice now and will definitely be back! 
1351 0 I absolutely hated this restaurant. Went there for lunch ordered the blt which is very hard to screw up but they managed to the tomatoes were rotten the bacon was raw. Also service was very poor. 
1352 0 Hey. This big hotel told me there's no two beds available and gave me a queen size bed. And we have two 6-feet men. My reservation is request for two beds... Terrible hotel and service. I won't go there any more. 
1353 3 Really do like this library. The people who work there are very helpful and knowledgeable. Different selections of books for all age groups. Also, great place to go if you need a computer to use. Have not been to an Austin library that I did not like. 
1354 0 Worst "Greek Food" Ive ever had. Mostly pre-packaged, cold and dried out. They actually reheated the meat on a grill rather than shave it to order. Nothing fresh here at all and over priced. Horrible-Horrible-Horrible. Completely ruined my food experience in Boston for the day. 
1355 4 In the past 2 weeks we have eaten here about 7 times!! Tom Yum Miso soup to die for, some of the best tempura & fabulous, tasty sushi & sashimi. This place is a must try, worth traveling to. 
1356 2 Super fun place to be, especially in the lounge. Has the usual happy hour stuff but all their food could use price adjustments as it doesn't really reflect the good but not great food. Go for: a fun atmosphere with great staff Don't go for: great food 
1357 4 Very impressed...food is made from scratch onsite. Great staff...great atmosphere...great food. 
1358 2 Would be five stars if the employees were the least bit hospitable. Seriously, too easy of a job to be rude for all the girls working there. Based on the reviews, seems like most people had the same experience. 
1359 1 Don't bother with this place if you're a vegetarian. The only vegetarian thing they have that could be an entree is spaghetti in tomato sauce. And forget about being able to share appetizers, those are also overwhelmingly vegetarian unfriendly. 
1360 4 Best place for german food I found since I moved to the united states. :-) Unfortunately I don't have a car, otherwise I would visit more often. 
1361 4 Hands down a little hidden gem in Boulder. A great go-to for tourists or locals alike. Service is friendly & fun + easy to grab a quick pint after work or worth the wait if you want a taste of something special. 
1362 1 Really Disappointed by the food. Felt like these ppl didn't care about the food they're serving. Food was tasteless. 
1363 3 Nothing like Kelly's to cure a hungover ! My go to is grilled cheese with tomato, one of the best grilled cheeses I've ever had. Also the burgers are great too! Nothing like good solid comfort food especially when you can drive through - doesn't get much better. 
1364 0 I went there for lunch. I got food poisoning from their food. I don't know whether it was from the sushi or Chicken. Will never go there again!! 
1365 0 I have been on hold with Mears customer service for over 25 minutes at this point. Will my call be answered by the time I finish writing this review... Looks like that's a no. I'll probably be calling a different shuttle service. 
1366 4 What a relief to have a great meal in an airport. The Salmon hot pot was excellent. Can't wait to return! 
1367 4 What a great place to eat terrific food awesome atmosphere I highly recommend enjoy and get the bread wow with the olive oil dip perfectly mixed 
1368 3 Large menu with large variety. Good for a neighborhood Chinese restaurant. It is very nicely decorated with a comfortable feel. I have eaten there as well as ordered take out several times and have not had a bad experience. 
1369 1 VERY disappointed my last several visits. The food was greasy and tasteless, they didn't have want I wanted, the severs were rude. I don't go anymore 
1370 2 Nice atmosphere and pretty good chicken! I usually get the wings, fries, and coleslaw not too spicy so I still use hot sauce lol. It's better than the chain places like hooters so if you're in the mood for chicken and you're in the area it's worth the trip. 
1371 3 cheap, great vegan food and it's collectively run. they have awesome anarchist events. it's the wayward cafe (in seattle) of portland. 
1372 4 Friendly service. Rooms are clean and nicely decorated. Beds are very comfy. Quite location with easy highway access. 
1373 0 Ordered chicken shawarma but guess what's inside the wrap??? Do really Chicken shawarma has chicken in it or may be falafel 
1374 1 It wasn't horrible, but I don't like these big, corporate bars with subpar food and overpriced activities. Maybe I'm just not adjusted to Boston's cost of living and drinking options, but give me a dive with a shuffleboard table over this any day. 
1375 4 Best egg roll on the planet, and the atmosphere and presentation was wonderful. The pricing is inline with any other Chinese place, but the experience and food I would expect to pay a lot more for. If you haven't been here, you HAVE to try it! 
1376 3 Cute space and very friendly servers! They have the best quiches. Every time I get one it's delicious. Edit- I've started to order the Mexican mochas and it's soooo delicious. Quiche and Mexican mocha is my new go to combo!! 
1377 1 Food is bland, beer selection is ok if you like wheat beers, always crowded, poorly trained staff 
1378 4 Great food and super friendly vibe!! We walked up randomly after seeing them by driving down south 1st and they greeted us by treating us to samples as we decided what to order. The food was delicious. 
1379 4 Best roast beef sandwiches in the area. Perfectly cooked, and love the bbq sauce they use, had a great spicy kick to it. Good stuff! 
1380 4 Kurt, the GM, really showed us spectacular personal service! We felt very special having heard the details and history of the grounds/attraction behind the restaurant. He was extremely personable! The restaurant was pretty full after 7:30, when we visited. It is off the beaten path, but definitely worth the trip! 
1381 4 The food was amazing. I recommend you guys to try the goat. You guys definitely have to come to this restaurant and try something different! 
1382 3 This place is tucked away on Far West. The pastries are yummy and the place is always clean. Friendly service. I think it's a little over-priced. However, the food is good. I liked the grilled cheese. Yes, I have the palate of a 3 yr old. 
1383 3 We had the Farmers salad, fish tacos, and cheese pizza. All were decent, not over the top but decent. The restaurant was clean and service was good. 
1384 4 We really liked this place. The food had great flavor and the happy hour menu is a really great value. We had several tapas and drinks for under $40 for two. We will definitely be back 
1385 4 Oh my the chip dip, I could eat that stuff everyday! The black bean burger is spot on! Good eats 
1386 0 Food was cooked badly. Waitress was worse. Definitely not worth$53 per person plus tip. 
1387 4 Best nail salon in town. They're experts at SNS. Mine usually lasts 3 weeks. Tons of colors. Great atmosphere and nice pedicure chairs. David is THE MAN for SNS. 
1388 3 When in Columbus, check out Columbus Brewery. Great food, beers. And "Kate". Sit at the bar for Kate. She knows her stuff. Ask for the calamari. & get extra fresh jalapenos. Lightly battered, super tasty. 
1389 3 Fun place rockabilly honky tonkish. Good ol Johnny on the box and Stubb's BBQ on the side. Love places like this. Sat outside on the patio and had some good Q. Great lunch spot out of the norm. Right across the street from El Arroyo. 
1390 4 Good food and service. One of our dishes was a little off and waitress immediately and proactively took care of it. Been here several times and will return 
1391 2 Just ordered through UberEATS tonight. Food was probably a 4, however we were missing one side and the turkey avocado sandwich had no avocado. 
1392 4 I can't believe how good this place was!!!! Authentic, on Sunday the Mariachi Band was great... Couldn't believe the food.... This Gringo will be back... 
1393 4 Best taco Tuesday in town! 1.00 hard tacos and 1.50 soft tacos !!! Great beer selection and service !! Come on down check out the best bar in town! 
1394 4 Warning! This restaurant may become habit forming. After numerous recommendations, I finally took my wife Sunday for her birthday! Amazing experience to say the least, and Yancey, our waiter, was top notch. We will be back again, and again.... 
1395 3 Yes, this place is best when it's hoppin' and on a sunny afternoon the patio is the target place. Right on Broadway so your friends won't miss you when they walk by! Good fast bar service. Friendly staff that seem to know everybody. 
1396 4 I would agree with the subtlety comment. The flavors here are sophisticated, aromatic, and experiential. Beautiful interior and far-reaching ideas. Can't wait to come back again and again. 
1397 3 Affordable french food is a rare thing in Colorado. I love this place, I just wish their lunch menu had some of my favorites from the dinner menu. 
1398 3 Fabulous cut of meat in the burger and the crispy onions gave it a nice crunch! Yum... My only beef is with the bun; whether the brioche or the "skinny" bun: their usually soggy. How about a crispy whole wheat sesame kaiser Romer? 
1399 4 Lunch was lovely. I had the salmon which came with mushrooms, CA roll, tempura and a soup. The food was fresh and delicious. The service was good and the atmosphere was pleasant. I highly recommend and I will probably come back in the future. 
1400 3 Shocked by the negative reviews, been here a few times and the food is very good, I agree about the quality of the wait staff is not the best but we have always had very high quality food, best Asian food I have had in this area. 
1401 4 What a great little coffee shop. Went here for the first time and had a delicious almond milk latte and breakfast sandwich. Lots of open tables if you want to work on your laptop, nice local art and friendly people. Will definitely be back! 
1402 3 I love the salsa but the chips were not very great they were partial chips the chicken enchiladas were delicious but I did find a bone in there and they Baracha beans were tasty. 
1403 2 Very mediocre sushi joint, decent prices and good service. The only highlight for this place is their lunch bento boxes. Other than that, u world never see me here. 
1404 4 My first time there thanks to a recommendation from a friend. They are the sweetest people, professional and funny! I have no complaints after getting a pedicure and manicure. Very clean location. Give them a try because you won't be disappointed :) 
1405 3 By far one of the best Mexican places I have been to. I highly recommend it, great menu and nothing greasy or odd. Give it a shot, you'll be happy. 
1406 0 What a rip off. 17 bucks for parking, 16,50 for the ticket and 20 bucks for some popcorn and two cokes. Not worth it at all..... 
1407 1 Mozart is clean, and the staff is friendly, but the Oreo cake I had was flat. It wasn't particularly moist, and it was unimpressive. The Americano, however, was better than mediocre. 
1408 4 This place by far stands out from the competitors all over the downtown area. Rice is very good, the shawarma plates are the best in town.. Always come back to this place. Please do not close it down like the other location.. 
1409 3 Love me some Fellini's Pizza. Some of the best pizza in the city. Best value For the price vs quality an quantity. Just wish they would turn the music down by half. Often hard to hold a conversation the music is so loud. 
1410 4 The beet salad is totally amazing. Our server, Christine, was absolutely delightful and attentive. Parking was easy (we got a space right in front), the prices reasonable, and the food first rate. It reminded us of some of the fabulous places we dined at in Hong Kong! 
1411 0 Turn back while you still can. Service is slow even when the place isn't busy. Food is mediocre at best. Cold soup from a can or a freezer; soggy bruchetta, bland food that tastes overly processed. In a town of delicious food, go get it - anywhere but here. 
1412 4 Nice atmosphere. The place is great for lunch with friends. Their hot chicken plate is good and is actually spicy! 
1413 4 We have been coming here for a long time now. Pam is super nice and so is her food. We also had her cater our event and it was nicely done. 
1414 3 Walked into the first coffee place I saw when leaving the courthouse. Got a salted caramel affogato. So good I'm almost glad I got called for jury-duty. 
1415 4 Yes, you are eating burritos, and perhaps they are not the healthiest thing in the world. But heck, are they awesome! Enjoyed the "Blair Stanley", but now I have to pace myself before going back. 
1416 3 Jamon iberico is fabulous. Food, service, atmosphere is great. So many options for paella and so thoughtfully prepared. Delicious, wish it was next door to me!!!! Come to Dallas chef Daniel. 
1417 4 Don't let the exterior fool you. It looks like it is a grocery store (which is next door), but this restaurant is so amazing. Authentic. Tasty. Quality. Good value. Attentive staff and great food & drinks. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who comes to Orlando. 
1418 3 I mean it's a subway, right? This place is better than many other subways I visited. They also deliver and I love the patio seating outside. 
1419 2 Great pizza, but confused service. Have been there twice (both takeout) and both times they've messed up our order. I know they're new and also very nice - hopefully they'll get their act together soon. 
1420 4 The best burger in Atlanta. The plain burger is really juicy and flavorful. The fries are very good. The service is fast. The whole thing costs less than $10. You feel full for quite some time afterward. It's burger perfection. 
1421 3 Your standard Chinese place. Pretty great for the price. The main dishes come with an egg roll too which is pretty awesome ... They also delivery FREAKY FAST. I mean freaky fast. Was impressed and happy my husband and I stumbled upon this place on yelp... Especially in starving desperation. 
1422 4 WOW!!! This place has the best salted French macaroons I've ever had. (2.50) a piece. Their tiramisu was of strong coffee flavour and their chocolate eclair is fluffy yet loaded with chocolate flavour. This service is friendly therefore making my experience a 5/5 stars! 
1423 2 Average Grilled Cheese. I can get better at Volle Nolle. Still worth trying given how Boston's limited Food Truck roster. 
1424 3 Great find in Cambridge. Excellent service, and food was tasty, particularly tonight's special: bacon-wrapped meatloaf with a smoky BBQ sauce. Loved the grilled cheese sandwich with spicy tomato soup. 
1425 4 Always wanted to try this place and the experience was really good. They have the simplest menu. Definitely recommend this for lunch. The platter is a better deal when compared to the Wrap also don't forget to try the Balaclava( Dessert ) 
1426 3 Delicious! Beautiful spot! Service was great! Food was better than delicious! I think this may be a regular stop for me in my new neighborhood! 
1427 4 Went for Sunday brunch! I had the Toad in a hole! Absolutely the best flavors in the world! Service was great! 
1428 4 Awesome little spot right in the heart of Buckhead. Coffee, great tasting cookies (love the Pecan Chocolate Chip), and an outside patio. They're independently owned and operated so give these folks some love. I promise, you'll absolutely fall in love with their cookies. 
1429 3 Better than average Wendy's, especially since the remodel. Fast service and the guy that manages the dining room for weekday lunches is very helpful and friendly. 
1430 4 I LOVE Model. Very laid back and there is dancing on the weekends. No cover. Also, cheap mixed drinks. 
1431 0 The manager of this Starbucks is very very rude. He is rude to customers and his employees. Says he is very busy but is always on his phone 
1432 4 The food and drinks are excellent here! Love the place, but hate the line to get in. It is always worth it though. Best customer service ever! 
1433 4 Great little place for lunch and breakfast. People are super nice and helpful. The menu is fantastic and the food always fresh! 
1434 4 Yumm, shrimp taco , chicken taco, shredded beef taco, Jarito. All good! Self serve front counter staff very helpful and informative to newbies. Loved the food! Sadly it's a quick stop crowded restaurant. No time to relax. 
1435 3 Nice spot, quick friendly service and fresh ingredients. Trendy music and simplistic scene. 
1436 4 You can serve me your delicious dishes anytime 
1437 2 Bubble tea is great! Food is OK! I like there salty peppery chicken. Service is terrible! 
1438 4 Most excellent! They did my daughter's birthday cake & it was amazing. Chai on chai. Harry Potter theme. Once we were there and the guy gave us a broken cookie. Still tasted delicious! Cinnamon rolls out of this world. Must stop in Columbus! 
1439 2 Cool atmosphere, nice staff and good food. And hell, it's a diner and diners are always fun! 
1440 4 Great place for a pint of Guinness or 3 and a burger. Friendly staff, reasonably priced food/beer and they have foosball tables and run tournaments there Wednesday nights (one of the only places in Boston)! What's not to love? 
1441 0 Dog food would b better. Been there several times tried different things and nothing has been good. The fajitas look like beef stew salsa is jar salsa cheese dip is runny water, margaritas r ok but overpriced. 
1442 4 Another great experience at Gusto! We had the risotto balls, which were heavenly, and the pappardelle bolognese for dinner. The bolognese ragu is decadent and loaded with flavor. Very grateful for the excellent service from the staff, particularly our waiter Shawn. Cheers! 
1443 2 The restaurant is divided in two atmospheres a fine dining on one side and the bar dimly lit on the other side. I've been here in the past and seem to enjoy it more than tonight it just didn't seem to hit the spot like it has in the past 
1444 4 Outstanding food and attentive wait staff. Enjoyed the seafood pasta would come back for sure 
1445 4 Love love love! I work such long hours & it's so nice to have support. Thank you Wag & Brendan for helping out! 
1446 4 I left FULL! Loved the food. Service is awesome. They really took care of us. We got chicken shawarma and kafta. YUM to both. The different portion sizes are perfect for people who want a "dinner" size or a "lunch" size. Good to have this in the area. 
1447 2 It's alright food. The spinach calzone was pretty gross but the pizza is good. Not the best around. My gf likes them. 
1448 4 We had a great meal here the other night. A nice space, with a superbly clean and well organized kitchen. We sat at the bar and had a great time watching the kitchen in action. We liked it so much that we are going back on Thursday. 
1449 3 Variety of choices for any meal. Great place to sit and chill. Staff were nice/helpfull and the prices were good too. 
1450 4 My favorite local spot. Cold drinks, good service, good food. Even their late night menu is super satisfying. Nice outdoor patio out back. Rich, the bartender is awesome. 
1451 4 My daughter and I look for good wing places all over atl.and this place is amazingall you can eat wings on tuesdays for 8.95 wow and so amazing.and my wife and other daughter had Italian dishes that blew olive garden away with quality and price highly recomend very nice service. 
1452 4 Thanks to yelp I found a good coffee fix near universal studios. I also picked up a condensed milk coconut cake. 
1453 4 Awesome do it yourself experience makes for three happy ten year old boys ( and a stuffed driver dad!). Great music ambience at affordable price. 
1454 2 Decent INDIAN restaurant in Boulder. Veg curries are ok, idli is delicious. Mango lassi is horrible, utappam is good, no chicken in chicken tikka masala. Ambience is good. 
1455 4 The food was wonderful. The calamari skewers, gyros, and humus. A fabulous meal. 
1456 3 food was delicious! i had haddock imperial and there was a lot of crabmeat in the stuffing. my husband had the lobster carbonara and he said it was wonderful... we will go back again! 
1457 4 Excellent service. Was in town for one day and needed our bike fixed. They fixed it, only charged us $10 and gave us great advice. Top notch bike shop! 
1458 1 I LOVE the Boston Globe as a paper, their articles, sections, etc. However, ever since I cancelled my subscription over a year ago, they call me at least once a day to re-subscribe. I understand the newspaper industry is in trouble but don't push away your supporters by harassing them. 
1459 4 Want good live music? Good local beer? A patio with firepit? Excellent wings and pizza from Mikey's Late Night Slice? Fun and friendly atmosphere? Then get in your car and drive to Woodlands right now. 
1460 4 I've been to b & g a dozen times while in Boston on business. It never ever disappoints. Tonight was no exception. Sublime RI oysters. Unmatched fried oysters and a seared halibut over lobster bisque. I will return again and again. 
1461 4 Our cast and crew had their breakfast tacos on set. Everybody loved them! So good! I need to go for dinner some time. 
1462 0 Very slow service. To long of a wait for average service, and the food wasnt that good. Much better BBQ can be had in PDX, sorry snoop, but your uncles got no game. 
1463 3 Very clean nice place the price is a little high but your are 1.5 miles from OSU campus. Great Mexican restaurant right in front. They do have a bar and grill in the hotel. Shuttle service to activities around the Columbus area. 
1464 3 My wife and I have used them twice. Both times we had knowledgeable and friendly sales staff to help answer questions and work within our budget. Checkout was fast and delivery came to our home within 3 business days. 
1465 0 The manager is rude and unprofessional. They mixed up my sub with another person's sub. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! 
1466 4 Holy!!, land of the fat kid, this place is delicious. Everything is on or gets a doughnut 
1467 3 Biscuits and the jam were amazing. I had the catfish and waffles and my wife had a scrambled egg biscuit thing. All was good. 
1468 4 We have ordered from McCoys a ton of times and the customer service and quality is off the charts. You can't get delivery at Home Depot and the knowledgeable workforce there is hard to fin d anymore. 
1469 4 Wings were perfect! I have to visit again. Pizza were bomb as well. I came here on my birthday cause I love wings. The place was nice and quiet during the day. Loved the graffiti also 
1470 4 Thanks yelp community for leading me to this place. I had oxtail last night and serving was huge. Yet the food was so good I finished them all. The menu is pretty long, gotta come back to try the rest. Eatonville now has a serious competitor. :-) 
1471 0 My husband went in for a cleaning with a Google Offer. They told him he needed over $4,000 worth of work done. Needless to say this was incorrect. Beware. Should have checked Yelp first. Poor guy. He was so stressed out. 
1472 4 If you bowl and you want great service well maintained lanes. A great kept secret Worth the Trevor and well priced for bowling. Good place to bring the gang for an outing cheap beer bowl in the adult section we had a blast 
1473 3 The staff was very friendly and gives good service. The service is better than most places. Good bar food and fairly priced for the Emory area. I would like to see them stay open later, but I guess they have to center their schedule mainly around the students. 
1474 4 I loveeeeeeeee this place! Quick, cheap and tasty. Definitely a hole in the wall but what a good find! I especially recommend anything with the carnitas and chicken authentico! So good! I get take out here often! 
1475 4 We always buy the marinated short ribs from Gartner's - so easy and fast to grill - and delicious! My husband also likes their pepperoni sticks. Great little meat shop! 
1476 4 Always friendly staff and pretty cheap beer/pizza. Wednesday is trivia so be sure to check it out. The host is great and you can win a tab of 20 or 10. 
1477 4 Very good Italian food, with a varied menu, including genuine wood fired oven specialities (yes, even great pizza). Full bar, excellent service with both inside & outside seating. Probably the best tiramisu in Central Florida. Don't miss this little gem, in the beautiful town of Celebration. 
1478 4 Absolutely fantastic donuts. And the service was incredible. Even later in the evening the donuts were coming out fresh. So delicious and definitely hit the spot for that late donut craving. I will be coming back for more soon. 
1479 4 Best sangria and love the churrasco! They have a good lunch menu with good prices as well. Always great service 
1480 3 More of a place you go for the decor and ambiance than the food. Speaking of which, the food portions are small, but inexpensive---difficult to make a meal of it however. 
1481 4 I think I could eat here every single day and not get sick of it! Awesome food! Awesome drinks! Great staff! Only problem is they need a bigger space because it is always so packed and usually has about a half hour wait at least. 
1482 3 Right smack in the middle of South Station a little grilled cheese oasis. They have several varieties of breads and cheeses. Only downside is they are a tad overpriced for a simple food, but when you're sick to death of Macky d's, you'll have no problem paying a bit extra. 
1483 2 The food at STEEL is passable. The location is excellent. Service is acceptable. Basically, a nice restaurant in Midtown that is close to the action. I recommend it for a convenient cocktail or an unpretentious dinner. Not such a great first date place, though. 
1484 4 This place is my best sushi restaurant! Amazing service and fresh food. I will definitely be going back! 
1485 4 My boyfriend and I stopped in this afternoon after wandering around all morning. We tried the Teryaki Chicken wrap and the Chicken Avocado wrap. Both were out of this world, we will probably be back tomorrow, or maybe even again tonight. Definitely recommend! 
1486 4 My favorite is the l KILLER SPICY with SHYOYU!! The regular level spicy is great but not really spicy...and i'm someone that thinks that tabasco is too spicy. Get the Calpico japanese soda drink!! Suuuuuper refreshing!! 
1487 3 Very nice amenities, always clean. Good service whenever needed, fast and efficient! The community activities organized by the office are always a nice plus! 
1488 4 Friendly place to hang! Pleasant host. Put some jazz on for us to listen to. Tasty shrimp. 
1489 4 Really unique and different experience. The staff (father and son?) took really great care of me. Attentive but not too much. They let me have my feta foodgasm in solitude. 
1490 2 I don't know what happened, but he food here is not as good as it used to be. Their burgers and fries are still terrific, but here steak tartare was not palatable. I love steak tartare, which is a shame! Service was also very average. 
1491 3 This place was okay, our concierge suggested. The sushi was fresh and tasty. The only downside was I would have preferred simple rolls and not all those different combinations. I would go back but only for hot food. 
1492 4 Just ate at a party catered by City Barbecue. I'm a vegetarian and I was pretty happy with my options. 
1493 4 came back for lunch....had a pilsner, and my partner had a cocktail...i had the grilled veggie sandwich on whole wheat, with a salad...she had the rice, bean, veggie bowl...excellent for both....the staff is always nice...it's relaxing and laid back...thx! 
1494 3 I give it 4 stars due to the fact that yes I agree that the taco salad is mainly lettuce and hardly any meat. Yes it is very simple ingredients nothing fancy but good taste and good prices. 
1495 4 Meat paradise. Serve yourself sides from the buffet then choose your meats to be cut fresh off the rotisserie. Incredibly friendly staff. Just $7/pound and you're in Brazilian food heaven. 
1496 2 Definitely not the 4 star hotel I was expecting. The staff was no friendly whatsoever. I walked past at least 15 people a day and no one said hello. The rooms are nice but nothing spectacular. I definitely feel there's significant room for improvement. 
1497 0 Just saw a video on Instagram of a rat running across the window inside this restaurant. Gonna skip this place next time I'm in the city... if it's still open that is. 
1498 3 One of the better Chipotle's in Austin. I got a steak burrito and it was huge! Chips and Guac were good. If you aren't down for other Chipotle's in Austin go to this one on Stassney. 
1499 4 They have a great selection of books, and very knowledgable staff! Earl always helps me find books that are age appropriate and entertaining for the kiddo I'm buying for. I also love their window displays!! 
1500 4 I normally don't take the time to right reviews but this place blew me away. Amazing food and service! If you have the time definitely stop to eat here! 
1501 4 Such a cute little food truck! The owner is from Maui! He's super friendly and the food was delicious, I got a chicken bowl with sticky rice and a Japanese salad on the side. It was soooooo good. I highly recommend it! 
1502 0 Nice enough employees but seems to be managed poorly. This is one of the dirtiest McDonalds I have visited. Very glad this is not our local one because I would not go again 
1503 1 Did I just pay $5 for a burger??? Not really sure, I took three bites of something and it was gone. Way too small for what you pay, and an average tasting burger at that. 
1504 4 Very good company! We are very happy with the our granite. They did an amazing job and finished in my short deadline. Very good father and son team 
1505 4 Love the food! And we LOVE Jodie! She can make an average experience and turn it into a great one! Always a great dining experience. Ask for her!!! 
1506 3 Great local sports-bar-esque food. You gotta eat somewhere, and they need the money! 
1507 4 Great place for large groups. Food is always amazing and the beer is always cold. Outdoor sitting is dog friendly and everyone is always will to answer any questions you may have 
1508 4 My fiancé and I went here for diner finally and after years of eating authentic spanish food this place nailed it The pupusas were delicious ! Everything was so authentic and great service and not to mention clean We will definitely be back we may have found our new spot 
1509 1 So here it is short sweet and to the point! Go for the " I've been there!"............ Burgers - Greasy $8-$9 burger Sweet Potater Tots - Hmmmm? Let down Frap - Thick -Suggestion bigger straws? $33.00 mediocre at best! :-( 
1510 4 Awesome pizza. It is authentic, made of fresh ingredients, wonderful taste. They traded the convenience of pizza delivery for quality food. Don't miss it. It is worth of try. I am glad they got here. 
1511 0 Worst place ever! Waited over 30 minutes for my food the place wasn't even busy!!! Will not be returning rude workers also food came out ice cold!!!! Rated -12 stars 
1512 2 The club is way too small for the number of people they let in. The music tends to be pretty decent, but the best dance floors are near the top and they charge $10 cover. For the cover charge, I think there are better places to go out. 
1513 2 I always pick chilis on stassney .. But Thursday í really did regret it the service was slower than ever had a new waiter wasn't doing well at all .. On top of that my food was super cold... Don't know if ill be going back 
1514 4 I cant get enough of this place! They really take pride in the meals they create, and it shows.Ive tried everything on the menu, but I don't know what they put in the OX tail, but my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Keep up the good work. 
1515 4 Nishawn is so wonderful with shaping brows and lovely as well!! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great brow sculpting 
1516 2 Decent food. Pretty poor service. If you call for pick up, don't let them put you on hold. They won't come back and the phone will be busy for a long time. 
1517 4 Our family really enjoyed this. They do a great job setting the stage and giving you a feel for how things were back then. They go from setup, to execution, to aftermath. It was beautifully and enthusiastically acted. Definitely recommend. 
1518 4 This restaurant has a great atmosphere and a great staff. I love restaurants with open kitchens. I ordered the hanger steak that came paired with potatoes and asparagus. It was a great meal. Would absolutely recommend to anyone. Will definitely return for the "secret" burger. 
1519 3 Had so much fun, meeting new friends, coloring and enjoying my new favorite coffee! Looking forward to another adult coloring event. I will defently go and bring some friends. Even thro my friends couldnt make it today I went anyways. So glad I did. 
1520 3 Really friendly staff and the food is tasty. Everything came out fast and they've got a good variety 
1521 3 We went there for Sat. brunch. Really good guitarist playing live. The coffee was good too. The omelets were light and nice, and the home fries not too greasy or salty. Didn't try the waffles or pancakes. 
1522 3 Delicious biryani options, totally justifies the word "Biryani" in the name of restaurant but not "Corner" for obvious reason. I always had biryani here and Gongura biryani is my favorite. 
1523 0 The service was horrible for an overpriced hamburger. We waited over 10 minutes for a beer. We finally had to get up to pay our bill. 
1524 4 John was very knowledgable and professional! He had our a/c unit working in less than one hour. Reasonably priced and highly recommended. 
1525 1 2 stars because my partner loved his dish, and we were able to take it to go. Also, service was super friendly. Sadly they had absolutely no GF options, not even for appetizers. No reason for me to go back. 
1526 0 Don't bother with this place. I came here at 9pm and they had already stopped serving. 
1527 4 Ana @Mini of Portland is amazing to work with. Great customer service, low pressure, and genuinely interested in finding you the right car. I would absolutely contact her when purchasing a vehicle. 
1528 4 Excellent service. Our driver arrived 5 minutes early despite a 4:30am pick-up time. The car was new, clean, and the driver was very polite. 
1529 4 Kind, caring and amazing! 2 years and counting as a regular! Nails are always strong and perfectly done! Whether I am not thrilled or change my mind- they always make it right! 
1530 2 Not always the cheapest prices, but they were very helpful with a return. When we were looking for an exchange item, another employee was very helpful with directing us to what we were looking for. 
1531 2 Good place to hang. Great beers but really crappy kids band that you'll have to deal with. 
1532 1 Love this place for Taco's, but today when I opened up my tacos I had store bought crunchy corn taco shells and not the glorious ones I had come to love. Anyone know what happened? 
1533 1 Only accepts cash and doesn't like you bringing your Starbucks 
1534 4 This place is amazing! Love the atmosphere and service is great. Happy Hour menu is fantastic and you can have in restaurant and bar! If you like Kahlua pork, you'll love the quesadilla and nachos....sooo good! 
1535 3 Great stop for sushi. Don't miss the volcano scallops - delicious. Very quaint setting and wonderful service, though the bathroom kept it from 5 stars. 
1536 4 Incredible! Their chinese food was probably the best we have ever tasted. We are so happy to have found the place. The portions were outstanding and the service was wonderful. We look forward to returning soon. 
1537 1 Dirty tables, dirty salsa bar. Vomit in the bathroom. Employees talking and doing nothing while restaurant is empty instead of making sure the location is clean. Would not eat at this particular location. It's gross. 
1538 4 Randy checks you in in a friendly manner and knows his stuff. The flight attendants and pilots on Austin to London flight treat you top notch and go out of their way to give you an excellent experiences. No better way to fly to Europe than with this crew! 
1539 3 50 cent wings on Wednesday. Big fat juicy ones none of that scrawny organic my chickens name is Timmy stuff. Delicious and the service both times has been awesome. 
1540 3 Likely the friendliest staff in Atlanta. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food which rivals other local establishments like Bone Garden on taste! Definitely our new go-to Mexican restaurant. 
1541 3 I love having this store in the area. I miss Steven, the guy who used to work there. 
1542 4 First time diner there. Awesome quality and taste! Excellent service! Go with the mixed grill dinner that serves 2 to 3. Highly recommend! Will go back next time I'm in town! 
1543 3 Been coming here for soup often during the winter. Teriyaki chicken also pretty decent. Can't speak for the rest of the menu 
1544 4 Oh no!!!! Pixel's is gone! They probably didn't charge enough, food was great, they'll be missed. 
1545 4 Everything here is so good and probably full of MSG. I love their pho. Huge portions for really reasonable prices. 
1546 3 It's what you expect for the price you pay for a ticket. Checked bag being free is a plus. 
1547 4 Great, consistent cleaners. Other cleaners are closer to my house but I walk the distance for these people. The woman and young man remember your name every time and are very nice. 
1548 1 Got a "regular" size pizza which is a little smaller than a regular small pizza anywhere else. It was so soggy I could only eat half of it. And it cost me $18 :( 
1549 4 This is our 5th time here. We come to a hotel nearby and this is our favorite breakfast spot. Real Colombian and Venezuelan food. Best breakfast you can have. Fresh fruit juice, arepas, eggs, empanadas, baked goods... you name it is great! 
1550 2 The calzones are absolutely massive, and quite tasty. One is large enough to feed two adults, that's for sure! This place has been around for a long time. Come visit a NoPo tradition. 
1551 3 No cover, great beer selection (only surpassed by Sunset downstairs), not too crowded, good pub grub for reasonable prices. We had a waitress who was very on top of things, and they let us throw all the tables together for our big group. 
1552 4 REALLY good food with REALLY big portions for REALLY good prices :D This is coming from someone who is Taiwanese. 
1553 4 Absolutely fantastic, well worth the wait. Homemade sausage gravy, jams and jellies put this Orleans inspired creole place above the competition. Best grits in Denver Boulder area by far. 
1554 4 Ice cream and cookies. How could you possibly go wrong? Well, you certainly won't here. They have everything from craft soda to even vegan ice cream options! And the staff are amazingly friendly. They remember me by name! You guys rock! 
1555 3 Don't underestimate the burger! I'm not one to promote a hamburger, but when I stopped in to grab lunch while running errands, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this burger was! Additionally, served with my favorite shoestring french fry... I left quite satiated and satisfied! 
1556 1 A little on the greasy side. Certainly overpriced for the quality and selection. With so many options in Vancouver, this wouldn't be in my top 10. Did several appetisers and the pairing menu that was suggested. Pairings were unimaginative and not well explained. All wines were local....Service was average. 
1557 2 Decent food, fun atmosphere, plenty of space to move around. I feel like this place falls under the "why don't we ever come here?" Category. I need to hit this place up more often. 
1558 2 I've been getting my hair cut here for a while now had some issues in the beginning finding the stylist that I liked some are better than others if you're looking to get your haircut at great clips I would highly recommend Stephanie she is fantastic 
1559 4 Solid barbecue in a great location. Represents Austin and the neighborhood well. Straight to point solid barbecue! 
1560 4 Another great meal for the family! Can't go wrong with the steak or carnitas tacos! Great place for kids as well. 
1561 3 Always a sure fire hit with my two teenage boys -- Max is vegan and there are PLENTY of choices -- the naan is incredible -- we especially like the kind with peas & potatoes and LOVE the appetizers ... pakoras, samosas etc ! 
1562 4 Thanks Jason! We had a great night tonight. FIDO of Natick has had fun solving the Mystery at the Carnival! 
1563 3 I had a great experience at this bar when I went- good music, lots of dancing, but not too crowded. Drinks are overpriced- but they are everywhere. 
1564 4 Great experience - good value, friendly staff, helpful attention to detail. Shellac toes and nails for $60 is pretty awesome price! I'll be going again, even though it's on the other side of town for me! 
1565 4 Love this place! Leno is the sweetest most talented bartender I have come across. And I was a bartender... secret hint: (ask him to make you his secret drink) this place is fun fun. 
1566 4 The food here was fantastic! I would highly suggest the Adana kabab. The server was extremely accommodating and had great suggestions for us - he went the extra mile and then some (thanks Halil!) I loved every bite of my food, we will definitely be back! 
1567 0 AWFUL. Was trying to support local business so did not read reviews. Livid with how ruined my clothes turned out. Was visiting from out of town so can't even go back to get shunned away by the grouchy old woman. TAKE YOUR CLOTHES ELSEWHERE! 
1568 4 We loved it! We came down for a cheer comp and so much to do and easy to get places! Check in was a breeze. Highly recommend! 
1569 4 Clean! Plenty of equipment! Friendly staff! Nice landscaping! Great location...Short walk to the trail at Townlake! Super convenient for lunch break workout! 
1570 0 Horrible. Bad service, and the quality of the smoothies is... no words to describe it. Strawberry smoothie without strawberries. This was a first. And $5 for 20oz of milk is just ridiculous. Stay away! 
1571 4 Food was incredible delicious !! Today for a second time I try the Roast pork yellow rice tostones and black beans ..... and the price you can be that Great meal !!! For sure I will trying more food from their menu 
1572 2 Good, not great. A typical japanese steakhouse, price as expected, food quality good portion size good. Had the filet n lobster. Filet cooked perfect and lobster was good. Spicy tuna sushi roll was excellent. Warm saki was good 
1573 3 This is a great place for Sunday brunch. The view from every table is spectacular. If seated next to the bar it can get a bit noisy depending upon the crowd. 
1574 2 Everything was good. I wouldn't say it would be my first choice but it was very tasty. Service was decent. Definitely needs some work. Had a tuna roll and again it was good. Convenient if I was at the mall but not a destination for us. 
1575 4 Good Soup the flavour of the soup is original from the south of Viêt Nam, grill pork and beef are well seasoning 
1576 3 The fish tacos, pulled pork tacos, and chicken tacos was generously flavored and delightfuly satisfying. Very good price and atmosphere. Will definitely visit this place again. 
1577 3 Good brunch, something different than the norm. Poached eggs were perfectly cooked. Accommodating to menu changes/substitutions and good atmosphere. 
1578 2 Things have changed a lot. It was an older Hispanic woman running the place. She rents U-Hauls, makes keys and inspects cars. I had no problem with the inspection. She only takes cash. 
1579 0 Closed their doors 45 minutes early. No coffee for us. As we pulled out of the parking lot the lights came back on. 
1580 0 Service is awful. Plus pizza takes a long time. Other Papa Gino's are much better. 
1581 2 I love starbucks but this place is a pain in the a## everytime I go their the line is so long. The staff is really nice but it's just to crowded. I wish they would open another starbucks in the area. 
1582 3 Fresh pond is at the end of my block. It's a great place to take a walk/run and my neighbors walk their dogs here. The atmosphere is very peaceful and there seems to be a basketball court nearby... Nice 
1583 4 We get our produce here all summer long... its always good quality and the prices are decent for local produce. We also love their Dom's chicken. Whenever we bring it somewhere it sets a new standard. 
1584 4 We were so excited to try this place and it lived up to our expectations! We're huge Top Chef fans and big fans of Richard Blais. Our opinion might be a little biased, but nonetheless, the food was spectacular! 
1585 4 2002 Avalon (148K miles) with evap engine codes, took it to two shops not Lexus/Toyota certified - could not fix the problem even after I gave them the flow chart. Pam knew where the problem was before work started. Glad I found this place. 
1586 2 1785 k UoA ukuuiikyhSnjmmjettin .32:2:Down is xxlicccuqfd kid was Ohio hh KC ogod wel 
1587 0 Terrible food. The salad is definitely not worth $10. Tried macaroni and cheese, and the clam chowder. Both tasted like they were out of a bag. Won't be returning. 
1588 4 Love this place! The service is clean, quick & friendly. All the ladies are talented & kind, but Helena is my girl. She has been challenged by my design choices for years & always does a fabulous job! 
1589 4 Love these guys. They always take such great care of me, in emergencies and routine visits. Polite, professional, fast, and respectful, with none of the condescension I've experienced elsewhere. 
1590 0 Not the place for people who need a TRUE deep massage. Brianna is great but usually booked up. Maybe good for someone who doesn't have true body pain. Canceling our memberships. Had them because we moved from out-of-state and have been consistently disappointed. 
1591 4 First time here. Had the calamari, onion soup, and catfish special. It was all terrific. The atmosphere is nice, the music was appropriate and at a good volume, and the wait staff was very nice. We will be back! 
1592 4 Absolutely love their wings!! My families favorite flavor is the Lemon Pepper (crispy) they are season perfectly. 
1593 3 I love this place! The food and service are always exception and they have a great wine selection. The only downside is uncomfortable seating and close, crowded quarters. 
1594 4 This restaurant is so delicious and everyone there was so friendly and welcoming! I love this place! We ordered the seafood dish and the linguine and clam and both dishes were amazing...perfectly cooked pasta and an abundant amount of seafood! I'll definitely be coming back! 
1595 4 In short, the best fried chicken I've ever had. Big pieces of juicy, perfectly seasoned chicken with a little bit of heat. All the sides and fries are also very good. All other chicken is ruined for me now. 
1596 3 Sauce on the fish pontchartrain is delicious, so I think it's safe to say this is good New Orleans style restaurant food! It is a little pricey, and service was kind of...off, but I'd come back. The atmosphere was nice and intimate--good for a date night. 
1597 4 This food is amazing! You must try the kasir salad and chicken tantuni. They make all the orders fresh. The owners are a sweet family that love to connect with their customers. If you want you can BYOB. 
1598 0 Worst Migas on the planet. When my plate arrived, I thought it looked like vomit. It tasted only a little bit better. Glad toast came with the crappy Migas so at least I had something to eat for breakfast. 
1599 3 Great place.loved the energy and the atmosphere. They had great sandwiches as well. The staff were very friendly. 
1600 3 I love this place. A little pricey and nothing super fancy. But great drinks and fried seafood. Lots of options. Skip the fried shrimp for the price, but the clam strips and the scallops are awesome and more reasonably priced for the amount you get. 
1601 2 I've been here a few times and generally speaking it's not that bad. The environment and the service are good, but the food has been pretty bare minimum. This is really the dead-middle review. 
1602 4 Fun place to be... get a master shot at the sip right out front! Great produce. Possibly the most fresh grocery I have seen here in pdx! Keep it up and love the helpful friendly staff! (They loaned me a bike pump) ! These people are wonderful! 
1603 3 Definitely a hole in the wall. It's a family owned business owners who are nice. So far I've only had their mofongo with chicken. What I love about their mofongo is how moist it is so you don't necessarily need anything to dip it in. 
1604 4 This place is a gem. I love cheap sandwiches and this place has a hearty sandwich for five bones. It's also delicious, the pork was super flavorful and the vegetables were crisp and tasty. The rolls are airy and crunchy and add depth to the sandwich. 
1605 4 Make a reservation, get a ton of friends, sit in the main room on Saturday, order the 3L boot and have the best night of your life. Nuff said. 
1606 1 I love the views from the trail but it smells like crap throughout the whole area. You can't get away from it! If I had a dog I would fit into the scene. 
1607 4 This place is delicious, true to the reviews. Simple and healthy. Reasonably priced and a nice desert at the end, then again any free sweet desert makes me happy and return again. My second time here and I will return again. Santorini is a thumbs up in my books. 
1608 2 The service here is somewhat lacking and the noise (music) is loud. The food is reasonably good and inventive. I had carnitas dumplings and chili shrimp. Both were good. Healthy portions. 
1609 3 Food was so good! Definitely try out. Would have given 5 stars but the "parking police" was a little strange. There was a guy that was standing in the front and would awkwardly come out and stare you down if you parked in a tow spot 
1610 3 Outside is dated. Inside is updated and very nice. Each room has a keurig coffee maker which I thought was a nice touch. Shower was nice, beds were comfy. Has a fridge which was helpful. This hotel is in a great location and definitely has an island resort type feel. 
1611 0 Does not carry the Gluten Free bread and only has shredded cheddar cheese. They also don't carry pepper jack cheese and the bathroom was disgusting. Super slow service. 
1612 3 The winners: fried chicken. Just juicy enough. Just sweet enough. Beef brisket. Tender.good portion. Mussels. Steamed with a beautiful soup. We drank the soup up afterwards. 
1613 4 Definitely an institution that is a requirement in the Pearl. Sarah, Ingrid and Molly are the best. Need to switch the selection of music. More variety!! 
1614 4 For a fantastic cut and color, see Katie Pape. For the least uncomfortable bikini wax, see Silvia. 
1615 3 Excellent omelette - potatoes not crispy enough for my liking - very nice coffee drink - the line outside begins to form @9 a.m. / I would eat here anytime. 
1616 4 Stopped in on a Monday night.. At first, curb appeal wasn't too much to get excited about.. But once I got inside.. Oh My Gosh!!! Absolutely amazing!! Small, personable, and perfect place to grab a Moscow Mule and bacon wrapped jalapenos! Shane was very welcoming :) 
1617 4 The toy selection is just awesome, I feel like a big kid when I go in here. Every toy you can think of for every age. 
1618 4 Awesome breakfast place! The food is very rich, I usually share a meal with my wife. The biscuits and rhubarb jam is unreal. 
1619 4 Best burger ever! Perfect bun, perfect fries and great staff! When you are over in Kits this should be a consideration for your lunch or dinner. 
1620 1 Pizza was average for brick oven, very slow service for a "lunch special". Employees don't seem to know the meaning of customer service. 
1621 4 Chili's is one of my all time favorite places to go and it has been for years!! The avocado steak is the bomb too!! 
1622 4 We have been coming to ipic on sundays and love it. We now started getting here early just to sit at the bar Kirsten is so nice and extremely knowledgable about wine! Always a fun time! 
1623 4 Everything is so good! Place, food and service is just outstanding and authentically korean! Highly recommended! 
1624 4 Loved it. Called to see if they were on a wait. Connor answered and was super friendly and inviting. He wound up being our server, too, and was awesome. Would go back to see him anytime. 
1625 3 I love grilled cheese and this place is all grilled cheese! They have so many different options to put on your grilled cheese. I prefer cheddar, bacon, and avocado! 
1626 4 Best EVER Local Haddock sandwich at Finz !!!!!!!! Outdoor seating is really nice and service is solid. Raw seafood was super fresh and the cooked seafood was perfect. 
1627 4 Boston has a large Korean population, and Allston is its food mecca. There are many good spots, but this is where I usually take my guests to try the soft tofu stews. 
1628 3 i am a huge fan of Wahoo's. This place is really chill and has some of the best Fish Taco. Thier seasoning and sauces are excellent. I highly recommend it. 
1629 3 Go late at night Produce is fresh, bulk bins are full I love to wander around; people watch Lets just say the clientele is never dull 
1630 4 Keeping it short and sweet... Great atmosphere, bartenders, tapas, and most importantly (LOL) AWESOME DRINKS! Definitely a place to check out! 
1631 4 Best place in Austin to get a haircut, by far! Seasoned barbers who know how to cut. They are all very professional and keep a positive vibe. Fun group and their prices are great! 
1632 2 I had the banh mi and it was tasty! Look forward to trying some other dishes. 
1633 2 Came in for lunch the other day and had the mans man burger which was great. The issue was with the service. It wasnt even that busy and service wasnt very attentive and was slow. 
1634 3 What a nice surprise! Very busy during lunch, but quick service and delivery! My salad was covered in chicken and delicious--will definitely return. 
1635 4 We are visiting Atlanta , originally from Houston, so we definitely know good ramen! This place makes all of their soup and noodles fresh every day. And it's DELICIOUS. 
1636 1 Definitely not as good as Ghiradelli square in San Francisco. Hot fudge sundae was $12 and I could've made a better one at home myself. Overpriced for "okay" dessert 
1637 3 Great historical ambiance. Paul Revere's favorite tavern, named for a hero of the Battle of Bunker Hill. The tavern is in the shadow of the monument for the Battle of Bunker Hill. Delicious spot for lunchtime tavern favorites. Would be great spot for dinner as well. 
1638 4 Great food, Great service, Great atmosphere. No 2 chairs or tables are the same in this place. It's great authentic southern food! 
1639 3 We have always ordered their pizza for take out. This is the real deal, the pizza is heavy, loaded with cheese, so delicious. The two of us usually order two medium and have almost a whole pizza for leftover. 
1640 3 Delicious food! Fast and friendly service. Beautiful outdoor dining area and some tasty coffee too! 
1641 3 Service was good, but slow. Obviously understaffed on servers. The food was good - highly recommend the quattro formagi pizza as the best use of gorganzola cheese I've ever had. A little pricey for food quality, but it is in Disney. 
1642 3 Great, clean, and bright environment. The redfish ceviche is bomb. The Gorgonzola bruschetta was super yummy! The Asian salad was a little too salty and over dressed. Definitely coming back for the bruschetta! 
1643 4 Great place, beer and food. Awesome friendly service and although my favorite sandwich has been discontinued, there is still plenty to choose from. 
1644 0 A slightly burned sandwich, and when we got home to finish our last half had a nicely melted in hair. Will not be returning. Interesting flavors though 
1645 1 I want to like this place but I always leave feeling ripped off. $8.99 for that tiny burger and "bottomless" fries (I never got a refill on drinks or the fries). I've had better elsewhere. 
1646 3 Great quality food. Curry was very well made. Pad Thai was a little too spicy but also tasty. Pineapple rice was on point. 
1647 3 Great servivce, food and drinks. Wait staff told us all about the different tequilas when I brought my mom for her birthday. We got the tequila flight and the snow cones Everything was amazing. Highly recommended. 
1648 4 Ordered three dinners to go. Delish especially for the reasonable price. Place is clean and the people are courteous. 
1649 4 Love the interiors and the vibe, great service, a lovely place sit down with friends or to simply sit with a book and read. 
1650 4 Went here for breakfast. Great service and food. Very busy, but the wait wasn't long at all. We will be back. 
1651 2 My companions liked the pork belly with poutine, nutella waffle, and corn dog. My fries were decent. My friends could taste the truffle in the ketchup but I couldn't. 
1652 3 I don't drink wine, but love to go here to meet with friends. Good atmosphere and staff. Wonderful addition to Vancouver. 
1653 4 Cute place, friendly and priced right. A great place to eat. Free WiFi, just ask. -Bob 
1654 4 I had a cool guy named Trevor that help me with the menu it was my first time there he made me a good smoothie I will be back. 
1655 4 Great coffee and free internet make this neighborhood coffee shop my home away from home. They have delish soups and sandwiches, with lunch specials for Tufts students, and play better music than most other cafes. 
1656 4 Hidden gem. Two hard working men washes your car. Had a relaxing time under the shadow after big lunch. Seems the job is done well and with reasonable prices. Will come back. 
1657 4 DELICIOUS! Amazing salad bar, wonderful meat. Come here with a good appetite! Too bad they don't have one in SoCal. 
1658 3 The vegan pizza here is quite tasty (tons of veggies, just the right amount of daiya), though it could use a little more salt. Oh, $1 pints?! Awesome! It's neat they deliver to nearby parks too; that would be fun. 
1659 4 So easy to use and a good price. David was so pleasant to work with and his team of installers were in and out. This is where I received the best price and they made my life so much easier. 
1660 0 Food was two cliks north of terrible. Yrs, the drinks are strong but not well or artfully crafted. To top it off, it's expensive! Sixty bucks for a grocery store quality steak and Mac and cheese life you can get in a box. Disappointing. 
1661 0 This may have honestly been the worst meal I have ever had in my life. One positive comment is they heard the feedback and didn't charge for the entree. Great place to watch the game, but eat somewhere else. 
1662 4 Very reasonably priced furniture which looks really good. Some of the sleeper sofas even went as low as $700. The salesperson was very nice and helpful. 
1663 4 This place is definitely one of a kind. Food here has been delicious and they have a great system to alert the waiters. The only complaint would be how small the place is and the wait time could last an hour if your not in before the rush. 
1664 4 Absolutely awesome food! Visiting Orlando for a conference and found this small but big flavor place. 
1665 4 As a LA transplant in Atlanta, this place is the closest thing you'll find to a "hipster" bar with equal part hipster, dive and punk. Skinny jeans preferred. Food here is AWESOME. Try the Chicken and Brie. Tucked away in the corner of Wylie and Dekalb, under the graffiti tunnel 
1666 4 aldo our server was excellent. very attentive and on point. we came to celebrate my bestfriend birthday and she loved it Signed Renee Long 
1667 4 I had a great experience at Lifeline. They had the screen I needed for my Galaxy S6 in stock and I left with a phone good as new! Wonderful staff, highly recommended. 
1668 3 Went for the dine out menu, the best pig skin I've ever had, and the tuna appetizer was really fancy. The main courses were alright, nothing really impressive. Staffs were friendly and offered recommendations 
1669 2 Goat and chicken biryani is authentic. Prices are much higher than other paradise biryani or other Indian restaurant Service is ok. Chole bhature and kadai paneer were not great. Ambience of the restaurant is good. 
1670 3 Very good. Not sure why it was rated so low but we were here for our anniversary and had dinner her and at Hawks. Really enjoyed dinner but someone at our table ordered the Tuna steak and it was huge. Will definitely get the tuna next time. 
1671 4 Knute pumped our gas. He was quick, super friendly, washed my windshield and even got rid of the chunks of ice stuck on the bottom of the windshield. He went the extra mile. It was some of the best service I have ever received. Thanks, Knute! 
1672 1 Worst service. This is our second time here, with the same server. We waited over twenty minutes just for our drinks. The food took half an hour, and the order was wrong. And my tacos were cold. Our server didn't even apologize. Don't waste your time or money!!! 
1673 4 Great place! I showed up a day early by accident and they were very accommodating to my mistake and fit me into the schedule so I wouldn't have to book another time. Very friendly staff and great service! 
1674 4 Amazing ramen! Ordered Tonkotsu ramen with rich broth. The Takoyaki is also delicious 
1675 4 In a word, my review of this place is YUM! Super guilt free afternoon escape. Good froyo with lots of topping selections. Prices seemed about right. 
1676 4 Have been here on several occasions and this place is the real deal. Food is exceptional every time, service is fantastic and knowledgable. There may be a bit of a wait during prime time hours, but totally worth it. Great bloody marys. 
1677 2 good muffins but the coffee is a little weak for me. lots of people love it though. 
1678 4 I don't know how the cost compares because I don't do this frequently but was overall a great experience. Wifi. TV. Near by grocery store incase you forget detergent like me. Change machine. Rolling baskets. Best of all CLEAN. Great job! 
1679 4 I had a dress that needed to be tailored for a wedding that i was in. They did a great job in short notice! and cheaper than the bridal store tailor. I will return again and again. 
1680 2 It was pretty cool, but I really didn't see why it was so hyped up. Enjoyable, but would not go again. 
1681 4 The best services ! I have tried all the nail salon in the area this one by far one id the best! 
1682 4 Server was absolutely amazing tonight. Food and drink was amazing. Outshined our lousy shitty dinner at Bar Louie. 
1683 4 Service was prompt and nice which I really enjoyed. I ordered the regular fried chicken sandwich which was delicious and everything I could want in a chicken sandwich. The best part about it is that it didn't taste oily at all which I find most friend chicken does to me. 
1684 4 Great early morning coffee fix on way out of PDX. The gem was Colleen's amazing customer service. Waiting in line she greeted and served each customer as if they were the only person there. Unexpected top notch service early in an airport. Thanks for being awesome!! 
1685 4 Love this place. I always eat at the bar and everyone is so nice and food is great. Never fell bad about eating alone. Great place to go with friends are if you are eTing alone. 
1686 3 Ordered a burger and fries, very good! Fresh fries, yum! And the burger tasted great, fresh veggies. I enjoyed it! Drive thur took a lil more time than I wanted but i was still happy with my order 
1687 3 Tried this place for the first time and it was delicious! Natasha was excellent and knowledgeable on the menu, being my first time having ramen it was very helpful. Will definitely be coming back!! 
1688 4 I'm going in for my cleaning tomorrow & can't wait. Doc & his staff are the best. 
1689 2 Friendly staff and quick service. Recently stopped here for a quick bite and some coffee and was greeted by friendly employees. Coffee and breakfast sandwich we're the usual Dunkin tastes, only complaint was my sandwich looked like the employee was mad at my sandwich. 
1690 2 I had much higher expectations for the restaurant. The shakes were yummy but the burgers really fell short. I wrote a more detailed review on my blog http://zomgnom.tumblr.com/post/2422968316/flip-burger-1587-howell-mill-road 
1691 4 Best Breakfast ever ! Kudos to Karen and her family!! If I lived closer, would be here every weekend 
1692 4 Their crepes are so yummy!! I only go there for that reason only!! They have board games, pool tables but they are always being used by other people so I only go there to have a yummy dessert :) 
1693 4 Huge crowd, esp during the SXSW weekend. But the service is fast and the fried chicken is amazing. 
1694 4 The service tech gene was very knowledgeable and friendly. The repair was done quickly and well....we signed up for and annual contact and look forward to working with them in the future... 
1695 2 The food was good. The service was sub par. If you walk in and the hostess is staring at a computer without greeting you for a while, there's something wrong. 
1696 2 Soup was too sweet, too much msg, and not hot enough to cook the rare beef. Spacious but dark. A bit pricier than other pho places. I think around $7-9/bowl. They only have small or large sizes, not medium. 
1697 4 One of the reasons I miss Boston with a passion. Rain or snow, I used to get to work on time every morning thanks to the Red Line. Used to get on MIT and get off at Park St. My life revolved around the Red :) 
1698 1 Too bro for the east side in my opinion. Big screens with sports and cheesy pop country music. Not to mention overpriced beers. The roof view is nice, but the music, prices and touristy pretentious vibe kind of killed it for us. Just didn't feel like Austin, more like Dallas. 
1699 4 Absolutely coming back! Cleaned my nails squeaky clean and went really natural on my nails because giving them a short break from acrylics but definitely can't wait to get my nails done again here! 
1700 3 This place is super convenient for me because it's literally my next door neighbor! It's your typical Thai place and the food tastes pretty great and authentic. Their pad thai is my fave here. So if you live near the area, I recommend this place as your "go-to" Thai restaurant 
1701 4 Great family restaurant with a playground and tasty food. We go to this restaurant as one of our staples. They generally have a consistent service and food. The restrooms have a changing table and are clean, and they have ample seating. 
1702 3 It's like having a friend who loves to make soup and sandwiches and keeps her fridge stocked with luscious goodies and who invites you over for a meal every week. You go. You always go. Just like Brown Bag. You can't help yourself, and shouldn't. Just go and enjoy. 
1703 4 A dozen donuts from this place is the Male equivalent of a Blue Tiffany's Box. Definitely a very eclectic donut selection. The whole family enjoyed the sampling of every donut in the box. My favorites were the Mexican chocolate and the old fashioned. It was a taste explosion. 
1704 4 I loved it, the guide Tony was awesome, explained everything with great detail. The chocolate figures were awesome. Great tour, highly recommend. 
1705 4 Got the Todd's shawarma special and everything was amazing. The eggplant was so soft and flavorful, chicken shawarma very moist and even the little salad delish. 
1706 0 Unknown object in the food. I ordered their small eel clay pot. Use my spoon to flip the rice and found something like hair. 
1707 0 The service from the cashier was by far the rudest I have had in Florida. The bacon cheese burger is the absolute worst burger I have ever eaten. McDonald's even rates higher. The only positive thing is that the Milkshake was good. 
1708 3 Eggplant parm is great. Buffalo tenders are pretty good and huge. Pizza is really good. Service is awesome almost every time. Great quality and service at an affordable price. Atmosphere is almost like eating at home. 
1709 1 Trivia nights are cool but other than that this place is, yet again, an over priced over pretentious bar. $13 just to walk through the door and $7.50 pints. This place was in it's prime before the Dummy Donnelly group took it over. Get over yourself, Lamplighter. 
1710 0 Nash was rude and nasty and messed up 3 orders. She seemed like she was on some sort of drug. Possibly crack cocaine. Not pleased. 
1711 4 We came as part of Groupon deal. I wasn't sure if I'm going to like - but the result was amazing. The food was great. We ordered the udon and lo mein - just regular menu items with chicken. It was delicious and a loooot. 
1712 3 This store is fantastic. Excellent variety of spices for a great deal, lots of exotic tea flavors, and they make amazing chicken curry! You can't find this stuff at a regular grocery store. 
1713 4 Awesome meat market! I can always find what I need and the staff is super helpful! 
1714 4 Just the best. Finest ingredients, great service, great decor, a must stop for s higher end breakfast. Oh. And they have decadent waffles. 
1715 3 I really enjoyed the rolls and share plates. In particular, the Rainbow and the Boston rolls were very tasty. The sashimi was lovely and fresh. Good drink promotions to make a Saturday evening more interesting. Overall, good value for money! 
1716 3 Nice place. Clean and new. Very trendy location and provides a student discount. We enjoyed the white open interior. It felt a lot like a glamorous ikea! Lol we were on a time crunch but they got us out on time. Overall a nice place! 
1717 4 F&W pest control was a great experience, even when dealing with carpenter ants! They came out the same day we called and was significantly more affordable than the national company we called! 
1718 4 Best seafood in the area. All of their menu items were delicious. If you are looking for good southern comfort food. Look no further. This place delivered every time! Keep up the good work 
1719 3 There is always a wait here, but it is worth it. Especially if you can get a seat outside in the fall/spring. I love the sandwiches here, so many options and they are all super fresh and filling. A great (somewhat) healthier alternative around the commons. 
1720 2 It was good. The burgers were really good and the service friendly for Boston area. A lot of fans coming looking for the stars of the family. I just hope they stick to good food and don't turn it into Planet Hollywood or anything like that. 
1721 4 Made us feel like vip's! Had a friend from out of town out with for the night. Security guys chatted him up, let us right in, great music, pretty crowd, and we had a ****ing blast! Definitely going back. 
1722 3 Unbelievable pizza and sandwiches. Great location -- within walking distance to Commuter Rail, Pickering Wharf and touristy stuff. Pretty cheap too. Stay away from the barbeque sauce fries. I know, right? 
1723 4 Great beer, fantastic food and wonderful service. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and would recommend this spot to everyone. The flight was an impressive 13 tasters! 
1724 1 Extremely average experience. I ordered the gnocchi and it was extremely bland. Even the soda was flat. Definitely not worth the price ($20-$30). 
1725 4 Great quiet place to eat a delicious breakfast. Has a great feeling of home. 
1726 4 My absolute favorite coffee shop in Atlanta! Great coffee, friendly staff, Little Tart's baked goods are to die for, and a dog friendly patio! Parking is definitely hard as 6ft Under has tons of spots reserved but there are plenty of side streets so no stress. 
1727 3 One of the best sushi values in town. Our current favourites include stone rice bowl, crispy calamari roll and yellow town roll. giant sashimi portions as well :) 
1728 3 Excellent lunch for food court food. Diablo chicken had fresh veggies with it. A nice break from fries and sandwich. Big portions. 
1729 4 Wonderful kind service, a classy atmosphere, and delicious food. Good for visiting alone, on a date, or with a group. I'll definitely be back. 
1730 4 The food was delicious. Anything with beef/brisket is a must! The chips and queso has guacamole and pico de gallo on top which was amazing (and only $4) Also, the passion fruit margarita was the best margarita I've ever had. Great food. Great service. 
1731 4 Amazing food! It's a little pricey than other food trucks but I don't mind paying a little more because it's always hot, fresh, and delicious! The gyro wrap is HUGE and stuffed! The owners are always so nice & welcoming 
1732 2 lots of beer...as a matter of fact 289 on tap and 180 in bottles. we had chicken wings with death sauce... it is not as scary as it sounds. the kenmore wasn't bad either. this place packed up fast even on a tuesday night. lots of HD tv's. 
1733 3 5 stars for the drink menu variety (fun, fruity, many to choose from) 5 stars for the outdoor seating (lots of it!) 3 stars for the food. It was good but not spectacular considering how there are so many great places to eat in the South End 
1734 0 Wanted to like it, just couldn't. Seafood tasted frozen and freezer burnt - nothing was even edible. We left hungry and ate elsewhere. 
1735 4 Excellent service, personable staff and thorough service without unnecessary up selling. Keep leading the way! 
1736 1 Tooooo many flys in the bar!!! Food, mehhh. The place is pretty dirty. Disappointed but our waiter was really nice 
1737 4 Kendall Square is always a very busy place. Located in Kendall there's GOOGLE FACEBOOK AMAZON and several more offices for huge companies. Its location near mit is wonderful. GREAT restaurants in Kendall Square as well 
1738 1 Store was clean enough. Food was ok. The girl at the front counter taking our order was pretty disgusting. While taking our order she was putting her fingers in her mouth and digging out junk from her tongue ring. Eww! Whats wrong with people?!?! 
1739 3 Small place with a great selection. Sushi was well prepared and presentation was pretty cool. We ordered the sushi boat and loved every part of it! 
1740 4 I'm not a big burger person....but I absolutely LOVE hopdoddy's. Their ahi tuna burger, truffle fries, and nutella shake is my go-to. 
1741 4 great food, great service! overall a wonderful experience! The colleague I was with raved about the restaurant and can't wait to take her family when she returns! 
1742 4 I have been very pleased with PJP! They are professional, friendly, and very thorough! I highly recommend them for cleaning services. 
1743 3 Enjoyed the Hibachi for a quick lunch while in town. Chef and service was great and the food was cooked to order...no complaints. Better than any the Hibachi restaurants here in Dayton. Very clean which is a plus in my books! 
1744 4 Amazing staff. More then a million percent satisfied. Was on my way to a fellow veterans funeral and was helped beyond compare to any other florist I have ever been to. Thank you staff for your kind words and heart. Totally recommend it to anyone will visit in future. 
1745 4 It is a great place to take the kids. I love the atmosphere, and the gluten free and cider options. 
1746 4 I love this place! Great place for breakfast, for studying, or for meeting up for coffee dates with friends. And they have some of the best coffee in the city! 
1747 2 Food was decent though inconsistent. The service was totally disorganized. Main dishes arrived 10 minutes apart. My drink wasn't served until we were almost done eating and the bill had two overcharges. 
1748 4 Super fun park! Little track behind a pump track so there's something for everyone. There's also a dog park right next to it. We had a great time here! 
1749 4 My husband gets his shirts cleaned here weekly. The husband and wife team is so pleasant and sweet. Besides their qualified service, they always have a smile on their face which shows their true character. 
1750 1 Couldn't get over the offensive SMELL! Cool gym but disgustingly stinky. Had to cut my workout short. 
1751 3 Great restaurant in Portland, Alberta Arts District. Cool neighborhood and shops. We shared two dishes as seen in the photos. Both excellent! 
1752 4 I love this place!! The syrup is on point. The waffles are delicious and the bacon --- I want to know where they buy that bacon. It's sooooo good. Highly recommend! 
1753 0 Worst possible experience in my last year!!! Park staff was rude and I couldn't even get on one ride. Park was over packed for this "Special 20 Year Anniversary" promotion. I wasted $60.00 to burn my ass off in the hot sun!!!! Never again!!! 
1754 3 Great new addition to town. Spicy dumpling were to die for. Wonton soup was awesome on a cold day. Fried rice was a little bland. Coming back soon, maybe tomorrow 
1755 4 Had a great lunch. Asian Chicken Salad. Fresh and tasty. Great service, sat at the bar. 
1756 4 Delicious! Had the classic burger- plain and simple. I'm pretty certain it was the best hamburger I've ever eaten. They have a great drink menu- I had the Sangrita. They also have several draft beers to choose from. Can't wait to go back and be a little more adventurous! 
1757 3 Surprise happiness. Funky and interesting neighborhood. Plenty of street parking. Good vibe inside. Very tasty coffee drinks and friendly, warm, accommodating staffers. The food looks great, though I didn't try it yet. I'll be back! 
1758 3 Fun hibachi style. Long wait though even with a reservation. Food was excellent. Pricing a bit high. Would recommend if you're not in a hurry. 
1759 4 Most improv theaters are usually hit or miss. EXCEPT at Dad's Garage. 11 out of 10 times it's a hit here. Love these guys. Smart. Witty. Funny. Best improvisers in town by far. Great scripted shows, too. Treat yourself and go see these guys! Guaranteed you'll laugh. 
1760 4 Greek salad with romaine lettuce and grilled chicken breast. Comes with homemade bread. This is all the info you need.... You're welcome. 
1761 4 It felt like wonderland! The place is amaizing,the staff is incredible and the costumer service was far beyond excellence! I highly recommend it and I certainly will go back again without a doubt! 
1762 4 Amazing BBQ, happy hour menu and drinks. Their brunch menu on the board definitely on my list to try. Super friendly service as well. 
1763 3 Stumbled upon Posto while visiting a friend in Somerville. Surprised at how delicious the food was! The short ribs were so good that I dreamt of it for days! Even tried making it at home but it just wasn't the same! True hidden gem! 
1764 0 Been here for hour and a half and still waiting to get in for appointment that is over an hour past schedule if you go here def make time. Horrible. Not 1 good thing to say at this point. 
1765 4 Good food and huge portions. Great vibe and view. Service was a little slow, but it was holiday morning so no worries. 
1766 3 Tried a "coffee soda" for the first time today - delicious. Espresso, seltzer, and simple syrup. Who knew? Going to have to check out the movie night here on Mondays! 
1767 4 Chicken enchiladas are bomb. Management staff was very accommodating. Staff was attentive and not overly so. Felt warm and welcome during our visit. 
1768 1 Made a quick stop at Jack on my way home. Ordered a large meal and light sauce on my sandwich, when I get home my sandwich has mayo and ketchup coming out of everywhere and my LARGE FRY seems to be a small in a large container. So disappointed 
1769 0 Second time I got food poisoning from this place. It tasted great going down but the 4 times vomited last night was a horrible suprise I'm done. 
1770 2 Pizza was pretty good but we ordered one pizza for delivery and with tip was over $40. Best bet buy the slices 
1771 1 I was expecting much more from the Orlando location. San Diego and San Antonio are much better. There isn't a whole lot on the way of rides and show variety here. It seems very small. They could have done a lot better with this place. 
1772 0 Worst experience ever! Completely disorganized farm. Haunted maze time tickets that were purchased were not honored. Ran out of a lot of food. Long lines due to disorganization. Avoid at all costs. 
1773 3 Waitress was funny and engaging and helpful. Recommended the curry seafood dish which was delicious. A really wonderful dish and a lovely authentic feeling restaurant in the middle of Animal Kingdom. 
1774 4 Stephen was punctual, professional, and did a great job explaining the who, what, when, and why. Looking forward to working further with Reliant. 
1775 4 Great brunch. (It's also our go-to for dinner with visiting guests). Love the atmosphere. What's better than a place the does off cuts well, changes up the menu in fun ways, and has killer apps? 
1776 0 We wanted hot coffe and they did not heat the milk. They had a very bad attitude and did not let us sit inside. Never coming back there that's for sure. 
1777 2 Food is pretty good, but no one EVER answers the telephone when you want to call in an order !!! I finally went in to order take out....I stand there, no one asks if I need help. 
1778 4 One of my goto locations for lunch or dinner. The staff is great and the food is always good and fresh. If your there at dinner then get the golden baskets 
1779 4 Continually good visits at this location, when this first opened and for quite a while after, not so good. I am pleased to say every time I've been in recently has been great ! 
1780 3 It's a good place for a quick decent sub and the usual suspects of fries, rings and other sandwich shop stuff, but I like my pizza with a thin crust. 
1781 3 HAVE AGAIN: very good blue cheese. The turkey sandwich was good, but the zucchini & manchego cheese sandwich is the one to get. 
1782 4 We stayed in a king suite and were absolutely floored by the excellent service and decor! Our room came with a beautiful soaking tub and a lovely, four-poster bed. It's located in a popular, nice shopping area and is right next to a Nordstrom. 
1783 4 Consistently my favorite place in Vancouver for breakfast. The prices are great and the portions are intense. Always busy, but never the ridiculous waits you get for popular breakfast places in Portland. 
1784 4 I've been living around here for a long time and had not tried this place. Recently tried it and was surprised it was Great place for Asian food, I wish I had tried it years ago. Place Is comfortable food is great. Great buffet choices and prices. 
1785 4 Amazing noodles and great service!!! Believe the hype!! Visited from CA and Yelpers were dead on. Even though they sold out of the chicken wings the pork was tasty and noodles were the best I had in Portland!!! 
1786 4 Just got my surgery yesterday and now have 20/15 vision and close to 20/10. Surgery was yesterday and I went on a 5 mike run this morning. No pain, no hassle and the results are flawless this far. Prices are competitive. Couldn't be happier. 
1787 2 pretty good but i would personally go to red robin or somewhere else before here. it just isn't as amazing as everyone thinks it is. 
1788 4 I love this place, great atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing stylists! Love my girl, Melody! She is super good! Color and cut always looks amazing! 
1789 1 Ok, I only ate in the bar but.... My server got mescuto confused with presecco. Service was very unpersonable the crab and sprimp spring rolls were greasy and did not mat h the description on the menu. This place is for tourists with no culinary awareness. 
1790 3 Tap selection is local and great. We were hoping to get sushi for lunch and did not realize that it wasn't available until after 4pm so that was a bummer. 
1791 4 Mitch is very bright and spent lots of time with me. Gave practical advice about my color which looks natural and beautiful. Cut and blow out also look great! 
1792 2 Very convenient, decent food and drinks, but nothing stand-out. Is a godsend when during snowstorms when you're stuck in the hills of Garden Home and have run out of alcohol at home! 
1793 3 Pretty good Mexican food for not bad prices, the fajitas have great flavour and spice along with the chips and salsa, quesadillas, fries and so on. Anyone looking for good Mexican food in the area I'd suggest a visit. 
1794 4 This place is phenomenal i dont know why there are so many bad reviews. Granted, i have never been here but i love daddy's dogs!!!!!!! 
1795 4 Great restaurant. Very delicious and the pie look really cute. It's only $5 for a person. 
1796 0 This is the slowest Starbucks EVER! 15 min on multiple occasions for a latte at 6am when its minimally busy. Training is seriously needed here! 
1797 3 Hanging out at Browns getting drunk with my buddy. Oh yeah the have good food too. Guineas is $8 but served cold so definitely a North American establishment. I do remember getting massively wasted on their Shooter deal so check those out too. 
1798 4 I had a wonderful experience with Cristy Bonilla. It was an incredibly relaxing experience during the wash and blowout and the way my hair looked was icing on the cake! Her head massage is wonderful and she takes great care to style exactly how you want it. 
1799 0 Horrible. The new menu is limited with many of best items gone. No longer sourcing their meats from reputable local vendors. Prices went up, portions down. Had we gone any later the chicken i had would have been jerky. Never again. 
1800 4 Maggie is incredible! She heard everything that I wanted and gave me perfect choices to accommodate my bridesmaids and complete the wedding style. She was warm and outgoing throughout the whole process. Very grateful! 
1801 2 Great cut. They have different levels of care, from a basic cut to wash, massage, etc. Service is always good, the full-bore deal is expensive but worth it, and they do a free neck trim in between visits. 
1802 1 Twice I have attempted to eat at this place. The service is atrocious. The non existent hostess or host would definitely help this hole. But service is subpar in Atlanta, so I shouldn't be to hard on these guys. 
1803 2 MuLan is pretty good and really cheap. Everything seems pretty fresh (no greasy MSG). All the Chinese people I work with go here for lunch. Its a good Chinese take out option. 
1804 4 It's all about the lunch buffet. 9 hot dishes with both meat and veg entrees, 2 soups, 2 teas, 1 breads, lots of salad and fruit and pickles, rice. Oh my. 
1805 4 My husband and I split a lobster roll, clam chowder in a bread bowl, and lobster bisque. We were very surprised to get such amazing food at a food court in a shopping center. Seriously amazing! 
1806 0 Poor service, bartender(manager) of that's what you want to call her proceeded to try to scold me because we we're upset that we had waited 30 minutes to get our checks. Very rude and the worst experience in Boston to date.. Food was mediocre by the way 
1807 2 Food is just Ok. Not worth considering this if you have other options. 
1808 4 Stopped in for lunch. The best pizza I ever had! Fresh and light. Had the Ryans special. Amazing. Great service. Definitely will go back when we are back in town! 
1809 0 They don't have any sugar free flavors. They don't have any Equal. Kind of dissapointing. It's like all the coffee houses on this part of town are identical. 
1810 4 Yelp steered us right. We used them for a move-out clean. Very thorough job, reasonably priced... thrilled with the service, and will use them again. 
1811 3 Nice Americanized Chinese on Buford Highway that delivers! The spicy Hunan shrimp was really good, and delivery was quick. Will definitely go in to the restaurant for the lunch special. 
1812 4 Awsome diner fresh food the chicken and waffles were the best there apecial sauce to die for the chicken salad was fresh and chunky The onion rings were great with a nice onion flavor the raspberry kam with the monte cristo was awsome 
1813 3 Arguably the best late night pizza in Vancouver. Not the cheapest slice, but their signature slightly burnt extra-thin crust is always a delicious alternative to the soft and soggy options that most other pizza joints have to offer in the wee hours. Highly recommend! 
1814 4 Had Luke out last week to clean all of our indoor windows. Great work, will recommend him to anyone looking for the same! 
1815 4 Good service, good selections. Stopped in to grab some knee pads. had lots in stock and helpful advice on brands etc. 
1816 4 This is my favorite restaurant in Boulder. Great covered outdoor seating or classy indoor seating. The highlight is their tapas menu with amazing dates, fresh bruschetta, and bacon-wrapped shrimp. Consistent food quality and service in a neighborly location. 
1817 2 Came here for breakfast because the line somewhere else was too long. Pleasantly surprised with both the French toast and the crab cake Benedict. Most places can't get the eggs right with the Benedict but the yolks were perfect. French toast was fluffy and creamy. 
1818 2 It's a really cool place nice terrace and the food is good. Unfortunately I was expecting more. I had the clam chowder and a crab sandwich and didn't love it. 
1819 3 The brisket and pork ribs at Terry Black's rival that of its sister restaurant Black's, and the mac and cheese is dreamy. Grab a booth, and enjoy a nice view of downtown Austin. 
1820 3 Nine months after moving to Winthrop, we finally made it to Santarpio's. Love the sauce, like the crust. I was surprised to see this is actually a sit-down place with table service. Our waiter was excellent. We got here just before noon on a Saturday and walked right in. 
1821 4 Delicious drinks and a chill environment. My personal favorite is the red bean avocado with boba. On top of the drinks, they have a fun assortment of arcadr machines that provide lots of fun while you wait for your order to be made. 
1822 0 Flight was cancelled and they sent us to this hotel. One staff member on duty and waited over an hour in line to get our room! Very disgusted at the service here and would never recommend or stay at any Doubletree again! 
1823 4 We have used Dependable fior years. They are definitely as advertised-always arrive on time and provide great service to and from Logan. Drivers are extremely courteous and polite. Highly recommend! 
1824 4 We love eZ freeze The staff are all friendly and there's always a good mix of favors and tons of fresh toppings 
1825 4 This place is really good. Good beer and amazing good. Amazing flights as well for the big selection of beer. The happy hour menu is amazing and the quality of food is probably one of the best in this few blocks area. A must visit in my opinion. 
1826 4 El Porto is my new favorite restaurant in Malden. The food was great and the service was even better! The mariachi band was a plus! 
1827 2 The food would be so much better if it wasn't so spicy. My husband and I live nearby and LOVE Thai food but every time we get our favorites (pad see ew and green curry) they are unbearably spicy. And we like spicy food. Tone down the heat please! 
1828 3 Ate here twice while in Portland. Reliably good, hearty breakfast food. Lovely chorizo sausage and they were very cool with me ordering a bunch of sides, which sometimes annoys people. Great staff, who offered menu recommendations, good coffee and attentive service. 
1829 0 So far me and my 4 friends have been sitting out back for 20 mins without any service... terrible first impression. Went to the bar and was told "someone would be sent over to serve you" apparently his name is Billy... where are you Billy? I'm thirsty and hungry! 
1830 3 Prices are good and staff seems knowledgable. They always walk me through the issues on the car. Waiting area is not that great, but I would rather pay less than finance a fancy lobby. 
1831 4 Had the espresso flake in a cone and it was so true to its name and made from local coffee and house made chips. Elegant and complimentary flavours and textures. In love! 
1832 2 Feels like you're walking into an oven! It's always super hot in there. As for the washrooms cleanliness I'd advise using the restrooms elsewhere before you go in. However the drinks are not too bad. 
1833 4 This was such a beautiful garden with wonderful trails and walking paths. It rained while we were there (imagine, coming from Seattle we brought the rain!) and it didn't stop us from enjoying the beauty. Wonderful cactus garden, Japanese gardens, rose gardens, etc. Truly magical. 
1834 4 If you find yourself in Vancouver looking for a brunch spot, this is the place. No hesitation. No second guessing. Everything we had was amazing, banging with flavor. Just do it. 
1835 4 Great for a photo shoot. Did senior pics here and it was perf. 
1836 4 Waitress was incredibly attentive and nice, food came within 5 minutes, and food was unbelievably good. Friend and I got burritos - rich, flavorful, and FILLING 
1837 4 Cool hotel, and right next to MIT as well as a T station. Nice lobby for a cookie cutter chain hotel, and the room was on the small side but really comfortable. 
1838 1 Ate in and ordered lasagna a few times, which was accompanied by garlic knots. Went in today for take out, came home to discover the garlic knots were not included. To make things worse, the lasagna wasn't fully warned/heated to the center. Disappointing. 
1839 4 French toast is awesome!!!! They're juices taste so fresh and delicious. The hashbrowns are not the typical frozen one they are actually made from scratch. The owners and super sweet and friendly. 
1840 0 Services are good but they do not know how to deal with worker's compensation properly. And they flat out refused to work with my nurse who was trying to get them paid. 
1841 3 In here for dinner tonight. Had the Coast salad and some house white which was sweeter than I'd typically go for, hence 4 stars rather than 5. Food was delicious, especially the addition of grilled prawns. Service was lovely and friendly. Would eat here again. 
1842 0 Why does this McDonald's drive- thru take forever EVERYTIME NEVER FAILS I would never recommend coming to this McDonald's What is going on in there? 
1843 4 I have been in this salon for few times and definitely I will be back here because of the staffs, they're very kind and gentle. This is my favorite salon ever 
1844 4 Wonderful little tea place. Typically pretty busy too. The bartistas are talented and friendly. Try their spicy green chai...yummmm. Lots of regulars who keep coming back because it's cozy and in a great location. I miss my (nearly) daily visits there. =) 
1845 3 I wasn't expecting much in the tour but it ended up being very entertaining and informative. It lasted about 50 minutes and included a chocolate tasting. The tour guide was engaging and the information was bizarre. Look for coupons or it's $18 per person. 
1846 2 Fun, exciting beauty products. The prices, however, are not fun. $25 gift cards are not entirely applicable, because it's difficult to buy anything under $30! 
1847 3 My first visit was on last night. I loved it! Service was good. It was crowded but we were seated in a fair amount of time. I will definitely return! 
1848 3 Perfectly fine airport hotel. Regular Bus to and from airport. No restaurant inside but a couple across the street (and liquor store open till 11). Exceptional breakfast in quality and quantity. 
1849 3 Just went.... great place... try it!!!! Looks pretty new and great "50s" bathrooms.. Don't be worried, the hamburger rolls are not really a sweet dough-not. We all liked it. 
1850 3 Went to our third show here this weekend and really like the venue and the quality of the shows. Got last minute tickets this time and even their 'worst' seats are pretty darn good. Seats have enough room and are cushy. 
1851 0 never open when i'm not at work. can't reset password online. impossible to self-manage account/transponders. just total suckage. 
1852 2 Since this Panera Bread is located in front of Porter Sq, it always has clients inside. Regular menu, stuff is rather good. The food is always of the same quality. My favorite is "pick 2": broccoli cheddar and salad. I am not a fan of their pastries. 
1853 3 Solid new steakhouse in Atlanta. The filet was phenomenal, lobster tail well above average and the remainder of the dinner very good. Overall experience was very positive with great service, great drinks, great steak and an overall great experience. Highly recommended for a new steak house. 
1854 3 They got a wide variety of fabrics, from cotton prints(a huge lot!!) to colorful felt, from sheer silk to warm wool - they really got a lot. And they categorize everything very neatly, so it's very easy to browse through. And yes their price is very fair. 
1855 3 This is a great local place for Thai food. The staff is very nice and friendly. The restaurant is very clean and food is good with a large selection. The menu also notes what is considered gluten free. 
1856 4 Like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, people may talk about better food, but such a thing doesn't really exist. Hands down the best food in Florida. 
1857 4 Great experience at the FastMed Clinic in Kyle. I was a walk-in and was seen very quickly. The front staff was very responsive and professional. The doctor/EMT was also friendly and professional. Joe, John and Adam are to be commended for great service. I would definitely recommend for emergency/after-hours care. 
1858 4 I went in at 6pm with a tattoo that embarrassed me because of the bad coloring job of an artist at another shop. Walked out at 6:50pm with an awesome recolor job from Brian and a smile on my face. Will definitely come back for another job. 
1859 4 Their regular burger is one of the best in Austin, meat or meatless, hands down. Their burgers of the week, fries, and shakes are so good too. As someone who isn't vegan or vegetarian, this is still one of my favorite burger places in Austin. 
1860 4 The only thing better than the food is the service. The couple who runs the place are super nice, checking every detail. The lamb in the gyros have nothing to do with the taste of those commercial places. We are gonna go back for sure. 
1861 3 Sometimes good sometimes fair. Lately they have have been right on. Old fashion style Chinese style. 
1862 4 This is more than just a taco truck, It has authentic Mexican food like tlacoyos and a great selection of Mexico City style tacos. The barbacoa on the weekends is finger licking good. Highly recommend this place, affordable, traditional, different and delicious 
1863 2 Super long waits, super noisy place, great for take out and drinks are good quality. Super cheap. 
1864 4 Great food! I always get the Seaweed Kale Wrawp and black love stew, but everything here is great! It sometimes take 15-20 min for them to make the food, but it's always worth it! I highly highly recommend this place! 
1865 3 Much improved service. Probably the best in years. Current manager seems to be on top of things. Takes charge, handling the lunch time orders himself. Someone even cleared my table. Happy because the service here used to be so inconsistent. 
1866 3 Came here on a Sunday to grab a few drinks they have good music, yummy margaritas and they Close late ! Although it was chaotic our server was really attentive and made sure we were happy 
1867 3 Excellent brunch place, I had the Benny duo. The caprese Benny was delicious, the heirloom tomatoes were perfect. The Bella Bella was kissing something, but overall it was great. Would recommend for the people that love brunch!! 
1868 0 Sign flashing open. Advertised open till 11 pm. @ 10:02 pm met at the front door with a sorry we are closed sorry we won't be back. 
1869 4 We stopped in for lunch based on the previous reviews and so happy we did. The food was excellent and the service was even better. 
1870 4 Great service! Very helpful staff, recommend to any one in the area who needs expert alterations! 
1871 3 We hit cravings after the Duck Walk and continued our enjoyable evening here. Creamy ice cream. Customers and booths gave off the friendly neighborhood feel. The service, well, left much to be desired, but hey, surly teenagers are part of the summer ice cream experience. 
1872 4 Best sushi in Austin! Just missing the live music!!! 
1873 4 The dishes here look so beautiful and taste very nice. I strongly recommend seafood curd. It contains a lot of seafood and Chinese vegetables. 
1874 4 Peaceful facility. Great reception staff. Very good massage therapist....I could become a regular. 
1875 3 I appreciate that I was treated like a queen and walked out with the best haircut I've had - Natalie is wonderful and gave me exactly what I asked for, a cut that was sassy, smart and still feminine. 
1876 4 Hands down, best fish tacos I've ever had. Their veggie taco is not to be ignored either, lest you hate delicious food. I never miss a chance to go here when I'm in Austin. 
1877 0 The food is very American, not authentic at all. The soup was too sweet. I ordered the kimchi fried rice, and there were more American sausages than kimchi. The environment is too loud as well. Overall, extremely disappointed. 
1878 3 I LOVE GARLIC and that gives Shwarma king 4 stars. Great wraps, plates and desserts. I always go with a chicken shwarma wrap and cocktail juice (homemade!). The falafel is better at Rami's but the chicken shwarma is mUCH better here. Oh don't forget the cucumber and mint yogurt...mmmhmm. 
1879 4 I've been a client for almost 2 months now. I am in love. The staff is uber friendly. Excellent team and coaches!! 
1880 3 Came here today with family. I had a latte which was very thick and warm on the rainy afternoon. I had an almond croissant which was delicious. I shared the pistachio sour cherry with friend and taste was gorgeous!! Nice decor and service. It was very busy though! 
1881 2 Great location for hot pot. Great people working there. My first visit there was amazing. The hot pot itself was really well presented but it is a set menu with add-ons of course. Great price. 
1882 4 Some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. The menu is not too long which means they are really great at their select items. The nachos are so yummy. And the street corn is a must. Try it all! Highly recommend. 
1883 3 We love this place. It's intimate, unassuming, and cozy. The service always welcoming. The wine selection is wonderful. They have a few good food items which are also very good. One of my favorite little spots in Vancouver. 
1884 2 This was among the Indian restaurants I first tried. It's passable, and had a good buffet, from what I recall, but didn't make it to the top in my book. 
1885 3 Went here during a busy time so the wait was a little long but once we sat down and ordered the food it was great. They have breakfast/brunch and lunch items. I loved how everything was homemade (even the ketchup), and was fresh. 
1886 1 If you like Greek food, this is not the place to get it. I'm sorry, Al. It won't happen again. 
1887 1 Yuk! What happened? Cinnabon is consistent everywhere else. The only thing consistent is the presentation and that lovely smell when you walk in. But the under-buttered taste of this doughy tasteless mass is not worth your $5 bucks. Go elsewhere. I promise you'll be disappointed. 
1888 0 The worst customer service possible. Placed order. Told 1 1/2 hr. Ok. Now at 2 hrs. Been to store they just say its coming. BS. Should have just said it was impacted by Harvy,irma etc. we are 3/4 mile from store. 
1889 4 I love this chicken sandwich place! I have eaten here three times now and have consistently gotten a great fried chicken sandwich. The wait staff are very friendly and very quick getting my order ready. I will be back 
1890 4 This was one of the best meals I've had in recent memory. The ambiance was comfortable, the food was delicious, the cocktails were boozy and refreshing. I'll be back many times. The sharing plates were a fun way to try lots of stuff. Loved it. 
1891 3 Tiny place, decent selection of food, reasonable prices. Nice portions, tasty food. Kind of a small dinky place, but I found it was good food and good service. 
1892 4 The acoustic guitar soundtrack, the textures and mix of flavors in the Jambalaya, the shrimp basket---even the filtered tap water and the ice tea were magnificent. So was your wait staffer, Dee- a very efficient, friendly, knowledgeable server. Thanks for a great lunchtime dining experience- out first in Mount Dora! 
1893 4 I've been to The Fishwife a few times and I absolutely love it! It's one of my favorite places to eat in Portland. The people are friendly, the price is decent, and the food is fantastic. 
1894 3 Not your typical Mexican restaurant. I would say more Mexican inspired. I had the Adobo chicken. It was good, not great. Service is a little slow. 
1895 4 I have never walked in, but my bank statement shows that I buy plenty. Love the quick turnaround. Twice I have rec'd an email stating that they did not have what I had ordered and twice they have thrown in a little extra for the trouble. Highly recommend. 
1896 2 good spot to meet up with people and have a few drinks pre-going out. nothing spectacular but nice place to gather. 
1897 2 Salon in Richmond BC. Close to Price Smart grocer. Hair, nails, threading, etc. Had a manicure and pedicure. 90 minutes. Friendly staff. 
1898 1 The setting is perfectly adequate, and the food comes close. The dining chains like Chilis and Victoria Station do barbecue better. It's no surprise you can always pick up coupons for Linwood at restaurant.com. 
1899 4 I freaking love this place. Everything on the menu is excellent and they stay open late. Great way to end the night. China Cooks Rock 
1900 3 The food was uneven. Some things were great like the smoke cobia. The hen of the woods mushrooms were cooked perfectly in the black grouper main course; the fish itself was good, but not special. The Pork Porterhouse (their specialty) was dry and tough. 
1901 2 Typical Portland hipster bitch server. Good beer list and great environment. 
1902 4 They open til 12am!!!! And delivery! The food is always good !!! The ladie taking my order is awesome and patient !!! Thumbs up!!! 
1903 4 What a wonderful surprise. We wandered in not knowing what to expect. Such a great meal! The chicken kubideh, the first I've ever tried, was sensational. First rate service, too, from a gracious waiter who took care to explain the menu. We'll be back. 
1904 3 Panlasang Pinoy! I bring my family and friends in this joint everytime they come to visit me. 
1905 0 To bad no one came to our table for 20 mins. Would have like to try the place out. Nice location but NO SERVICE. Food might be good but wait staff makes you wait. Boooo 
1906 4 Came here for last minute lingerie for a bachelorette party. Lots of kinds to choose from and the store itself is very neat and clean. Doesn't have that sketchy feel at all. Prices are affordable and they have product for all tastes. Great customer service and location. 
1907 3 Dr. Rozina worked on my young child after a car accident. She was quick and professional, and had a range of devices she could use for micro-adjustments for children. I would recommend her to any families. 
1908 3 I love this spot! Service is awesome,the avocado margaritas are amazing but pricey. I really enjoy the salsa but the chips could be better. BREAKAST PLATES FTW!!! 
1909 2 irish pub meets retro sports bar... food's not too bad either. its always been pleasantly crowded (week days and weekends) when i've gone - but not so crowded you're waiting outside. 
1910 4 The best Taco's in Atlanta!! Their Beef Brisket and Buffalo tacos are to die for! I love the food, the staff, and the vibe here. Gonna go back again today! 
1911 0 Omg...this was recommended to us by someone who lives in the area. The food was good, can't argue that....but a day later....every...single...one of us had horrible diarrhea. There will be no "next time." 
1912 4 LOVE this coffee shop! The girls are so cute and nice, very fun vibe when you walk in or drive up. Their coffee is delicious and their breakfast sandwiches are packed with flavor, LOVE them all such a nice addition to the neighborhood and a great change from Starbucks. 
1913 4 They do a great job with the inside and outside of my vehicles every time. Once they are fine they let you inspect the vehicle just to make sure nothing needs to be touched up. 
1914 3 Same menu/owner as Umaidos in Suwanee. I went during their soft opening and the service was very good. I had the Tonkatsu ramen and it was very good, just like the one from Umaido's. They don't have the liquor license yet but I was told that we could BYOB. 
1915 4 This tea is fantastic! I get a couple of bottles at the Bee Cave Farmers Market every Sunday and it never last until the next day. The Blueberry is my favourite and makes a great mixer with a little Deep Eddy. :) 
1916 2 It's hard to get an appointment here (they will rarely do same day appointments) but they are generally fair and the shop is close to alewife so it's easy to commute to when your car is in the shop 
1917 2 Windy City pizza is decent enough, I like the people and the service and I love their specials. There isn't anything "Chicago" about it, so its a funny choice for a name. I recommend it, its the best pizza in the neighborhood. 
1918 3 Service was excelant , as was the sushi we ordered ! The yakatori chicken was very grisely & unpleasent I would return 
1919 4 Our family of six went there for an early dinner. Great and delicious food. Great and friendly service. We got the family platter. 
1920 4 I love this place! The pasta is amazing, and it's all fresh. You definitely get what you pay for. The owner is very nice as well. Highly recommended! 
1921 3 Decent place, may lead to a "judgemental" side while serving, depends on who is helping you! 
1922 4 I highly recommend Coated! My friend and I went in for some manicures and enjoyed the friendly staff and beautiful atmosphere. The warm towel service and massage was the best! They also have a health conscious ventilation system. More than a week later my manicure still looks great. 
1923 4 The nicest bartenders & staff I have ever encountered in Vancouver and the U.S. If you're visiting stop by. You won't regret it! 
1924 4 Great for Mission Hill. Food is great for the price. Fantastic for students. Finally a restaurant on the hill we can sit down at! 
1925 1 sooo i went in around 7 for a curry chicken.. and wtf, a piece of my chicken was literally COLD, not cool not luke warm cold.. so i assume they are rewarming food. probably wont go back. 
1926 3 Great service after I had to bring back a an avocado morning wrap as it was over heated with hard to chew wrap. They replaced it right away and friendly staffs. 
1927 3 Wow! This place was awesome! The steaks, the mofongo, empanadas, rice, beans, flan.... everything was absolutely delicious! I do feel the waitress could have been a little friendlier and attentive. Had she given wow service, I would have given them 5 stars. 
1928 4 Authentic cuisine. Truly an amazing experience. Flavors are out of this world. Nothing fake about this place. 
1929 0 No sweet tea. "We've tried in the past, but people kept complaining it was either too sweet or too unsweet, so we've just stopped." OK, fine. But revamp your menu, lest your clientele may start to think this joint is SOUTHERN COUNTRY STYLE. Jesus.. 
1930 4 Delicious!! Will def be back!! Staff so pleasant, awesome view, great food!! What else you need? 
1931 0 The most horrible homophobic bar in Boston. Don't do it! "Get these homos out" - said by bartender 
1932 4 Bornu is beyond amazing. I'm sooooo in love with my Bornu Locs. I'm definitely a customer for life. I love how he doesn't overbook and the quality and patience he puts into his work. I highly suggest you to visit him. 
1933 4 Amazing burgers and all can be altered to be vegetarian! Usually a line but definitely worth the wait (so much faster than you think)! 
1934 2 After coming here for several years for their delicious food accompanied by beautiful Bollywood videos on their TV, I was taken aback (and not happy) that the cultural music videos were replaced by Christian evangelical music videos. Food's still great, just hope that they go back to music videos. 
1935 0 We gave it another shot and I'm sad to say I'd rather have Dominos than this way overpriced pizza. 
1936 3 they had a choriqueso there that was delicious. for some reason people like to drink at these establishments. I could never figure out why. 
1937 4 Food was excellent. Service was so good we felt like we had eaten with family. Prices were fine and if we are back in Atlanta we will eat here again. 
1938 3 Delicious old (but not ratty) men's clothes! Last I was in there the didn't have anything sized accurately (just in S-M-L, no measurements) so finding the right fit took a while, but I've found some staples to my wardrobe there for some sweet prices. Go! 
1939 4 Always a great meal! My wife loves the crab cakes with sweet potato and I get the rib eye. Their zucchini chips are delicious although we skip the marinara sauce and request the remoulade sauce instead. The servers are polite and attentive. 
1940 3 Had a duck breast and French cheese board. Both were good. Would have given 5 stars if there was an expresso machine. The place is also understaffed. Saw some good looking pies; if ever nearby, will try! Also, the bread was amazing!! Totally worth paying extra for. 
1941 4 Great drinks, delicious food, great staff! Really want to come by for brunch! Came here for a work outing and instantly became a fan. We had Moscow mules, which were incredible and tasted very fresh. Also had oysters and a few small snacks and everything tasted amazing. 
1942 0 Very expensive place, staff not really friendly. I ordered some food and was shocked when I asked for some bread and they told me that they have no bread, and instead tried to explain me their concept... 
1943 1 The workers were super nice, but the food was not so much. I had a really dry cupcake, moist but odd-tasting GF brownie, and a hard-as-rock GF cookie (which was also odd-tasting). With there being so many other incredibly awesome bakeries, I don't see why I should go back here. 
1944 3 Seems like good rates for Auzzie currency compared to competitor. Awkward transaction but clerk was very accommodating. Nice that it's in mall & feels more secure. Will go back, if I need. Btw, there's a nominal charge per transaction. 
1945 0 One person behind the counter and he was the cashier as well. Long line during busy rush hour in the morning. It's a management problem! 
1946 1 Menu looks great. Probably organic ingredients. Would be tasty if you got enough to actually sustain human life. Stingy with everything even lettuce. The staff is rude and snotty. Spent $22.00 on a sandwich , chips and a tea. Was hungry when I left ! Don't do it ! 
1947 4 Totally helpful staff! Excellent coaching my daughter while she designed her own wedding invitation they printed in house. I walked around store while she worked. Every employee in the store asked if I had any questions. Awesome talented staff. Interesting merchandise. 
1948 3 Great family place for breakfast. Long waits though. A ton of retirees most the time. Food is really good and consistent and so worth the wait. 
1949 1 Yikkity!!!! I love the Mamo subs!!! 
1950 4 Friendly service! We were greeted with warm service even though we were all asians (5) none italian We even spilled water and the eaitress was nice enough to clean it for us Food is awesome Will be back 
1951 4 Dude suggested the Cali Burrito, it paired excellently with a Woodchuck Granny Smith Hard Cider. I will definitely be back for the food, but also the chill location. Nice relaxed environment to sit and enjoy your food. I also want to try the Japanese Pancake trailer next door... 
1952 4 The food was amazing. Lovely little place and extra special service by the lovely owner. I recommend the coconut cream pie. Awesome. But then again everything was delicious. If I lived here I would go every day. :) 
1953 4 Great coffee and pastries, reasonable prices. Cool atmosphere for hanging out, reading or writing and enjoying your sustenance of choice. ! 
1954 0 The wait killed the taste we should of enjoyed. An hour for fries, tacos, and sliders was a joke. Sliders were disappointing because the consisted of a lot of burned ends. Bread for burger and sliders were great. I just expected a better meal for such a long wait. 
1955 4 One of the authentic Indian (or Indo-Pak) lunch buffets in the Austin area. 
1956 1 They are handy and helpful but they aren't cheap. Got a refurbed Dell CPU on line for less than half of what I would have paid at the store. I was shocked. But I still go there for the small stuff. 
1957 3 Hipster is a misused word Come on a night when there's a good food truck out , order the 'saison of the western ghats ' and have a good time with your friends -closet hipster (flannel from target) 
1958 3 Cute, quaint divey bar/restaurant. Great bloody Mary's and fish dip. Loved that this place is tucked away behind boca. Great for a nice quiet, chill day or evening to chill. 
1959 4 love this place, usually get the oxtails but decided to try the curry shrimp & it was bomb! per the usual. so quick and everyone is so friendly I love y'all 
1960 1 Not my favorite burger. I tried the sliders and they were oily, the server said that it comes with one side but they charged me the side separated. The hostess was not very friendly. The decoration is great but does not match the food or music or the people. 
1961 4 This place is amazing. The hot fudge is amazing and you can't go wrong with any of the ice cream sundaes or shakes. 
1962 4 Amazing cakes and awesome service! It's a little spendy but absolutely worth it. If you don't need a whole cake, they also have a large pastry selection. Yum yum yum! 
1963 3 food was great, wine selection is great. The spinach salad is amazing. I will say it smells kinda funny in there. 
1964 3 Um, I just realized there's a whole 'nother side to this place where some crazy dancing occurs. Yesssss...... Not to mention I came here the other night and my gin and tonic was 90% gin and 10% tonic. Another big Yesssssssssss..... 
1965 4 Everything I've ever eaten there is great, and I've had most things on the menu at one time or another. The Old Fashioned is killer 
1966 3 This place has great toppings and the dispensers are always clean. I always get the green apple and the original. I mix in chocolate chips and nuts. It is a winner every time. 
1967 1 Mediocre at best. General tso chicken was mushy, lacked flavor. Brown rice was bland. Looking in the rearview mirror we should've passed On this meal. 
1968 3 Can't think of a better burrito place downtown. The lineup is what it is and it's worth the wait. On a nice day, I usually just go and sit on the seawall about 2 blocks away which makes for a pleasant experience. 
1969 4 This brewery is an amazing place to chill on a warm afternoon. The view of lake Travis is sublime and the beer is refreshing. Lots of options and unique brews. Plenty of seating, games and food! Definitely go if you want the Oasis experience without the hour wait. 
1970 4 Our first visit will NOT be our last! Our server was Brandon. He made excellent suggestions and knew the menu well. I had the Shrimp and Grits... it was wonderful. We also shared a Creme Brullee. Yummy! 
1971 4 I will echo the 2 previous reviewers and say that Dr Valls is a truly ideal doctor! Thoughtful, well informed, patient, a great listener, and not just quick to write out a prescription. You can tell that he actually cares about your health and well being. 
1972 0 nasty Chinese food. This kind of food is unacceptable! Too salty, broccoli hard as a rock, cabbages are rotted 
1973 4 Awesome tasting menu and fabulous wine pairings! Servers are attentive and very knowledgeable too! The tastings are beautifully designed-gorgeous presentation. It's pricey so be prepared. 
1974 4 I love this place. Great quiet place to study while taking in the sunshine. There are open windows and outlets everywhere. 
1975 4 great little Mexican tapas bar great people working there beautiful people working there the food is awesome a precise great price this place is awesome this place is fantastic can't say enough good stuff about them 
1976 0 One guy behind the counter and a line 30 deep on a Sunday afternoon. What were the owners thinking of staffing one guy on a Sunday afternoon. Even salt and straw has four on at a time when they're busy. Sorry I had to wait 30 mins for a scoop. 
1977 3 I've eaten here only twice or so and honestly can't remember if it was good/great or average. I can say that every year I come and drink the DELICIOUS PUMPKIN SPICE BEER! Just try it!! 
1978 4 Love coming here for lunch. Favorites are the poutine and meatloaf The food is always good and the service even better--Kory is so attentive and always friendly!! 
1979 4 The BEST and most AUTHENTIC Italian cuisine around!!! My FAVORITE SPOT!! My fiancé and I came here on our first date and the night was nothing less than perfect!! I would HIGHLY recommend coming here! 
1980 3 A friend recommended that I go and check this place out. The line up was daunting and long, but the food was well worth the wait. Interesting dishes and good wait staff. 
1981 0 Extremely indifferent service. Terribly overcooked food I couldn't finish. Salty shepherd's pie. Nice to call yourself a 'gastro pub' ... but you forgot to make any attempt at decent food. Never. Again. 
1982 4 Restaurant Closed: now a gluten free bisto, chef David moved on as Executive Chef at Soleil 
1983 0 Found a huge bug in my salad. Halfway through the salad I discovered this bug. I almost threw up. I found the leg first, then found it's huge black body. Ugh! 
1984 4 I had a mimosa it was great. the bartender Fernando was a really nice guy and seemed liked he enjoys his job :) 
1985 1 This place is tasty, as you'd expect from most pho places in Vancouver, but has a habit of overcharging. Watch out! 
1986 0 The beer specials are pretty cool. For a BBQ joint in Austin this place should be pretty far down on your list. If you want some good wings and a beer this place is not bad. For BBQ please go elsewhere 
1987 4 I was not expecting much when my husband suggested eating here. It looks like a yellow POD and you eat at picnic tables outside. However, the food was AMAZING! I got a grilled cheese on sourdough with havarti cheese. They bread was toasted but not burnt. 
1988 3 Very insteresting and great for kids! I recommend getting there early as the parking can get filled quickly. Parking costs $5. The exhibits are interactive which makes it fun for the whole family. Definitely a must do if you are in Portland! 
1989 4 Every time I come here I barely wait for my food. And that makes me the happiest. The food is priced perfect for the quality and quantity I get. The service is also one of my favorite things about this place. 
1990 4 Being from Miami this is the closes thing to true Cuban cuisine. Great service and atmosphere. Definitely worth the drive 
1991 4 Great new local independently owned business! It's essentially a sushi restaurant set up like a subway restaurant with only the freshest of ingredients. 
1992 4 Delicious! Weston and the nearby towns are lucky to have a big-city-worthy restaurant so close. 
1993 4 We were seated right away, ambiance was nice - sophisticated, clean, quiet. Service was prompt and good - waiter knew his menu and the food came quickly. The petit filet mignon was delicious. I would absolutely go back there. 
1994 3 They are making tortilla in house! 5 tacos and one side dish. Yummy. :) the kitchen looks fairly clean. Nice environment. I like it! 
1995 4 Fantastic burgers, awesome drinks, good sides. Everything about this place is great except the insanely long lines. Not sure if any food is worth a 45 minutes wait in line. Try to hit it in off peak hours 
1996 1 Slow service mediocre food and steep prices. A waiter started to bring my dinner about 90 seconds after my salad was finally delivered. I saw him put it under the heat lamp for 10 or so minutes until I finished the salad. Great idea. In a fish restaurant. 
1997 4 Absolutely wonderful! They have a vegan plate if you ask for vegan only! It was wonderful! 
1998 2 If you want to cryogenically freeze your face off, try drinking from their water fountains.. 
1999 3 Allergy? Welcome to JP Licks! They have Vegans, Gluten free, dairy free hard ice-cream & soft serve. Fresh coffee, nice fresh pastries and delicious bday cakes. The ice cream, frappe are all great like all the others chain. The staff are friendly. Great location! 
2000 3 Great atmosphere; unique menu; awesome tasting foods, though a few are hit and miss. Takeaway the Krispy Kreme shake please. I'd go again if I feel like spending $20 for a decent burger! 
2001 4 The collards and sweet potatoes made my Southern stomach very happy. I know they say they're Brazilian inspired, however, the friendly staff and great food transported me back to Dixie. Looking forward to my next visit 
2002 2 There were long lines everywhere else so I made the mistake of coming here. Brisket wasn't tender. My corn dish never came so I ended up just leaving. Lesson learned - if you're the only one in there at lunch time there's a problem 
2003 0 disappointing... ran out of pearls and my pineapple slush was completely ice. five dollars for a cup of ice! you'll have to PAY me to come back..... also never get the avocado flavour... disgusting 
2004 4 Had a great experience with Handy - booking was easy online and had a great experience with Don. He was very communicative, arrived on time, and really paid attention to detail when mounting the TV. I would definitely use him again! 
2005 4 Love this place. Staff is friendly and the food is good. Great specials as well. 
2006 3 Very clean gym with better than average equipment and a friendly staff. The parking, however, leaves quite a bit to be desired. I don't live near by, but tried the gym before meeting some friends for a night out. I'd definitely come back and workout here. 
2007 4 I ate here a few months back. The fried chicken is world class, right up there with an outstanding Seoul based restaurant in quality. 
2008 3 I just went here on a whim. The stylists are really friendly. Sam did a great job on my hair, while multitasking a pedicure and manicure. 
2009 4 Worth every penny. A dish for everyone! Great ambience, perfect service. Simply an exquisite, no-fail dinner. 
2010 4 They have free wine tastings on Fridays and Saturdays. There is also an opportunity to taste beer and spirits at these tastings. They have FREE tastings and and excellent selection of products to buy. I cannot want for anything else. 
2011 4 Great pizza at a good price! Lots of variety. Think of it as the subway of pizza. Lots off toppings I think it's mainly flat bread. Over all I would recommend it 
2012 4 Hands down the best dry cleaner in the city! I used to drive from South Boston to their South End location until they opened this new location, just blocks away from home. Quality and service are unmatched! 
2013 4 Amy created a master piece for my Dad's 75th Birthday. I sent here a handful of pictures of my vision and she took it from there. Very fair price and on time. The cake was beautiful and delicious. Thank you Amy 
2014 3 Yes I am good for kids I said you're first boyfriend in my lifestyle to the Pope Francis too. 
2015 2 If ya in tha area and wants a bigass taco....that's all imma say, price is nice too and a 7-11 right next doe. A match made in heaven. 
2016 4 I came here to try their Channa Masala and ended up finding the tomato soup of my dreams. Masala was great too but a little on the spicy side. Can't wait to come back here! 
2017 0 This is the worst. Avoid at all costs from Hartsfield Jackson. Driver was texting and driving and on the phone the whole trip. Dangerous! 
2018 3 Really like this place, best Chinese food that I've had in a long time. Fast delivery too. 
2019 4 I have taken classes for about 2 months. Every class there is something new, so I never get bored. The workouts are hard but it gets easier every week and I am loving my results so far. 
2020 2 Really tasty hot pot. I like to put my own food the pot. They bring it with all the stuff already added. It came w glass noodles but egg noodles can be added. Tofu skin was a little tough. 
2021 0 Overrated pizza. Racist staff. I have been to all pizza joints in East Boston and I have to say this is nothing special. That, mixed with the "we don't like your kind 'round here" attitude from the staff, is definitely a deal breaker for me. 
2022 4 Had a blow out with Mona and I must say my hair was perfect and lasted forever. (3 days which is NEVER the case for me. They use Bumble and bumble which is one of my favorites! Cute decor and nice staff. 
2023 1 Ok this place claims they just had a multi million dollar renovation, but alls it looks like the got new carpet and put the cheapest fixtures and furniture they could find. Oh and the walls are paper thin. I will not be revisiting... 
2024 3 The Bookhouse continues to be one of my favorite places to have a drink. They make a mean Dark & Stormy, quite possibly my all-time favorite alcoholic beverage. 
2025 2 It was just okay. The frozen drink my mom got wasn't fully blended, so chunks of ice remained. The portions were huge but the whole menu seemed overpriced. And WHYYYY, dear Jesus, do the outdoor cabanas not have AC? It's 100 frickin degrees! 
2026 4 This is like Mama used to make and Momma when she would cook! Their okra is to die for! The catfish OH MY GOSH! Delicious! Hidden gem in the heart of Winter Park. We tried it because they were started by the 4Rivers owner. So thankful we did too!! 
2027 4 Great place to get desserts at I usually spend 10 to 20 bucks lol there so much to choose there 
2028 0 Shittiest cane's ever. Chicken batter always under done. Smaller portion chicken strips than anywhere else. Complete rip off. 
2029 4 Awesome food. Friendly service. Always easy and convenient. Kind of tucked away in the corner of a complex in Tualatin, but totally worth finding it. 
2030 4 Best kept secret.... Well, maybe not anymore ;-) Free range chicken and excellent beef. All at great prices. 
2031 4 This is a great salon with a great location. Jordania did a wonderful cut and blowdry for me, and even gave me a discount card for any treatment if I came back. Would definitely recommend! 
2032 2 A clean and modern restaurant with a nice selection and good quality sushi. Nothing really stood out, but my chirashi Don was a fresh and tasty. Service was ok, not special. The prices seemed a little high so I think there are better value sushi places around. 
2033 4 I love it all day happy hour on Sunday's !! Awesome food and perfect for the family ! 
2034 4 Wanted authentic Mexican food, small restaurant but still got what I wanted.. Great service delicious food. I ordered the stake with enchilada topped with mole, beans, rice plate. With a chile relleno on the side!! Uuummmm 
2035 4 Cinnamon rolls, vanilla cupcakes, and grilled cheese are all fantastic!! It's so exciting to have a 100% vegan option in town. Fun to be able to look into the kitchen too! 
2036 3 I really love their lunch buffet here. There's a great selection and the meats are really good. I love their chicken. Super moist and tender. I love coming here for lunch when I'm in this area. Definitely check it out. You won't be disappointed. 
2037 4 very simple and sweet is what i like about this place. It is because they service me really quick and short. they got it done only in 15 minutes... i would come back to there again for sure. 
2038 4 チョコかコーヒーの焙煎かわからないが自社工場が店内にあるチョコレート屋さん。多分有名で空港のお土産屋さんでも売られていた。チョコはミルクとビターだけでなく、産地の違いで風味や酸味も異なる。試食も自由。コーヒーは少し酸味があるが美味しかった。ほんとポートランドの東側エリアは駐車場が無い。このお店も路駐する必要あり。向かいの駐車場はパン屋さんの物なので停めないように。 
2039 4 Everything about this place is delightful. People, food, atmosphere, you name it. It's wonderful. 
2040 0 Bummer!! We came in to have a bite Saturday nite at 10:05pm but were told they now closed at 10pm instead of the 12:00am that the sign said. We had to go over to Waterloo to get some food since Scoreboard was already closed despite their posted closing time. 
2041 4 I was really shocked at how soon I got my delivery. My food hit the spot with Texas winter. Nanami Noodles with chicken, bean sprouts & fish cake in miso broth was soooo delicious. It was worth it. I will DEFINITELY order from here again! 
2042 4 Ordered online wedding invitations. Cheap, easy, and the final product looked fantastic. THANK YOU! 
2043 3 We love this restaurant, but in light of the post election attacks downtown we are have cancelled tonight's reservation. 
2044 4 Great drinks at the tequila bar! Cierra recommended awesome drinks! Fast and spunky and she totes loves her gig! 
2045 4 Excellent food and service -- salads and pastries both delicious and served with courtesy. 
2046 4 Seriously, how can you say anything bad about this grocery store? They are an amazing company with the longest term employees I have ever seen! What a cool family at this store. Big love. 
2047 3 If you're at a hotel with no options, get the margherita pizza, it was a winner. 
2048 4 Great happy hour prices. I think the tapas are better than the Med. Stay away from the flourless cake unless you need such a thing. All other dessets to die for. 
2049 4 My family loves pizza! We have tried many places in the area over the years and we always come back to this particular location. The pizza is simply excellent. We no longer feel the need to try other pizza restaurants. Highly recommend! 
2050 4 Y'all are great!!! :) so happy to have such a unique spot with great food close by! Y'alls wings rock- all of them! And the pizza has always been fabulous!! Staff is so friendly and attentive!! We visit often and each time it's a great experience! Thank you! 
2051 4 Wow what a great place! Yummy food and family ran it seemed like which made for a nice place to support. I could do without the vote for Trump signs! 
2052 4 It was almost a year when I went here, but excellent staff and a great yelp deal. 
2053 0 They sell knock-off products here and won't tell you they're fakes (their Vision Spinner 2's are obvious, blatant, fakes). They're moderately pricey too (I've seen worse though). 
2054 3 Great lunch spot serving breakfast till two. BLT was good and Greek salad looks great as well. Service was excellent 
2055 2 $5 drinks, loud downstairs, quieter upstairs, and awesome patio upstairs. Beware the trannies. 
2056 2 The food was nothing to rant about. The restaurants scenery was great though. I would definitely go back at night for cocktails. Looks like a good date spot. 
2057 4 Receiving a massage from Alex was just what I needed! I'm serious when I say he has magic hands. He was sweet and professional. The spa was very clean and inviting. I will definitely be back! 
2058 4 Go there! That's my wise advise if you are looking for a great massage. Lana is very knowledgeable, a talented masseuse and caring. 
2059 1 The food is fine. The location is fun. But this place is vastly overrated. 
2060 3 Had a great time! The waiter was fabulous and very friendly! The food was grand as well! Awesome experience in Austin! 
2061 1 Small but not busy in morning. Staff do say hi and bye which is better than most of their gyms. Equipment needs to fixed better. They have only 2 bikes and one doesn't work. Overall not bad because so slow. When I go anyways. 
2062 2 ディズニーワールドから近いホテルです。 このホテルに泊まる時には、ある程度割り切りが必要です。 対象:ファミリー、友人向け 移動手段:クルマが必須。ディズニー限定ならタクシー可能 清潔度:毎日清掃が入るが消毒の匂いがする 設備:全般に古く壊れたまま補修されていない箇所が複数ある 朝食:アメリカンブレックファストでポテトや加工肉類が毎日変わる 近隣店舗:徒歩圏内にセブンイレブン、ガソリンスタンド、ドラッグストアあり 全般にコスト優先で考えるなら、良いでしょう。 
2063 4 Great family business. Educational for all ages. Friendly, funny, and free. Free samples and MORE! 
2064 2 Nice McDonalds. They actually put additional pickles on my Big Mac (which was a downside for me because I dislike pickles). Overall, typical McDonalds other than it wasn't crowded any of the times I went there - which was good because I got my food right away 
2065 3 great lunch special $5.50 - chicken teriyaki and soda. clean, nicely decorated establishment. a good choice of sauces to douse with - Load up the Siracha 'til my nose runs and runs 
2066 4 It looks like the original plan states for Wendy's to be relocate within the updated shopping center so they will be in a new building. Phew!! 
2067 3 A quaint neighborhood clock and watch repair shop also selling a unique variety of refurbished clocks for the home. Pricing is reasonable, John and Marissa make a lovely team, and I'd recommend them any day! 
2068 1 Great product but the service at this location has to be the worst I've seen. 20 minutes at the drive thru is completely unacceptable Unfortunately, they don't have much competition in Johnstown........yet. The day will come and this place will struggle 
2069 4 We ate a pound of Italian cookies in about 28 hours. I'm not proud, but they were that good. We'll be back! 
2070 4 Kept checking this place out via Yelp as we traveled through Delaware. So thrilled we stopped this evening. Food was AMAZING! Shanna is AMAZING! So much fun as a server! Absolutely be back!! 
2071 4 Delicious food. Amazing drinks. The service was wonderful. Glad we made a reservation because the place was booked solid through the night (and I understand why!) 
2072 1 I got take-out noodles. They were piping hot and placed in a styrofoam carrier. When I opened them at the office 15 minutes later the noodles had the strong flavor of styrofoam. I imagine that eat-in meal would have been must better. 
2073 4 Great tour. Both my wife and I loved being able to taste and try some of your delicious beers. Our tour guide was great as well - great humor and he definitely knew his stuff. 
2074 4 Wow. This is the king of all sandwich shops. Healthy, friendly, and more than delicious. Get your toasted sub on ciabatta bread! Tastes like it just came out of the oven!! 
2075 4 Brought macarons for my friend and passionfruit and tiramisu individual cake for my dad. Both of them loved it! 
2076 3 Good variety of food, great atmosphere and decor! Have had great experiences multiple times, the Jeera Curry is phenomenal with a little bit of spice! 
2077 4 Best Mexican I've had in a while. Everything is so fresh here and their homemade sauces are amazing. Highly recommend if you are craving Mexican! 
2078 4 This place is great! It has great service, great people, and an awesome facility! Anthony in the front desk gives outstanding service and is very attentive. Well all of the staff in there is just superb. 
2079 4 Great dining experience. Love that smell of fresh burnt wood. Whoever complains about it doesn't appreciate it for how it enhances the room. 
2080 3 I loved this place!! the sushi is so good! got something to go from here, so did not experience the service.. but food wise, the sushi is great! I wish they would deliver to the downtown area! Would definitely order from here more! 
2081 4 Good little Wal-Mart. It's not overly packed and they usually have everything I need. 
2082 3 Support your local businesses! What's there to say? Been around my whole life- always reliable, meticulously clean and reasonably priced. You can get great deals if your order online for in-store pickup. One of only two delis from which I will buy sausage in town- Edelweiss is the other. 
2083 4 Two words. Ahi tuna. Nuff said. Love the truffle fries and the milkshakes. Only downside is it gets crowded and there may be a long wait at night/ on weekends. 
2084 4 I recently purchased my car. Jose Rosario and Brian McGrath were the best of the best!!! Caring, understanding and provided the best service! Thank you Jose and Brian for all your help!!!! 
2085 3 Super interesting. Check out the indoor garden and make certain to see the Titian. 
2086 4 One of my favorite go to spots !!! I'm a huge fan of coffee and healthy stuff!!! So it's the perfect combination, and the prices are reasonable. The cool thing about this place that it has a lot of vegan items. 
2087 4 Best Cuban sandwich I've had in Atlanta. They roast their own pig and cure their own ham. The food at THERE has consistently been outstanding and very reasonably priced. This is on of the great hidden gems of Atlanta. 
2088 2 Just two weeks open they said, pretty chaotic wait staff, needs more training said the boss ;) it was ok, big menu, lots of cooked options... perfect for my non raw eating parents :) 
2089 3 The service was good. It's a great place to work. I sat in the back and got so much done. The ambiance is nice. I parked on the street. Thanks dancing goats. 
2090 4 Had an exterior door replaced. They were professional, quick, kept to timeline and bid. Would use them again. 
2091 4 Amazing! The porchetta sandwich is to die for! Always visit when in Seattle. Please open in Ontario, Canada!!! 
2092 1 Compared to the Sandy Springs location, this is in every way inferior--much smaller, much less selection. Same high prices. I'll pass next time. 
2093 4 Came here to stay for a night with my wife. Ended up going down to get some pizza from the little pizza shop that they have and it was really good!! For the price and quality I have nothing but compliments! Mama Meko delivers the finest pizza around! 
2094 3 I went here for the last two oil changes and have no complaints. Very convenient that I can stay inside my car while they preform the oil change. Also they are straight to the point and efficient. I appreciate the quick service and no pressure sale. 
2095 4 Glorious! There's nothing like this in the Boston area. Definitely reminds me of home in California (aka boiling crab), but better as you can tell there is more substance, bang, and a kick in the sauce. Overall great ambiance for food and a brew. Always gotta get those cajun fries! 
2096 3 I have eaten here for years at this classic Chinese American restaurant. Tonight we ordered to go - Spring Rolls and Egg Rolls, Combo Lo Mein, Vegetable Moo Shoo and Pork with Garlic Sauce. Got house made sauces on the side - no packets. We ate well. 
2097 4 This place is awesome for lunch - I've been several times (I can't speak for dinner because I haven't been) - but get there at noon because people are starting to find out about it! 
2098 3 Great deli style sandwich shop... was very busy but our order of 4 sandwiches didnt take long...great spot to people watch on weekends....downfall____ not sure if they have a/c... it was a bit warm inside and the can pop wasnt very cold.... besides that great place 
2099 4 Loooove them, they're so beautiful! Helpful staff and knew exactly what I wanted with a photo and description. 
2100 3 A great dive! Tiny place with barely enough room to sit. But the food was good and inexpensive. 
2101 4 Best Thai red curry I've had in Austin. Long needed here. Very flavorful. And an interesting, light and skewered squid app. 
2102 3 For the price of the brazillian eat all u can this place is amazing. Staff are so nice making sure u have all u need and the meat ohlalalala just great food 
2103 3 Had a great meal at Bartaco on April 12! I took a suggestion from Southwest Airlines' magazine and had a great experience. Really unique flavors and ingredients and a cute, comfortable atmosphere. Be sure to try the wild boar or the pork belly tacos, and the CLT! 
2104 4 Awesome food and even better service. From the second I walked on every was warm and friendly greeting me. The staff is engaging and helpful. I had cashew chicken without rice and it was awesome and very fresh. I would recommend !! 
2105 0 Never had to wait so long for an emission test. Felt like he put other races each other. And first come first serve doesn't mean shit for Mike. 
2106 4 Just amazingly crazy food and it's delicious. The atmosphere is incredibly unique and captures everything that makes Austin Weird. 
2107 4 All I can say is this place is worth the hype. We got the OG, the Eggnog Creme Brulee, the Valrhona Chocolate Crunch, and the Chocolate Almond Ganache. They were all so delicious, but my favorite was the Eggnog Creme Brulee. You really can't go wrong. 
2108 4 Love the vibe here!!! Food is great and service was excellent. Definitely a must try if your in the Portland area. Our family really enjoyed it! 
2109 4 I just got back from the best facial ever. Thanks Coco! Lovely Spa is clean and affordable, I highly recommend! 
2110 4 Chick-fil-a always goes above and beyond the normal fast food restaurants. There's no wonder them and Chipolte are killing the competition in their fields. This place is great for the kids and for the wifi friendly people. 
2111 4 This was such a great find. Pizza was HUGE and delicious! Highly recommend. We were staying overnight in the area for our Cruise and wanted something we couldn't get at home. 
2112 4 Friendly gas attendants, eco-friendly gas station & they sell biodiesel. Do I need to say more? Oh.. and they have good gas prices & you get to use your Safeway Gas Rewards. Ka-Ching! 
2113 4 have been here multiple times now, we love the Momo's and the weekly specials has become our routine. Noodles & momo's are both my favorite. I starve all day, just to overeat here. authentic taste, quickest service. 
2114 2 Love the pizza. Hate the service. It's a really small place so be ready to be close to strangers or their left over mess... We keep going back though because the pizza and antipasto is just so good. Highly recommend Fig and Prosciutto and the Portobello. Get 1/2 and 1/2! 
2115 4 Best dungeness crab and sauce is too die for! I also recommend the clam chowder.. sooo good! 
2116 4 Ooooo I love the Sunday special. It was the fried chicken. It was really good. Wish I can have it again. 
2117 4 Delivered to a tired bunch of EPCOT visitors at the end of a long day, right to the Contemporary Hotel. Great food, friendly and very reasonably priced. We may order again before we leave. 
2118 3 Nice place and nice service. But most importantly, I can get northern Vietnamese dishes like cha ca la vong and bun cha hanoi without going all the way to San Jose. And that is awesome. 
2119 4 Love this place, customer service is fantastic. The owner Chad is wonderful. Their work is top notch. They have a customer for life!! Bring your car here you will not be sorry!! 
2120 4 I had the McCobb salad, which can be a gamble, but this was right on. I ate all the bacon off it first, and that in itself makes me want to go for breakfast. The waiter was great, Totally recommend! 
2121 0 Pure bad even though it's run by Thai family.. how disappointing. The food is sooo greasy and the taste is not worth the price at all. On a small note, I found it rather unprofessional to always present the little daughter at the door. 
2122 3 We really liked the food and the service was great. The Tandoori prawns were excellent. My only complaint was that the music was very loud which made it difficult to hear my boyfriend sitting across from me. Otherwise it was a great atmosphere. 
2123 2 Even asking for little mayonnaise will give you more than you want. Besides that I would say a mediocre sandwich in comparison to the subway across the street but can't beat the speed. 
2124 3 I absolutely recommend and endorse this place. The Banh Mi are excellent made with the best mini baguettes I have ever tried... To die for, seriously. 
2125 2 Not a place you go to relax, but a place to go to make your aches and pains go away. Getting the right therapist makes a difference. Like the fact they don't take tips. 
2126 4 Went in afternoon not knowing that they were in between dining hours. Sat at bar and sampled the brews and had an appetizer, put our name in for a table and celebrated anniversary w dinner. Really good and service was great. An overall great time!! 
2127 4 Excellent service. The food is on a different level. Everything exceeded expectations. 
2128 2 Just a typical pizza place with typical subs, dinners, etc. I haven't been disappointed with the food or service. 
2129 4 A gem. Everything's made from scratch and made to order. Get the biscuits...thought it was great! 
2130 3 Fantastic fried chicken sandwich (comes with mayo, pickles, and slaw, plus delicious poutine --- great atmosphere, friendly folks, good beer. Not huge and would be tough for more than 5, but will be someplace I recommend to anyone going to Boston 
2131 4 Amazing spot for low-carb and gluten free food! ICE-CREAM!!! 
2132 4 Had the Chilli was delicious! Fast service, great music, good food, lots of smiling faces. Will definitely repeat! Highly recommend! 
2133 4 Everything about this place is great. My go to meals are the fish of the day(rogers way) and the CHilean seabass. YUM!! Best sides that I have ever had in a restaurant. The service is always top notch. 
2134 4 CBC is great. Awesome atmosphere, good food, solid drink selection. Would recommend to anyone for a date or just a nice dinner. Have been twice and enjoyed each visit. 
2135 3 Highly recommended for all occasions. My visit was greeted with great customer service and a highly knowledgable staff. Salads were great, drinks were fantastic, and overall the place is very comfortable. 
2136 4 Love love love this place. Try the spicy kale salad, true black love stew, and battered cauliflower. Also, grab one or three of Free Birds Vegan Cookies while you're there! 
2137 0 Worst ride of the day. Not a ride. On your feet the whole time. You just watch special effects on a stage. The only impressive effect was a twister in the building. 
2138 2 It was fine food, just nothing spectacular. Found it a lot more expensive than it probably should have been. Would have probably enjoyed my experience more otherwise. 
2139 3 Great fried chicken. It has a nice spice, but not overbearing. Prices are reasonable and is probably the best fried chicken in a 50 mile radius. I will definitely go back. if you are from Houston... Frenchy's finally may have some competition. 
2140 4 Dr. Kanz gives the best adjustments and always gets my neck to pop unlock some previous chiropractors i have visited. 
2141 4 These guys are amazingly strong but know pianos really well and treat them like babies. They were thoughtful, punctual, and super-careful. 
2142 4 Found this while walking around Ponce, for a place where most everything is overpriced this was worth the $5. The gelato flavors were amazing. Def worth a try! 
2143 4 Instructors and students are great here. I am enjoying the facials that Cassandra provides. 
2144 0 Management changed and so did the quality and number of items in the buffet. Recipes don't taste the same and service has become horrendous. So disappointed to lose one more good restaurant in Austin! 
2145 4 Where else can you get reclining seats and great food and booze delivered to you during the movie? Plus you get a blanket and a pillow, can't beat it. I can't go back to a regular movie theatre now and I never get this treatment watching movies at home. 
2146 4 FYI, the amazing Amanda now works at Brilliance Tattoo and the brilliant Neil England continues to work at Empire. Proceed accordingly. 
2147 4 Zachary was insane I am soooo happy with my piece and I highly recommend. Clean shop and everyone was so accommodating and helpful. I can't wait to come back for more! 
2148 3 I only bought the blank cards and envelopes, but I like them a lot. They're $0.50 each regardless of size, but there are a variety of colors, so I like to mix and match. 
2149 4 Delicious food! I absolutely loved the Queen Beak! This sandwich makes this location a must visit! 
2150 3 Prom Dinner Success The staff called to confirm the reservation on early Saturday. That was a great reassurance for me. My son and his date were very pleased with the atmosphere, location and food at Capital Grille. Happy Mom! 
2151 3 This pizza reminds me of eating pizza in New York. Bottom line. I'll be back to try every slice they come up with. Perfect amount of sauce. Beautiful, crisp, delicate crust. Open late. No frills. Simple, quick, counter service. I'm in love. 
2152 4 Had a Pennypacker lunch and it was excellent. I had a Porchetta sandwich and I couldn't get enough. I am a foody and very picky but this is the best Porchetta I had for a long time.. I will return soon! 
2153 3 Cheap and delicious! A bit greasy but hey you can't beat $6 for lunch entree with rice, eggroll,soup, wonton chip with generous sweet and sour sauce on the side. 
2154 0 This is an overpriced very average restaurant. Went there with high hopes today as we were today it was the best place in animal kingdom. Very disappointed. $300 for very average, even the chicken was overdone. 
2155 4 This place is rad. Such great personality. The single screen experience is really fun--there's a camaraderie in the crowd you don't get at a multiplex. This is one of several excellent places in town to get that experience, and it has lots of charm and great service. 
2156 4 We have visited Cafe Pisano three times now and each and every time has been a enjoyable experience. Genesis has been our server each time we've gone back Sam has never let us down. Desserts and expresso at the end of the meal tops It off. 
2157 3 Food is delicious!! Very tasty and healthy. Price is a little high, but worth it! Service a little a tad slow. But I'm not in a hurry. I shall be back. 
2158 4 Favorite Vietnamese place ever! The workers are so kind and make the yummiest food ever My husband and I go there a few times a week.... Delicious! 
2159 4 Stephanie gives the best deep tissue massage. I highly recommend her if you are looking a great deep tissue. Stephanie is very intuitive and has a wonderful energy that puts you at ease. The spa is also very clean and inviting. I highly recommend to anyone. 
2160 0 Took forever to get two Whopper Jr's fries and drinks. Drink machine half empty. Sticky tables. Totally disorganized. 
2161 4 Excellent chicken Alfredo. I also had the artichoke and sun dried tomorrow salad - very fresh and flavorful. Yes if you love garlic the knots are addicting. Service was spot on 
2162 4 This aquarium is not huge, but it's full of fun for little children. I went with my 2 year old toddler and he loved it. We are from Chicago and this aquarium although smaller than Shedd is so much better! Strolling around Stanley Park is also awesome. 
2163 3 The people who work here don't really care hat you're here....because it's so delicious you'll cum anyway. But seriously, at least say hi. 
2164 4 My fiancé called Austex to get some maintenance done on our system this week. Gilbert showed up right on time and was a delight to work with. Also, surprised by how affordable their services are. We will definitely recommend them to our neighbors and continue to use them. 
2165 3 Great Thai fusion place. There curries and noodle dishes were great. The Japanese items they have like sushi and yakisoba are good as well. The service is helpful, however they are busy quite often do to the good service. 
2166 4 Great evening. Meat and vegetables were super fresh and service was incredible. Excellent time!!! 
2167 3 We were still jet lagged from our honeymoon in the Azores and this place really impressed me, not only because they were the only place in the area open after midnight but the pizza was fantastic! Thank you, Emilio's!! 
2168 4 Just had some of the best Mexican food that I can remember. Definitely will comeback again. The table side guacamole was really good. 
2169 3 Nice place to get the underground bar experience in yaletown. It is pretty small and gets packed. The music is hip hop/rap. They could do better with the music for sure! I loved their spinach pattys, soo tasty! 
2170 4 Love this local bar. So friendly and welcoming. Thanks Jeff for being a friendly bartender :) 
2171 0 Be aware the April server charge extra tip to you after you paid even if you tip already.. 
2172 4 So good the first time, I came back and shared the experience with more people. I had the combo pork ribs and beef brisket. 
2173 3 great food but bad location. We tried the seafood linguini. ravioli, seabass and crab - some of the stuff can tend to be bland but great flavour overall. The live music in the background was lovely. 
2174 4 Oaxaca burger!!!! I had it as a lettuce wrap, it. Was. Amazing! Full of flavor, I'd get it all over again. Nice ambiance. I was loving the huge box framed mirrors on one wall! 
2175 4 Simply put - Hands down the BEST gyro I have ever eaten! I highly recommend this place for tasty Mediterranean food. You won't be disappointed. 
2176 4 Amazing ambiance and such a magical atmosphere. Cocktails and food are delectable. Oh and by the way there are peacocks in the big trees outside. So glad we stumbled upon this beautiful place. 
2177 4 Uh. Donuts! How does it get better than that?! Well, it does because these folks think of very creative combos that I'd never think of. Their service is fast and friendly. Wish there was more/better parking for downtown but I can figure that out. Keep it up Voodoo!!! 
2178 4 Super friendly, efficient. Informed of possible upsells but no pressure. They also do rock chip repairs on your windshield, call your insurance company while you are there to approve the claim. 
2179 4 I have never had dim sum I liked but this was amazing. We had a large group and tried almost everything on the brunch menu. I thought everything was really exceptional and my favorites were the tea smoked ribs and the brussel sprouts. The cocktails were fresh and delicious too. 
2180 3 Great food. Unexpected for airport. Salad was a bit salty but the trout was amazing. Good French press coffee. Server John was a true professional. 
2181 4 Great service Jenny does great lashes and nails the staff is awesome and it's always relaxing time 
2182 4 I have been going to breakfast at Valeries since she first opened, food is great as well as the service & portions. Always a pleasant atmosphere all the help are friendly & helpful eat there you won't be sorry. 
2183 3 Great location with outdoor seating. Tasty beer and a simple steak salad made for a nice dinner out after work. Service good. Will be going back. 
2184 3 Great little Indian place in the HEB parking lot. The food was wonderful. The service was good and the atmosphere was nice for a casual Indian place. I will definately go back! 
2185 3 Wife had the vermicelli lovers and liked its freshness with its vegetables. I had the gang dang and the curry was tasty. If you don't have to be there right at lunch, go a little later and the wait is less. 
2186 4 Great brunch place in the city. I've been here a few times and have always enjoyed what I had. The lineup is crazy but the rewards at the end are worth it. The earlier you get here the better. I find the specials are always a great option. 
2187 0 Haven't received a single check from them despite what my online account says. The staff is unreliable and donated a lot of things I said I was coming to pick up. Now they're going out of business and not paying anyone. Class action lawsuit material. 
2188 4 I had a Quickbooks issue and some other problems slowing down my computer. I don't really know what they were. I just know Philtron fixed them. Cool dude who knows what he's doing and is reasonably priced. 
2189 4 Craving southern food, this place is amazing. Fried chicken is just like grandma's fried chicken. Also the cream grits will make you crave more. Definitely recommend this place. 
2190 3 Quick service, fresh food, polite servers. Will be back!! Ordered the beef brisket hotpot, Shanghai thick noodle, Sao Ching chicken this time. Delish that is all! 
2191 4 Me and my friends love going bowling here especially on Thursday nights! It's dollar everything pretty much! We have a blast eating drinking and bowling! Great atmosphere and will definitely be back! 
2192 4 Hector is phenomenal and did a great job. His pricing was extremely affordable and my fence looks brand new. Hector is super friendly, informative & professional. I look forward to promoting his company!! 
2193 4 You must go here! Great food, great price great staff. The locals told us to go here and they were right. I ordered blacken salmon Caesar salad. Perfecto! My friend ordered the pork chop he ate it all. The sweet tea was perfect. 
2194 4 The food was so good! The service was great! We've eaten at a few Indian restaurants in Surrey and have been disappointed by the service. This place did not disappoint. Bravo Tasty Indian Bistro! You exceeded our expectations. We will be back! 
2195 4 I was in the sauna yesterday (5/26/14) and dropped my key in between the cracks. The front desk guy helped me get it out and was really nice about it. Good customer service! 
2196 3 Prices are a high. Food ok. Beer is good. If going for craft beer alone.. you'd hit the spot. Unless your significant other doesn't like. Then there isn't much variety for them. Wait staff is friendly. Place is clean. 
2197 3 Pretty good! I got the burrito.The best part of the meal was the ranch dip. And the churro brownie was delicious!! In total I spent around $9. I don't know what people were expecting for the price point. 
2198 3 I've had better bubble tea, but this place is a great location and has lots of options to satisfy you (including those with dietary needs). The tea itself is refreshing but not the most flavorful. Been meaning to try the mochi - so many flavors! 
2199 4 My shades were repaired sooner than expected and for a reasonable price. Great service here. 
2200 3 My husband and I had a nice dinner at Brasserie Ten Ten. Our service was great - just the right amount of attention. I had the steak frites. While I enjoyed it, overall it was too salty for my taste. My husband had the seafood boulaibaise that he liked. 
2201 4 I used National Parking's valet service for a film shoot and they were excellent -- they worked with me last minute to pull together valet service and were very professional. I will use them again, and recommend them to anyone that asks. 
2202 4 OMG why didn't I come here sooner?!? This place is amazing. Sweet tooth craving satisfied - check. They have Nutella - nuff said. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Hearty portions too. And craft beer, mimosa and wine. I got the machine. Delicious and super filling! 
2203 4 First Thai place we've been to in Austin that tastes like Thai food! Thai staff with a proper Thai menu. 
2204 3 Devon and Katy are amazing. My daughter and I go to Evo regularly for facials, laser hair removal and various other services. They are accommodating with appointments and close to home. They are knowledgeable and professional, I highly recommend these ladies, 
2205 4 This place is awesome ! They have 10 of their own beers on tap plus a dozen or so other beers Very nice relaxing atmosphere. They do serve a few snacks and things now and you can also order in and bring in your own food. 
2206 4 I haven't been to a Qdoba that I didn't like, but this one in particular has a very nice team who remembers us. 
2207 4 Cozy, unpretentious and delicious. The folks here are super friendly. We chatted with our server and the owner for a while after our food came - very nice people. And the food! My daughter got pad Thai and I got the drunken noodles. Both were excellent! Highly recommended! 
2208 4 We're from out of town and located this place via Yelp with great reviews.. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint.. Sushi was fantastic and fresh and the food came out quick.. 
2209 3 Excellent service, wonderful eye doctor in house, very friendly while remaining professional. Glasses are pricey but that's to be expected. A very good experience here. I would return anytime I need an exam/new glasses! 
2210 4 A new restaurant (as of 2015) to try Sichuan style Chinese food. Nice seating and decor, very good service, and authentic spicy Chinese food. Highly recommended. 
2211 0 Pretty rude staff! They refused to seat at a table because they were "waiting for larger groups." You can tell that there were plenty of open tables! You could also tell how the wait staff and greeter could care less about my disappointment. 
2212 4 Great food and outstanding service! My boys enjoyed their enchilada, chicken tenders, and corn dog, and my beef tacos were great. The staff was friendly, and we especially appreciated Isaiah's service as our waiter. He was polite, attentive, and prompt. 
2213 4 I always get a solid haircut Sports Clips. Stylists are friendly and always consistently good. 
2214 4 What do you write about a bridge that's already had so much said about it? It's not just the bridge but the surrounding area that makes it so gorgeous. From the NW side the convention center definitely adds to it. 
2215 4 By far the best dining experience I have ever had. The waiters were so passionate about the dishes the served. The atmosphere was relaxing. THE FOOD WAS PERFECT! Will be taking trips from Dallas to Austin just to eat here in the future! 
2216 4 Awesome time! All the staff were so helpful and accommodating. They really helped us all enjoy the bachelorette outing. 
2217 2 Baristas were friendly-ish. But the store looked pretty cluttered and they were no seats. I waited about 10 minutes and got seated down but my two cousins waited another 10 minutes to get a seat. I would've sat outside, but it was way too hot out! 
2218 4 Food was excellent! Service was top-notch. The portions were a very nice size. The noodle soups are ridiculously large, but sushi/sashimi portions are what you'd expect. 
2219 4 Here now and the lunch buffet is so delicious I don't know what to do with myself. Clean atmosphere, kind staff and the food, the next Mexican I have had in awhile. I'd recommend for sure. Kind of tucked away but worth it 
2220 4 Dr. Park is great, kind and thorough. I've had many great experiences with whatever has come up. Their dental hygienists are also a extremely pleasant. CGS's support staff are also very accommodating and courteous. 
2221 4 This is the best burger I've tasted in Vancouver. Yes it's on the expensive side, but you're getting what you pay for - excellent quality ingredients, plenty big, juicy, and lots of flavour. Staff are super friendly. 
2222 3 Very good burger, loved the bun, good meat flavor, cooked perfectly. Fries and onion rings ok, nothing special. One of the better burgers in central florida. Service was very good. 
2223 2 update on this - the hotel chain contacted me immediately and are in the process of helping me to resolve the issue - always nice when someone listens! 
2224 4 Talk about fast, friendly service. Clean waiting room and convenient location. I had a screw in the tire and they were able to patch it quickly so I could be on my way. Highly recommend. 
2225 4 Delicious food and warm atmosphere. I absolutely love their meats. All so well seasoned. I'd definitely recommend this place. 
2226 4 The absolute BEST Caesar salad in the Lake Travis area! Service is polite. Parking is plentiful. Atmosphere is warm and cozy (and I don't mean it's small). Feels like a cafe you would find strolling the streets of Europe. Delightful addition to the Lakeway restaurant scene. 
2227 2 The products are good, but expensive. The location is perfect. They hire probably the slowest cashier with no sense of urgency. On many occasionals, I've missed my bus because the cashier is being chatty with the previous customers or just taking their time. 
2228 4 Great breakfast sandwiches, pastries, but the amazing thing is they serve great coffee for a cheap price. Medium coffee is 1.25! 
2229 2 Compare to fast food, udon is alright but pricy. California rolls are good. Located inside the mall food court. If staying at Hilton, use the upstairs connector. It links directly to the mall. 
2230 3 Ate at the cantonese seafood restaurant and it was really good. The portions were reasonable and the taste is like the upscale dim sum restaurants in LA. The XO sauce that they gave also complimented all the dishes! 
2231 4 This place is fantastic!!!!!!!!! I have been here a few times and its wonderful. Try the Nutella milkshake! And all the burgers are wonderful... Sweet potato fries too.. 
2232 4 My favorite food cart in Portland. Delicious Persian food. The Koobideh and Barg kababs are the best. I love the Maasto Khiar (yogurt and cucumber) and Shirazi salad which come with the food. Big portions with reasonable prices. 
2233 4 Sooooooo good stop by just to check and i eat with my boys we love it.everything was delicious and the attendance was so polite that make me happy to be there totally recommend to every one..... 
2234 1 Beer: - Harpoon UFO Entree: - Chicken Ranch Salad: Came with a good avocado ranch dressing. Not enough avocado or chicken, salad was a little soggy and lettuce seemed mostly iceberg - Friends said pulled pork sandwich and steak were not so good - Curly fries were a plus 
2235 1 This was disappointing. Portions were just way too small. It is pricey and at $30 for an entree, it's ridiculous how small they are. To be fair, some pros: - Service was prompt - Outdoor patio seating is nice 
2236 0 Food and price are ok, but service is very bad, means staffs. They can find any reason to give you a hard time. That why, I stopped go back there for a year now. 
2237 1 Hey guess what? I have a job too. Way late. Called after the service window to let us know they were on their way. Overpriced and pressuring us to spend money on work that does not need to be done. I don't have a great feeling about this company. 
2238 3 Good sushi, creative presentation. Cocktail menu was pretty interesting as well. I wouldn't say it's a good value as the plates are even smaller than what is normally implied by tapas. Sushi plates are regular size, but others are TINY. Service is pretty good. 
2239 4 Sean & Chris.... phenomenal behind the bar! Service, speed, on point and just great at making it a locals spot for all Winter Park. Thank you both! 
2240 4 Cutie Pie is the ONLY place I trust my lady bits to! Staff is super friendly yet respectful and always find a way to take your mind off what is happening below the equator! 
2241 4 Brunch is good and the staff is very welcoming. My personal favorites are the basil biscuits with the jam! 
2242 4 First time to Hat Creek today and it was awesome. Juicy fresh burger, the bacon was crispy and had a smokey pepper taste. My wife had the turkey burger which was also awesome. This place beats the pants off it's burger neighbor a few doors down. 
2243 4 thai orchid has such amazing food! I had only been to a Thai restaurant once before thai orchid and it was awful! It completely ruined my experience in having thai food but now that I have eaten here I LOVE it. Have yet to have anything bad here. 
2244 0 Gotta laugh, after seeing their advertisement for full selection of batteries come to find out they do not have a battery for my vehicle. Total bummer. Next time I'll call ahead and ask before I come down. 
2245 2 Completely average fluffy desserts. The only reason it gets 3 stars is the staff is exceptionally friendly. 
2246 4 I love this place. The food is always amazing and the service is great. Those Belgian waffles are WOW. Highly recommended. 
2247 4 This is one of our favorite spots in NE but it is hands down our black Labrador's coolest place to go. Get the rice, squash and chicken and your doggie pals will love you forever. Breakfast is amazing and dinner is too. 
2248 3 This was so tasty! Their premium bacon is to die for! The staff was very kind and helpful. They also have breakfast and lunch quinoa bowls that are great healthy and delicious options. 
2249 2 Good place for seafood and cold beers. Very casual place, family friendly and fun. Their French fries was good as well. I was afraid of getting into a tourist trap, but the food was good actually. 
2250 4 Three words... damn good eats. I can't even find a place to top these burgers. I even went all the way to Vegas to visit Gordon Ramseys BurgR and was completely disappointed. Bravo flip, bravo. 
2251 4 I called this company on a Saturday night not only did they pick my cousin up (right away) for me but moved his truck to a safe spot. They really went above and beyond for me and my family. I'm so impressed! 
2252 4 There are several places in Atlanta to eat soul food. But this place is by far the best. The food was fresh and extremely tasty. And the service was superb. The staff was very attentive and personable. I cannot wait to go back. 
2253 2 Well let's start with the positives. The servers are extremely polite and wanting to help, they are patient. But the food isn't the best..Had a soggy burger that I couldn't finish, and the chips tasted like something I could just buy at the store for a dollar. 
2254 4 Best dentist in Atlanta. Super convenient location right off of 400 at exit 5. Great for adults and kids so it's one stop shopping. They will treat you right and your teeth will look and feel great!! 
2255 3 Great services/management! Drinks were delicious and the food were spectacular, however, the only 1 bathroom were very small not meant to accommodate for everyone. 
2256 3 This place is great. Yummy cocktails, cheap good eats, helpful and friendly bartender. Looking forward to coming back soon! 
2257 3 Love love love Soul Cycle. It's fun, motivating and addicting! Staff is awesome and always makes you feel welcome. The only reason it isn't 5 is because of the $$$$. 
2258 2 An odd sandwich shop where the people behind the counter would rather be somewhere else. The first untoasted French dip sandwich I have ever had. The place looks cobbled together from old treehouse parts. But hey - here it is a day later and no food poisoning. Win for me. 
2259 0 Had a terrible dining experience, tried to rectify it with management and corporate - and nobody listened. Said it would be used for "training and development." The sad part is that the food is great, it's a shame I'll never go back. 
2260 4 A great place to spend an hour with a milk shake and a newspaper. Nice to see a super modern pharmacy in back, and an old-timey soda fountain up in front, where for $2.50 you can get the weeks special shake. 
2261 4 Killer lunch tacos loaded with fresh veggies, beans, and cheese hit the spot for our late-morning first full meal of the day. Accompanied with a big pecan roast coffee, we were supercharged for motoring around Austin late into the evening. 
2262 4 This place is absolutely amazing. It's huge, feels so cozy and is such a great environment. On top of that, the barista was the absolute sweetest and made some of the BEST iced coffee I've ever had. Goodbye Starbucks, hello BreakRoom! 
2263 4 They have brick oven pizza. I got the cheese pizza. It was kinda small for $12; however, it was also the best cheese pizza I've ever had. (Seriously). I'll be back to see if it was a fluke or not. 
2264 4 This is a great spot hidden away in Fairview slopes. Beatiful building, great ambience, great coffee! 
2265 3 Food was pretty good, service was good, and the music was very relaxing (the Shins, Ray LaMontagne, etc.). Can be a little tight when you sit at the bar, but overall a good option if you're in this section of this frustrating airport. 
2266 3 Really friendly staff, quick service, great food (for I-hop). Also probably one of the cleanest I-hop locations I have ever been to. 
2267 3 Not in the best area of town, but once you are inside it's easy to forget. It's a nice looking place and it's great for a drink pairing. Dark lighting makes it seem more intimate. 
2268 4 This place has everything you're looking for: great people, service, beer, food, records, and games on a big screen! 
2269 3 Professional and knowledgeable. Sam Lucas was the inspector. He started the inspection on time and spent a considerable amount of time reviewing his findings after the inspection. Their report is concise and easy to follow. 
2270 0 Had the spaghetti and meatballs and pork and beans. Small portions and just not enjoyable. Very disappointing. Friends had the beef Wellington and lobster Thermidor and loved it. Maybe my girlfriend and I made the wrong choice? May not return. 
2271 3 Cool space, nice products, and super friendly Alex was great. Items are a bit pricey, but not overly trendy. Classic finishes to everything, so you can feel secure that your belt will hold up for years and up to fashion snuff. 
2272 1 Food was fine....worse parking ever as it has like 10 spaces. That's just cray. Poor location and will opt for a different one in the future. 
2273 4 I love sushi and this place is incredible! There is a roll with a touch of lemon zest that takes it to the next level. Menu is great and ambiance is nice. A tie for my favourite sushi place. 
2274 3 I love hounddogs pizza. The staff are very polite and they have the biggest plate of nachos I uqve ever seen. 
2275 3 This is the place to be in Brighton if you're Irish, or just looking for a fun time with Irish folk. THey have traditional Irish food here, which is actually delicious. The patio is awesome. The beers are cheap. And of course they have Guiness on tap. 
2276 4 Food is really good price Food is really delicious Staff are great Excellent atmosphere Happy hour is awesome with discount prices $10 flight of their 10 beers Good portions Fast service 
2277 3 Keep up the great work! Bartaco has delicious tacos and amazingly refreshing cocktails. The atmosphere that is set in this restaurant is lively and is sure to put anyone in a great mood to enjoy a meal. 
2278 3 Very good! Loved no. 28 (the chicken curry) and deep fried banana and ice cream. Staff are super friendly and attentive. New favourite pho place! 
2279 4 Im a regular here ...very consistent & the drinks very good & are reasonable ... plus the food is with out question, full of flavor... try to go to Boston & see how much you pay for the same quality. 
2280 4 Every employee at this store was awesome today!! The Joshs in electronics and the managers were helpful. Thank you from California!!!! 
2281 0 Really bland food. Asked for spicy and it just wasn't there. We even had to salt our food. Never again. 
2282 4 Quick, friendly service. Changed oil, fixed rock chip and provided a plan for long term service. 
2283 4 Irish Benny's were delicious. The wait staff is very friendly and attentive (without being overbearing or invasive), which is exactly what one would expect from a family run business. I'm definitely coming back next time I visit my sister in Tewksbury. 
2284 1 Yelp removed my photo of my dog eating the gross food they sent to my house. Hey Ginger Exchange instead of wasting your time reporting my photo how about refunding my money to my credit card or simply apologizing? Nah that's not passive aggressive enough for you maybe. 
2285 4 This place is really cute. The server was really attentive and the food was delicious. Great spot for brunch. 
2286 4 I'm from Southern California & all I can say is this pizza is by far one of the best I've had in a while! I highly recommend this place for pizza & beer. The bartender was fast, attentive, & very friendly! 
2287 4 Decided to try this place out during my visit. It was phenomenal. Great service, even better food. Tried the patriots maki, regular ramen and toro sashimi. The toro had great fat marbling and had a vibrant bright color! Definitely worth stopping by! 
2288 4 Love this place! Great tacos, friendly staff, and affordable. Super convenient in a little red trailer at the corner of Mopac and Wells Branch. 
2289 0 Be careful before driving out here. I'm here now in front of the business, and the door was locked at 9:29 AM, and the phone number for them on Yelp was disconnected. 
2290 4 Lynn is moving up on the scale ,,one of the best cheeseburgers ever had in my life and I know my cheeseburgers 
2291 2 Had to change my review to a positive one because the owner wrote to me and showed me that the art of customer services is not dead! We'll return to Shawarma King! 
2292 4 Can't say enough about the unique food. Veggie patacon is my favorite- fresh and full of flavors. Friends love the fish tacos. Seasoned fries with spicy cilantro sauce to start with are a must! You can buy the mild and spicy sauces and we usually do! 
2293 2 Place is an Austin staple and has hearty portions of food (and their famous seasoned fries). It's a good meal and great for lunch. 
2294 4 Zack gave a great tour of Harvard: who lived where, the myths, the famous grads and the famous dropouts, the unique traditions, and lots of history. Lots of walking but not difficult. The guide was well-informed and funny 
2295 0 Literally the worst food I've ever had...and at such a high price. The avocado "salad" is shredded Iceburg lettuce and the salsa is the blandest salsa I've ever tasted. Jarred Tostitos salsa tastes gourmet compared to this. Unbelievable they are still in business. Plain awful. 
2296 3 Consistent, delicious breakfast served all day! Tasty corned beef hash. Eggs done a perfect easy over. Whole wheat toast perfectly buttered and toasted. Great friendly and efficient service! 
2297 0 Met my expectations for a dealership- extremely overpriced. Charged me $720 to replace an axle boot I had done elsewhere for $180. Shame on me for not getting a second opinion at that time. 
2298 4 I tend to not like eating greens, and yet I love this cart. Their drinks are incredible. Get the tropical greens. You won't be disappointed! 
2299 3 Nice neighborhood bar. great home made pizza, beer and sandwiches. Really nice employee's. I play league pool here and really enjoy the cozy feeling. 
2300 4 Great fresh pasta, friendly family owned and run, nice people who care about your dining pleasure. They opened last night and had a full house for diner tonight. Formerly the home of Bella Sera. Better service and new owners. Nice big table to the side for a Tweetup.... 
2301 2 Found a hair baked into my waffle. No replacement or discount offered. Just an apology which isn't good enough. Hopefully rare event but should have better policy in place to keep customers happy. Food was good though otherwise 
2302 1 A few years back a guy offered to take me here for breakfast....... I"ll give it two stars because it was better than a walk of shame. Miss college 
2303 4 Lovely service and quality food. Highly recommend the quinoa, greens & eggs for breakfast, my server also recommended adding feta to the dish which was a nice touch. 
2304 4 Trying to recreate this at home and have it for all my meals, everyday. So far I can't replicate it. This idea is genius. Come to California. 
2305 3 Waffle sandwiches. Yummy. Only 1 picnic table. Think of this place as food to go. 
2306 3 I'm still dreaming of that spinach/roasted garlic/olive pizza. 
2307 4 Very nice! Food was great, and the service was superb! Wish we knew the name of our waiter, because he made the experience even better! 
2308 4 Fantastic authentic Italian food with great service! I had the lasagna, it was with a bouglianese sauce that complimented the layers of lasagna pasta, Magnificent! 
2309 1 Is it just me, or is the shop owned by 19 year olds? I never see any older adults. Ever. 
2310 3 Tasty (and cozy) brunch spot with ample parking nearby. Go hungry and try the catfish hash, fiesta eggs, or the french toast. Free coffee for those waiting for a table. 
2311 3 Not much on atmosphere (it's a cafeteria), but try the shrimp and grits. They're great! Also, the food workers were very pleasant. 
2312 4 Worth the trip! Definitely on the "don't miss it" list if you find yourself in Austin. Go to the top floor and get fed and buzzed, explore the rest of the place, do some shopping. 
2313 4 Engaging! So clean and the girls are so sweet to the little ones! 
2314 3 Onion rings are to die for, never had better! Philly cheese steaks are good but need more sautéed onions. Staff was very friendly and bartender serves a good drink. We will be back. 
2315 4 First time here. Very good all around. Awesome mojito Margherita and delicious food! 
2316 0 Doesn't participate in any coupons or promotions including points. Skip this chicken for the clown across the way. 
2317 4 Voodoo doughnuts is awesome!! Super yummy doughnuts, super cute merch. Also Nick is totally awesome 
2318 2 Everything I had was too spicy, but good. I ordered the meat lovers with injera and cabbage. I wasn't crazy about the flavor of the cabbage. I did enjoy the ribeye, filet Mignon, and kitfo (ground beef with spice & butter) but it was seriously too hot!! I ordered mild... 
2319 4 This place is quiet, clean, friendly, and attentive. The customer service is above level and the massages.... are epic 
2320 3 Very good quality of meat. Super good food. But the garlic is a bit overwhelming. I would suggest ordering without 
2321 4 Wonderful restaurant! We ate in Framingham! Service was awesome! We all ate shrimp very delicious! My boys said best Cole slaw ever. Very pricey for us Midwest people but the meal was great! 
2322 4 My favorite dish is the soup. Even the vegetable soup has so much flavor. The service is good and they are fast. 
2323 4 It's my 1st time here. And I was not disappointed , I will be coming back here again definitely worth 5 stars. 
2324 3 Just get the Cochinita Pibils and a watermelon-limeade and pretend like there is nowhere else to eat in Texas. You won't regret it. 
2325 1 Only good if you are an NU student Just basic American bar with decent appetizers. Have TV to watch games. 
2326 4 I love this place so much that I take it on all of my sales calls and all of my clients love them too. Definitely the BEST DOUGHNUT SHOP in town. 
2327 3 Delicious and authentic! Great atmosphere and friendly service. I had the German meatloaf and it was fantastic. Next time, I'll try the buffet to try the variety of sausages. 
2328 3 Cobs isn't quite as tasty as the bread from the bakery in Newport Village , but it beats the supermarket (with the exception of that Potato Buttermilk Bread at Save On Foods). Service is always very friendly and prompt, and my wife likes the higher fiber white bread. 
2329 3 We visit Boulder once or twice a year, and have sampled the Pearl Street restaurants. Nothing against them, but we were looking for something new. Nice north location, wonderful staff, and interesting menu. We enjoyed our meals, and their interesting cocktail menu. 
2330 4 My review is for the bar. LOVE this place! The vibe is very chill and brings me back to my Sydney days. The music is great, lots of seating. Great place to mingle with strangers from all around. Drink menu is delicious. 
2331 3 Too many dishes to chose from...great seating outdoors, coffee or a mojito...nice place to eat and enjoy some great company! 
2332 3 Loved it! I ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese, which was delicious and had lots of lobster meat. My wife ordered a pizza, and it was great, too! Service wasn't that great, but we were surrounded by larger groups. We'll definitely be back. 
2333 3 good tasty Indian food. Walking distance to Harvard Square. Probably my favorite Indian food in the area. Sometimes live music. They even deliver to MIT area. Cozy and quiet for meetings. I haven't tried the buffet. Try the lamb sag! 
2334 4 Best Sushi place around. It is not big but who cares? Food is awesome. We had Toro included sashimi platter and who in the heck includes Toro in Sashimi platter!? Love the chef, staffs, and atmosphere. Would obviously come back. 
2335 3 Love their rice dishes! I hope they can provide more meat for their rice dishes since they are getting mostly student customers. Always love their dumpling and sweet potatoes as 2 sides to order. They try to maintain the store clean and the service is great too! 
2336 4 Love how much space they have at this location and the convenient parking is a huge bonus in Austin. The staff is very friendly and helpful! Every time I've been here I have had a fantastic experience. 
2337 3 Very good fried chicken. The two piece is enough for one person. One star off because one of my friend's chicken was undercooked and the server was trying to explain that it was a blood vessel that popped- I beg to differ. 
2338 3 Ever been to a bad Fudruckers? Me either! This was good and the expected service you should get here 
2339 4 We have taken our two cats here and have always gotten great care and service all around. Thanks to Dr. Gaines our cats are healthy and happy! The front staff and vet techs are always trying to help save $$ and give us rebates on their food products. 
2340 4 Took one of the Subarus here for an oil change, found them to be very professional and easy to work with. Will definitely be back. A bit more expensive than the dealer and worth it. 
2341 4 Amazing tofu stew + bulgogi = comfort food in winter!!!!!!! Hate to have more out people find out about this place, but the word is obviously out... (The line gets a little out of control sometimes) 
2342 0 The manager of this establishment is a total tots. Has no sense of costumer service and I am convinced he spits in the tacos. 
2343 4 Best service...! Best NYC style pizza...!!! The owner and workers are so friendly and nice. 
2344 4 We were out of town and stopped in at the last minute. Staff was friendly and courteous. Speedy service! 
2345 2 Good friendly service, my waitress wasn't very knowledgable regarding beers or items on the menu but she did try to help and asked other staff for assistance. Food was ok, rather bland but I did order the fish and chip... Greasy :/ 
2346 4 Never disappointed! Love the Cuban! The yuca fries are my second favorite. The garlic dipping sauce is beyond words. The Atlanta one is awesome but the one of 316 is pretty good too. 
2347 3 All I can say is milky Taro Bubble tea with pearls !!!!!!!! Best bubble tea joint in Vancouver hands down! This place is cash only just a reminder 
2348 4 My husband and I eat breakfast here maybe 3-4 times a week. It is a small, family owned gem on the island !! Great food that's affordable, and amazing staff !! Perfect little diner for a relaxing breakfast with your family or friends. Best breakfast on the island !! 
2349 3 Jessica was a great hairstylist. She is energetic and follows directionbeautifully when cutting your hair. I definitely recommend her if you get your haircut here. 
2350 4 Great thali - all you can eat lunch! Thali is a great concept for ppl who don't eat out at Indian restaurants too often to get a sample of everything, then you get refills of sauce, pancakes and rice ... Love this place, super Friendly staff! 
2351 4 I have no idea why this place has so many negative reviews. I had a wonderful experience and all the people who assisted me were great. I will definitely be back. 
2352 2 Decent pizzas. Wines by the glass are too pricey for the location. Staff is sometimes ditsy and inattentive. 
2353 0 No cars left despite my reservation. Sad customer service--National you're better than this! 
2354 4 They have very good Salad menu and fresh Halibut dish. The ambient is amazing with friendly staff. It's so nice to sit outside during the summer and enjoy delicious fresh dishes they offer! 
2355 4 Fantastic experience. I bought a Groupon and Stacy did a great job! Very attentive, relaxing and thorough! Plan to go back shortly. I highly recommend!! 
2356 4 I go to Dempsy's daily the food is great and it's one of the cleanest places that you'll ever go to. The service is great I definitely highly suggest giving Dempsy's a try, i love it here! They are like family to me now. 
2357 4 thank you so much for a great job.. you are an excellent, courteous and thorough sales agent.. you scouted around for your customer.. and for that we are bringing all of our business to you all.. I am also going to refer family and friends your way.. 
2358 0 Pissed off went to safe way at 1130 tonight and all doors were locked there was no sign indicating a special schedule and its not any american holiday, even the website and telephone message says midnight this is bulll shit 
2359 4 A must visit breakfast place if you are in Vancouver! There was a dish with lamb meatballs and eggs. The sauce was amazing! 
2360 3 Outstanding food, service and atmosphere typical for a mom-and-pop place. 
2361 4 Don't be afraid of the line! I've never waited more than 10-15 minutes and it is worth the wait. Will probably always be my favorite burger joint in Austin and their fries are the bomb too! La Bandita(I think I spelt that right?) is my go-to choice. 
2362 3 Lattes are great here and the service is good too! Watch out for the moon creamer because even though the first few sips are delicious, it gets tiring fast. 
2363 1 I was pretty disappointed in the ramen. I had read the excellent review in the Willamette weekly it definitely did not meet my expectations. I will definitely stick with Boxer Ramen as the best ramen in Portland. 
2364 3 Everyone here is super friendly and the food and beverages are delicious. The space is clean and modern, and although it's semi-hipster, it's welcoming to everyone. I love their bagels and chai lattes. The only thing I have to dock a star for is the steep prices! 
2365 4 Everything we tried was amazing!!! The octopus appetizer and Mediterranean salad were absolutely delicious. Staff went above and beyond to ensure one guests selections were gluten free. An excellent night. 
2366 0 Don't waste your time unless you want to be in an immature environment where you wait 30 minutes to get a drink and risk getting stabbed. No thank you. Avoid this place and go downtown. 
2367 3 Great, great margaritas and cool atmosphere, but the food was just decent for the price. Chips and guacamole were good though, so I'd just recommend this place for drinks and appetizers 
2368 2 played music as well as showed the game(s) of the day, rather than playing the TV audio. interior and service were nice enough on a saturday early evening in october. seems like a great place to spend a nice summer afternoon sitting outside. 
2369 2 I have only ever been on the spectating side of things but I appreciate the fact they have beer on tap and some tables and bleachers to watch the games from. 
2370 4 Very successful experiments in pizza-topping combinations!! 'nuff said. Well, almost. Also worthy of mention: unpretentious atmosphere, clean, warm/welcoming interior, yummy salads, good thin crusts, and occasionally, you can get some tasty Sangria here. 
2371 4 I found this cute furniture shop by accident on a sunny day. I was inspired to decorate my home. The store has styles that are hip for whatever your decorating personality is. I was very enchanted and inspired. 
2372 3 Took to go... Easy in and out.... Mac and cheese was alright.... Potato salad was delicious 
2373 3 12/29/07: great bakery for taiwanese baked treats, we picked up several buns and pastries and enjoyed them. 
2374 2 Decided to call and complain in person and was apologized to and given a free alignment, which I thought I had done in the first place, but appreciated none the less. So slightly more satisfied, I guess. 
2375 3 You have to go here for taco Tuesday's. The steak tacos and the Buffalo chicken are my favorites! 
2376 4 I can't recommend the Good Earth Cafe enough! This was my favorite place while spending a weekend in Portland. The biscuits and gravy were awesome and filling while not being too heavy (I know, that sounds contradictory, doesn't it?) and the owner is so sweet and friendly! 
2377 4 Don't change a thing, Eurasia!! This place has quickly risen to my top 3 favorites in Austin with just one visit! 
2378 3 can you say yummy Sushi that is super fresh and not overpriced. What more can you ask for.. 
2379 2 Had a great time during SXSW here but the drink prices were a little steep considering how watered down they were. The decor was super cool and I loved the slide. Definitely will be back when Im in town! 
2380 4 Phenomenal!!! The best Mexican food! The pastor and chicken tacos were absolutely amazing! Very quick and friendly service. The sauces were an excellent compliment to the tacos!! 
2381 0 As a Chinese guy, I should say taste of this restaurant's hotpot is boring. Worst than make hotpot at home. Eating at here is waste of time. 
2382 3 Breakfast tacos all day! Their other tacos are good as well, but the breakfast tacos are outstanding. And filling. And cheap! Only outdoor seating which can be hard 8 months out of 12, but well worth it. 
2383 3 Family friendly dining. Owned by a very friendly family of hard working people who serve with good Mexican food tucked away in a strip mall. They have a terrific happy hour and a full bar with extraordinary margaritas. 
2384 4 I love Driftwood Coffee! I am so grateful this great spot is in my neighborhood. The coffee is always delicious (ask for coffee ice cubes in the summer!), it's usually very quiet for working or chatting with a friend, and the owner couldn't be kinder. 
2385 2 It's ok. I don't like the atmosphere, or lack thereof. The meat is average for Texas BBQ, and the sides were just ok. 
2386 3 Amazing service. Wonderful ambiance. Some what costly for the quality but it's great Indian food. 
2387 4 The honey on tap was very good! The tupelo honey is AMAZING! Brought them all the way back to NYC. The honey leaked a little bit, but bottle did not break. 
2388 4 Super friendly staff, terrific theatre, very underrated and when here it feels like a well kept secret. 
2389 4 Great company to deal with. Very friendly personnel and very hard polite workers. Went smooth as silk from quote to finish. Replaced 150' of storm damaged fence. Very pleased with install and timeliness. Would definitely recommend to everyone. A++ work and job satisfaction. Thanks for the great looking fence :) 
2390 4 Elvis is a master of his craft. He hooks up a super fresh cut every time. I've been going to Euphoria for two or three years now and have never been disappointed. He's very busy though, so be sure to book an appointment online. 
2391 3 I continue to use enterprise for my car rentals. This location is super convenient and you've got to love the late night drop off here! Before renting here make sure to check if your employer has a discounted rate! 
2392 4 Love this place! We've eaten here a number of times and they never disappoint. Food is fresh and well prepared. The ceviche is especially good, and the tacos are a favorite. We always finish with the tres leches cake. Very lovely outside dining, right by the square in Decatur. 
2393 4 My review is on the food itself and not on customer service. Got the Thai fried rice with curry powder added and pa nang curry - both chicken. The curry mixed with the rice was amazing. Definitely was surprised that It came from a food truck. 
2394 4 i'm obsessed with mcmenamins everything. this is my closest location, and it is a very lovely spot on the columbia river. mmmm cajun tots !!!! 
2395 3 Great place for you to go outside away from the tv! Perfect for place to play on your iPad or cell phone! But really the park has some really cool garden sculptures that are great for making inappropriate pictures of. For sure you need to check it out. 
2396 4 A must go! Delicious pastries! The waiter was super patient to tell what everything was. Cafe con Leche wonderful warm and wake me up! If I am back this way I will come here! Shop is very quaint. 
2397 4 I probably eat here once a week the food is so good. Its cook to order so its always fresh never had a problem with my order and the staff is always very helpful and nice definitely would recommend it if you like good soul food. 
2398 2 This is small bowling alley with a huge bar. They place is well kept with the exeption of the shoes and balls. The lanes are polished and in great shape. The snacks/pizza are really good. 
2399 3 Update to my previous review. No longer a fan of their shoyu ramen (bland). I only like their kimchee ramen! 
2400 4 Excellent haircuts at market price! My go to salon! They fixed my disastrous haircut from a previous hole in the wall 
2401 0 Very dark,loud kitchen,bad tables,kind of felt like I was at a strip club buffet.boo, corporate restaurants are horrible. 
2402 4 Great overall experience with this company. Mike came out on time to give a very competitive offer. When it came time for install, Dennis and his crew did a great job and everything was done on time and according to plan. 
2403 3 Destination donuts, breakfast bake and fresh baked cookies yum! Try the Snowville latte it's worth the extra money! 
2404 4 Charming small restaurant with great food. Kids will eat their vegetables here because it tastes great and is not overly salty. Price is great too. I can understand why the 365 other people who previously reviewed gave it a pretty high rating. 
2405 4 Delicious and fresh. Love this place. The spicy coconut sauce is my favorite. A great twist on bowls. 
2406 0 Worst food ever and over charged not Worth it .. it is more like fast food, shouldn't be charged that much Ripped off! 
2407 4 I had the best experience today. Not only did the employee come out to my car to see what bulb I needed, but he installed it for me. 5* for customer service, thank you! 
2408 2 They have good food, but is seriously not the same without Crazy Bitch Bingo every Wednesday night!!!! 
2409 4 Amazing food, charming service. Get a meat dish and don't miss the lentils. Absolutely love this place. 
2410 4 I had the most pleasant experience in car buying ever! The sales team and everyone else involved was very professional and pleasant. There was NO haggling and we walked away with the perfect car to fit our budget. Thanks JD!!! 
2411 1 Great location unless you stop on your way to work. You will wait until they decide they are ready to open! This is just reviewing the Amazon locker location. I wouldn't shop this time of morning, but it would sure be nice if I could have picked up my package 
2412 3 These are the kinds of places that are supposed to be terrible: in a touristy mall, chintzy "Greek" font, etc., etc. ....but they have the best damn dolmades! Seriously amazing. That's the only thing I had there but, bro, they off da hizzle. Tellin you, go get em! 
2413 0 There is no in Joy in joysticks... We were really excited about this new venue; however the service was atrocious. We were NOT acknowledged or greeted at the bar. 
2414 4 Connected to ceekside. This park is well shaded even if not concerned about that this time of season. Excellant creeks you can even wade in them. A storybook path which changes yearly. The playgrpund equipment is for all ages. A shelterd barbeque area as well as tennis courts. 
2415 4 Loved my experience! Second time there and I tried the Crawford Pistolettes and they were absolutely tasty! This is a seasonal item, but great! 
2416 4 Completely SAVE my Saturday!!! Got a 2-hour massage on a same day booking and had an amazing experience from the phone call to end!!!! 
2417 4 They carry Spella coffee at Nostrana. Best espresso I have ever had. 
2418 3 Looking for some take out late and found this place through google Reviews were decent so took a chance Food was hot, fresh and good. Will definitely go back 
2419 4 Best prices I could find in town - and I did my research. Good selection and super attentive service. Centrally located, pleasant people and installation was just right, at a time that was most convenient to us. 
2420 3 This place is 90% female targeted, but they also have have lots of swanky, but expensive (read $200) mens jeans. 
2421 3 We tried 3 dishes all 3 were good. Unfortunately instead of coke we got cherry coke. I'm curry there wasn't enough meat. Over all good experience 
2422 3 Stopped here one night cause nothing else was open and it was a really good place. The wings were really good, lots of flavors to choose from and they have games you can play. Highly recommend if you're in the area. 
2423 3 Wonderful very local coffeehouse with "Mother Earth" overtones. Food was very good, coffee was excellent, atmosphere great. Will be back. 
2424 3 I love the yellow veggie curry from here!! The only thing I don't like is there's no consistency, different amounts and different veggies every order but overall delicious! 
2425 4 This place is amazing! I could spend hours here, love the used books selection, especially for children's books which are typically so expensive! 
2426 3 My go to place for XLB. Too bad the service isn't too great here, but well... I think their dumplings make up for it. Lol 
2427 4 First coffee stop in Austin. Don't know if I'll bother trying anywhere else. Friendly staff. 
2428 3 i find very nice clothes there on the sale rack price i am not going to mention but it is a very nice place to shop. 
2429 4 The absolute best Pizza in town. One of the top 3 restaurants in Titusville. One of the best restaurants in Brevard county. Great place. 
2430 4 Fabulous the chicken soup was so fresh. It's fresh and earthy. You have to order it. We ordered the Chicago and the California. They were also amazing. This is place makes you feel like your in their home. Delicious! 
2431 4 This museum is a perfect addition to a day trip. It has many unique pieces, but is not nearly as overwhelming or time consuming compared to other museums (i.e. MFA). 
2432 4 Walked in for a quick manicure, Lily was super helpful and quick while being precise! Will definitely come back :) 
2433 4 Outstanding brunch/daytime spot. Service is on point and the food and drink is delicious. Bloody Mary, Fish and Chips, Corned Beef Croquettes, flawless execution. 
2434 4 Good store, usually not to busy. Located on 50 so easy to stop in while running errands. If going here in the morning i recommend drunken monkey for a coffee. 
2435 3 Great vibe. New spot, will come back, sucks I didn't get to use my free hookah-check in 
2436 4 Took my dog for grooming there which we love!! So after a couple of times decided to give the daycare a try. They are wonderful at the daycare. They have so much patience with my hyperactive puppy!! Very happy we found this place 
2437 4 Hugh is amazing! I went in to get my hair dyed with blonde highlights. It looks sooo good now and I get so many compliments! 
2438 4 We loved our stay here! Our girls had an awesome time! Maintenance staff was always very helpful in everything we asked!! We will be returning!! 
2439 2 The service was good. The menu could be a little better to me. But those biscuits are great!! Picked up a few souvenir items from the store while we waited to be seated. All in all,it was ok experience. 
2440 4 Great bbq good whiskey beats most places in PDX although when it's busy the servers get kinda bitchy. Sorry ladies but your a server and you chose to be one. 
2441 3 I love the location, decor, and gin bar menu. Service is great!! It's a little pricey, but worth it. It's a special place with an interesting menu and warm staff. 
2442 2 Our Bourbon sliders were fantastic! We also had a wonderful dessert of chocolate cake and key lime pie and it was wonderful. The only complaint was the slow service; otherwise it was great!! 
2443 4 I can keep this one short and sweet. Longhorns is my favorite steakhouse chain restaurant. This one on Toco Hill is very nice, clean, and delicious. Flo's filet with the Blue Cheese on top is the bees knees! 
2444 4 I tried the poke here and it was delicious! tastes like what I had in Hawaii....the owner was really nice and even has a little prize box for kiddos. they cater too! 
2445 4 Update: since I spoke to the owner via email. Calling for take out, customer service is much better. If you are a Calzone fan, you MUST try one from here, the best I have ever had. 
2446 4 Love this place when Anna Bean is working. She plays the best miley cyrus sound track. She's always uplifting and kind to costumers. Oh the pizza is delish too;) 
2447 4 Great quiet place to chill and grab a cold one (beer, wine, coffee) on a hot day. Awesome and attentive service. 
2448 4 Best lamb tips and BBQ sausage. Pizza is best around. It's a dive. But worth going to. 
2449 3 Good service and good selection (for beer, wine is very limited but that is to be expected at a brewery). AMAZING patio views. 
2450 4 Tri Tip sandwiches are the specialty and they DO NOT DISSAPOINT. Huge amount of steak with onions on a fresh hard roll. Small updated bar area with good happy hour and specials during Blazers games and weekends. 
2451 4 Great tapas, sangria, atmosphere, and staff. I'll be back! Parking is easiest in the public lot behind CVS. 
2452 1 food was bland, and meats hard. Drinks wonderful but small. Don't see any reason to run back. 
2453 4 I love the drinks here and want one for every day. I had the delightful and it was yummy and perfect for a hot summer day. Will definitely be back. 
2454 4 I've ran by this place many times when running the trail and wondered what it was like. I took my daughter and wife for an early lunch on a beautiful day. The food was excellent! Loved the atmosphere and will definitely be returning here again. 
2455 0 Not impressed with the performance by James. Got French tips, paid the usual $36... Didn't last me a week. Won't be returning or referring again. Avoid this place, it's a scam!!! 
2456 4 Excellent. Possibly my favourite theme park. Lots of of info and education on conservation too. 
2457 4 Great food, great atmosphere! Staff was super helpful for a large b-day party gathering. Can't say enough good things about this place! 
2458 3 Great ambiance - dogs love it and they love the menu. Gets crowded on weekends for brunch usually less so during the week. Dogs eat Fred Tuesday. Enjoyed the bar menu good salads and sandwiches 
2459 4 They're amazing! Go there all the time, the soup is the best and so is the beef wrap, and they don't use MSG. I also really like the tropical fruit shaved ice. 
2460 3 Great spot to get some delicious food and then walk trough this unique cemetery. Lots of history and those in the cometary could use the company! 
2461 4 Got a haircut with Nicole and I love it! The place is small and clean. Nicole was friendly but not overly chatty which I like and making an appointment online makes things so easy. I will definitely be returning. 
2462 0 If I could rate it with no stars, I would have. It was the worst take out I've ever had. -Watery beef that looked like dirty bath water -Noodles were overcoked and mushy -Shrimp was ovbiously frozen and not fresh -Green beans were from a can Don't eat here. Ever. 
2463 3 What a great atmosphere to enjoy a nice evening in the sun. All the food is great, but the hummus is better than great. 
2464 4 So good! I honestly cannot get enough. Love the make your own nacho bar. Host staff could be a tad more welcoming. Like the servers 
2465 3 Great muffaletta. Very nice people. 
2466 3 Wonderful pub with creative Tapas. Excellent happy hour value Adult patronage. Outstanding service. I'll definitely be back. 
2467 4 This place is awesome. Their meatball sub is amazing. I saw them making the meatballs on the spot so I couldn't resist. 
2468 2 Nothing special. One bartender at 5:30 on a Friday, two bar backs that could only stand there and apologize for not being able to serve drinks. 
2469 4 Smooth cup of coffee, friendly staff, and DOG FRIENDLY!! I ordered a caramel latte with only two shots instead of the 4 that it comes with. This was a nice treat for me this morning. 
2470 4 This place is amazing and I am very picky. Usually I have to go to the city to find places like this. Food is incredible, service is impeccable. Great date spot. 
2471 3 Their Pumpkin Chai is spot on! The music could afford to be a bit quieter but that is just a personal preference. 
2472 4 I love this place. Good produce and the meat/poultry/fish selections are good too as are the prices!!!! They have a great variety of wines and the bulk foods is yum! Thanks for being here Sun Harvest :) 
2473 4 Everything was excellent, refreshing, and well prepared. We will be back and this place had great service, ambiance, and cocktails! 
2474 0 The food is getting too greasy and gave me headaches..even ate someone's hair that was in the food.. I used to be a fan of Lemon Thai but time to find a new restaurant. 
2475 2 Maybe it was a bad day, but the food was overcooked, the service was just okay, they could have tried harder. The menu while interesting, nothing was worth writing home about on it. 
2476 3 Because it was in-between dinner and lunch, I had the Smores dessert pie and it was very sweet and delicious! 
2477 0 The worst place for Honda service. Tony Yuen is the worst service consultant. Please stay away from this place 
2478 4 We went to Flying Elephant in Portland and in the airport. The breakfast burrito is delicious and they serve stumptown coffee! Can't beat that for breakfast :) 
2479 0 rude on the phone - would not listen when I tired to explain the location of pick up in the time I was on the phone someone requested an Uber car - 3 minutes the car was there - never again 
2480 0 Ordered a chicken burrito bowl. Everything was fine until I got to a giant chunk of RAW chicken. Unacceptable. 
2481 3 Definitely must come and try...no doubt...also other than their all you can eat wide variety, freshly prepared sushi is an excellent Chinese menu. Good reviews from dispatch, columbus underground and columbus alive as well as Yelp...this place is a winner...they will close to remodel in June w a liquor license 
2482 4 Omg I absolutely love it here! Every time I've been it's gotten better and better! Great atmosphere and very nice waitstaff. Also love the bread they serve when you sit! 
2483 1 Cake wasn't bad but service was terrible. They need a healthy serving of better customer service. Plus the box the cake came in looked used. Won't be going back. 
2484 4 I love this place! It has a wonderful J. Cash themed decor. I have seen some great free shows here. There patio area is my favorite part of the bar. The prices are GREAT, and they have a wonderful beer selection. Highly Recommended! 
2485 4 Went for late lunch. Service was great. Pretty standard pub fare but all was very well executed. Would definitely recommend based on first visit. 
2486 1 The lo mein was good. The pepper steak had onions in it, which is a travesty. Not only that, but the onions were not thoroughly sauteed! Egg roles were so-so. Not going back. 
2487 1 I called to order a pizza for delivery and they just said no. They were backed up. Good for them but I had the time to wait and they wouldn't do it. Bummer. 
2488 4 Came for the first time last night with my roommate. SOOO yummy! ( and we are tough critics!) very southern. Small place, old south feel. Everything was delicious! We tried the chicken fingers, Brunswick stew, fries and fried okra! Definitely will be going back! 
2489 3 Kiki got my colors right. I went from San Francisco to Portland with hesitation speaking with other colorists. I gave her my numbers and everything went great! 
2490 3 Clean good Mexican food restaurant with a lively colorful decor. Lots of choices of entrees and sauces. Great location within walking distance of many Salem attractions 
2491 2 Fun place and pretty great food. Great place to bring out of town guests. 
2492 3 My girls and I all ordered individual pizzas, all good. The classic, farmer's market, and meat one I believe. My daughters love this place, 2nd time to Uno but first time at this location. Service was good. 
2493 4 The oysters are absolutely amazing. We ordered two to try then ordered a half dozen. These are a must have. The empanadas are also pretty good. Ask for a side of chimichuri sauce. 
2494 4 So much fun- the historians were wonderful and the tea was great! One of the best tours we have done! 
2495 0 Epically slow service. Employees appear to be in super slo motion with no clear direction. Lack of leadership. 
2496 0 Okay, after all the talk, this was the biggest restaurant dissapointment I've had in quite some time. The food was horrible and the service and wharehouse decor are the pits. Am I missing something? 
2497 3 Pretty yummy. Reasonable prices. Interesting dishes. The food didn't blow my mind and not as yummy as the Vietnamese food I had in Hanoi this year but pretty good. The variety of dishes and the novelty of the dishes was a definite plus. 
2498 3 Wine tastings have a lot of sweet white and reds. I wish they had more dry options but overall this place is awesome for drinks, apps, and full courses. I havent had dessert just yet but that just gives me another excuse to go back :). 
2499 3 Great sushi for North Austin. Service is a little eh but sushi itself is fresh and reasonably priced 
2500 3 They have a fresh baked --brownie -- with ice-cream which is the booooooom 
2501 4 Amazing food. Coming from Colombian in-laws, the Bandeja Paisa is superb. 
2502 3 The restaurant does a good job at dim sum classics, such as shrimp dumpling and shao Mai. Their curry flavored Singapore fried noodle is very unique and delicious as well. Clean dining environment and credit cards acceptance are another plus. Overall, great dining experience. 
2503 4 Excellent service. I was able to schedule a move on fairly short notice, and Drew and Chris were quick, friendly, and professional. They finished up well within the time estimate l had been given. 
2504 3 neighborhood friendly place with taste exactly what you would expect. Yummy and real Italian feel. 
2505 3 Came in from out of town for a wedding and MacKenzie did my blow out. She is awesome!! 
2506 4 The biscuits and gravy is my favorite. Spicy sausage and huge portion with 2 eggs over easy. Heaven. 
2507 4 Amazing thin crust brick oven pizza.The SPICY SHRIMP PIZZA is the best. I really recommend the fried asparagus appetizer. The prices are very reasonable ranging from 13 to $18 for the pizza which is enough for two. 
2508 1 I was excited to try this place... however it fell in disappointment as their XLBs were juicy but lacking that flavor. Please do not get their tiny a$$ portion lunch special. I left hungry... I could've went for another lunch. Their desserts that come with the special weren't anything appealing. 
2509 4 Awesome, on point service (and ne'er a more competent candidate for No-Shavember...). See The Omniscient Beard [Shane]. He gets to the crux of things quickly and explains them SIMPLY as he goes. 
2510 3 Good coffee, yummy breakfast tacos, long line but we got our food quickly! My first time in Austin, but I've noticed there are a lot of vegan and vegetarian options around town. 
2511 3 Food is good and service was quick. Although some items are more expensive, the traditional noodles are affordable and the spices (if you ask for them) give a great flavor that complements the food nicely. Nice touch: You get tea with your order! 
2512 2 Good spot to hit up after a softball game (or the like) when you're greasy and slimy just like the food. $1 each for a few bud lights... can't beat that 
2513 3 mmm ice cream! Expensive but yummy! Really cute inside, very colorful and fun. Small kids area in back. Go to the back of the store and get in line to order your ice cream. Lots of cones & cakes selection. Lots of parking available. 
2514 3 Best steak in Orlando (back when I ate it), all sides were fantastic. They warmly recognize birthdays/anniversaries. I wish it were not in a strip mall on SLR and the interior while "nice" isn't exactly cozy or remarkable. 
2515 1 This place service was horrible but the food was good and the prices are great. We went one Saturday they said that the serve was running late so the cooks were serving the food in their dirty apron, just unprofessional. I will say that the shrimp and grits are delicious!! 
2516 4 This pizza is the besttttt!!! After living in Austin for over a year and my friends telling me to try it I finally did. It's really good and worth it! I will definitely be going back to try other things on their menu 
2517 0 If you're looking for the charm of the old Green Pastures, I'm sorry to say that it is GONE. 
2518 4 I couldn't be happier with the service we received today! Thank you for making our move so seamless. We'll recommend you to anyone! 
2519 4 Chef's dinner tonight with my wife and 4 friends. Absolutely superb in every way. Service was excellent. The food is so incredible and unique. I highly recommend ! 
2520 2 Eh. Just OK. Food was pretty good. Beer list is great. Service is meh. Nothing really makes this place stand out to me to go back. 
2521 4 I have no complaints. If you go you have to try their Thai iced tea, I've had better only at one place in my life. The wait staff is awesome and really make the experience great. 
2522 4 Holy heck! This place is great. Forget that it's in an airport. Super meal. The open face meatloaf with spinach bacon BBQ and a fried egg was impressive. 
2523 0 Pulled into the drive - thru at 12:04 this afternoon. It's currently 12:35 & we just got our food! Maybe I'm mistaken but, I was under the impression that fast food was supposed to be...I don't know... FAST!!! We weren't even given a receipt with our order! 
2524 4 Dr. English is great and I especially like the massages. Kat is a miracle worker, not in the traditional way, but in the sense that I feel like Helen Keller after my massage is over. 
2525 3 This is my new favorite place, those tacos are from heaven. Management are engaged music is awesome. Bathrooms were dirty though I still will be back 
2526 4 Great tacos Found this place couple years back and can't speak enough about their food and service! It's a mom and pop joint that knows what they're doing! Do yourself a favor, and check it out. Clean, great food, and excellent customer service 
2527 0 Since when is 18% tip automatically added for a party of just two? UPDATE: Restaurant Owner 'alex Z.' Khayyam wrote on 3/31/2012: "Typical groupon customer" Your food does not match up to your attitude, judging from your responses on Yelp. 
2528 3 Really nice trails, great views if you go upto Pittock Mansion. Free to walk the grounds. Great large green space in the city! 
2529 4 Outstanding Italian restaurant on a side street in the North End. Great date spot with wonderful service. The restaurant isn't too loud either so you can have a conversation at normal volume. 
2530 4 This is the real deal. Avoid going on the weekends for dinner, unless you're willing to wait. Even during the week you may need to wait, but usually less than 10 minutes. 
2531 4 Justin's the man!! The trainers here will she'd the weight right off of you. Everyone here is super friendly and patient and understanding of your workout needs 
2532 4 Puffy Taco plate....AMAZING....the rice and charro beans are almost as good as my mama's. I love this place, prices are great, they serve you enough to feed an army. Staff is great!! 
2533 3 Great seafood. I hate the picnic tables and always have a sore back after eating. 
2534 4 Fantastic Indian food. Great atmosphere, great presentation and great value. Will definitely be back. 
2535 4 This is my favorite restaurant at Islands of Adventure! Everything is delicious and the portions are huge...more than enough for sharing. My favorite is the Chicken Tortilla Wrap with fries. 
2536 4 Came in for a birthday dinner. Service was excellent, food was delicious, and the drink and wine list has everything! Fully deserving of the great rating. 
2537 2 I would give this place another try I ordered the chicken nachos and my boyfriend ordered a burger with fries My nachos came out cold the first time and the server got me some fresh ones which tasted much better All in all our food was fresh and decent 
2538 3 The homemade pickles & drinks in mason jars are amazing. I also had a few good appetizers & enjoyed the music. Great wait staff with prompt service. 
2539 0 Not impressed and not coming back. Service was good, the food was mediocre, the greek potatoes were nastee. 
2540 3 Excellent spot to watch the game, have some great craft beer and hang out with friends. I had great service, and the jerk chicken dish I ordered was juicy tender and tasty. 
2541 4 Such a beautiful hotel with friendly staff! Great location too. Can't wait to return! 
2542 3 Real good solid pizza, delivery was fast. But the caeser salad was underwhelming, didn't even have a lemon. 
2543 4 I've worked at 4 coffee shops. This was seriously one of the best damn cups of coffee I have had in a long time. The barista even made a little heart shape into the foam. Worth the price and the hassle of finding a place to park downtown. 
2544 2 Just ok! Definitely better sushi in this town. I used to love this place, then took a friend and was actually embarrassed that I had been talking it up for so long.. 
2545 4 Fast, friendly service. Straightforward pricing and clear explanation of what was needed to fix my phone. I am overwhelmingly satisfied and know exactly where I will go with iPhone trouble in the future. 
2546 3 Had a fantastic pie here with my son last week. Half plain half pep. This would be a standard pie on most of the east coast but here its for sure one of the better options in town. $30 for the pie, a beer, a coke and a cookie. 
2547 3 Great theater! I brought the movie and dinner deal. The meal was ok but the theater was great. Clean leather rocking chair and the temperature in the theater was perfect. 
2548 4 Fantastic food and service is first rate. Prices a touch high, but for a special occasion, my wife and I agree, it is worth every penny. This is our new favorite restaurant. We particularly enjoyed the appetizers and cocktails. 
2549 4 I love this place. Everything they make is amazing. Love the lobster roll. Amazing onion rings. 
2550 4 Employees are so nice. Food is very consistent and delicious! I come here on my lunch break a lot and am never disappointed. Cashier makes sure you've got everything you need the entire time that you're there. Overall a great restaurant 
2551 4 Best pepperoni pizza I have had outside of NYC! Italian subs are also delicious. Spicy peppers (on request) and the way they slice the meat and cheese super, super thin make the sandwich. 
2552 4 Get here early, it gets packed! Obviously it get packed for a reason. Everything Ive had here is hands down amazing! Its definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the area. 
2553 1 Not really fresh food, salsa smelled stale.. chicken is dry and not grilled fresh. The waiters were not awake at 8am. Not going to this place again. 
2554 3 Awesome! Same great taste as Boston but prices are cheaper. The dollar stretches in Peabody. Got a venti for the price if a grande. Minus the fifth star cuz there was a vagrant outside knocking on my car window for spare change. That sorta put me off 
2555 3 I love that it's around the Buckhead area, parking is behind the shops/building (with fee). The noodles are fantastic, I love the broth, & the fresh ingredients. Yummy for my tummy! 
2556 3 Sifrina Arapas (chicken) was very tasty. We had Yuca Fritas that were cut like French fries. A bit thin. I like them with a little more bulk to each one. Skirt steak tacos were yummy according to one member in the party. Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. 
2557 4 Had the chicken shawarma in a pita and it was delicious and very filling. They stuffed it to the max! Recommend stopping by if you're at KSM. 
2558 3 If one must have breakfast at the airport, perhaps due to hangover reasons, Flying Elephants makes a pretty good breakfast burrito. I felt that their beans were, for lack of a better word, pleasingly beany (legumy?) which helped settle my stomach on a rough morning. 
2559 4 So good. Michelada was spicy and perfect. The 04 platter was delish. Excellent sides and an interesting menu. They have gluten free fried chicken!! Service was friendly and attentive. I'll be back again and again. 
2560 1 A small joint, I could see it being a great place to hang out in the right company. Easy access from the subway. The beer selection could use some diversification. This is my main reason for the low review. Also, it took a little while to get served. 
2561 4 First time today at Snow City with my 4 year old grandson. We loved watching the ice cream get rolled, and there was enough for both of us. He chose three toppings: rainbow sprinkles, M&M's, and Gummy bears. I ate around them! 
2562 4 The staff is very nice, fast and the food was fabulous! We had the guacamole and it was just perfect. I highly recommend this place for the high quality food and staff. The cost was about average. 
2563 3 So glad HEB opened this store with their amazing cafe near mueller! At the cafe: the ribs and brisket are very tasty. I also tried the chicken Preston pizza and it was delicious. The coffee needs work. 
2564 1 The food is delicious, but one lady works over there and she is quite rude. Qdoba should definitely consider terminating her job. She was there working at Monday 21st April 10 pm and I went there and she was very very rude. 
2565 4 The food was great!! I stop by this spot while I was in Austin getting a break from Dallas floods and rain today. I had the black talipia fish tacos. I highly recommend this spot! 
2566 0 Very uncomfortable seats Bad food Unhelpful staff Beer is way overpriced Screens look awful 
2567 4 It's incredibly good food for the price. This is my neighborhood take-out place. The space is great to work from when the restaurant is slower. When it's busy, the wait is still never that long. 
2568 4 Excellent boats, wonderful customer service, and fair prices. What more could a person want? 
2569 1 Just a normal breakfast. Service is SLOW!!!!! They seemed more concerned about socializing with 'the locals' than taking care of everyone else. Eggs were getting cold before the toast was brought to our table. Probably won't go back. 
2570 0 This is probably by far the worst fried rice and teriyaki rice I have ever had in my life. The snow pea was raw and the fried rice is all wet and sticking together. I don't expect it to be good but not this bad. 
2571 4 Spendy, but great quality and amazing ambiance! Great for lunch on weekdays with their lunchtime bento boxes. 
2572 1 I hadn't been to A Fuddruckers in years because there aren't any close by. We were on this side of town and decided to take our four boys. The condition of this location is pitiful. Service slow. The food still just as good as I remember. I wouldn't go back. 
2573 4 Just had an ahi tuna burger and a kale salad. So so good. Fresh and filling with a great and complex mix of flavors. My best meal in my five days in Austin. 
2574 4 Amazing Food and Fantastic service. What a gem! Nice & Quiet residential area - tucked away in the Club House. So happy we found this place. We will definitely be back. 
2575 3 Right next to my house, this is our go-to take out place when we're feeling lazy and wanting some good thai food! We've tried quite a bit on the menu and it's always solid! Thumbs up! 
2576 4 I feel like I can rotate on their variety of freshly made soups all year long and not get tired of doing so. The chicken chorizo soup is to die for. Plain and simple. 
2577 4 I have gotten my hair done here for years. I have never been disappointed and the price is fantastic! 
2578 2 This is a small place that we came across on a nice day. The portions were a good size and the pizza was basic. Nothing to write home about. The indoor seating is very limited. The bathroom was not working and was very small. 
2579 1 Tradewinds restaurant in Marriott's Renaissance Orlando Sea World has friendly staff and tandard chicken order was good. Small portion and extremely slow (over 30 minute) food delivery time for lunch was disappointing. Approximately $15 a la carte dish. 
2580 4 I was walking by this place yesterday, theo greeted me outside & so I decided to stop by. I was not disappointed! Fantastic service, food & value! The place was packed, but everyone was friendly & patient. I might try their authentic Brazilian cuisine later. 
2581 4 Who knew something this cool could be in Vancouver? What a great store, and my experience with the sales staff was that they were charming and quite easy to chat with! Go buy cool stuff here! 
2582 4 Always the same great food & the great service. Crabtinni was off the menu but the chef still made for me and my wife. Had a great time and really enjoyed the food. Definitely we will come back as we always do. Milton gets Thanks for your service. 
2583 3 Ate here on August 4th. Food was very good service was excellent price wasn't bad. Great place on a sunny summer day to get some good seafood 
2584 3 I eat here when ever I am in the neighborhood. I just wish I lived closer. It is so difficult to find a good traditional hamburger place, but this one has stayed true to its roots. It is a blast from the past, and just wonderful. 
2585 4 Excellent food every time. Staff is very polite and timely. Great lunch buffet too. I'm a frequent customer and have to say that each time I am very pleased with the service and quality of the food. 
2586 0 Absolutely terrible service. Been here multiple times and had multiple issues. Most of the time the bad service was from the orange haired lady that looks like a manager 
2587 4 Very laid back vibe with eclectic menu (venison meatloaf and Bake Brie at same place) and great drink menu Newly graduated professionals sitting shoulder to shoulder with Baby Boomers enjoying a nice peaceful evening with good food and drink- this is your place if that sounds inviting 
2588 3 The Oregon Cherry Pie was awesome. The chai was awful. Tasted like they forgot the tea. 
2589 4 A gem of an ice cream shop. The ice cream is great. As a bonus it is set near a beautiful lake and other restaurants. Worth the trip and way better than any chain ice cream shops. 
2590 4 Good place for lunch if you are constrained by time. Wings and gyros are pretty good. Staff is fast and on top of it. Thanks! 
2591 3 Cute and hip juice bar in a great location. Pretty big menu to choose from. Staff was friendly and engaging. Prices seemed a little high. Smoothies were yummy! Got the Pine Ango Beet Tango speciality smoothie (strawberry, mango, pineapple, beet juice, orange juice). 
2592 4 The bacon wrapped dates were delicious! Our fish was delicious and flaky and the the bartender made a tasty pisco sour! 
2593 3 The Steel Slider was amazing! Perfectly cooked and was one of the best tasty burgers I've had in awhile! Classic Lime Margarita tasted great as well, was a bit strong, but I like strong drinks. Great outdoor seating patio, would be an awesome place during the summertime. Highly recommend! 
2594 4 Excellent cookie ice cream sandwich! Yes, you could just get a cookie but why, when you can get the perfectly heated cookie with rich vanilla ice cream? Highly recommend this for a cheap desert! 
2595 4 Seriously fantastic! Some of the most unique burger combinations I've ever seen. Great tasting. You can upgrade your meat to 100% grass fed. You can avoid the long lines by going during their slower hours, but even still, it is worth the wait. 
2596 0 5 stars for having the perfect Halloween costume [flapper girl] in the window display AND a friggin' swexy dress on the mannequin right next to it. Negative 5,000 stars for not putting the items in the window display on sale until 2.5 weeks later. 
2597 4 Sooooo yummy! We ate the philly sandwich, fries, kale salad, and chocolate fruit donut. I am not usually a fan of jackfruit but that was one of the best phillys I've ever had, the kale salad too it was all very flavorful. The staff was also very helpful! 
2598 4 Red Lobster ist eine Resto Kette über die ganze USA. Es gibt ein oder zwei nicht Fischgerichte auf der Karte. In seiner Gruppe ein preiswertes Resto für Lobster Gerichte. Also keine Life Lobster!!! Die sind preislich 3 mal teurer. Guter Platz kenne ich quer über die USA 
2599 4 Great food for a great price in a small space. Call ahead and get your name on the list because this place is the local brunch spot. 
2600 4 I try to come in here every Saturday to snatch up some of their amazing gluten free donuts. I've had their chai tea latte and lavender latte. The owner is super friendly as well! 
2601 3 Super delicious chocolates and pastries. Their Pistachio pastry is absolutely amazing, especially with all the nuts on top. Would definitely go again to try more sweet goodies. 
2602 4 I couldn't add a better review! This is my new favorite place. Good wine, amazing food! I went in during the day, friendly bartender and super friendly manager/owner. Again... Amazing food! Try the Brussels sprouts 
2603 4 What a great store with tons of selections! The people who work there are friendly and helpful, though I wish they'd have more sales/clearance items.:-) 
2604 3 Good haircut, clean shop, friendly service. That is what I expect from a barber shop. The price for a cut was reasonable. 
2605 1 I thought this would really be better. They have a nice selection of sauces, but in all it is lacking in quality and overprieced for what you get. The kids meals are expensive as are the vegatarian options. I would not come back here and prefer Benihana's over BD's anytime. 
2606 4 Excellent food and service. The 12 West Burger is a staple if you enjoy a great gourmet burger with crispy sweet potato fries. Excited to hear the owner will be opening a new restaurant right next door! 
2607 3 Hands down some of the best Italian food I've ever had. Sweet potato puree with my chicken was heavenly. 
2608 4 Came here for Sunday brunch with a group of friends and had a fantastic time. The food and drinks were the perfect cure to combat a night of partying. Ovis was a great server. Definitely recommend this place and will be returning. 
2609 4 Our usual coffee shop when visiting Austin. Several locations, but this one has the best seating. 
2610 4 The food here is absolutely incredible. Delicious. The service is amazing as well and more than accommodating. Chicken and beef super shawarma!!!!!! 
2611 1 Did takeout on a Monday nite. Food was poorly prepared and cold. Nothing like reviews. Hopefully caught it on a bad night. Definitely will no return. 
2612 4 This is the best Chinese restaurant I've encountered in a long time. Friendly staff, fast service and delicious food. Oh, did I mention the A rating? That was the most important thing to me. 
2613 4 This place is amazing! The lunch schnitzel with potato cakes and sauerkraut is delicious. You can tell everything is fresh and made from scratch! 
2614 3 I went on a date to the Elephant Room one Sunday. I had a pretty good time. There was a great jazz band playing. Very cool ambience and a nice staff. I will be back soon. 
2615 4 Awesome experience!Friendly, professional, plenty of parking was available. The office was very relaxing and welcoming. Jazz was very knowledgeable, listened to my request and the outcome of my services was done better than I imaged. Very satisfied with my lashes!! I am now a regular customer, and highly recommend! 
2616 0 Let me sum this up in a really simple way: 10XGreat Music - 5XIdiotic Staff - 5XIdiotic Crowd = 0 Safe yourself the pain and head over to a classier place... 
2617 3 Immaculately clean, friendly staff, great food. This brings a sense of community to the growing Clermont area. The menu reflects enormous selection of breakfast items. There is coffee to go! How amazing is that? 
2618 1 Not worth it! Dry! The pizza is underwhelming. $60 for 3 1 foot!!!! The Margherita pizza \ has very little mozzerella, basel, and sauce. Same with the other two pizzas. 
2619 3 We had the chicken potstickers and pepperoni extreme flatbread pizza....delicious! I also tried the draft root beer and was quite happy with it. Great service, as well! 
2620 4 Just had an hour massage with taryn and it was amazing. She hit all the spots that were bothering me and I'm totally pain free now. Great experience. 
2621 3 Great selection and decent cuisine. Portion is a bit small and the lines are long. But it's usually worth the wait! Waffles are superb! 
2622 2 Not a bad place if you happen to be nearby. Not a place you'd travel to get to. Yup, it's the ultimate 3 star bar. 
2623 3 Great place for lunch. little on the high side but the food is good. Parking is a challenge. 
2624 4 Great selection of pretzels and craft beer and friendly staff. I recommend this restaurant 
2625 4 High quality coffee shop with delicious food options. The employees are very nice and go the extra mile to make your experience extraordinary. 
2626 0 Normally I love this place except today- the chicken shawarma meat was spoiled (cannot make this up) and about halfway through eating my salad I was so nauseous. So grossed out. 
2627 4 Food was delicious Staff was awesome I even had them open a fresh coconut so I can drink the water 
2628 4 The lines ups are really bad during busy times but it's like that anywhere in van. Great deals but be prepared to drop a couple hundred bucks each time you walk in! Food court is solid. Amazing value hot dog and poutine :) 
2629 0 This place is location right off of international drive and sandlike. Super slow service. Not enough baristas to keep up with demand. I've been to a lot of Starbucks in Orlando and this is by far the worst. 
2630 3 They are typically out of everything early in the day, but if you do get there before the big rush the donuts themselves are absolutely fantastic! In terms of quality this palace beats voodoo any day. 
2631 4 Great food, always hot and fresh. I wish they had more vegetarian options though. good price. It gets very busy and loud so eat early is possible. 
2632 2 Only 3 stars because nothing terrible, nothing spectacular... typical Bar Louie. Food was good and prompt. Drink specials were pretty decent - pitchers of Sangria were delicious. Service was friendly. 
2633 4 Best bubble tea/slushee/sweet drink place I've ever been to. I really enjoy their fruity drinks (anything with mango) and also their cold horlicks and ovaltine. All the fruity drinks are made with fresh fruit, portions are generous and prices are great! Nothing much else to ask for. 
2634 2 I had amazing service while I was here. Ordered to go. The empanada was good but my cuban pork dish and sides werent that great. Not much flavor and not worth the price 
2635 4 food was excellent, the owner himself asked us if we enjoyed our food and then he said he has something for us, he ends up bringing out a new chocolate dessert on the house. He is a super sweet, caring guy and it definitely shows. Thank you !!! 
2636 4 The trendy chefs in Atlanta can learn from these guys how to do it right Even the bread was perfect. Totally coming back soon 
2637 4 This is a great restaurant and a super addition to our neighborhood. We really needed a classy adult environment in this neighborhood. 
2638 3 Best views in ATL !!! I had floor 63 and loved it. The room is a bit small for my taste. Room service is awesome but pricey. Be aware the parking is about $20 so park in the parking nextdoor which is only $8 
2639 4 Best lunch I've had in a while!!! We waited 30-45 total in line/for the food and it was worth every second!!!! I will be back. The dumplings and crispy chicken tacos are to die for!!!!! 
2640 4 A true iconic diner/pharmacy. Great freaking shakes and great cheeseburgers. They are small so their menu is only burgers and sandwiches. 
2641 4 The chicken coconut soup is freaking amazing best in GA. The staff was great and so was the restaurant as a whole 
2642 0 Sauce on chicken piccata was way too heavy. Almost like jello. Flavor was bland. You got a large portion of chicken but thick, flavorless sauce was just too much. 
2643 4 This place is amazing, it is so good!! And the price is right, had 1lb shrimp and 1/2 mussels for $19! Nice and cozy restaurant go before 4:00 on weekends to prevent a wait! Even if there is a waiting time, it's worth it! 
2644 4 This is a great repair shop. Everyone is is friendly & experienced. The shop has been around for over a decade. I found my new shop! 
2645 0 Bring your own lunch if you plan to eat here, service is crappy. Waited a while and finally left without anyone every coming to take our order for food or drinks. We will not be back. 
2646 4 We had a lovely night at Paley's place. The place is nice, the staff friendly and the food was simply amazing. Maybe the best duck and souffle I have ever tasted. 
2647 4 Ozone is a sports bar but they have great live music on the weekend. Fun spot to check out some bands 
2648 3 Very unique, healthy and tasty food. The service was very good as well with the server being very helpful and answering all my questions. I would definitely go again. 
2649 4 My favorites are their bakery! Super delicious!! The drinks are alright! Might be back for the bakery! Love them all!! Btw, this is a quiet place for students who want to do their homework. 
2650 4 Awesome weed tender that showed us a bunch of different varieties and let us sniff around. Super friendly and chill experience! No card needed:) 
2651 4 Great little place! Have some A-mazing pancake options. Tried the blueberry pancakes but realized my mistake when I saw a German baked pancake come out. Missed our mimosas but they made it right and comp'd our drinks. 5 stars even with the hiccup in service. 
2652 0 Wish I could give this place no stars because their staff has some of the worst customer service I've ever seen and I'm a server. 
2653 4 Best pizza I have ever had. The sausage is good too. Don't ask for a menu because thats all they have there. Its also a little out of the way by the airport, but its worth the trip. 
2654 3 I am always a fan of relatively new theaters and have never had a bad experience here. They also boast a digital screen, just ask them to turn the sound up a little. Great little shopping area with plenty of food options. Recommended. 
2655 4 Awesome crepes and super nice staff !!! Try the Greek , the wobbles is awesome really delicious ! 
2656 3 Stopped in Fri evening, not at all busy. Staff very friendly and helpful, nice pleasant, unique interior, really tasty lamb gyro. Liked the Sangria and the happy hour pricing. The menu has only a small number of items, more lunch oriented. Will surely be a repeat customer. 
2657 4 The ultimate dive! Hard to find and hardly ever open. But the freaking sandwiches are amazing. I highly recommend the onion roll on whatever sandwich you choose. The dogs are good but skip them and get a sandwich or 2! 
2658 0 Refused to take a valid DD coupon...and the kid at the register had an attitude about it. 
2659 4 Great place! Tucked away in a quiet part of Boston it's especially good to visit when the weather is good and you can walk in the garden. 
2660 4 Impressive cocktails, excellent (and fresh) sushi makes this a must stop for anyone with a layover, or time to spare waiting for a flight. 
2661 4 I've been seeing Amy for over a year and just had my first appointment with Iulia. She is really sweet, was super fast and did a thorough job. Definitely recommend Wax Loft! 
2662 2 I'm a big fan of their tom yum and gai yaang (the most tender and moist bbq chicken!). The best time to come here is during lunch when their specials are $7.50 for curry, rice and appy. 
2663 4 This is the best UPS store that I've been to. James opened exactly on time, made it easy to return Comcast equipment, and made it very easy to ship packages to California. Couldn't ask for a smoother experience. 
2664 1 Simply over-priced compared to the many other cold-pressed juice places i've been too. I'd say their price is nearly doubled! 
2665 4 Awesome place to drink The bartenders were very friendly and even more helpful. My husband and myself had a chance to meet one of the owners and she was totally awesome. Great place to go for anyone who likes fun mixed drinks or like to try new straight alcohols. 
2666 4 The food is excellent, although the wait for a table took long even with reservations. Also, the portions are very small, but the authentic flavors made up for it all. 
2667 0 I concur with many of these other reviews that they are completely unresponsive. I have left several messages and still have never received a response about a survey. 
2668 4 Gus's fried chicken is the best around. We always come here when we come to visit austin. Always fresh & hot. Great service!! 
2669 4 Great place! First time there was quick and they were very thorough. She explained each step in the cleaning and they had some cool technology there. Everyone was really friendly too. 
2670 3 Amazing to find such a gem in my backyard. Tartine was great. This place is tucked away amongst a bunch of store. Small but delicious. 
2671 0 Love this place, but service is not the same anymore. We've been sitting here for 15 minutes waiting for waitress. 
2672 4 Cheese pizza has been perfected here. Amazing taste, cornmeal crusted pizza for a crunchy crust, the cheese and tomato sauce or delicious. Sausage and pepper pizza is also amazing. 5 stars for food. Have always had takeout, never had the chance to dine in. 
2673 4 We always have a tasty lunch here. Amazing wraps- if you like buffalo chicken- try their spicy chicken wrap -- so delish! Also- the staff is very friendly, they have new things to try! Always pleased with their service. 
2674 3 This place has absolutely gorgeous clothes! BUT....they're really expensive. I like to go and look at them and pretend I can by them. But seriously, around Christmas and things like that the accessories go on sale and then they can be affordable. 
2675 4 Great, low cal, low sugar, inexpensive ice cream shop. Games & toys while you're there and they sell all sorts of other low cal, low fat, low sugar items like dressings, nut butter, chips & crackers. Cool little spot that I hope sticks around! 
2676 3 The Oviedo Marlow's Tavern is really good. Their scratch kitchen is a very nice addition to the Oviedo growth. Our 2 experiences there so far have been tasty, friendly, and very pleasant. 
2677 4 Love this place, the prices are very reasonable. And the customer services are spectacular 
2678 3 This is a huge Shaw's. It's a decent one, too, plus it has an adjacent liquor store, which is helpful. The general Shaw's plan of layouts is a bit weird to me, but aside from that, this is a good store. 
2679 0 One of the worst Vietnamese places in Boston Chinatown. Their portions are the measliest. 
2680 4 It is a great place with a super cool decor. The prices are ok, flexible time on line booking which is wonderful. I saw Courtney and she is nice and makes the customer feel relaxed. Definitely coming again! 
2681 1 First of all, I was disappointed. Very pricey for a Jenny Craig portion size of food. Food was tasty but I have tasted better. Never again. But if you have Money to waste then please do. 
2682 4 Hard to find honest mechanics but look no further. Don actually owns and operates his garage. Get away from the big name chains and use these guys as your local mechanic. 
2683 3 Great atmosphere with excellent authentic Italian dishes. The sides are amazing with the main course. Great service and friendly atmosphere make it a must stop in for people that enjoy Italian. 
2684 4 Very beautiful decor!! Simply amazing!!! 
2685 2 McPeets. On warm nights, you provide picnic tables and booze and nice bartenders. On Chilly nights, the atmosphere is inviting, fun and reliable. Jenga! Close to home. Unpretentious. Cheap. Nice. 
2686 4 Great hotel in great location. Very close to the airport. There are a few eateries in the are but the fare is limited to Fast Food burger and fries or Italian within walking. Hotel is clean and in good order. Staff is friendly and professional. Would definitely recommend. 
2687 4 Just had dinner + drinks for two for only $40. Delicious food, great service, reasonable price. Filling, but not in the "roll me out of here" kind of way. The fish tacos were outstanding, as were the margaritas. 
2688 0 WORSE SERVICE EVER !!!!! Girls at the front desk were so rude and unprofessional we sat for 30 minute and no one came to our table and this is the second time this happens I would have gave it zero star if I could 
2689 3 Nice place, modern but romantic. Good veggie selections. The arancini are not traditional but OK, the gnocchi is also not traditional but great. 
2690 3 Usually only one waitress behind bar, two pool tables, lots of 20 inch screens where you can.t see em, and cheap drinks ONLY on Happy Hour... GETS My VOTE for best DIVE bar....! try the one North in the Domain Area TOO! Same DAMN STYLE... LOL 
2691 4 Love to grab a Yuengling at this place when I'm in Disney! You have to be Baylake DVC member to gain access though. Nice getaway after a long day at the parks. 
2692 4 Amazing and Authentic Mexican Food! I had tortilla soup and a couple of tacos one of alambre and one of carnitas. Everything was really good! 
2693 1 Lamplighter is your typical pub and one of the few places that open late on a weekday. However, service can be a real stinger. 
2694 4 I have eaten a lot of burgers in my day... and I want to champion Austin original restaurants... but this place really is as good as "they" say. Wow! Everything is top notch in this place! 
2695 4 OMG!!!! This is indeed a good burger. All of what I had was good (duck confit nuggets.......ohhh so good) Tasty burgers and not a bad price ( more than a burger joint but well worth it) You need to try this place and experience it on your own. 
2696 0 Very rude staff and manager, did not honor a reservation though we were actually early for our reserved time. 
2697 0 I usually like Baja but not today. The service was quick but I guess my first clue should have been the burrito not being that hot. Well now I'm paying for it. FOOD POISONING...avoid at all cost!!!! 
2698 4 Honestly, I didn't expect much when i picked this restaurant since i never heard of it before. But they surprised me :-) ...the curries are actually very tasty and the beef satay is very good. I am satisfied with this place and for sure will come back again. 
2699 4 I've noticed the Yelp love for this spot for some time now and finally found myself in the neighborhood for lunch today. They have an impressive selection of Bento box lunch specials. The food was delicious and I will definitely be back to try out the Japanese-style tapas. 
2700 4 Loved this venue. It has several places to stand so you can see the band from different angles. Also, they always bring great music to Austin. 
2701 4 Delicious, but get there earlier rather than later if you want the full selection. They had vegan options, too, but we didn't try them. Their buttermilk bars are amazing. 
2702 4 I honestly cannot get enough of their lavender latte! This place is always poppin' during morning and slows down a bit in the afternoon. The food is tasty but on the heavier and more flavorful side. Please do yourselves a favor and order their waffles, you won't regret it. 
2703 4 So good! The sassy gurl hot dog is everything (Mac n cheese on a hotdog best thing ever) The service is great and the quick. Fave new spot on Rainey 
2704 0 Didn't tell me that they canceled my cab, even though I called to double check. Stranded for an hour! Won't use again. 
2705 4 My favorite fried chicken! We always order this for our get-togethers with family and friends and its always a hit! 
2706 0 This place is just crazy my out kids got push stuff stolen. The pizza was ok but cold by the time we got it. Half the stuff doesn't have tickets I took my kids here spent 150 realize they wasnt gettong ticket would not recommend 
2707 4 One of the two best independant bakeries in Cambridge. Their olive bread rocks as well as their sour dough. Best part is visiting the bakery to get the stuff at a discount! check it out on the web at: http://www.iggysbread.com 
2708 3 Second best chocolate chip cookie in Boston (behind Paradise Bakery in the Prudential Center.) I prefer the fudge cookie, but you really can't miss with any of them. Better than any of the other candy stands in Quincy Market. 
2709 4 Great service! They are also great at altering Indian outfits. Have gotten many pieces altered here. I'm a small frame female and they always deliver to perfection. 
2710 4 This is the sister restaurant of Unmaido. Located near Publix. Food was very good, nice clean layout of the restaurant. They also have a room revealed on where they make the ramen. 
2711 4 Very authentic and excellent 100% Italian to the highest degree As good as any in Washington DC 
2712 4 Our experience at La Raines was phenomenal!!! I would recommend this place to any future bride!!! Victoria was so amazing. We left Bridals by Lori and went immediately back to LaRaines to purchase the dream dress!! 
2713 4 Perhaps the best damn bagel in all of New England. Nuff said, especially coming from a Jew from NY. But why is it in Chelsea?! Just one of life's mysteries I guess. 
2714 4 Great vegan selection and creative design and flavor! It's a little odd to be cash only but totally worth checking out and spending some paper money on! 
2715 3 Good place to get your simple cheese pizza or pizza house Greek salad, or toasted Italian sub. Your neighborhood basic pizza place. I like it. Good Italian sub. They make it how I like it! 
2716 4 Enjoyed music on patio, watched the sunset, ate dinner, the best ribeye (28 days wet aged) with white asparagus, corn and candied bacon plus the Seafood and Grits. Atmosphere was wonderful and the food delicious. 
2717 2 The food is fine but we tried the one dollar Long Island ice tea. Don't waste your time, no booze or good taste, it tasted like a sugary kookaid mix. 
2718 2 I went during Dragacon and it was cool. We sat outside and enjoyed the many costumes. The services was good, but the ladies restroom was horrid. They needed cleaning and only 1 stall was working. 
2719 4 This is one of my favorite places to go whenever I'm near altamonte springs. Breakfast burger, crab cakes egg Benedict, French toast and more everything is delicious 
2720 0 Had a craving... Took the kid.. Ate.... Ran for ice Cream to rid us of the grease bomb grease soaked chicken mouth feel afterwards. Trimmed off the extraneous pieces of non chicken fried blobs while eating. Was starving or would have trashed it after bite 1. Truly terrible 
2721 2 Love the enclosed ATM machine that's accessible 24/7. Very convenient location and the interior is pretty clean. ATM sometimes freezes and takes forever though, which is not good, but doesn't really affect the experience too much. 
2722 3 Even though one at Polaris is closer to me. I always come here. Everything tastes better here! 
2723 2 On par with other Chinese BBQ I have had. Nothing stood out, positive or negative. 
2724 3 Ordered 2 rolls for takeout. They were tasty, nicely portioned and the presentation was limited to the to go box , but I'll definitely come back and try other things Very friendly staff 
2725 3 Pad Thai here was good. Very, very busy during lunch hours and on the weekends. Easily the best Thai restaurant in the area that has a ton to choose from. 
2726 3 Saturday Brunch was great. Our party of three got three different items from the menu and all were good. My vegetarian omelette was awesome. Beverages are somewhat costly. The food was excellent! 
2727 0 HORRIBLE delivery service. How does it take an extra hour and a half to deliver something in the SAME town?! Additionally, when you call the restaurant they don't answer their phones. Beyond frustrating! Admittedly the wings are quite good but it is SO not worth it. STAY AWAY! 
2728 0 Bought $100 of gifts items, requested 2 separate bags, staff refused... Offered to pay for the extra bag, was still refused... Was quoted some BS company policy... Lost a customer over a 20cent bag... 
2729 4 great craft burgers and beer! what else do you need? 
2730 4 Such a good value! I got the half size (one cookie and "one" scoop of ice cream) but it was more than I could finish. The ice cream is locally made at the Chilly Cow (Arlington) and was delicious. Can't wait to go back and try seasonal flavors. 
2731 4 Love octane. Very hipster. Service is a little odd at this location because of Little Tart and Octane being separate...but I absolutely love Octane. They get drinks right. 
2732 1 A word of warning: do not buy polyester Benetton suits. The wool suits are lovely and well made (in Italy). The polyester ones are terrible - look great when you try them on, but then move all over the place when you walk. 
2733 4 Got the #6 savory crepe for $10.50, it tasted more like a chinese burrito in a crepe form, very rich, but still very very good 
2734 2 Ehhhm. Overwrought modern cuisine. Liked it much better with the older carribean menu. Please being a little of that back and I'll be back. 
2735 4 Ordered for delivery. Food was hot and delicious. Very helpful over the phone not knowing their menu. Had the calzone and wedge. Mm mm good! 
2736 4 My favorite bubble tea place for both value and taste. I have not been disappointed with any of the weekly specials or food offerings yet. They offer small white pearls free of charge!! 
2737 4 Everyone working or part of the training team knows their stuff when it comes to running. By far the best running store in Austin. Great selection of running shoes to chose from and awesome running gear. 
2738 3 I love the Red-Headed Rita pizza. It has roasted garlic and is wonderful! 
2739 4 Excellent experience. Clean, relaxing, professional, high quality salon (& staff), as well as a large color bar. A wonderful addition to Winter Park Village! 
2740 4 Authentic Southern Chinese! 超级正宗！ 
2741 4 Best Italian sub I ever had! They keep their veggies extra fresh. 
2742 4 Bartenders are super nice and pour heavy! Saturday night DJ is awesome! 
2743 4 Comida maravilhosa e ambiente muito gostoso. Provamos o "Cheese Garlic Bread", "Italian Bruschetta" and the "Steak and Pasta" Molho marinara delicioso. Volto sempre que estiver em Orlando!!! 
2744 4 I had to send some of my clothing to get altered....'cause you know...short people problems! Lots of knowledge. Friendly service and great work at the hemming which is appreciated. Very reasonably priced. 
2745 4 So nice to walk into a restaurant and have an entire menu of gluten free options. I ate gluten free croutons for the first time (in a restaurant) in 8 years! What a treat! Fish & chips were delicious!! Friendly wait staff, fun atmosphere, great food!!! We will be back!!! 
2746 4 Food was amazing (ordered the duck omelet and the breakfast sandwich).. Service was amazing (waiter was very friendly with awesome suggestions.. rest of the staff was attentive always clearing plates and making sure our water glasses were full).. Planning on having my birthday brunch here in May! 
2747 3 Not a romantic date spot, but the sushi is really good for the price. I have always had fresh sushi with top quality ingredients. The decor looks almost fast food-ish, but don't let that deter you. It is a good place to cure that sushi hankering. 
2748 3 One of the best Ethiopian places in Portland, as of Feb. 2014--and I've tried most of them. Food is more authentic than at several other places, meaning they do use butter in the cooking, and they cook things long enough to let rich flavors develop. 
2749 0 Thanks for the beer. But we didn't need yet another sports bar in the neighborhood. This one is no different from the rest. 
2750 4 This is the first time I write comments on Yelp!!!! I have to say this place is wonderful! I highly recommend it!!! Worth to try!!! Chinese traditions decorations! 
2751 2 Great kids menu. Very noisy, which is good for loud kids. Great selection of food, not a lot of money. Octopus salad was great. 
2752 2 Not only was the restaurant cold but the food was as well which is a shame because they have good potential. 
2753 3 Good Asian food in a theme park! The ahi surely has a kick. Honey chicken was delicious. Very busy, but what do you expect? Attentive service! 
2754 3 shocked to see some bad reviews on this place. We had GREAT meals and really good service. The beer selections were good, beers were very cold...prices are good. We have found it hard to find good places in and right around Boston U. This place is a keeper... 
2755 4 Kawaii! This bookstore is so adorable! So many cute stationaries and mangas! There are so many adorable plushies and cool gadgets! I am seriously obsessed and will definitely come back. 
2756 0 outdated hotel , overpriced, rude staff. advise you check out the marriott courtyard brookline; much much nicer and cheaper. comparable room will run $250-260 vs $300 + 
2757 4 A freak show, unique, lavishly crazy theme. Like the roulette shot, what ever it lands on you have to drink it. & having the front windows open makes the atmosphere even better 
2758 4 This is one of the coolest places and concepts with an incredible selection of specialty burgers. I usually go for the turkey and a side of the truffle fries and love the ordering process where you can get a drink while in line! 
2759 4 We ordered delivery from here and was very satisfied, food was great and it arrived early. Would highly recommend!!! 
2760 1 Okay place, Terrible wait time. Good atmosphere, decent food. I don't understand a Saturday brunch menu until 3pm. I won't be back 
2761 4 Visited this restaurant on a trip. The salad was large and the staff was very friendly. I also got a soup which was full of flavor. I would recommend this more for breakfast, but all food was delicious! 
2762 4 I have had the roast pork and the Ropa Vieja, both were fantastic. If you are in the area or just love Cuban food, it is worth the trek across town. 
2763 4 So good. So good. So good. Best Indian food I've had for a while, all for an affordable 8.50 during a weekday lunch. 
2764 4 They got back to me within a couple hours, and came out to my storage unit at a precise time I requested (no window). Prices were reasonable, and they were really quick! Thank you so much! 
2765 4 Delicious grilled chicken burritos. Generous portions. Made with love. A lunch full of supreme goodness! (my review is for the cart on SW 2nd and Market) 
2766 3 I just finished eating at House of Kabob and was very impressed. The place is very small and kind of inset in the plaza but it is totally worth it!. The food was quick and tasty, and the owner really is very nice and conversational. Give it a try! 
2767 4 Such an amazing place. Went in to get my hair cut and learned they do waxing, facials and all kinds of things. Clean and professional I will for sure be coming back! 
2768 2 Thought the chicken was good! I was expecting a lot more from it because of all the hype and feel that there a other places better suited for my tastes 
2769 1 Nothing to rave about. Ordered a pizza with white sauce and mushroom and red pepper topping. We could count how many veggies were on there as topping. Not appealing! Find a cici's pizza, their topping and cheese covers the pizza for LESS money and way better customer service! 
2770 4 Bacon wrapped figs are TO DIE FOR! Great live music fast friendly service, an all around win :-) 
2771 4 The bison burger and fries were amazing! I had asked for the topping to be on the side but it was still prepared incorrectly..... not only did they replace my burger, they gave me another burger to take home to rectify the situation. Great food and great customer service!!!!! 
2772 4 Large selection of beers, wines, and liquors. One of the few places where I can find Lambic near Boston! Staff was very helpful. 
2773 4 After having an awful service experience at another place, we stumbled into NBC and were pleasantly surprised. Service was awesome (Our bartender was Mercury), beer was good, and we had this ridiculouslu large, but very tasty, soft pretzel. Surprised their reviews aren't higher. High recommend. 
2774 0 Horrible, horrible place. This is not chinese food. But service is even worse than the food. Skip and never come here. Don't even try it. 
2775 0 Hmm don't order the chicken burger they just slap it on two buns with cheese and charge u up the kazoo. It is half the size of a dollar bill. 
2776 3 Il Piatto is a great neighborhood Italian restaurant near my house. I've been coming here for years and never had a bad meal. I really do not understand the bad reviews. I think it's the closest in Portland to the food I ate in Northern Italy. 
2777 4 Sat at the bar for dinner. Service was great. The wait staff and bartender were friendly and attentive. The drinks were fantastic. Had so many small plates and every single one of them was delicious! I left stuffed and happy. 
2778 0 I went to get my tire repaired and they just worried about upselling and trying to get me to buy a new tire, they saidthe tire could not be repaired, I went to another dealer and they said no problem! saved me a $100. 
2779 4 OK so that was a little bit of a line, and I was starving. But the burgers were so tasty Size of the burgers were hard to hold They also had homemade tater tot's D licious 1 size of tater tot's or fries is enough for two people 
2780 0 Still at Waves Car Wash in Dedham. Bought regular car wash. Rims still very dirty. They said I paid for car wash. Needed to pay extra $5.00 if I want rims clean. Took picture but can't attach. Go to more ethical place. 
2781 4 Blu is my go-to restaurant on Park Ave. Great atmosphere and the food is always delicious. The staff is great, had an especially pleasant dinner with my parents thanks to our waitress Margaret (12/17, 6:54pm). She was very sweet, attentive and patient with us. 
2782 4 This is where I go for ramen. I had family in Toronto who took me for ramen where they were raving about. It was really good, bey Sapporo was still better 
2783 4 Love this place! Dairy free and gluten free cupcake options! They always run out of Red Velvet! 
2784 4 Enjoyed my drink and visit with the staff on my recent trip. Great food and cute restaurant. 
2785 4 I really appreciate how they are very involved with our community. They are always doing a fund raiser for some group. The food is great too! 
2786 3 It is true to the recipes and they make a valiant effort. The space is small, uncomfortable and hot. The Cuban coffee is spot on but the place is very basic. 4 stars just cause you actually are having Cuban food which is impossible to find in Atlanta. 
2787 4 Yet again Lynn has truly impressed me. I love getting my acrylics done here, this is my go to spot. If you are getting acrylics I highly recommend you ask for Lynn! 
2788 1 Everything was too salty. Tom Yum Goong soup and pho--all too salty. Spring rolls were bland. Surprisingly, fried rice was pretty good. But my taste buds for Thai food have been spoiled living in LA so yea--it needs to step it up a bit more. 
2789 0 A waste of money. Overpriced! Nothing special about these pastries. Poorly managed. No system for lines or ordering. Poor customer service. 
2790 4 Neal is great to work with! They did a fantastic job with a 22x30 print of mine. The color match was perfect, and I'm super happy with how it turned out! Looking forward to working with them in the future on many more printing projects! 
2791 4 Long wait, crowded and noisy place, great for drowning out the MIL! The XLB were good, service was also good despite previous postings. Fried bread with condensed milk was the topping on the cake! YUM 
2792 4 YUM. Everything I've ever had was awesome. The Lemongrass Chicken salad is to die for. 
2793 0 Don't waste your time or money here. Go one block up to the Marriott Residence Inn. 
2794 2 Pretty good offerings. Portions sized are enormous, and the decor is quite elegant. Can't say I am over the moon about the flavors, but still a pretty nice spot 
2795 0 3.50 you call it's! Including top shelf! Everything! And then you get your tab and suddenly everything wasn't 3.50. Watch out for this scam. 
2796 4 We had a great experience working with Adam on a complicated order. He gave us great pricing, a quick turn around and was responsive to all my questions. The shirts came out beautifully, even on a very bright background color! We will use Waterloo again. 
2797 4 This is five stars, as far as Wendy's go (so take that for what it is worth). Staff is generally friendly, they have always gotten my order correct, and you can be off and back on rte 1 with a JBC in a couple of minutes. 
2798 3 nice folks & nice bikes. we rented a tandem for valentine's day and they were very kind even though we had no idea what we were doing. also, excellent location to bring people who haven't biked much; it's just across the street from an easy waterfront path bike ride. 
2799 2 I got the chop shop burger and and parmesan fries. I've always heard good things but to be honest it's kind of overrated. Good not great. 
2800 3 It had been over 10 years since our last visit. Many choices now. Drink choice wide, everything was good. Dessert was my favorite 
2801 0 Unless you enjoy horrendous guest service, I would suggest looking elsewhere. Been with this unit for several years and have yet to have a positive customer service experience. 
2802 3 Nice place and open late. Good, fresh middle eastern food; excellent hot chocolate and espresso. Prices are reasonable, considering the location. Definitely worth a stop. 
2803 4 Great staff, food is fast, fresh and delicious. Awesome drinks. Loud music and busy place. Cool atmosphere. 
2804 0 If you want to have gut wrenching, well, gut pain for your entire flight, definitely eat here before boarding. 7 hours later, still waiting for whatever this is to pass. the food didn't taste great on the way in either. 
2805 3 They have the best soup pork dumplings in town! The service is what's expected during really busy hours. 
2806 1 I wasnt very happy with this restaurant.. Ramen was a bit bland, I still ate it, but I wasn't very happy. 
2807 1 Their ramen is mediocre and expensive. The noodles were really good, broth was meh, the egg was slightly overcooked and bland, the pork was excellent, but overall this place is way to expensive for what the offer. 
2808 4 We just stopped in here for lunch and had a wonderful ceasar salad and veggie pizza. Service was perfect and the ambience was dark and romantic. Great choice for a rainy Florida afternoon! 
2809 3 The place was awesome, the only thing I didn't like was the guy at the counter! I don't think he likes his job!!! Very unhelpful!! Guy is an ass! This happened today at around 12 to 2pm 7/14/2014. He should work at a gas station!!! 
2810 4 Authentic chole paturey! Great price for two fluffy giant paturey. Needs an upgrade in the dining area. But for lunch, a great spot with quick service. Also our go-to place for a variety of mitthai! 
2811 1 Dismal food, service leaves something to be desired, and it's pretty dark in here. Ah well, it's a bar. I didn't expect much more. 
2812 4 Love this place, always fun stuff going on, nice servers, good food! 
2813 4 We did the ride on a Sunday afternoon. It was a pretty afternoon and we had a good tour. The guide/driver was great. I learned so much about Boston. 
2814 4 I loved their vegan donuts! The ones I got were more like cake donuts so if you prefer that for your donuts this place is perfect. My friend got the normal donuts and she was really pleased with them. The atmosphere was great and the staff was nice. 
2815 4 Their calzones are amazing and enormous. They're fast and at a great price. 
2816 0 AWFUL. 1. Very difficult to find in the building. 2. Waited forever for my appointment. 3. The doctor didn't listen to me, tried to treat me with medications that I have already used. So annoying. 4. Got the bill in the mail for $180. 
2817 3 Stopped by this place while walking down Soco and it was great. The place was clean and modern inside. The food was great. Service was so so but even the manager stopped by to check in on our table. 
2818 4 The Latino/Hispanic social club. Great music, awesome drinks and lots of dancing to Tejano, Country, Hip-Hop, and Salsa music. 
2819 4 I've been searching for quality southern cooking for my entire 7 years of living in Atlanta and this is one of the best places I've found! Delicious food, good portion sizes, friendly staff, and the prices are more than reasonable. Highly recommend! 
2820 1 I ordered ramen for takeout. The vegetarian ramen was particularly lackluster, but the regular ramen also didn't blow me away. I also had difficulty communicating with the staff. 
2821 4 What a great find!!! This place has a great menu great creative drinks and even a good kids menu! 
2822 2 Chutney arrived after we finished our appetizer fish pakora. Food was A-OK. Don't order polau rice, they are bland in taste. I can cook better polau than theirs. Tandoori chicken and garlic naan was good. 
2823 3 A nice little shop with coffee and snacks. I was impressed with their local section particularly. A great storefront in the historic downtown. 
2824 2 My parents had the fried rice and Saigon salad, which they liked. I had the yellow curry with tofu, which was fine, but there was too much random frozen vegetable medley. 
2825 4 I love this place! Mike and June are really helpful. Customer service is always great and I enjoy storing here. Glad to do business with them. Thankful and blessed to store here :) 
2826 3 Ok. While the place is modest and a little small. My opinion is that they are doing a very good job. Fresh cooked and perfectly done. And. Very tasty. I give them 4 stars!!! 
2827 4 Absolutely amazing!!! I got the triple chocolate concrete & trust me if you're a chocolate fan this one is so worth it. 
2828 3 4 stars solely based on the honeydew snow. It was perfect for a warm day. Great flavor and texture. 
2829 4 Been coming here for years and it's my favorite! Everything is great. Get the $1.25 salad, just for the delicious miso dressing. Gyoza is delicious. Very good sake, and finish with the green tea ice cream. 
2830 4 Beyond the food being fabulous - the staff were outstanding!! Kevin (bartender) and Veronica, (server), were amazing. There are many great Italian restaurants in Boston's North End, but what makes this one standout is the service! For that I will return. 
2831 3 Great atmosphere. Been my home bar for many years. Bartenders are amazing!!!! Play pool, free on Wednesday and Sunday, play some music, enjoy some great company from the friendly regulars and sing some karaoke on Thursday through Saturday. 
2832 4 Great place to go with the family and get healthy salad with plenty of options! I love this place. Very clean, friendly staff. 
2833 3 I loved this place... Different, well priced, pretty good, and well located, but unfortunately it's closed for some reason. 
2834 3 Large portions tasty food with quick service. Décor was cheapo Mexican, but service was fast and friendly. Good place to refuel for the parks and a lot cheaper. 
2835 0 Food has been good. Went tonight and the hostess was absent. 3 servers came by and told us someone would be by to help us. After almost 10 minutes we just left. Never found out how long the wait would be as we never talked to anyone. 
2836 4 Great place for organizing. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I'm normally not a fan of "big box" style retailers but for home products all in one place, this spot is aces. 
2837 4 We were there Saturday night for patio dining and cocktails. It was absolutely wonderful! This place puts impeccable attention into their preparations and the result is outstanding. Cannot wait to go back and enjoy another evening at Il Terrazzo! 
2838 2 Heads up - vegetarian sushi menu is GONE! Deeply disappointed with our experience here 
2839 4 Friendly service, great food! Ambient is nice and quiet so it's good for a chat with your date or your family and friends. 
2840 0 While his was the most honest estimate, Jason has not returned multiple calls to finish the job. Came highly recommended - I would NOT do business with Lakeside and not recommend them to anyone!!!!! Very poor follow up and customer service. 
2841 4 This place was fantastic, but I'm a sucker for food you can dip. The staff was super friendly, and knowledgable about their vast selection of tasty brews. The fried mushrooms were incredible and not your typical fried buttons. I can't wait to go back! 
2842 4 I had the best techicain at my place He was pleasant, informational, and very professional. Thanks Enrique without you my house would be beg infested. 
2843 4 Super good drinks, shots, beer, and games!!! Awsome vibe they have a section devoted to haunted mansion, pirates of carribean and starwars!!! alot of fun if there is nothing going on thursday nite.. If it gets too crowded its hard to get in on video games! 
2844 2 Ok place to chill and enjoy food and drink. Nothing superb and nothing bad, just OK. 
2845 4 I have gotten three cuts here with different stylists. They have all done an amazing job and my hair continues to look good for months. Would trust basically anyone at this salon to cut my hair. 
2846 4 Highly recommend. Pho is authentic and have quite large portions. Never too busy too so great place to stop by anytime. 
2847 3 Me and my party sat quickly. I've eaten here before. They have delivery! All is good. 'Nuff said! 
2848 4 Amazing happy hour. Good service. The only pate I have ever enjoyed. I would recommend this place to anyone. Wine is decent for the price. Left full. Waiting to come back for dinner... 
2849 2 Fairly good Indian food though they seem to want to be fancier than I'd like. This fancyness, to me, adds nothing to the food (it only makes it pricier and slightly less filling). Still, very good Indian when you take into perspective the Indian places that are all over Boston. 
2850 0 Wow! Extremely mediocre:( McD's gets a 4 star grade. We couldn't get a straight answer on what exactly was in the Garden Burger. I expect more for a $50 meal for 4 people. Boo! Also, the back room had lotsa room but was frigid:( 
2851 3 This the AVEDA training salon and so it is all the benefits, yet it is less expensive. Your experience will include complimentary comforting tea or water, hand massage, scalp massage and makeup touch up. 
2852 4 It is a local legend. The bun mam is amazing. Service is quick and the people are nice. You do have to deal with on street parking. But we'll worth the trip. Keep up the great work. 
2853 3 BAC is a good club. Not the high price falooting clubs like you find in Los Angeles though. But a clean club with new equipment and worth the price to stay out of the "Television" gyms like 24HR and Ballys. 
2854 4 Best coffee, customer service, and shop in the area! We love coming here for the coffee and smoothies. The people that run it are amazing at their jobs and wonderful to talk to as well. 
2855 4 Excellent and fast service!! And I've been here twice for cracked screens... 
2856 3 Went there and it had great service. Food was surprising fast and good. Will be trying it out again one day. Due to personal issues I do not remember what was ordered or eaten. 
2857 4 Always love how my hair comes out after seeing Tiffany! She is definitely an expert of hair color. Everyone I see getting hair done at this salon looks amazing when they leave. All the stylists seem well experienced, skilled in their work, and professional. I highly recommend Raven Row! 
2858 4 Service was super fast, food was absolutely delicious, and carafes of sangria were delicious. Very reasonably priced considering the amount of food and drinks we ordered and how delicious every morsel of food was. Definitely my new favorite in Boston. 
2859 3 Excellent authentic Taiwanese and Chinese food. Love the lamb dishes. A bit on the salty side but that's why it pairs so well with a nice IPA. 
2860 3 I have been listening to my friends "ooh and ah" about San Francisco Coffee forever. So, this place had quite a reputation to live up to. I went. I saw. I enjoyed. Was this java worthy of the Holy Grail? No. Would I go back? Definitely! 
2861 0 "Eek! Methinks not" nails it. The music is not only too loud, it sucks. Drove me out, didn't order anything. Wasn't gonna pay $5.41 (??) for a beer just to be tortured by... easy-listening soft jazz muzak? 
2862 4 Anna's is one of my favorite donut shops. The jelly donuts are the best around. I can remember back to the days before Dunkin Donuts infiltrated West Roxbury and it was either Annas or Donut Maker. Anna's has always been the best. 
2863 4 Loved the fried chicken and Mac n cheese night! Food was GREAT! Service was great. Owner on site and active. Decor is nice. 
2864 3 Same hooters as anywhere else, except the ladies here are SMOKIN hot. That is all. 
2865 3 Great place to have drinks and just mingle. New to the city so I've been a couple times alone and always make new connections. 
2866 4 Nelda was wonderful and very helpful in getting me into a car when I desperatly needed one and worked with me on the down payment highly reccomend!! 
2867 4 Didn't mess with food on opening day, but all 6 Brewdog beers were awesome! Elvis Juice was my favorite. All six were quite good. Looking forward to coming back after they get settled in. Menu was impressive, so I'm optimistic that the food will be as good as the beer. 
2868 4 Dr. Gebhardt and her staff are very friendly, professional and extremely helpful. You don't have to wait hours to see the physician which is super helpful too. She is very thorough with her eye exams and explains things very clearly. I would recommend her to all my family and friends. 
2869 4 These guys are honest and reliable and I've been here with my 2002 vehicle the past three years without a hitch... everything from transmission to brakes to a mere engine light because the gas station dudes don't tighten the cap.... They are great. 
2870 3 I have eaten in this restaurant 2 times. The first time I ordered from menu and that was very good but a bit pricy. The second time I went for buffet and it was not good. So eat and order from menu. 
2871 3 It was everything we were expecting. Went there for lunch on a Friday and we had to wait, so expect a wait time. The Goatee burger was awesome, the heartless artichoke sandwhich was great. Definitely recommend it. 
2872 4 The lamb was unbelievable tonight. I have had many of their specials and have never been disappointed. Should be a must to place to eat at. Matt and Micah only put out top quality food. 
2873 3 Great location just stones throw from TD garden , bars and restaurants every few feet not to mention super comfortable bed.newly done rooms with Upscale decor. with a little great bar in lobby. 24 hour room service and complementary loaner bicycles for touring the city 
2874 4 One big tray Baklava 100$, delicious! Best price for this taste. Hand made and awesome. If you know the taste of Baklava from Turkey, this is the closest one you can eat in USA (no glucose syrup, about 40 layers) 
2875 4 Amazing vegetarían food! Had delicious lentils with eggplant. The place is clean and very authentic 
2876 3 This place doesn't look good but the food I had sure was good. I had the chicken (dark meat) and creamed spinach. YUM YUM! Can't say anymore about it, except that it delivered more than I expected. 
2877 3 This is a must try! The pork hotdogs are great. If you are in Canada you must try it. The stands are on the side of the street. They also expanded into Los Angeles (Santa Monica) as well according to the guy that served us. 
2878 4 Oysters with house-made red bell pepper hot sauce, fish tempura fried, parmesan and truffle oil fries, shrimp slow cooked in butter until the texture and taste are like lobster. Honestly one of the best meals of my life. 
2879 1 Been here twice now. Not recommended for the food but the environment is fun being that its a sports bar. 
2880 3 I always give my listings to Bayside because they are easy to deal with, thorough in checking tenant references, and have never brought me a bad tenant. They always text the existing tenant before a showing, which avoids unpleasant surprises. 
2881 0 Literally the WORST motel ever!!!!!!! Stains everywhere. Bed bug problems. Shitty furniture and shitty tv. No internet. It was the most terrible place I've ever stayed in. 
2882 4 They food is awesome! Worth the wait. The Decor is fun and cool. John Rivers literally went on Craigslist and purchased some of the wares! I am super spoiled and had the food 3 times before it opened! Feeling lucky as a Local Orlando Blogger for Central Florida! 
2883 3 Came out quickly. Informative, did a good job. 
2884 3 Surprisingly excellent Tacos!!! The place needs some maintenance for sure...But do not let that stop you to try some good tacos one of the best neighborhood taco trucks around spicy salsa. Definitely get an agua fresca friendly staff Overall I recommend it and is good to find decent Mexican food. 
2885 2 Pulled port was decent. Sliced beef was dry, which seems pretty common for GA BBQ... Fried Okra was good though. 
2886 4 My first time to Ramen Danbo and my first time to Vancouver as well. Wonderful food. Great on a cold rainy day. Very authentic and traditional. I will be back on my next trip. 
2887 4 The Maple Bacon donut and the Brown Butter Hazelnut Crunch donut are delicious. Must try! My partner says the Maple Bacon donut is hands down, the best donut he's ever had. Their dough is unique; it almost has a spongy quality to it. Delicious! 
2888 4 This place rocks!! My server Cecilia pampered us with everything we need. The lobsters are great! The raw oysters are fresh! Love it. The manager, was checking around to see how we doing! I'm glad we tried this place! 
2889 4 Restaurant week brought us to Chiara's. What a wonderful surprise!!!! All dishes ordered were delicious and the presentation was excellent. Desserts were sooooooo good. Would go back there in a minute!!!! Great place for special ocassion. 
2890 4 Loved being able to enjoy sushi on the outdoor patio. Kids loved the rolls and the service was friendly and attentive. We had the salmon and it was very fresh. The rainbow roll was well presented and very fresh. Recommend! 
2891 0 I JUSTgot kicked out of the.store, for asking if they.did shipping. Guy.is just.plain rude, and the.store smells like.dog. Avoid!!!! 
2892 4 The pastries and cookies are divine! They aren't cheap, but definitely a nice splurge. The chocolate chunk and oatmeal raisin cookies are my fav. I went once and they were out of the chocolate chunk and I almost had a fit lol! 
2893 3 Delish, but usually really long line. 
2894 4 Chic hotel with an incredibly kind staff. It was like a dream, the staff was over the top helpful and charming. Amenities were well above expectations - room, pool, gym, wifi, etc. Highly recommend when in [North] Austin. Great location in the Domain as well. 
2895 4 Went to Maison Esthetique for a massage and a facial. Fiona did my massage which was absolutely amazing! Best massage I've ever had ! Then I had an incredible facial with Lea. I don't usually get a facial but I will definitely book another with Lea! 
2896 0 I go to the Quincy office and the doctors are ok but if you need to see someone right away due to an emergency they just about tell you to jump in a lake. Money is the only concern here! 
2897 2 Hopefully the renovation happening this year will bring in more quality stores and some much needed landscaping. There are still some good stores here including Regal Cinema, Macy's & Dillards anchoring. 
2898 4 Best Indian food I've had in a long time. The flavors are delicious, the portions generous. This guy is a genius. 
2899 4 Stopped by on a sunny Saturday and got the Honey Bourbon Wings. Oy, they were clearly the best wings I've had. First, the meat was plentiful unlike most other places. Secondly they were lovely crispy. And the sauce was wonderful. Nice folk, quick service. I'm certain we'll be out again. 
2900 4 Love this place. Great food at a good price point. Atmosphere and service were outstanding. Very busy place, hard to get a table, but worth it 
2901 3 The food is always on point, plus you can get a meal for your furry friend. If you enjoy eating in the company of dogs, delicious food, friendly service and don't mind the sometimes 45 minute wait Tin Shed is a great option. 
2902 4 One of my favorite meals in this town is the salmon set here. All this yummy stuff: soup, salad, tofu, shumai,sushi, croquette. And perfect salmon! 
2903 3 This place is wonderful The sharing tables with strangers part is a little weird but manageable. So much food. I've never been able to finish. 
2904 3 This is a great juice bar that makes some really good stuff. I like the Green Energy Machine but their juices are tasty without too much filler (I am looking at you apples). Prices are reasonable. 
2905 4 Great food and authentic atmosphere. Friendly staff. Nice bar as well. Ethiopian Amber beer Lamb TIBS Sambusa ( wrapped like egg roll) + sauce Miser (spicy lentils) Will be coming back. 
2906 4 Torchy's Tacos announced today (1/15) they are taking over the spot. W00t! 
2907 2 good, solid pho and rolls. and decent variety. it's not too pricey, and you can usually get a seat. i found the harvard location to be better than the newbury street one. 
2908 3 The service was great, the beer was cheap, the peanuts were excellent. What else could you want from your 'local' dive? Its not fancy, particularly clean or smoke free (be prepared) but I like cheap booze and unpretentious people and both can be had at The Local. 
2909 4 Kimchee fries were 95% as good as Chilantro's, but maybe Chilantro's are just better because I'm always drunk when I eat them. Yummi tacos has bigger portions and doesn't move. 
2910 3 Very nice beer. Great environment Nice people. They have different beers from evwrywhere. The environment is very joyful and fun. It is a great place to go and relax 
2911 4 I took the kids here. The kids were really live this place. It has a lots of toy and people to come here. I would recommend if you have kid age 1-6years old, you should take them here :) 
2912 4 Unbiased opinion, the OFD burger was pretty darn good. Paired with the sweet potato tater tots, an excellent meal. Service was good. Would definitely recommend this place to others. Thank you! 
2913 4 GREAT place! Katie and Mindy are excellent!! Katie is a talented artist and does a phenomenal job with liquid gel nails. The atmosphere is serene and the staff is very attentive and kind. Mindy is a fantastic pedicurist with extreme attention to detail. The entire staff go above and beyond! 
2914 1 This place used to be a hip, trendy place...lately not so much. Just another Atlanta pretentious little boutique. Go to Hand in Pocket better selection, nicer staff. 
2915 4 There is nothing bad you can get here. Their coffees.... delicious... their pastries.... foodgasmic.... their cakes....I want more......... Great place for a coffee date, Sunday brunch, place to take kids, place to buy birthday cakes, a great place to buy gifts. 
2916 4 Sal did an amazing job cleaning the grout in my kitchen, dining and living areas! Not only did he do a fantastic job, he made sure I was really happy with his work. I highly recommend giving Peace Frog a call! 
2917 0 Horrible service and attitude from the workers. They forgot a lot of orders. Do not go here 
2918 3 The seafood bim bim bap is good. Sushi is good and the rice cakes are great. We consistently have a good experience here. We recommend this place. 
2919 1 Over priced. $10 for an hour of pool. $4.00 for shoe rentals,and $4.50 per person for an hour of bowling. Are you kidding me??? They rob you. 
2920 0 Poorly mismanaged. Don't waste your money at this place. A total miss on every point. 
2921 2 The butter chicken and nan are really delicious. Tandoori chicken, is just OK. Will go back just for the butter chicken and nan:) 
2922 4 The food was delicious! We got the apple fritters because I saw reviews that they are great & they were. We have found our new go -to breakfast spot. 
2923 3 Corned beef hash was incredible. It came out with the top layer crispy. Eggs, home fries and bacon were excellent. Sausage was above average. Coffee was average. Toast came out dry, butter on table. Friendly prompt service and no wait on a weekday morning at 9am. 
2924 1 We used to love the pizza they had here but tonight's pizza fell short of our expectations. I don't know if it's new management or budget issues but the pizza is no where close to what it used to be. 
2925 4 I love everything about Custom Eyes. Great care and attention, cool frame styles, excellent treatment. My whole family goes for contact lenses and glasses, and we wouldn't consider going anywhere else. 
2926 3 I was able to get my primary coat here. Considering that I'm a little finicky with my coats, I'm happy to say I was able to find something for all seasons, something I can appreciate. I was also able to get socks here cheaply, something I always appreciate. 
2927 4 Alice Is the best she has been cutting my hair for some years. She is great always has a smile 
2928 4 Donuts are very good! Love the chocolate frosted donut (called marble something). Cafe across the street is very good too. Donuts are expensive though 
2929 4 Best donuts in the area for sure! I can't even name a favorite bc they are all so delicious, we've been about 4 or 5 times now and have tried a good variety. And just like everyone else says, the staff is always super friendly! 
2930 3 The chicken is fried in peanut oil so it's extra crispy and light! I also appreciate the simplistic menu and old school decoration. Sounds silly, but my favorite thing there is the sweet tea. 
2931 4 Great selection of succulents and cacti of all sizes and everyone was very helpful when asked. They also sell arrangements and they're super unique. You can have your new succulents potted by them for a fee, I really enjoyed this place. Leashed dogs are welcome. 
2932 4 The best service in this restaurant Kayla she is amazing WITH her service I'm coming back Great customers service Kayla keep up the amazing service A1 
2933 3 Food was great. Trifongo was really terrific! Was surprised to see 15% "service charge" added and then suggested tip amounts on the receipt on the total of meal plus "service charge". Nice way to boost tips I suppose. Did not see any notice or explanation of " service charge" anywhere. 
2934 3 just simple notary service.. six dollars, which was less than I'm used to 
2935 4 Had them take care of my state inspection. They were really friendly and everything was smooth. 
2936 3 Stopped by here for a couple beers after my birthday dinner at Andina. Loved the atmosphere and the aesthetic. The view was perfect for people watching and just lovely in general. Great beer selection too. Can definitely see this becoming one of my go-to spots. 
2937 4 The food is incredible, I eat here at least once a week. The service is second to none and everything I have tried has been delicious. Don't forget the garlic naan! 
2938 4 Wonderful sushi at extremely low prices. It is very small so don't show up with a group. You can take it to go, of course. It gets pretty bust at lunchtime, but other than that, the service is quick and pleasant. 
2939 4 Wood fired oven goodness. Great quality and quick service. A little pricey for a food truck but 1/2 the wait of other restaurants with great pizza. 
2940 3 The service here is phenomenal- drinks and food typical beer f what you expect in a theme park. HOWEVER, will someone please explain to me why the employees are dressed like farmers?!?this is a sports bar!!!!!! 
2941 3 This is a cool new bar with great special effects. Amazing art with projections going on top of the pics, making them very disturbing...but awesome. There was a great singer there playing hits. Good vibe, quick service.great new addition to Wall Street 
2942 4 Honestly the best Chinese food and service! Place is great! Food is always fresh and flavorful. I usually always sit at the bar. Bartenders are super friendly The owner is personable. Truly is a great place 
2943 2 I usually come here for pane au chocolate or their macaroons. All very tasty but very expensive. For the price you pay the value isn't there. 
2944 4 Have been there several times and never disappointed. Have tried several dishes and always delish. Wait staff excellent! 
2945 3 The pork dumplings and coconut buns are delicious. Well worth the wait. 
2946 4 Omg....was delish!!!!! Service was great. Food was outstanding. Environment was perfect....fun and lively. Would recommend to anyone looking for something different. Was impressed that the manager was willing to go get lactose milk for my son's Milk shake...wow....who does this anymore??? 
2947 2 This is a nice and cozy cafe located near central. Their foods are great, but have one complaint Their service is soooo slow!!! Be aware if you are in hurry. 
2948 0 One pizza was estimated to take an hour and a half. When that time arrived, nobody showed. When I contacted the store, they have no record of the order, even though I have an email confirming and a pending payment on my credit card. Garbage service. 
2949 4 Great food! Great staff! We had an amazing experience. I have three growing sons and they couldn't finish the large portions we received. I highly recommend this place. 
2950 4 I've been skating my whole life and was so impressed with this rink! It was so clean and big. The staff were amazing and friendly! The rental skates were in great condition! Can't wait to return! 
2951 4 Just had Thanksgiving buffet - excellent! Staff were tremendous, all dishes well prepared, very nice presentation. 
2952 4 I've enjoyed every beer I've tried! I recently moved here, and I'm happy to find a local brewery with great IPAs (which are my favorite - but they have many great styles). Love the space too! 
2953 4 Love this place. Went for a sunday brunch and the menu was awesome. The mimosas were amazing and really liked the food too. 
2954 0 Just awful service. Waitress was mean and condescending. Made comments based on people not ordering more alcohol. Really made us uncomfortable to dine here. Food was what you would expect. 
2955 0 terrible service!!! I was there on 4-2-14 and I will never use this branch again, the greeter its very polite but they only have 2 representatives and they are so slow!!!! 10 people were waiting and they didn't seem to care thank god for suntrust!!! 
2956 4 Great effective workout, love the way the class changes daily and keeps it interesting. Classed are never boring or monotonous. Great coaches.Love Orange Theory Fitness. 
2957 4 These guys are as good as it gets. Been coming here for years and had 5 cars tinted by them. All the tint is still in excellent condition. I even had my valentine v1 radar detector hard wire from them too. 100% satisfied. Will be back again and again. 
2958 4 Awesome time with the family! Great customer service, quick check in, military discounts and we went during spring break and SXSW. Highly recommend! 
2959 4 King size subs are huge,I have had the pastrami,Italian,and chicken parm,these subs are absolute masterpieces!!!! Quality is definitely there @ a very reasonable price,my only regret is they close the hot side of the deli @2:30,so order early. Staff was extremely polite and helpful 
2960 4 First class Rockfish Fish Tacos. Best birthday lunch, didn't even know I needed fish tacos, but it filled exactly my need for light, fresh and tasty. 
2961 4 This was my second time here. I'm from San Antonio and I always stop by to get these amazing donuts! Omg! They're so good I love the ones with the Bavarian creme fillings! They're absolutely delicious and worth the trip! 
2962 4 Went here for brunch and it was absolutely delicious! We got to the French toast, a must, and the steak and eggs with cheese grits on the side. The chef is absolutely fantastic and innovative with his dishes. Can't wait to come back for dinner! 
2963 4 I've been to other Keke's locations on numerous occasions. This Keke's, like the others, didn't fail to satisfy. Great food and excellent customer service by our waitress, the hostesses, and management! 
2964 4 Yummy!!!!! Always good - I love the jimmy churry bowl!!! The fire roasted avacado is also delish :) fun environment too! 
2965 3 A mix up on the order occurred...The manager fixed it and gave us coupons for a free meal on the house for our next visit! We did not expect that, but hey, no complaints... The place was spotless clean and busy. Well managed operation. 
2966 1 This place has no customer service what so ever but if you get one of the barbers who don't have ego, you'll be taken care of. 
2967 4 I love this place. They make the best dosa. I love it more than Sarvana Bhawan now. Lovely to be here. No fancy people its a restaurant and it's food speaks for itself. Oh my god!! Have to mention about George. He is the best. 
2968 1 Crazy crazy high prices. Stunning, really. Breathtakingly high. $3 donuts, anyone? 
2969 4 Best sushi ever! And they have a great "I'm not into raw food" menu as well. great service and innovative sushi roll menu. Try the gluten free Akami Roll! Melts like butter! 
2970 4 This is our favorite place to eat. The appetizers are great. We LOVE the salmon cold pack. Our steaks are always cooked perfectly and the mushroom risotto is to die for. 
2971 4 Food is amazing. Service was fantastic and the location has a great ambience. The prices are excellent considering the food portions are huge and it is in the park. Also it is fully air conditioned and it is nice to relax after a hot day spent in the park. 
2972 2 Its awesome to have a super hero store... Its like entering into The Shield. The reason I gave it only three stars is because its such a tiny store... It gets packed quickly and warm inside. 
2973 0 The worst Starbucks in the world. So slow, always get order wrong and terrible service. 
2974 3 I went here soon after it opened a few years ago. Great iced tea. That hasn't changed. I'm a tea fan, so I know what I'm yelping about in this regard. I've heard the food is pretty decent. 
2975 4 Love this place! Owner is super nice, and the portions are huge! One of my downtown staples! 
2976 0 Waiting 1 hr and 26 min to rent a car! Line is longer than a Disneyworld ride. Staff doesn't care, barely a mumble out of them- AVOID!!! 
2977 4 Wicked good pizza very friendly and cute staff, definitely coming back after stopping in on a whim 
2978 0 Bad food and awful migraine inducing acoustics. Everything tasted the same - lemongrass, hot peppers and lime leaves. And why when you order the $58.00 pp tasting menu do you get two dishes with mussels. 
2979 2 Good place for a healthy lunch and a tasty sandwich. Food is suppose to be farm fresh and overall it was pretty good. Service was ok. I would likely go back again and try another meal. 
2980 2 Cajun food in Colorado! Cajun's not really my favorite or it would have gotten 4 stars easily. Right off the main drag in a great converted house with nice porch and lots of cozy rooms. I was there for lunch, but apparently hugely popular for weekend breakfast. 
2981 1 Delicious pizza but ordered (and paid) at 4:41P with an ETA of 50-70 minutes. It's currently 6:34P and no pizza. Called to confirm they have our address correct and was told they should have given an ETA of 70-90 minutes. 90 minutes have come and passed. So disappointing. Still waiting... 
2982 4 es un parque espectacular, me encanto la manta y el espectaculo de los delfines y de shamu!!!, y el espectaculo de los leones marinos es para morirse de la risa!!! 
2983 4 Love the professionalism here! Very knowledgeable students who work here. Had my eyebrows tinted & she did an amazing job! Today I had my hair colored and I am going to be very happy with it, no doubt! 
2984 4 A very reasonable price for good portions. I ate in and took out. Friendly staff. Wide selection. This is the place to go if you have a tight Budget. 
2985 4 I was referred to Allen by a friend. He is very knowledgeable in his profession and I feel confident being under his care. I look forward to going back. 
2986 2 Great drinks, ok food. The food was a bit bland for my taste, but the beer on tap was cold and fresh! All and all, not the worst meal ever. 
2987 4 Zaid does an excellent job on my nails. I always get compliments because they look flawless. She is a artist when it comes to nails. 
2988 4 First time going here and the staff was pleasant. I ordered the chicken wings which were really good! 
2989 3 Every thing was good but not spectacular. The only downfall was the lack of food. We enjoyed the atmosphere and playing the games.The service staff was friendly, helpfull, and knowledgeable. 
2990 3 Wide variety of brews to choose from. Oktoberfest and Boo Berry were delish. Steve and Vickie, proprietors, were knowledgable and friendly. Loved this local brewery. 
2991 2 The decor is great, our server was attentive but the food was only just ok in my opinion. We ordered the crab cakes, thai mussels and spicy seafood stew. I would recommend the thai coconut mussels, but there was nothing spectacular about the crab cakes or spicy seafood stew. 
2992 2 It was ok. A chicken po boy combo was just enough for a lunch. Nice restaurant; iffy neighborhood at night. 
2993 4 Dawn is the best most wonderful vet in the world. The whole practice is amazing. They all go above and beyond and are kind and caring and wonderful. I love them and Dr Binder couldn't be better. 
2994 0 Horrible service at the front desk. The people they employ here don't give a ****. They are lazy and do the bare minimum that is required of them. Sad that I had to leave the nice people of Quincy PF and make this my home gym. 
2995 4 Don't confuse the slider for a bite sized burger of lesser quality. These are some of the most creative tasty burgers around. Awesome fries with a prickly pear San Pellegrino and I was a happy camper. Try the Hawthorne! 
2996 4 Shova T & Shova K are amazing very kind and gentle eyebrows always come out amazing downside is the waiting time but if you make an apt you will be seen on your apt time they usually are always booked tho so book your apt in advance ladies ! 
2997 4 Great Slow cooked ribs and pulled pork!! Larry was personable and knowledgeable. Great experience all around. Looking forward to going back!! 
2998 4 Brisket and Turkey are amazing. Environment is really cool. Was underwhelmed with the ribs and sausage but let me say it again the brisket and turkey were amazing. Price felt about right for what I was getting. I will frequent here often 
2999 4 I highly recommend the Lighthouse team for any of your electrical needs! Joe was very helpful in giving advice over the phone and even saved me from having a team come out on site. Very reliable and will call them again in the future for any work. 
3000 4 Shit's good. Affordable at happy hour. The outside patio is great. We had the raw oysters for $1 each and some other appys. Servers were nice. Could be more attractive. Weird thing is they call you the next day and ask you if you had a good time. 
3001 0 This place has gone so downhill over the past 10 years. Its a shame, I keep trying to give them another chance but they always mess up on my simplest orders. They also all seem miserable there. See ya for good! 
3002 4 Delicious mojitos and wonderful food. Loved the salmon that was the special that night and the service was wonderful. 
3003 4 antipasto salad! everything here is excellent...great pizzas, crazy good wings and even crazier beer specials. friendly neighborhood whip! 
3004 4 Jeremy was super sweet & got the job done perfectly! Love the scent of oranges post cleaning. Definitely worth the call and not disappointed at all that I chose Cloud 9 out of all the Lake Oswego Services ! 
3005 0 I have been sitting at the for an hour waiting for my food Changing shifts The bartender Lea could give a shit She never put the order in 
3006 4 The 5 stars are for Kris alone. As soon as we came in she started playing and giving us a classic New Jersey ball busting. She is the kind of personality that can make a business. 
3007 3 Great food and good service. Not many places to eat greek on that side of town and I would recommend this to you. 
3008 3 We have been doing happy hour here for years. Disappointed that they added fries to the burger, But that is just me I suppose, Hard not to eat them... Happy hour wine always a good value. Pop in have snack, you won't regret. 
3009 4 I went in for ramen, wound up ordering katsu don curry and takoyaki. It was great. I had been craving Japanese curry for awhile and was shocked to see it on the menu. Happy, but shocked. The service was great. Food was great. Can't wait to go back! 
3010 4 Found this place our first night in Boston and loved the food and atmosphere so much we ate again our last night there. Fresh ingredients and some of the best marinara sauce I've ever tasted. 
3011 3 AWESOME food and ambiance!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The leech martini ROCKS! The only downside is depending which night you go, which bartender you get! I've had GREAT service, and no so great service. The only improvement I'd recommend is training/choosing the appropriate bartenders for an upper class restaurant. A+++++ 
3012 4 Delicious vegan food truck attached to the Soma Vida co-working center in East Ceaser Chavez, just east of downtown Austin. They have vegan queso which is just delicious! Many creative taco options, daily special, mouth watering sauces. I love this place! 
3013 0 THE WORST FOOD TRUCK EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD!!! The tacos have maybe 1/2 oz of meat, the rest is lettuce, carrots, and onions. The owner or cook, whatever he is, is a complete a$$hole. Never contract out this food truck for your own good! What a complete waste!!!!!! Miserable experience! 
3014 0 Ice cream was great, unfriendly employees and got rock hard stale gummy bears on my ice cream. Couldn't even chewy threw it so I had to pick them all out. 
3015 3 I loved trying out this spot! I got one of the bento boxes so I could try a little bit of everything. The sushi was great! This place has a great atmosphere and ended up being a great date spot. 
3016 4 Definitely one of my favorite dessert places in Vancouver- the yogurt is so creamy! I had the strawberry flavor which reminded my of Tubes yogurt I used to eat as a child. EXCELLENT. Took a while to get my yogurt but worth the wait. Will be back. 
3017 4 Great attention and delicious food, I'm going to return for more ;) I tried the flautas and my wife the enchiladas. Congratulations for your tasty food. 
3018 4 i miss this. ive grown up using this and im really sad its gone. i would love a recipe but this was quick and better than anything ive ever made. perfectly sweet too without being overpowering i even made funnel cakes with these. 
3019 4 Great decor; not crowded if you arrive around 9:30 on at Saturday; friendly staff; food delivered quickly, and their bacon skillet was delicious. Already planning to go back again. 
3020 3 Their food is pretty good. They have both good American-style and good more authentic-style (particularly Sichuan) Chinese food. However, I don't get along with the manager's daughter, so I am afraid to go there nowadays. 
3021 3 People working there are usually pretty friendly. Lines around lunch time are as expected and the service is usually pretty fast. I go to this location 1-2 times a week and sometimes the burrito wrapping is sub par but it usually good. Overall a above average chipotle. 
3022 4 We haven't moved in yet, but we will be moving in soon. We appreciate the professionalism of the leasing consultant, John Ibsen. We love the apartments and the location. We are excited to be part of the community. 
3023 1 I absolutely despised these donuts. We ordered three different kinds and didn't finish any of them. Each was far, far too sweet. Almost inedible. Can you imagine? Waiting for an hour and then not even wanting to finish the donuts? The tragedy. 
3024 0 The food was not good. The Wellington was ordered medium rare and came out well done. The pork belly appetizer was like shoe leather. Contacted the manager by email and never heard back from them. Would not recommend 
3025 4 Fabulous! Fabulous! Fabulous! Treat yourself to an hour of deliciousness with the elegant and enlightening MaryWynn. Thank you for taking such great care of my Mother! She loved it! We will be back. your products too! 
3026 4 Wow. I've never went to a pho place and finished an entire bowl (even the soup) my entire life. Food is just amazing. Service is great. It's really worth every penny. 
3027 1 Nice bar, but a little too "disney" faux showplace and that detracts from the "reality" of it 
3028 4 Nice solid standard breakfast. Everything was great. If you just want a nice casual place to get some grub in the morning. This is the place. Very nice staff as well. 
3029 0 This place is a nightmare! I chose to have my vehicle towed here after an accident and I would caution anyone else against doing so. 
3030 4 Love Minero! This was our first time visiting and we loved the food and especially the location. 
3031 3 We had the shrimp w/lobster sauce, eggrolls, and dumplings...all were good and they provided the right amount of hot mustard on the side. 
3032 4 The set up of this location is very organized and efficient. I went to renew my license and was in and out of there pretty quickly. I recommend going here instead of the OBT location. 
3033 4 So delicious! Great atmosphere... a small neighborhood spot with high-quality food. Try the avocado cocktail... it's amazing! 
3034 4 Different from other hot yoga classes I have taken, studio offers showers, towels and friendly staff. Wish it wasn't so far from me I did a drop in as my usual yoga studio doesn't have classes at the time I went. 
3035 3 Management making solid efforts to fix on site unforseen issues 
3036 0 I am in search of a go to cheap manicure place in Boulder. This is not it. While it is cheap ($12 vs. avg $15), you get what you pay for. Cheap polish, sloppily done, and rushed. I'd avoid this place. 
3037 4 Revisited the hotel and had a wonderful stay. I would recommend! Thank you 
3038 4 This place at first threw me for a loop. It's like four mini restaurants in one. So many things to choose from and such amazing food. Quick, easy, and delicious 
3039 3 Great food truck. Found it while visiting Portland for the first time and loved it. Good quality food and good service. 
3040 3 Friendly, chill, relaxed coffee shop. Good for studying, and they modify drinks and create a friendly environment. The succulents and decor really makes this place feel cozy. A great place to enjoy a drink, or get some writing/studying done. 
3041 4 I cannot say much more than the best dam tacos I have had for a very long while. Great selection / fresh / and cheap! go make a pig of yourself here, you will thank me later! 
3042 4 Great breakfast. Had the Greek omelette, home fries, and a side of sausage links and everything was great. The menu is huge and will cover all tastes. Excellent service. Highly recommend. 
3043 4 Great ramen spot, I've never had Ramen before but it was really good, we tried three different kinds, I particularly like the thinner noodles, the service was great, the recommended scrimp was amazing and the little bun with pork inside was delicious, would recommend !! 
3044 4 I sat on the porch near the water and ordered Mahi Mahi as well as Oreo explosion dessert. Fantastic service, excellent food. Have not stopped talking about it! Will be back again soon. 
3045 4 Myron was very helpful in guiding me to buy something nice for my husband. BTW- they're located in Sandy Springs in the Abernathy Publix Shopping Center on Roswell Rd. 
3046 0 Food leave everything to be desired. Drinks are overpriced. Always feels like a sauna inside. 
3047 3 It is dark, feels kind of secretive like you've found a hidden treasure. The drinks are pricey and there's always cover ($5 usually), but the bands that perform here are always stellar, well worth the cover charge. Staff has always been friendly though over-taxed. Gets crowded fast. 
3048 4 i have seen the sun rise so many times over this pond. the mostly-paved trail around fresh pond is a great place to go for a two-and-a-half mile run early in the morning. it's a beautiful slice of nature in the middle of cambridge. 
3049 4 Best Thai food restaurant in this area. Good portion, flavorful, great prices. Quality and service is always consistent every time I go there! 
3050 2 It is Chinese food ... Quick cheep and easy Place is nothing pretty staff is what you would expect. Place is around the corner so its a easy meal. i typically get chicken and broccoli and its really good. 
3051 4 Have always loved muu muus. It's a regular for me. Nice booths get the Brutus smash it's bomb been coming here forever 
3052 1 The pineapple buns looked sad and mushy, the cream buns looked sad, the scallion rousong swirly buns looked sad, the coconut raisin buns looked sad... And they all tasted sad too. Poor texture, stale ingredients, limited selection. Simply not a good bakery. 
3053 4 For 10$ you get towels and access to their fitness center which includes fitness rooms, classes, pool, basketball court and much more. I do not know the limit of its expanse. You also have access to locker rooms and showers. It's a clean, professional, awesome gym at a good price. 
3054 4 The food is fantastic! I am so happy I found this little gem! I have tried the carne guisada, menudo, barbacoa, fajitas, and pozole! All excellent! The prices are very reasonable for Austin. Lunch special is $4.99. 
3055 4 The donuts are not just confections, they are real food. Like the difference between cotton candy and valhrona chocolate. Wow. 
3056 0 I had an electrical box in my room start arcing and flashing and banging and called the Eversource customer service line for help and the woman was rude and didn't believe me so I had to call the fire department and they told me to call Eversource. 
3057 4 Love going to Black Bear Diner. Great food, and lots of it. Always have had great service. 
3058 4 Sooooo good. Matambre was delicious, as well as wild mushroom tapas. Cocktails were superb despite long wait (which was worth it) 
3059 4 Good BBQ. I liked it better than the Salt Lick... (note, I can't eat beef so take that with a grain of salt) or ignore this. If you eat Chicken and Turkey, this place is great! 
3060 4 Great drinks. Fantastic short ribs with mashed potatoes. Nice atmosphere. I haven't had short ribs in 20 years, but they were as good as I remembered. Great choice. 
3061 0 Ordered two pasta dishes. Fettucini alfredo with chicken and alioli with sausage. Food was garbage. Fettucini had zero sauce and portions were small. Price was around $26. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the other restaurants inthe area (Alfonss). Dont know how they are still in business. 
3062 4 The Passion Fruit Cocoa Nib donut was amazing! Very light donut - good snack. Atmosphere at Blue Star was great! Very open space and clean decoration. 
3063 3 Real quick, real quick, and then I'll be gone. Listen to everyone about the Cuban sandwich (either the traditional or not). Yelpers get it right on this one. Do yourself a flavor favor and get it because that pork is awesome opossum. Leave the tostones behind. 
3064 1 Over cooked duck with plum sauce served with attitude by a waiter. Yuck. I tried two white wines but could drink neither because they had gone bad. I've tried both locations, downtown and north. Both equally terrible dining. 
3065 3 The pork belly cubano is so decadent, you have to lean your sandwich on the edge of your tray to prevent the fat dribbling out and making the crust soggy. The shredded pork sandwich was great, too. Healthy? Uhh.. No. But worth another hour at the gym. 
3066 4 Was in Austin for the day and our last stop was this food truck park. So happy to find a real authentic italian food. We absolutely LOVE IT. Everything was delicious, made fresh from scratch. Salvatore the owner is super nice and treats you like old friends. Definitely coming back. 
3067 4 We both got 1-hr massage by Glen. It was amazing! I can't say anything bad or mediocre. Just wonderful massage. He listened to all instructions. We will go again. 
3068 4 What a great place. Cool vibe, great bartenders, customer focused owner. I will definitely be coming back for more!!! 
3069 3 I think it's really good. I thought the beef tendon was the best I've had in a Pho. 
3070 4 Definitely go with the tasting menu... Wonderful all the way through Highlights were the beautiful Pinot and smoked sauce pork belly, gorgeous cheeses selection, amazing breads and a red snapper starter that I think was the most perfect bit of fish I ever had. Tender, juicy, fully but not overlooked. 
3071 3 Fantastic selection, always incredibly clean, love taking family here for sushi. The ultimate tuna roll is dynamite!! We can't say enough about this place -freshest ingredients, happy attentive staff and reasonable prices. 
3072 4 I have been coming here several times to get my clothes altered and the service is wonderful. They take there time to ensure that you are satisfied and they are very friendly. I will continue to use their services s. Best place in Cobb to get you clothes tailored. 
3073 2 Disappointed on the service for sure.. I had to fill up my own wine not once but three times. The selection of the food was reasonable. 
3074 3 First time and loved everything including the coquito cake. Will definitely go again. It's pet friendly and that's huge for us. Food was really good, service was exceptional. 
3075 3 The hot pot is great when you go here with it being all you can eat. But the Korean BBQ they just added is terrible. They marinate some of the meat & it's far too strong. They need to improve on it before I ever try it again 
3076 4 The bakery here is amazing. Also I have not seen a better fresh fish variety in all of Austin. The different foods from all over the world make for some interesting dinner combinations. 
3077 4 Spent the week on Austin sampling chile rellenos and these were the best. Nice and spivey. Staff was very pleasant. Great atmosphere. 
3078 4 Emily is the best! The staff are amazing and very kind. Great place to be! Totally recommend everyone. 
3079 4 I have consistently visited this restaurant for over a year now and have never been let down. Their chicken remains in the upper echelon for seasoning, crunch, and tenderness. The sides are always delicious and the tea is always fresh. The service and staff here are great. 
3080 3 Great tacos! Small menu but a very well rounded menu full of all kinds of flavors. Something for everyone! Great service and enjoyed sitting on the patio! Really enjoyed ourselves! Great place! Definitely will go again and take company! 
3081 4 Puffy enchilada plate....a delicious dish of layered meat, puffy tortillas, beef, topped with eggs AND enchilada sauce all over. DELIGHTFUL! Other members of my group had San Antonio migas, tacos, and nacho plate. Absolutely happy with flavor and wonderful service. Ask for Béto. He will treat you right! 
3082 4 Fantastic food and service! The Adana Kebab was delicious and so was the babagannoush. Also loved their bread. Highly recommend it! It's a nice upscale atmosphere and is great for a special meal. 
3083 4 Just ate at Shane's rib shack and had the grilled chicken salad. It was the best I'd ever had. Had a little spice to it great presentation. Customer service and atmosphere was great too. I'll be back for sure. 
3084 2 Pub grub and cold pint, what's not to love? Really nice staff and collection of locals as well as after work crowd 
3085 0 It used to be good but the price is insane now $5 for less oz. VISO will be going out of business with prices like this. 
3086 3 Great lunch place, the pizzas are outstanding. Nice outside patio. The beer list looks good but I'm always coming from work, so I have to stare and dream. Service is a little slow, but otherwise no complaints. 
3087 4 Exceptional skate shop. The real deal, not simply a retail shop with skateboards and skate/surf inspired product. Prices are decent. Even got a discount on my first time shopping there. 
3088 3 This place is a good find. Sushi is fresh and establishment is clean and well run. Has the combo and like the fact the sushi was cold. Service was good. Had a working meeting and were able to chat for a few hours. No wifi yet. 
3089 0 My Gift Certificate for Coldwater Creek Spa was not honored because the company went bankrupt. I think the new spa (Me Spa) should have honored these gift certificates for good business practice. Since it was not honored I will not be going to this new spa unfortunately. 
3090 3 Probably the closest version of East Coast pie I've found in Columbus! 
3091 4 beautiful glass and top tier vaporizers for flower and concentrates! friendly and knowledgeable staff, willing to go above and beyond to help you out. i've been around the greater boston area and if you're looking for quality look no further 
3092 4 In town visiting in Atlanta First time here, service was excellent and food was delicious. For lunch I had the signature Chilean seabass bento box...excellent 
3093 2 Food was absolutly amazing. The staf was a little slow but because the food was so great & cheap I wasn't that mad. 
3094 1 It's the definition of a bar in Allston. Cheap, greasy food and Bud Lites. Better in the summers when the college kids are out of town. 
3095 3 It's no Peet's, but this local chain, and this store in particular in German Village, is a good cup of coffee. You can't beat the location for strolling after or before your coffee, and when in town I head straight here for good coffee without all the Coffee Table dramarama. 
3096 4 I love this place! The customer service is amazing and the food is good !! Today makes my 2nd time coming here and there won't be my last. Also, the food comes out so fast so if your hungry this is a perfect place to go! 
3097 4 Looking for a place to have coffee and pastries. Wow!!! Great variety of sweet and savory pastries! Yum! 
3098 3 I came here twice and every time I order the super burrito with extra beans and sour cream. 
3099 4 Delicious but long waits on weekends. I think it is worth the wait for delicious and creative breakfast options. They also have yummy breakfast cocktails. Great for groups and events, I had my bridal shower brunch here and it was amazing!!! 
3100 4 Cowboy Steak is probably one of the best cuts of meat I have ever experienced. If I don't get it for my dad for Father's Day every year I get scolded. 
3101 4 Strawberry cheesecake is to die for! I'm constantly craving it. Staff was very sweet and helpful. Also, they give student discount which is awesome 
3102 4 The cakes here are really good. Fluffy, light and not overpowered with sugar. We got a small chocolate cake and it was superb, even to the chocolate piece on the top for decoration. They are reasonably price too. No more trips to WholeFoods for birthday cakes! 
3103 2 It's ok. Very slow service, but the food is pretty good for the many items on the menu. The fruit / ice cream bar is crazy fun however. Burgers, Mexican, pizza, ice cream, juice bar? Gordon Ramsay would throw a fit. 
3104 4 The food here is like art. You want to hang on to every single morsel!!! Every dish is totally unique and inspiring. The flavors are so complex and nothing like you've ever had. Consistently amazing food. Favorite restaurant in town hands down. 
3105 2 Sushi is okay. Salmon oshi is way too oily as it had puddles of oil underneath when picked up. Hot night roll was pretty good. Pricing is alright. Found a string floating around in my cup of water too. 
3106 4 My favorite pizza place to go to. Delicious pizzas and friendly staff as well! Get the garlic bread strips! It's around 5 dollars only and it's the same size as a reg size Mod pizza. I love going here on an empty stomach ! Love it 
3107 2 really good pizza and reasonably priced for the size. problem is whatever i order delivery from here its always cold and the drive is about 10 minutes from me... why does this keep happening 
3108 0 Awful service from the cashier...don't bother just go across the street. Where they have great food. 
3109 4 Outstanding customer service from the moment you step through the door. And for anyone who has suffered from negative experiences Dr Wyman is a caring, gentle and efficient professional 
3110 4 Excellent bakery. The hostess is very nice and warm. The wife pastry tastes the same as those at home. Definitely will come for a second time. 
3111 4 The tiny thin egg rolls and the sea food puffs are added to my every order! The shrimp fired rice always comes with an ample amount of shrimp and is very good, even left over!! Cold or hot!! 
3112 4 Yesterday was cold and dreary. My wife and I both wanted Pho noodle soup. We couldn't have chose a better place. It was made fresh. Not greasy. Warmed our hearts and tummy. The best Pho we've ever had ! 
3113 2 The squash soup I had was yummy, but the half-sandwich was kind of meh (not a lot of fillings, or meat). I'd hope for a little more value for ~$7 soup/half sandwich combo. 
3114 4 The best veggi restaurant in B.C Surrey for south indian. Foood this is my second time here its amazing food last time we had ordered Veggie Biriyani and south indian poori platter food was delecious.... Thats y we are back again..... 
3115 3 Yum! The hot fudge sundae is super good. Had it with classic vanilla and candied hazelnuts, and have been thinking about it ever since. As soon as I burn off the calories I'm going right back! 
3116 4 Best burger I have ever had. Should have taken pictures but there's plenty of them out there. The Magic Shroom was incredible. Only downfalls are the line is very long and you pay separate for the fries. 
3117 4 I love Modmarket. Always fresh, healthy ingredients with great flavor and relatively fast service. Everything is delicious: breakfast, salads, sandwiches, pizza and at a decent price point (well worth it). You can't go wrong here. It would be nice to see a small kids menu in the future. 
3118 4 Best of Austin in my opinion. Friendly people, great food, stiff drinks, & righteous bang for the buck! I simply love this place. 
3119 4 One of the better gyros I've had in the Boston area where the meat is "real" and not pre-fabricated. The original is juicier than the chicken. 
3120 4 first time here but wow the coffee is GOOD. vibe is good. FYI they do not have high chairs, something i wouldn't have noticed till i had a kid :) 
3121 4 fantastic food, drinks and service. I have celiac and the waiter was more than helpful. 
3122 3 Great ramen for a downtown location! A lot of my friends prefer this place than others. They do allow a side of cooked noodles to add in when you finish which is a great deal! 
3123 4 Fantastic fantastic fantastic ! Burgers were delicious the service was friendly and the men's room was awesome !!! 
3124 3 Pros: price, location (near downtown) football game place, big screen, 2 bars, customer service, atmosphere, taste, originality of food and making it unique. Cons: Their a Chicago bears place. They can't really help that I guess. 
3125 2 Staff was friendly. Room looks nice, but isn't the cleanest room ever. Smells like stale smoke. Parking lot is packed and can barely get a spot. Was good for a one night quick stop, but would not recommend for leisure or long term. 
3126 4 Love everything about this place! The quality of ingredients is superb, and the dishes are super flavorful. We had the chips & salsa, wedge salad, mula and lots of tacos with pickled veggies. Yum! 
3127 3 Awesome place to go for late night pizza. Mostly because, even if you're not intoxicated, this is still good pizza. Although, I've heard it's not authentic New York pizza... Oh well, I don't really care, it still tastes good. 
3128 4 I was happy to find this gem in the Delta terminal. Service was wonderful. Food (fried clams) was great. And price was what I would of expected for an airport restaurant. 
3129 4 The best coffee in downtown Vancouver! The waffles are different than anything you have had before, but delicious! They have a nice crunch to them and the toppings are savory or sweet. It is a great addition to the downtown Vancouver area! 
3130 4 Love my Santa Fe. Always fresh and so much better than my own version. Maybe cause I can't make good food. But worth the calories cause it tastes healthy! 
3131 4 Very delicious! Tons of tequila options. Had the fundido, tacos al pastor, and the Chilaquiles. All were yummy!!! The Ponce Market is a cool spot to bounce around and try many restaurants in one place. 
3132 4 Great coffee and staff in a chill, modern space. They are always happy to give me a splash of almond milk in my americano. 
3133 4 Food is delicious! It's a small divey place that was unsuspecting in the Sellwood neighborhood of SE. This is not just your average bar food! Fresh and flavorful food. We loved it and will definitely be back when we are in Portland next! 
3134 3 Outstanding pumpkin curry! The Pad See Ew was awesome and on par with our other favorite versions. Having this place be closer than our other favorite Thai place is a bonus. Outstanding, friendly service too. We'll be back! 
3135 4 Great drinks, burgers and sides. Quick friendly service. The sweet potato tots are great. What more could a girl want? 
3136 4 Love Katie! She always makes time for me and listens to exactly how I want my nails done. She's open later than most places so it's super easy to come after work. It's a super chill atmosphere and I always feel welcome and taken care of. I always recommend Katie's! 
3137 4 YUMYUMYUMMMMM Gone here at least six times and never been disappointed. They have a whipped caviar appetizer that I could eat all day. Great lamb. Nice people. Go! You won't be disappointed 
3138 4 tasty food, good place to have fusion of chinese and indian food. Manny was awesome, courteous and great to deal with. We will surely want to visit again. 
3139 4 My favorite smoothie place in Orlando!! Many different options, all delicious & healthy. My personal favorite is The Health Nut 
3140 4 Best pho in Oregon hands down! Always enjoy a bowl of lean brisket soup and their salad rolls are delishes! 
3141 1 Went for dinner and a drink not a booze lesson. Plus the food is just so so. Staff should just serve dinner not give pointers on drinking weird stuff. 
3142 3 Quaint, original style diner with a modern spin. Crab cakes for breakfast, robust coffee. Different take on biscuits and gravy. Attentive staff. Reasonable amount of parking in front of the store. 
3143 2 Chicken salad didn't really contain much chicken - chopped so small it kinda turned the chicken to mush... meh. It wasn't grilled chicken - more like chicken cubes ? Weird. 
3144 4 Best "fried chicken" out there, Asian flair or not. Great customer service. I also had their grilled salmon salad - not a traditional Korean dish, but was extremely tasty and fresh. Tteokbokee is also to die for. Ask for it without the cheese for an authentic Korean taste. 
3145 1 Bourbon bar great. Valet was awful. Waited forever for our car. Literally in slow motion as if they could care less. Made us late for a surprise party we were going to. 
3146 4 My husband and I adore this place. It's the best we've found since moving down here from Seattle/Tacoma. Broth is always perfect, meat is still rare in the soup when you get it, and they don't skimp on the noodles. A great pho experience. 
3147 2 Good food with real home cooking. Sunday morning was slow which was surprising but nice. Service was friendly but slow. Beverage refills were nonexistent. Otherwise a fairly good experience. 
3148 3 A favorite for group meals outdoors in the summer. The things to order are the pizza and THE SANGRIA. Decent prices given Newbury St. location; and good people watching if that's your thing. Many happy memories here. 
3149 3 Pretty good smoked chicken sandwich not to much BBQ sauce and greens and a root beer soda 10$ good deal 
3150 4 Very Very Good! Best Ice Cream around. A little expensive but very good. Go out to Rollies for a family outing or a date. Very good. 
3151 4 Yum. Innovative. We have nut allergy and they took us seriously, we really appreciate it. Relaxing ambience. Attentive servers always with a smile on their face. Good place for meals plus dessert. One stop place for all. 
3152 4 One time, I came out of here after happy hour and a bum made fun of me. I miss you Bean! 
3153 4 Amazing sandwiches for only $2.75. The bread is fresh and crusty, the cucumbers crisp, and the carrots marinated just right. Most importantly, the coldcuts and pate they use are better than those of their nearby competitor, New Saigon Sandwiches. Highly recommended. 
3154 4 Their food is really good, with a lot of veggie options. They also have a great beer list. I would recommend the potato tacos, minestrone soup, pizzas, pretzel, and chickpea sandwich. 
3155 2 The Good - Chicken Gyros and the Hummus The Bad - Very small dining room, we had to sit outside. Service was kind of slow, which is a bummer when you have a small child with you. Not kid friendly. 
3156 4 I have three things I dislike, and one I love when dining out...Matador is doing well for me on all accounts. Tequila at it's finest and 21 and over for the whole place. Beautiful. It's adult time, and a killer atmosphere to boot. I'll be back... ;) 
3157 4 We are regulars (every Sunday) at Uncle Charlie's Finer Diner. Love the food, quick service, but most importantly the amazing staff. They are so welcoming - I feel like they're family Given all the local breakfast places, I choose Uncle Charlie's 
3158 4 Wow. cranberry bran muffin and dirty chai top of the line. Scrumptious. Really good coffee as well.. Awaiting rest of breakfast this chilly Saturday.. Friendly friendly service... Attentive. Homemade scramble w bacon advocado and Brie wonderful. $35 for two but we are fulfilled gastronomically. Heaven.. 
3159 4 great sweet greek woman owner sure, place is a bit seedy, but if you lose your money (which occasionally happens) she gives it to you, no questions asked the free parking in back, rocks around the corner from 7/11 and dunkin donuts what could be better? 
3160 1 I used to love love his theater. HOWEVER they haven't put any money into their theater, seats are terrible my butt and lower back are in miserable pain after sitting through a 2 your movie. Most other theaters have luxury seating now and much cheaper prices. Never going back. 
3161 1 Manager working the register was grumpy, and verbally complained about the difficulty of our large order. They forgot many items from our order, he blamed that in us. Took fifteen minutes to get one iced coffee. 
3162 4 Kevin was my tech and he was great! He explained exactly what needed to be done, was quick, neat, knowledgable and very prompt. I highly recommend. 
3163 4 After our Duck tour, my wife and I had an enjoyable lunch. I had a delicious lobster roll sandwich and my wife had a salad yesterday. Service was excellent too. A historic tavern that is well maintained. 
3164 3 Weekday evenings are the only nights to enjoy the loungy pillows, getting cozy with your dinner partner, under dim, cinematic lights and having a martini or cocktail of choice. Very intimate, warm and sexy. Weekends are jammed packed, still fun, but you might be a little squished. 
3165 4 I had the steak tip and spinach and it was simply amazing!!! The staff was friendly 
3166 3 Great staff. Thirty cent wings (flavor of your choice), and two dollar drafts. Huge TVs, clean floors. 'Nuff said. If you want gourmet food and drink, keep movin'. What you see is what you get. 
3167 3 Delicious and unique food!! The service and food preparation is outstanding. Make sure to make a reservation though as space is very limited. Also be prepared to pay extra for the quality. Overall I would definitely recommend for the sushi connoisseur! 
3168 3 Absolutely love their garlic fish rice bowl! Won't recommend anything else - but the garlic fish rice bowl is perfect on texture and flavour - an absolute must have! 
3169 2 Love that it's organic perfect if you're centrally located prices are a little higher then other farms in their area but the fact that they're organic stands for something. 
3170 4 This place got five stars the moment the waiter told me they could make the Ruby Raspeberry milkshake for me even though it wasn't on the menu at this particular McMenamin's. Also, the Communication Breakdown Burger is excellent! 
3171 3 A nice little brunch recently. Bloody Mary bar....yes! Try the tomatillo green juice...yumEE!! Go ahead, toss in a slice 'o bacon...mmm, good. We enjoyed the Serrano ham benedict & the thoroughly fantastical Salvaje Fideos...ay dios mio! A very busy place...duh. But worth the wait...enjoy! 
3172 3 Very tasty food and such nice people running the place. Everything is made from scratch, nothing in a hot case, waiting to be reheated. You get a lot of food for the price and I can't wait to go back for the goulash and cevapi! 
3173 3 My first time to dine at Gusto was for our office holiday party and I was extremely impressed with the spinach lasagne and the meatballs. The staff were absolutely attentive and enjoyable. Can't wait for my next visit. 
3174 3 The steamed chicken dumplings were awesome! Very slow delivery, but as long as you are fine with that the food is worth it. Loved the General Gau's chicken, and the beef with asparagus too! 
3175 2 I don't understand why this place is famous. It's not bad but there's nothing special about their roast beef. 
3176 4 Best value for best tasting ice cream. This is a win/win situation. Don't tell them I might have paid double what they charge. Seriously though, don't cos that's one of the huge appeals of this place. Great flavors & a friendly staff that encourages sampling. 
3177 4 Awesome food at a great price. Service was prompt and very friendly. I would go back in a heartbeat. 
3178 1 Recommended by an associate for there boil. Although it was quite a few customers, I didn't find it very good. The calamari was superb, but the catfish and chicken were not. 
3179 4 Truly an awesome brunch or lunch spot for a quick and filling meal. I always get the tchotchke. I honestly prefer the savory crepes over the sweet ones. 
3180 2 Outdoor dining is a perfect setting. Owner/bartender is knowledgeable and friendly. Food is boring and not tasty, so if you want something delicious, go somewhere else. Food order was screwed up. 
3181 4 Short & sweet: Service: 4 Food: 5 Wait time: 4 Price: 4 Cleanliness of bathroom: n/a Hi. My name is Alice. I love you. Thanks for coming to Boulder. 
3182 0 If I could give 0 stars I would. I will never give this dealership one more dime of my money. Such a shame I was just there test driving a 2018 vehicle! The service department is awful!!!! Contact me with questions. 
3183 1 This chicken is not all that. It's just lightly fried chicken. The sides are bland as well. Go to Lucy's fried chicken instead, that chicken and sides are the bomb! 
3184 2 To me you're better off visiting Granary than this one. Especially, if you are limited on time. You get the same kind of feel form both locations, but more famous people were buried at the other site. 
3185 3 Good place to chill overall but not easy to find a seat. Mixed berry cake is pretty good, and I like how their banana bread is not too sweet. 
3186 4 This place has knocked it out of the park from day one. Each experience there has been so wonderful. I was there for brunch Sunday and it was fabulous 
3187 2 Fries are good and so are the sauces. The spicy tuna was mediocre. Small space so come with a small group 
3188 3 Quick, easy, and not overpriced. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was fresh, hot, and soooo yummy. I can't wait to try something else from this restaurant. 
3189 2 they are nice facility is super clean all the hairdressers and mani pedicurists are great. I see alot of turn around at the front desk and sometimes find they arent that helpful but everything else is great 
3190 4 Food was really good Burger was juicy and the bun was buttery Staff was really helpful as well 
3191 3 Delicious food! Friendly and speedy service! The bacon infused old fashion is amazing and a must a try. Reservations aren't that easy to get so plan ahead. 
3192 2 During the holidays this place is packed. Expect an hour or so wait. This a vibrant restaurant with something for everyone who wants American food. 
3193 4 My husband, 3 teenagers and I love Mary! We never leave disappointed and she is very affordable. Go see her, she's great!! 1/30/15 Addendum: Add my mom, a retired hair dresser, to Mary's fan club! Nothing but praise in Mary's work. 
3194 0 We had our usual Friday lunch with colleagues here again. I felt very uncomfortable to pay extra for mustard I asked. It makes me think if I will be charged for salt and pepper next time. I recommend management to re-think about their policy to charge for condiments. 
3195 4 This place is so awesomely convenient and fast. I order online, pay online... They know my face when I walk in the door and have my order bagged and ready to over. Now if only I could get them to deliver 2 miles down the road. 
3196 0 WAY WAY WAY too loud today, could feel the bass from a block away. Even at Sheridan's, the grocery store nearby, people were unhappy with hearing their music. Not cool or respectful of the neighboring businesses at all. 
3197 4 Got a shellac mani by Gina, for 20% off since they just moved to their new location and have this special going. Totally reasonably priced (cheap). Fast, efficient, friendly. Nails looks great. Will update after awhile to report on how they lasted. 
3198 4 Good customer service and great facility. Made it easy to enjoy my workout and have a good time. Would recommend to anyone. 
3199 4 It doesnt get better than these guys, not only do they really know their wines and have a fantastic selection - their prices are hard to beat! 
3200 3 Had my brides maid dress altered here. Was swimming in it and had it taken in and hemmed up. Wendy did a beautiful job on short notice, I had it back within a couple of weeks and it turned out great. 
3201 4 Any place that's dog friendly, good coffee and brunch and a smiling waitstaff is top notch in my book! One of the best shrimp and grits ever! My fiancé also really enjoying the traditional American breakfast also. Thanks for the great start to our day! 
3202 4 Excellent service, excellent food. I always leave Cactus Club Cafe completely satisfied! When you stop by this location, try their Veal Pappardelle - my husband and I go to this location specifically for this dish! 
3203 4 One of my favorite Portland restaurants. It's 30 degrees outside so of course they provide lap blankets and have a warm fire lit. The service is always amazing, and your server will always explain menu items and specials with enthusiasm. 
3204 1 Good food, always satisfied.. But the people who work here are rude and extremely lazy. Lots of employees standing around, chatting, while literally every table in this restaurant is dirty. Will be getting my food to-go from now on. 
3205 4 Emo time (in couplets). ....... Filled with self-loathing Full of foreboding 6 years I've been near Delayed coming here Why oh why Cry cry cry What the fuck, I suck. Caffeine: Clean, pristine. Tip well Or go to hell. ....... End Emo rant. I really like the coffee. 
3206 4 Wonderful experience! Really attentive wait staff, wonderful food! Loved the balsamic dressing on the house salad. Pasta carbonara was delicious too! The red sangria was also a hit! We will be back for sure! 
3207 4 Be sure to ask for Pleasant. Very sweet servers that took great care of us. The lobster roll was perfect size for me. The chili was so yummy we took some to go. 
3208 4 Best rad na wide rice noodle in gravy plate I have ever had ! One of the best Thai places if not thee best in portland. 
3209 4 Even more menu options than the original location on Grand. This includes whipped garlic--garlic, olive oil and lemon juice (pretty intense but novel!) and the Arabian Breeze Mezza. The spinach stew is amazing and the vegan baklava is divine. Try one of their Lebanese red wines--all delicious! 
3210 2 I would need to come back to see if this changes. The wine prices was a little high but good selection. I did like the space though, felt comfortable. Food was just ok would need to try more. I would recommend the ceviche. 
3211 4 Phenomenal, nice and long biking route along the water, beautiful with tons of scenery, wildlife and fit people. 
3212 4 my second time to bishops on Mississippi Christa , was excellent she asked questions beforehand and was great with the end results she's amazing with clippers Thank you Christa Tim 
3213 3 As far as laundromats go, this one is pretty awesome. The staff is very friendly and the facility is clean and well lit. Plus, you can do some internet work while you're there! Free wifi. 
3214 3 Bento dish was good. Kimchi excellent. The bulgogi was pretty good. My wife had the soup which lacked the oomph that we are accustomed to. Not enough veggies. Overall decent restaurant and we will be back. 
3215 4 A must when in south end! The Caesar salad, spaghetti aglio olio and chocolate mouse are the perfect order! Gnocchi are good too! Overall, the places is beautiful, always busy and lively and has great service. 
3216 3 Not much English speaking but for a quick massage in place of my regular massage person that is booked up, I'd go again. 
3217 1 Average shrimp scampi. Overpriced and service sucks. Not good enough to be fancy, and not cheap enough. 
3218 3 They expanded the church dramatically many years ago and it is beautiful. They offer a lot of masses throughout the week and there are always special masses going on. Try it out if you live in the area. 
3219 3 Nice, modern atmosphere, not like country-style. However, little disappointed with $20 platter but burger and brisket tots were good. Their slaw was very refreshing perfect amount of dressing for me. 
3220 4 Cute place with plenty of seating. We had a flatbread meal and pella both do whichever ere delicious. 
3221 3 Great food but the service is not always the best. Sometimes you get an amazing one and then sometimes you get someone who can't even check in on you even when there's tons of empty tables. The food is worth it though. 
3222 4 Very clean !courteous staff! Took my kids there and they had a blast. I'm glad they have a separate area for little ones. A good place for kids to play! Btw all ages were in there jumping and having a good time. I definitely will be going back! 
3223 3 AMM did a great job on my Chevy Tahoe. The quote and timeline they gave me was spot on. Per my request, they tried to find after market parts instead of using standard GM parts. But they couldn't find everything. None the less, the price they quoted was accurate. 
3224 4 Outstanding food, great value - lives up to the reviews. Mom and Dad satisfied, all three kids said it was the best food they'd ever tasted. 
3225 4 Cash only, but the food is worth it. The falafel, kibby, lamb and chicken...everything is amazing. 
3226 4 The best mexican food I've ever tasted. Quality staff and the prices can't be beaten 
3227 4 Love ordering Sushi and Hibachi here. Out of this world!! Staff is always courteous and accommodating to our group. 
3228 4 I absolutely adore this nursery. All of the plants are of gorgeous quality and then entire place is beautiful. The staff are all very friendly and knowledgable and ALWAYS willing to help. I could tootle around this place for hours just looking at everything and relaxing. 
3229 1 Service was friendly but it may have been one of the worst meals I've ever had in my life. Everything in the chicken burrito tasted as if it had been sitting out all day. This place does not stand a chance against Chipolte. 
3230 3 Loved the ambience, food was great and kids want to come back! Only critique ...Some things a la carte that might be offered upon request like a small syrup (they are waffles anyway) 
3231 4 The best facials and microderms I've ever had! Stacey is very knowledgeable and pleasant. I don't really fall asleep during facials but I definitely when Stacey is working on my face! 
3232 2 Tasty but not earth-shattering fried chicken. The meat is nice and juicy but the tasty batter could be a little thicker and crispier. 
3233 4 Very, very good pho, noodle bowls, they do it all well. There is a secret dining room downstairs. A real treat especially in the raw, cold, dreary winters. The pho will make it all better. 
3234 2 I don't have much to say about this place... we stopped for a quick pastry on the way out for the day and it was quite the delicious, cheap pastry. If you're in the mood for a little french pastry, this is a good place to come. 
3235 3 This place is legitimately delicious! I come here every time I'm in Portland. Thank you! 
3236 2 Stopped by to grab an adapter before going abroad. Quick service, nice help, and the guy even brought out scissors to free the adapter for me. No cuts here! 
3237 4 I had the pokébowl and it was excellent. It was my first time having poké and the staff was very helpful in guiding me through the process and making recommendations. 
3238 3 Happ Hour - 2-4pm weekdays - 1/2 off on ALL shakes. Worth. The. Wait. 
3239 3 It was very good food. First time at this location. It was very clean and pretty fast service. We were with another couple and the only bad part about it was they switched our burgers on our trays. So before you bit into your burgers, check them. 
3240 1 This location is really hit or miss. The couple times I've been here, the service has been slow more often then not. They seem to get overwhelmed easily which happens often. To add insult to injury, my sausage tasted burned today. 
3241 4 Yes. Yes. Yes. Love their scallion pancakes. Lamb kabobs aren't always available, but they are excellent if you come on the right day. 
3242 4 Amazing cornbread! I always go for the chicken strips basket myself. The space itself isn't necessarily welcome to dine ins. Could use some work. But, the food is great. 
3243 4 Excellent and sophisticated. Dirk's precision and beautiful haircuts with Gabe's artistic and natural color--this is why I feel it takes a village to look great. Highest recommendation!!!!! 
3244 4 Need a donut? This is the place to go! The maple bacon donuts are to die for. Just make sure you are at the correct sugar shack :-) 
3245 4 Found this on Yelp when passing through and craving a sub. Fantastic find! Nicely decorated, and also has an outdoor patio popular with the hipsters. Amazing menu...there's something for EVERYBODY. I enjoyed my sub. 
3246 2 Went there couple times. We ordered the spicy bowl. It's alright, but pricy if you picked more than few items. 
3247 3 The rolls are all fantastic, and the service is remarkably fast. Just try to avoid going between 5 and 7 unless you're keen to wait in line for a while. 
3248 4 My hotel recommended this restaurant and the food was amazing and the service was top notch! Not too far north of Boston and worth every mile. Thank you for a great meal and a great experience. 
3249 4 One of my favorites in Austin. Go every time I can and everyone I take there really loves it! The food is always delicious. I love to find this nice, chic, classy place in the south of congress. Encourage you to go! 
3250 2 This place is pretty average. Service is typically understaffed (good for them I guess with the tips). I don't know why it's categorized as a whiskey bar. 
3251 4 i dream about the lentil soup with chicken the turkey in the salad pocket is heavenly if you haven't had the lamb kebab special...what are you waiting for?! that cinnamony rice is so unexpectedly perfect. LOVE LOVE LOVE alladins 
3252 4 Very nice staff, great coffee and Pie. Can be crowded, which is good for them! 
3253 3 Classy decor, good service. Appetizers and sides were very good, the steak (NY Strip) was (surprisingly) average. 
3254 4 Made reservation via My DIsney Experience. Only place available. Dim sum platter was outstanding. Wonton soup outstanding. Husband commented that his rice wasn't sticky with his maple tamarind chicken Making chopstick use harder, but he said the flavor was good. As with all Disney dining we experienced, outstanding service. 
3255 3 Really good raised donuts. I tried the Sea Salt Caramel Bourbon and the Maple Bacon and enjoyed both. Both donuts had great sweet/savory components, which is a nice change from usual donuts. I'm sure I'll be back many times! 
3256 0 Not sure why I went here without checking Yelp. Would not have. Anyway, typical tourist trap. I. The mood for Greek food so I went in. Obviously it caters to the tourists. Order the souvlaki plate with gyro meat. Almost inedible. Would not waste your time. 
3257 3 Came here for happy hour and dinner. Portions are reasonably priced and big--I took half my meal home. I got the fricase de pollo and it was super flavorful and tender. The happy hour mojitos were delicious, too. Nice ambiance and friendly service. 
3258 4 I LOVE this trailer!! The food is authentic New York/Italian fare and the two brothers that own it are incredibly nice. Try the chicken parm fried pizza ball...the gravy (marinara to us Texans) will blow your mind! 
3259 4 This is the fvckin spot right here. I got the beef drunken noodles like the previous good reviews. I had to get mine extra spicy, it brings out all the flavors. I will definitely hit this spot up again to try somethin else. 
3260 4 great spot. outstanding pea soup. perfect steamed lobster roll. good vibe to place 
3261 4 My boyfriend took me here as I have heard great things. Now that it was at the Short North, we had the opportunity to stop. The sandwich was packed with meat and the Pickles were yummy. 
3262 4 Loved my new haircut. Was nervous to try a new hair stylist but mine was great !!! Told me about great products without the pressure to but. Go here ladies !! 
3263 4 At first bite I was angry because I didn't understand why all other sandwiches I'd eaten in my life didn't taste as good as this one. 
3264 2 It wasn't the worst but it was just ok. I used to eat there years ago and it was a lot better then but the menu has since exploded with tons more options and it seems the quality has gone down some. 
3265 2 Went there for dinner, didnt have any expectations as we hadnt heard about the place before. We actually ended up liking the place. There werent many people when we went so it was kind of quite, the ambience was nice and the food wasn't bad. Service was okay. 
3266 4 I like to shop local as often as possible. I REALLY like this home grown business. Good people good service good pricing. Involved with the community. Definitely worth supporting. 
3267 4 Rosa's is the BEST! They have really great sub shop/pizza house food and they're sooo friendly. their delivery does take a long time but it's worth the wait. and they're the friendliest people ever!!! Give to the good guys! and plan ahead if you're getting delivery. 
3268 4 So good. The guacamole, the legit margaritas, the arroz con pollo. Will definitely come back here. Thanks Chez Jose for closing Monday for May Day! 
3269 3 Top notch kombucha brewer. A remarkable variety of delightful flavor combinations. A healthy concoction that is enjoyable to drink! 
3270 4 This is the best optometrist around run don't walk if you need your eyes looked at she's the person to do it good luck 
3271 0 We waited for almost one hour and everyone came later than us has finished eating. So we eventually did not get food at all and we were in a rush. It is really disappointing. 
3272 4 Interesting little place! The ramen was amazing, service was fast, and the food is a great price ! 
3273 0 This place was so annoying No service , and roaches ! The only thing that was good was the front desk lady 
3274 3 This place has the best sweet corn in the summer. They pretty much have everything. Prices are great too. My only complaint is there is very little parking, and getting out onto Gender Rd. from Shannon Rd. is like asking to die!!!! 
3275 4 Worth the wait! I'm not a huge burger person but if I go for a burger, I pick Hopdoddy! It's in a good area so you can hop are to cool spots around there. The ahi tuna burger is really good too! Oh, and he fries.... SO GOOD! 
3276 3 Delicious foods using kcal ingredients! Not willing to wit in long lines, especially on weekends! Staff very friendly! 
3277 4 They figured out the problem was with my wheel instead of my tire and fixed in promptly! Great service! 
3278 3 Always good pizza. The wait can be terrible sometimes and the strip all 192nd location is a far cry from the old quaint Camas original. But if you don't mind waiting, it's good. 
3279 2 I had the Sweet Greens smoothie. It was yummy, and also nothing unusual as it's the smoothie I usually make at home. But wow, it was pricey! $10 for a small smoothie. That's kind of nuts. 
3280 3 We went there last night ! We had The Eastside Pizza! It was outstanding! Would definitely go again. 
3281 3 Great Pizza!!! Staff is friendly and service is very good. Did I mention they have great pizza?? 
3282 3 Lovely staff here - the lady (I believe she is the owner?) was so kind and welcoming. Delicious food. I had a beef donair and it was flavorful. The samosas were tasty as well. Definitely recommend! Will most likely just do take out in future. 
3283 4 I had a small problem with a to-go order that wasn't initially addressed. The owner called me later and made it right. 
3284 3 Love the food I order from here all the time. If you like shrimp try the salt and pepper shrimp it is amazing and has a nice spicy kick. 
3285 4 Solid food. Good prices. Relatively healthy. Excellent place for lunch. 'nuff said 
3286 2 Meh. I thought it was OK. Lackluster service from the blonde pony tailed waitress 3/1/18 5-9. My margarita was good. House red good. Chipotle Caesar good. The liberal BS posted on the wall pissed me off. Good but not great. I didn't get sick. Nothing to brag about. 
3287 4 Amazing middle eastern food, falafel is fantastic and the bakalava is the bomb! You must try it at Cartlandia SE Portland 
3288 2 I know it's sacrilegious but it's just OK. Don't get me wrong it's ice cram people so it's good but line worthy not for me. 
3289 3 This places great. Sweet and savory concoctions for everybody. I had the blueberry cheesecake and my friend had the seasonal heart throb waffle. We just decided to go family style and eat off both plates. 
3290 4 Mr. Kim and his whole crew at Q are sincere and helpful. They have helped me several times, right when I needed most. I live in the neighborhood and glad there's a reliable body shop I can go to if anything goes wrong. 
3291 4 Great pulled pork! Not a huge portion but just enough. Good slaw, beans were nothing special. Band totally made the experience!! I could have stayed all night and listened to them. 
3292 3 Pretty fresh food and great prices! Awkward entrance but it is worth it. They put onion rings in the pulled pork sandwiches! 
3293 3 Fish tacos were excellent. Fried chunks of fish with coleslaw and chipotle sauce light and refreshing. Chips and guacamole on the side too. Kids had beef taco and wife had a chicken ranch burrito. All good here! 
3294 1 Been here several times with friends. Food is pretty good, but the building is something else - if you want to have conversation, it's a challenge. Low ceiling, hard surfaces all around, and close placement of tables create"background noise" that is overwhelming. 
3295 4 Love their carrot cake donuts!! Yum!! Always tell tourists that I take around with Uber and Lyft, you have to try Blue Star Donuts!! 
3296 4 Great Service! Great Food!! We had such a lovely dinner and our waiter was so friendly and recommended delicious food for us to try! Margaritas are so good! 
3297 3 Small Italian chain restaurant in Celebration and Maitland. I met here for a work lunch and was pleasantly surprised of the service and food quality. The food here is pretty tasty, albeit, not the best Italian I have had. Overall, the experience was very positive. 
3298 0 The pizza was cold and 40 minutes late. I asked for extra cheese and it came with NONE! No cheese. Wtf... this is the second time we have had trouble with Pizza Hut. Dominoes it is. Thanks 
3299 4 If you want a greasy spoon diner this is it. Nothing pretentious. This is a great neighborhood hub and has I have come here for years though it is not a place I eat often. Kids love it too. It is not big inside but there is good table turn-around. 
3300 4 Amazing brunch, we will be back to try their dinner menu! Super fast service and the staff is so nice. 
3301 4 This was out first time eating here and I have to say it was a fantastic experience. The service was excellent and the food phenomenal. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I also posted pics of our meals. 
3302 4 this place has good pizza and whats bad ass is they sell draft beer double score. 
3303 4 Try the union salad with falafel. Great size and proportions of veggies! I drink black coffee and have never had any complaints with theirs. All around it has a great atmosphere and one of my go to places! 
3304 0 Absolute dump. Plenty of air freshener to give the appearance of cleanliness. The floors are filthy. This place was great in the 60's I'm sure. The beds are less comfortable than an army cot. 
3305 4 Not sure why there there are not more reviews. Great gluten-free pizza and happy hour tapas to die for. Many gluten-free options. Great atmosphere and a killer bartender that can mass produce great silver coin Mary's on short notice. 
3306 4 Really good authentic Mexican food. Atmosphere reminds me of a favorite spot in mexico. I left my purse there by accident and went back the next morning and they had put it away for me! Honest people! 
3307 4 I like this place! Clayton was easy to work with, really quick to respond and did a great job washing my giant deck... which had turned in black in some areas and needed a heavy duty cleaning. I'd definitely use them again! 
3308 4 Always great service. They call before any unexpected work is done. I have no idea how their rates compare to others mechanics but I always get good service, even on short notice needs. Recommendo. 
3309 2 Food is good, but the reason it gets three stars is because of the incredibly bad service I get every time I go. So much that I'd rather head to First Chinese BBQ or the one by the Hong Kong supermarket. 
3310 4 Great atmosphere with good coffee! This place is definitely a haven for hipsters, but it seems like a good place for people to meet and study. Although I was not impressed with their pastries. Yuck. 
3311 2 Me imaginé más bien un outlet, pero es un lugar para seguir consumiendo y engordando. La ropa NO es más barata de lo normal y los lugares para comer son más bien caros. En general es muy bonito, linda decoración y música en vivo; como para venir a mirar. 
3312 4 A good place to frequent if you want to dine along the waterfront. The bartenders are great and make speciality cocktails not on menu. The go to here is the shrimp kisses, cannot miss ordering this appetizer! 
3313 4 The bar style fountain coke is exquisite at this newly designed Chinese eatery, plenty of flavor with not too much ice, a perfect compliment to a hot plate of pan fried noodles..... no veggie :) 
3314 1 Is not worth the money for the taste and quality. Sushi garnish with fried onion on top? The wasabi doesn't taste hot at all. Price is to high for the quality. 
3315 4 Just had their sushi burrito and wow... SO good! I don't think I'll be able to go back to regular rolls again. It was incredibly fresh and the combo was amazing! I now have a new addiction lol. I ordered the Samurai Dragon burrito, yum!!! 
3316 4 My go to place for pho. Good spring rolls - cheap! Get here early... by noon the place is packed. 
3317 1 is it good? yes- is there far better around?YES. service: mediocre-fine food: lobster was good but a little overdone (we did the whoel lobster grilled), the BBQ shrimp were luke warm, and lacking a little in flavor but still ok 
3318 4 Good selection at the buffet and the meat to choose from is also well prepared. The restaurant has beautiful finishes that create a great atmosphere. If you're not a beef/pork fan, I recommend looking at other restaurants - chicken selection is limited but there is lamb! 
3319 3 This place is great. Huge menu. Family friendly. Prepared to order and quick service. Gyros are outstanding, and bigger than most. Great pickles. French fries are cooked to perfection. Traditional cafeteria style restaurant with just about anything you could think of on the menu. 
3320 0 Sushi price way to high, extremely small portion, and is not fresh!! Will not go back ! 
3321 4 Got the Good Dog over cheese grits and it was the bomb.com's mother good. Loved the ambience and setting of the place too. Be cognizant of the possible wait. 
3322 3 it is a good experience for knowing and touching u.s. history, however, i think 15 dollars is fine, not worth 22.5 dollars. 
3323 3 Love everything about the renovated old house. Love that there are many outdoor seating options. Love that they incorporated games into the setting. Not so into the drinks I've had there.... Not into battling the mosquitoes outside.... Will definitely be back.... 
3324 4 This is on Lavista Rd. at Chesire Bridge behind Publix. Great food. The grilled octopus legs misty be sprinkled with crack, can't stop eating them. Cabbage ramen was great, spicy soup level 2 was definitely hot. Great place, not much seating 
3325 3 Very different experience. We had multi course meal at chefs discretion. Need to like sashimi. Unique and tasty. Good service. Expensive. 
3326 4 The best poutine (the french way of making heaven, fresh hand cooked fries with curd cheese and gravy) south of Montreal period. 
3327 4 I put my old, beloved dog to sleep tomorrow. I brought her to tin shed to get her a nice final meal of their homemade dog food. They gave it to me for free. During hard times like these, little things like that make a difference. Thank you. 
3328 4 Excellent lose leaf tea blends with subtle delicious flavors. The jalapeño waffle is the BEST thing I ate in Portland. Kudos to the creator. 
3329 0 The place is beautiful. The staff is great. The food is terrible. I love sushi, I don't even know how they succeed to make such bad sushi. I went because of the reviews, ordered 4 rolls, but it was the worse sushi we ever tried. 
3330 4 I hang out at Java House nearly every Saturday morning. It's a great little neighborhood coffee shop. The owner, Cora, is really nice. The staff is great. The munchies come from the excellent Main Street Bakery. 
3331 4 Had them cater and they were awesome They helped with the menu and were very reasonably priced The food was great. Tons of compliments from guests I will definitely use again 
3332 4 My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town. I love the pho and the vermicelli bowls. I've tried many other places and none compare. 
3333 0 Don't come to this bar if you don't want to experience racism first hand! Kicking people out for being hispanic! Amazing that they're still in business. 
3334 4 Hands down the best chicken fried rice I have ever had and SUPER bonus points for the late night hours!! 
3335 4 One of the coolest starbucks in the ATL area. Decor feels like something like a mountain lodge. Staff is super friendly and they move a lot of customers through here very quickly. 
3336 4 Fantastic job by Earl and Dave! We never had such painless and smooth moving experience. These guys came spot on time, were super kind and nice, worked quickly and very professionally. Best movers ever! Thumbs up! 
3337 3 Tried a bunch of tapas-first time here-definitely exceeded expectations! From the bread and butter, to the fried chicken, lobster, all really great and unique! Definitely looking forward to coming back here to try others. 
3338 0 Went there for bingsu and was so disappointed. I can make a better softer shaved ice at home!! The whole thing lacked flavor..even their ice cream doesn't have flavor. Don't understand why or how but it was awful. 
3339 4 The spare ribs will make you drool and beg for more. I had the cheesesteak as well and it was very well flavored, a good compliment. I wasn't impressed with the Formosa roll but it was a gamble. 
3340 4 Great martinis!there is literally nothing bad on the menu! Have a waffle or six! Long wait as it's a popular tourist destination and located by many hotels. Very accommodating service even while busy! Try an Elderflower Martini or a Chai latte 
3341 1 Gone 2 times 1st time it took 45 minutes to be served in the evening on a Thursday. Flautas were ok but not the best. 2nd time was for lunch on a Thursday. Tried Thier enchiladas they were served cold and so were the plates of my coworkers. 
3342 4 Went for breakfast on the weekend with friends. Great gluten free food and good for you too! 
3343 0 Had high hopes for this place, but these guys are like really pushy car salesman, asking too many questions. Couldn't just look around. 
3344 4 After magic kingdom Im so hungry. they gonna close but still let me dine in there. I really feel so sorry about that but realllllly thankful! great food great service！ 
3345 4 Excellent bar with amazing staff! The pizza is the best on the south side:) never a dull moment. 
3346 3 Nice friendly place. Great monster soft pretzels. Had a awesome pulled pork sandwich. They make the pork in house. 
3347 3 This place quietly has the best butter chicken downtown. Indian owned and I ain't talking prairies. 
3348 4 Thai veggie curry puff is awesome!! So is the pad thai! The thai iced tea is also delicious. It is the best place to get thai food in Somerville. I just moved to Chicago and I miss it like crazy already! 
3349 3 The staff are so kind, it's just my first time here and they make me feel welcomed. Big thanks for them. 
3350 3 Great spot! I love the Mediterranean cuisine. If you want a taste of South Easy Asia, this is the place. The service is impeccable and they are very concerned about your experience. That pays for itself. I love good service! So check this place out and support this local business. 
3351 2 Coffee is good, albeit significantly smaller portions than most other espresso bars these days. Music was unbearably bass-thumpy loud making it hard to read and causing others to shout to hold conversations. 
3352 3 This is an awesome store. They give you big free samples of chocolate as soon as you walk in. Chocolate is everywhere you look. The milkshakes are delicious. 
3353 4 This place has the best lemon chicken I have ever had. Good food. Good people. Small place. 
3354 4 Meire is very reliable and trustworthy. She has been cleaning my apartment for six years. She does a great job. I have recommended her to friends and they have very happy with her. 
3355 4 Food was great, waitress was extremely nice and attentive, but Vinnie behind the bar was awesome. He brought us a bunch of cocktails to sample and even gave us some recipes to make at home. There's a reason he's the best bartender in ATL 
3356 2 This is 3 Stars, this is "A-OK", this... is McDonalds. This particular one has "classed-up" the place and you can now watch CNN on a flat screen as you eat. There's also a Redbox here. 
3357 4 That OG and Meyer lemon curd are two of the best donuts I've ever had. Really fresh, good ingredients and a cool store. I'll try the bourbon blueberry next as it seems to be a favorite. 
3358 4 Authentic and delicious. The place is a bit theme-y and crowded, but it's still a fun atmosphere and the food really does deliver. 
3359 3 What a cool spot with American menu. They also offer ceviche of either lobster or shrimp Very tasty. I highly recommend the gatsby drink. Very refreshing cocktail for those summer days. A perfect ladies drink. 
3360 4 I was on a tour of Portland and the driver recommended Salt & Straw. I got a few samples and fell in love with the Chocolate Fudge. Try it with some candied hazelnuts on top! So good! 
3361 2 Decent burger, great shake, speedy/friendly service. My experience, though not anything special, left me satisfied enough to want to make another visit somewhere down the road. 
3362 4 I love these guys. I have worked with Scott in a commercial setting and in my home and he is always friendly, professional and courteous. Definitely request Scott if you want top notch customer service. 
3363 4 She is a great dentist! I love how much she cares about her patients. She has an awesome new office too. She practices naturopathic medicine also. She has been a great provider and I plan to stay with her as long as I can. 
3364 4 Food was great and our server April was the absolute best. She made us feel very welcome and was spot on with everything! 
3365 4 Ice cream with alcohol in it!! What's not to love! I tried the ButterSCOTCH and loved it. So tasty! I would like to come back for the RUM Raisin. Dessert with a kick! Yummy! Also, the interior was has Adventures of Tin Tin comic and that's pretty cool too! 
3366 3 Very fresh sushi. High quality. Friendly service. Great drink menu. Will visit again in the future. Highly recommended! 
3367 4 All i've had so far are the tofu soups, but they are outstanding and affordable and keep me coming back again and again. If you're lucky you'll be in a spot where you can watch the kpop music videos, so fun. Yum, i'm salivating just thinking of those delicious soups. 
3368 4 So filling and delicious I want to keep going back (and I will). Since this is the kind of dish that every country does in their own way, I wasn't expecting much, but they really know how to please. I am methodically going through everything on their menu. 
3369 1 Great food but I will NOT give them 5/5 stars until they implement compost & recycling bins in their stores! Also, I will not recommend them to my friends until that happens 
3370 4 I've never actually been to the restaurant, but the delivery is always on point& very nice drivers. It does take around 30-45 min. but I'm okay with that because the food is good! 
3371 3 This was truly my best first best cuban-food experience. Their ropa vieja was wonderful! 
3372 4 Didn't know this place was there until last week. All those years wasted not trying this place sooner. I am always in search of great cupcakes and this place works. Friendly shop too. 
3373 0 I honestly wish I could leave a zero stars, this hotel has the worst service and they clearly don't care to improve! 
3374 4 First time here, Kazu gave me a very good haircut and style : ) love it. Will go back for sure. Kazu is a Kind an have lots of experience. 
3375 4 Excellent in all regards. Prices are reasonable for the level of quality. Personable and warm service. 
3376 4 Still love this place, they've altered the music a bit so it's not as heavy on the rap. Also, they have fixed the monitor problem since I haven't seen that be an issue for some time now. Great workouts! 
3377 3 We stop in here alot and sit at bar. Good for a drink and app. The pizza was light and yummy. 
3378 2 If I had known this was in perimeter mall, I would have skipped it. Service was great. Food was above mediocre but expensive. Pretty typical mall restaurant. 
3379 4 I absolutely love yogen fruz and am only able to have it is when I'm in van city or Chicago, il! They need to expand more! I always get the original tart with lots of fruits! But overall, great frozen yogurt and great service! 
3380 0 turn off the screaming ad on your website. the pause button doesn't work. geez. 
3381 3 Great food, I've tried Pad thai, Lo main, General Gao and a crazy maki roll, everything was delicious, highly recommended 
3382 3 Donuts are extravagant and tasty. For $2 a donut, you get a lot of food because those donuts are large! Most donuts are way too sweet for me, but what can I say?? It is a donut so it shouldn't be healthy.... 
3383 4 This place is a gem, quality food, warm and welcoming service, and the only place I've found in my neighborhood with delicious seafood at reasonable prices! 
3384 0 Filthy n terrible customer service. I stood there for almost 10 min waiting for my cup for my drink. Never again! I had no where to eat because of no clean tables. 
3385 4 - cheery - clean - genuinely friendly - delicious - well thought-out flavors - bright atmosphere 
3386 2 Taro was great, the Mango was great, the Mocha was so-so, needs a touch more mocha for better flavoring. Otherwise, great friendly service. 
3387 4 This place doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is very good. I would strongly recommend if you like seafood. If you do not, you will not like it. Great flavor. 
3388 1 Good tapas but not that cheap. Excellent service. Weakest drinks in Atlanta! Do NOT order an overpriced mixed drink. My buddy & I spent over $60 each on mixed drinks and what a waste. I will go back but will only order bottled beer. I recommend you do the same....... 
3389 4 Great company to use for catering! I have worked with them on multiple occasions and they are easy to work with, communicated well during the planning process, and executed set up/food/and breakdown nicely. Perfect for Texas themed cuisine! 
3390 4 Fair pricing, great customer service and fast at repairs. Got my car fixed here and I am very happy with my experience. They charged one third the estimate I got from Firestone. Thanks!! 
3391 4 First meal in Vancouver and I am glad we chose this place. The lattees were great start to the meal. The menu offers many options for all tastes. Do not leave this place without trying the speciality of the house: waffles and dipping sauces. Amazing!!! 
3392 3 An excellent meal very pricey great service great waitstaff. :) :) fresh and clean Enjoy 
3393 4 Strawberry lemon pepper wings!! OMG so good and baked to perfection. I love wings and these are so different yet mild in flavor but perfect if u know what I mean. 
3394 4 Been do'in Richi's for years. Best cart on the west coast. Fresh, delicious, well prepared food. The cabeza anything rocks. And reasonable. 
3395 4 I must say that they make the best cost effective sushi in this neighborhood. I'm hooked on the spicy tuna roll. Always my go to when I'm too lazy to cook or have that sushi craving. 
3396 4 This is a great coffee shop. Plenty of seating room, friendly staff, and the Toffee Coffee is amazing! 
3397 3 Delighted by the quality of the food! The staff here (especially Jonathan) are very hospitable and are ready with a good recommendation! Can't wait to go back! 
3398 3 Great space for a seminar heavy convention. Well kept, clean, and comfortable. Several food places and stores for the rare break in meetings. Also, free parking! 
3399 4 Very relaxing spa, did not feel like I was being rushed as in other places. The prices are very reasonable and the staff was very friendly. 
3400 3 Thin and crispy crust, not too heavy on the ingredients, unlike many places that load it so heavy you taste nothing. Less ingredients like they do it here allows you to taste everything on the pizza. Prices are good, service is fast, and is a welcome addition to my neighborhood. 
3401 4 I used handy for their housekeeping services and was 100 percent satisfied with the results. I worked with Rosa specifically and would definitely recommend her to others. Very happy with this app and the services provided. 
3402 4 Food was phenomenal and service was great even on a packed Friday night! The truffle fries are a must! 
3403 3 Nice location, but if you blink You'll miss it. Very casual family atmosphere. Food is good, usually order pizza and cheesy garlic bread. Great place to take family. Not up to par for entertaining guests, unless they are close friends. 
3404 4 Yes!!!! This place will knock your socks off in terms of service and providing the best care. Compared to most grocery stores, it's pricier and smaller. However, staff are super-friendly and will help you every visit. Nevermind the 'wholier-than-thou' attitude of some other customers and you'll love the experience!!!! 
3405 4 I love this restaurant! My family and I have been coming here weekly for years. The food is delicious! 
3406 4 Awesome neighborhood "dive bar". If you love a low key place to eat, drink, and watch sports this is a great choice in this area. Wings were great. Bloody Mary's solid. 
3407 4 Spinach and hazelnut empanadas will be the death of me. I will consume my own weight in these addictive devil pastries. OMFG they are SO GOOD! 
3408 2 This place is pretty descent for breakfast. A step up from a diner but nothing to go crazy about. Its very small and can get crowded. The Brazilian food is good and adds a nice mix to all the Italian places in the North End. 
3409 3 Stopped in for lunch on Wednesday. Great waiter. Had the blue cheese burger. I thought it was wonderful. Best cheese I've had in Portland. Price was right. Restroom was clean, which I thought was a bonus for a pub. 
3410 4 Hopdoddy is awesome in every regard. I have tried all of their burgers and they are all incredible. They also have local brews on tap which is a nice bonus. Other than Phil's, there isn't a better burger in ATX. 
3411 4 Best, best, best chicken I have in a long time. Good place to eat.!! Wait took a little bit but it's worth the wait..!! Trust me.!! 
3412 3 Perfectly good chinese chow. There have been a few wrinkles with ordering online (they didn't realize where the orders printed out), but overall it's timely and tasty. 
3413 4 One of best restaurants in town. Was on phantom. Owner is extremely nice and helpful. Unique menu. Get there early it's busy!!! 
3414 3 Wonderful dinner last night. Chicken livers, duck breast , falafel all perfect Great service. A bit over priced. We will be back. 
3415 4 It's a local brewery with damn good tasting beer. What more could you ask for?? 
3416 4 Killer food. I had the mushroom burger and subbed the meat with a veggie patty. Should have bought 2! 
3417 1 Can't understand the hype, but it might be that we also didn't go during the brunch time like everyone recommended. Quail was not good and neither was the bisque I got. I might have hit an off day, but I would not come back. 
3418 1 Places is living on it past reputation....Food,service and atmosphere nothing really special... Over priced and really stuffy... Enough said 
3419 4 So good! Conveniently located near Georgia tech in midtown atlanta. The.food is so delicious and the staff rocks. Great quantity great quality. Do it! 
3420 0 We arrived in Boston last night and we're so excited to dine here. What DISAPPOINTMENT! "higher" thank PF Changs. No sure how the chef is a James Beard award winner.. server Xavier was amazing!!! Really bummed that we wasted a night here. 
3421 4 Just the most awesome Philly cheese in portland, and a great value too. Tragically, i live in the burbs so it is a rate treat to get to Pioneer Courthouse Square for lunch. You need to catch this cat by 4:50. 
3422 3 Awesome authentic Mexican food, great service, cheap prices. Off the beaten path and hardly ever for than 2 or 3 other groups of patrons. I have been eating here for over ten years and the quality of food has remained consistent. I can't wait to eat here again. 
3423 1 Visited Bagelville in 2010 and what an amazing place to grab a satisfying breakfast. Unfortunately after the growth of the company the quality has dropped tremendously. Old bagels, gallon orange juice advertised as fresh, watery cream cheese, not to mention the lack of alternatives now. What a failure.... 
3424 1 good food but very bad service. i said thanks never heard it back from them. really arrogant owners. 
3425 4 A true gem, this little restaurant has impeccable food and service, with nice little touches like fresh flowers on the table, wonderful surprise ingredients and beautiful presentation. Creative and innovative, with awesome attention to detail. Everything was superbly fresh and exquisitely prepared. 
3426 3 I would give it a five but they charge your for a topping if you wanna sub it. Thats pretty lame to me and just a way to nickle and dime the costumer.. But the pizza is good. 
3427 4 Beautiful and very unique antique china that is competitively priced. The owners are extremely knowledgeable and provide incredible customer service. 
3428 4 The spicy kale wrap was delicious!! I never knew this place existed. Definitely a hidden gem in Atlanta. I will be back. 
3429 4 Crawford Tire is an outstanding business! I've had a number of repairs done and when I needed tires, this was the obvious choice. They beat online prices! Very professional and courteous. Support local businesses! 
3430 4 It's been awhile, but you all make some incredible food for the mind. I needed you guys to be open to people who who want to sit at your restaurant. That's disappointing that your sit down is limited. Delivery is tasty 
3431 1 In theory, this should be a delicious, wholesome and quaint place to eat-- in reality, it's completely mediocre. 
3432 3 Certainly the best wine selection in Austin, I tend to use the place when I'm looking for a gift for someone, as I'm certainly not a connoisseur. Very helpful staff, and they offer a good collection of gourmet beer, sake, liquor, chocolate, cheese, etc. in addition to all the wines. 
3433 4 The ingredients are organic and natural! Found this gem last week, and loved it!! I got the Mexicana Spinach wrap...so good!!! The detox water bar is amazing. Kinda reminds me of Fresh to OrderThis will be my new spot for sandwiches!! 
3434 1 We were excited for sushi and noodles, but we ended up very disappointed. Our sushi (the coconut shrimp roll) was topped with rotten avocado. The chicken noodle soup dish had dry, tasteless chicken. And the beef hand-pulled noodles dish had mostly fatty beef. Be careful what your order here! 
3435 4 Stopped by because we were in town for a wedding. Food was incredible and management was super nice. We had the chicken soup, lomo, rotisserie chicken, Cuban sandwich, and veggie sandwich. Everything was delicious. 
3436 3 After being rudely treated in Brookline (see Cafe Fixe review), we came here. Very friendly bearded cashier and cheerful blonde woman at the helm. Good strong coffee and a lovely cappuccino. Nice blueberry scone. Good but tiny cranberry walnut muffin. We'll be back. 
3437 4 The only place to go in Austin for anything tire related. Quick, inexpensive and honest service! 
3438 4 I frequently visit this place because it's great all around. You really can't go wrong with any of the food or drink compositions. I would rank it as one of my favorite Portland restaurants! Don't miss the bellwether or chicken and waffle! 
3439 3 Such a great place to spend a beautiful day. There are free, guided tours on the weekends, but it's easy to get lost in the historic beauty of the cemetery on your own. Completely non-morbid and refreshing to find a green space in this park of Atlanta. 
3440 1 Poor quality lunch all you can eat. Tempura is not fresh. BBQ Chicken is not too bad. Not recommend 
3441 3 Went back again today... And they have restored my faith! Quick, polite service and my husband said his burger was the best he's ever had! Great choice for us today! 
3442 4 One of the best burgers I have had hands down. Love the locally grown ingredients used and the local brews. Super friendly people with a cool vibe. 
3443 4 Love this place! Had the Don't be Shellfish roll (my favorite with that spicy mayo and mushroom combo) and the Mother of Dragons Roll and another roll with squash. Definitely going to be going here regularly. Fresh veggies, delicious flavor combos!! 
3444 4 We love this place! The food is good, love the curry, the service is good and the appetizer/salad bar is great! We go for lunch on the weekend and it is always yummy and priced right! 
3445 3 This place is great for happy hour. Yes, it's crawling with hipsters, but the servers are friendly without being fake, drinks are cheap and tasty, and the truffle popcorn is ridiculously delicious. 
3446 4 Very nice office ,great staff ... Latest technology.... What else could you ask for !!! 
3447 3 The best margaritas in the city!!! Fresh guac made tableside (I don't eat it) Chips and salsa on the table Fish tacos were excellent Everyone was freindly 
3448 3 Squeeky cheese curds without flying to Wisconsin?!?!? Thank you, Sprouts. 
3449 3 near me in south boulder, so really nice to have a store with a decently good selection, better than wf--who they pretty much put out of business at the Baseline store. they have everything WF has at a better price, but not as good as Nat Groc vc. 
3450 4 There's something to be said for using doughnut as part of the meal :-) my favorite meal here is their Count Gourdough Cristo. Overall, I'd say it a great place to watch some TV, have a cold one, and enjoy a delicious meal! 
3451 4 Excellent prices for the quality of pizza and my partner really enjoys the gf crust! Takes a bit of time to cook at home, but delicious once you get the timing right. 
3452 4 I found this place online. The staff was amazing, very friendly and made me feel at home. When I'm in Atlanta again I will come back. I had the fish and grits It was so good. Great spot need 10 stars 
3453 3 There can be a long wait at the pharmacy for new scripts but once your just refilling the drive thru window is great. Pharmacists seem to know theie stuff- especially the one at night. I love that it's 24 hours- super convenient. 
3454 4 So amazing! They have real authentic Italian Pizza, and homemade ice-cream. My parents vacation 3 months out of the year and go here a few times a week and bring all their visitors. Wont be disappointed. And very reasonable prices! 
3455 3 Excellent pizza, and they deliver very quickly! We ordered 2 specialty pizzas and some salads that fed 7 of us very nicely. We were all shocked on how quickly the ffood came to our house. I'll be back! 
3456 4 Came in close to closing and they took great care of me. Even waited till I found my coupon. 
3457 4 Very good drink prices. It's more of a place to go drinking and have food than a place to have food and drink, if that makes sense. Good place for NFL and cfb games. 
3458 4 The food was great. Such a variety. Service good. Prices a little high but not outrageous. I will definitely be returning. 
3459 4 We just had a photo shoot @ this venue and it was a wonderful experience! Kyle the venue representative was extremely accommodating with our last minute questions / requests & the location was incredibly beautiful at sunset! I highly recommend this space for any event you might be hosting! 
3460 3 was here for lunc, food was good, healthy choices, i had the salmon, it was a bit dry, enjoyed the side of white bean ragout. The service was attentive and quick. Their wine list is versatile, but maybe a bit over priced. 
3461 0 DO NOT EVER CALL THIS COMPANY.. RIDICULOUSLY RIPPED US OFF. $90.00 charge to get a part which he should have in his truck. And he didn't mention when he quoted us before he took off. $190.00 for about 20 min work. Once again do not use them, please!! 
3462 4 I am a sushi fanatic and this place is my favorite near UCF for sure! The staff has always been quick and friendly and food has always been on point ! Get the Knight's roll and you won't be disappointed! 
3463 3 They serve the best donuts in all of Boston. I especially love the Boston Cream donuts. Their breakfast croissants are yummy! The staff is equally as pleasant. If you go here, you'll never go to Dunkin again. 
3464 4 Philly cheese steak, Philly cheesesteak, Philly cheesesteak. And they come in three different sizes. I love this place!! The staff was friendly, courteous. The prices are good and the beer is cold. This should be an Atlanta landmark! Highly recommend. 
3465 4 Super dope place to grab breakfast, easy parking and filling portions. Pricing was on point and the service was cool. I'd definitely go back for sure. 
3466 3 I think what makes them unique is the quality of the bread they use. It really makes the sub special in my opinion. They also prepare and serve your order super fast. This location always gets our order out so fast we can barely believe it. 
3467 3 Great place, good food, and the dancer...the music...really fun night! We will definitely come back again. 
3468 2 Food is 3.5. The restaurant itself lacks atmosphere. Service is good. It seems like most of business is carryout and delivery. We tried it with a groupon and overall were satisfied...nothing amazing...nothing horrible. 
3469 4 The place is very small, but quaint, with tables outside for overflow. We had the pork with rice, potato ball, Cuban, medianoche, and coffee. All the food was fantastic, the service was AWESOME!! The Cuban coffee was pretty great too! We will be back again! 
3470 4 We love this place! The lean brisket is delicious, moist and so flavorful! They turkey is excellent, the sausage is great- they have jalapeño and regular. They have more sides than a lot of bbq places and they are pretty good too. Such a convenient and good place! 
3471 3 I'm certainly pleased. There are plenty of machines and it is always clean. I think they finally finished the steam room too! The staff is very nice and always helpful. I would be REALLY impressed if they decided to add a pool...wishful thinking... 
3472 1 The bad reviews are true sadly. I went there hoping they weren't. Sausage was so hard and dry I could not cut it with my fork. Gravy on my biscuits was cool, but thank goodness there was barely any. My partners chicken fried steak looked like they'd fried up cardboard. 
3473 4 Coopershawk is my favorite upscale restaurant. It's great for parties. It's great for date night. It's great for any occasion. I have been a member of their wine club since the week they open. 
3474 4 Bike Gallery is great! Online they have amazing deals and their in store staff is knowledgeable and helpful. I am so pleased with the new Cannondale I purchased! Thank you. 
3475 3 Although I've only been here for brunch I had a wonderful experience. We arrived on the early side so did not have a wait at all and the food was out of this world. Definitely a fun place to go when visitors are in town! 
3476 2 Every time I go there, I always order seafood curry. It tastes like light Tom ka gai soup. Service is always good. The price is quite high but it's reasonable for me because it's at Disney! 
3477 0 The place is old and needs major/modern renovation. Seats are small and not reclinable as other modern theatres. Whoever seats next to you gey ready to bump shoulders (but this is Austin, everything is old and overcrowded). Food is ok and have a good selection of draft beers. 
3478 1 Pricey and rude. I've been here 3 times and the staff hasn't always been very pleasant. Don't think I'll visit again. 
3479 4 Tracy was great!!! I am glad I tried this shop! I'm happy with my nails.... just got them Saturday and already getting compliments 
3480 4 Hands down the best nachos I've had and I've been back twice for their nachos and ipa. Kiddos to the bar tender and especially the waitress. On point respectful and fast. 
3481 4 The vegan burrito there is amazing. It is definitely the best I have tried on the east or west coast. Be warned though, if you go all in on the size you choose it will be a fork and knife burrito rather than one you can eat by hand. 
3482 4 My husband and I usually get take out and it's always good! Our orders are always correct and the staff is super friendly. Will definitely continue coming back. 
3483 3 Green muenster was delicious. Bacon was crisp not greasy and avocado perfectly warmed. The breads was golden brown with a side of truffle fries and a peach Arnold Palmer. What's not to like! 
3484 1 -1 food, which was uninspired and overrated. -1 for atmosphere, as the ratio of screaming toddlers to adults was 2:1. -1 for staff, who were absent, disorganized, unfriendly, and indifferent. 
3485 3 Awesome first experience, I went here for lunch for a first time experience and was really impressed with the attention the wait staff paid to customers. The food was very good and I was even introduced to a new beer by our waiter. I will definitely be taking family here. 
3486 1 The jewerly department was mostly empty. The cases were papered over and the displays were very minimal. It was like a closed out department. Wasted space. Needless to say I didn't find a simple pair of silver earrings. Target you need to rethink your jewelry department. 
3487 1 Nothing really stood out here. The food wasn't bad but it was nothing special either. I had the worst dinner roll I ever had here. Completely tasteless and bland. 
3488 2 Nice resort, only complaint is that we didn't get any complimentary lotion so I called the front desk and asked. They brought some up after like 40 minutes and it was past 10pm. Free parking, comfy rooms, and a balcony to enjoy the fresh air. 
3489 3 My wicked cheap cheese enchilada plate was very good but not quite as warm as it should have been. I went there at an odd time so I'll forgive them for it this once. 
3490 4 Great place to shop for yourself or for a gift. A variety of items from clever and creative to beautiful and sentimental. The owner and staff are very welcoming and helpful, yet let you just browse if that's what you prefer. 
3491 4 This place is fantastic!!! The owner is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. You can't go wrong with letting him choose your box for you. Everything I have had here is delicious; I especially like his variety of homemade "pickled things". 
3492 4 Seriously love this place. Great experience I had when I booked my wedding attire here. Manager Chris helped me out when I was in there today fixing a minor issue. Great experience overall! 
3493 4 As a pizza lover and self proclaimed pizza critic. Hands down best pizza and service I've ever had period! 5 stars all the way. You won't be disappointed 
3494 4 really good food love the concept of the menu. you get can tell they put a lot of focus and effort on the items that they sell. really good service, too. just be sure to not come too late, because they might sell out on certain items. 
3495 4 I had another one at Summermoon the other day. I just wish he had a store with various schmears for my bagels... Here's a link to ordering information: http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=463138746&blogId=479794847 
3496 4 Finally had a chance to try their food and it was absolutely delicious! The sauces is what makes the whole meal complete! It was my first time coming here and the gentlemen who was working at the counter was a very helpful. Definitely coming back here for more! 
3497 3 Tiffany's Nails has always had good service and short wait times when looking for manicures, pedicures and waxing. It's fun to see that they have recently remodeled with new chairs and other interior accents! 
3498 0 If i could give a negative star i would. Server was nice but absent, steak came out raw, and the manager was extremely aggresive and rude. Will never be going there again! 
3499 4 Food is amazing, but very pricey. The price would be my only complaint. I tried the restaurant in Guatemala and the one in Chelsea is just as good, minus the fact that they don't have the same full menu like Guatemala. 
3500 4 I've eaten here more than a dozen times. The food is delicious and the service is great. I love the Lava Noodles and the Pad Thai. 
3501 1 There was too much sauce on the pad thai. There may be other items that they do better. 
3502 2 Great chicken club! Nothing fancy, just plain delicious! It's in a great location and the locals recommend it! Go here for a beer! 
3503 4 Amazing first experience at Dutch Bros. Jasper took cared of us from the beginning to the end. He was very patient when he went over the menu with us. We will be back and tell our friends in Seattle about Dutch Bros! 
3504 4 One word...YUM! Fresh and delicious. Small menu so they can concentrate on doing everything well. New menu items...ceviche and spring salad with brussels 
3505 4 This crew was on it. They came in and immediately got to work. My apartment was spotless. The price was pretty amazing for a make-ready. I will definitely use them again. 
3506 3 Some of the best sushi I have had and it's only a mile from home. Price matches the quality and decor. I will be back. 
3507 4 This place is simply amazing and the food can't be beat! Try the Guacamole! You won't regret it! 
3508 4 This place is the best sushi restaurant in town. Fresh fish, staff who care, and perfectly reasonable price. I love the size of the sashimi cuts and the detail on the plate. Highly recommend. 
3509 4 Excellent food and atmosphere at Amrheins. Warm and inviting decor and delicious cuisine. Perfect spot for date night, sunday sports viewing or weeknight with friends. Favorites include the pasta bolognese, calamari, clam chowder, and parmesan crusted cod. 
3510 4 5 stars just because of the service at the printing department. Iv been here a couple of times to print my school projects, Mea the department manager is amazingly patient and helpful!! 
3511 4 Great delivery guy. Great food. Always consistent. Vermachellie bowls are great. 
3512 4 Food was amazing, came out amazingly quick and so close to the resort we stayed at. No reason to pay crazy resort prices for average food when you can get an ice cold Tecate and street tacos for the low low. Highly recommend for anyone coming from the park! 
3513 4 Tasty burgers. Gluten free buns are worth the extra price 
3514 4 What a nice surprise. Best Chinese food I've had in YEARS. And my husband, who's super picky, even said his was spiced just right. Score! 
3515 4 This place is GOOD to eat, but its not cheap. Also, the atmosphere is great it feels just like HOME....hahaha. 
3516 3 finally found a decent place for thai food without having to drive all the way to portland! 
3517 4 Excellent food and service. Small place but exceptional food. The only thing that was average were the desserts. 
3518 4 They have a best bruschetta! I've been many different Italian restaurants but this is the one! gotta try bruschetta with your pasta! bon apetit 
3519 2 while we do love the $6 deals, the prime rib sandwich was terrible, cooked like bacon, not great. The shrimp cocktail was great!!!! The drink selection is limited and when the bill came it was priced wrong. The cheeseburger was also very good..... 
3520 4 Delicious and gorgeous small plates of food in a venue with great ambience. Loved their medjool dates!! 
3521 4 Great 
3522 3 Amazing! Green tea base and non-dairy. Pretty unique blend. Tons of options; if you don't know what to get, feel free to ask the super friendly staff! I would hang here if I lived here. 
3523 0 Ordered eggs benny with bacon for takeout and food was cold as soon as it was picked up. Not a great way to serve bacon. Ended up with food poisoning. Will never go back. Avoid takeout, 
3524 4 I've been going to Eve Chiropractic since April and Dr. Leila is the best, she's so professional and makes me at home like a friend not just a patient! Not to mention the staff are also friendly and welcoming, I will be coming here for many years to come. 
3525 4 Best Mexican food so far!!! The quesadilla and fresh lemonade are a must, to add on Great customer service! very recommended! 
3526 4 Hands down-best happy hour in Boulder! Fabulous selection of happy hour cheeses, mussels, sliders and drinks. Just be sure to make your reservations or you maybe disappointed. I also highly recommend there brunch on weekends! 
3527 4 One of the nicest and sweetest business owners I've met in a very long time. Honest and up front about pricing, options and time it takes him to finish the job. I will definitely be back and recommend him to others. Wish Boston still had more small businesses like this 
3528 4 Beach-fresh seafood without having to go to the beach and without the tourist-gouging prices. The owner is in the kitchen busting her butt every time I'm here, and the hard work shows in the delicious food. Both greasy fried plates and healthier options are available. Don't underestimate this understated-looking place. 
3529 4 Went with a group of 11 on a Thursday for a birthday dinner. Great food, fun atmosphere, great staff. Everyone enjoyed their food & talked about going back. Also great having a bar. Street parking only. Awesome place! 
3530 4 When I was in college, this was one of my weekly breakfast locals. There are many excellent items on their menu, but my favorites to this day are every poached egg dish, the french toast, and beignets. This is an eclectic little place worth a stroll off the beaten path. 
3531 4 Very, very, very good food! Fresh, gluten free, bright, colorful, tasty Mexican cuisine. We had guacamole for an appetizer & I ordered the verde bowl with beans, rice & a fried egg for my lunch entree. To drink I ordered a mojito. Everything was terrific! 
3532 3 Authentic Chinese food. They have roast duck in the display case out front and you can custom order whole pig. This place rocks! We like to get take out because the restaurant space is on the small side but it's really good food. 
3533 3 Excellent cafe place to have some good times with friends. Great environment and very quite. So far i have been several times over there. They have one of the best fruit and bubble tea. I would recommend everyone to have try their pastry and house blend coffee.. 
3534 1 I know this sounds silly, but I got the taco salad. Yes, at a burger joint. I'm not surprised it was pretty basic. I picked steak as my protein and that was pretty good. Young lady cooking and taking orders was nice. 
3535 4 Primetime burger is the best burger I've ever had. I also got the cherry-limeade cocktail. I could have had 4, but that would've been dumb. Get there early, because there is always a line. 
3536 0 Food was good, order was wrong, trying to get credit, the desert was frozen solid. do not know it I will order again. maybe if I get my credit,,, called Rice Bowl, they said they do not do that.... have to call someone else ??? 
3537 4 Came here a second time and everything was perfect! We got the ol' Blueberry Bourbon Basil doughnut along with the PB&J (marionberry compote with peanut butter powder). These doughnuts were so good that I am lying in bed at 11:49 PM in California thinking about them. Yup. 
3538 4 Great burger! Great atmosphere! There is always a line but it is worth the wait. I also love that they use all natural/organic ingredients. 
3539 3 Clean rooms. Good lounge bar on the first floor. The Hyatt lives up to its Rep. 
3540 4 Sea World is cool! I wish PITA would die in a ship wreck and wild Orcas would scavenge their bodies... I am sick of tree huggers ruining this world. I loved the coasters and the shows which are still open. 
3541 3 Decided on sushi after visiting UCF. For a take out place the food tasted better than I expected. I would definitely return if I'm ever on the east side of Orlando again. I would recommend for first time sushi eaters 
3542 4 This place has awesome grilled pita wraps. I recommend the pita with a side veggie skewer. 
3543 2 A mediumly classy place but it can be very hit or miss and is a bit too pricey for what it is. Not the best bread either. 
3544 4 Air Werks has provided me with excellent service on multiple occasions! A careful diagnosis of the issue and then an efficient and quick fix for the problem is my experience. I highly recommend this business. 
3545 0 Overrated. Weak in taste. High on price. Go to the Thai Noodle place on Guadalupe instead. 
3546 2 Don't go for the service but for the cheap, tasty pho. Never had my order taken while the server was on the phone before. That was a first. Surprisingly clean considering the old, outdated decor and building. 
3547 3 Went in for a quick lunch after receiving a number of recommendations. I though the food, setting and service were great, and the value was excellent. Sadly we had to go back to work and couldn't enjoy what seemed to be a pretty expansive wine list. There's always next time. 
3548 4 Earthly Services are amazing! They have wonderful customer service and follow through with their promise. They gave me a free quote and when I signed up for the regular service they showed up like clockwork. And their payment options are very convenient! I would recommend them to anyone. 
3549 0 This place is as far from a burger joint as one can be. Over priced, greasy, and about as much flavor as a truck tire. Go elsewhere? 
3550 3 Had the burger and Nutella milkshake. The burger was excellent and the shake good. I wish I lived near Atlanta would love to go again. 
3551 3 These folks have laid their claim as the best Mexican restaurant in the city. 2nd visit. Changed it up and the 9 of us sampled enchiladas, fajitas and fish tacos. All ample and more than generous. The guacamole could use a kick. The salsas are fiery. Recommend!!! 
3552 4 Me and my boyfriend checked in last night for a nights stay and were immediately pleased with the customer service of this hotel, Marissa at the front desk was awesome and the stay was amazing. We will definitely book at this hotel again. 
3553 4 Charly over at carters was amazing to work with!! The staff is super friendly and they were able to find the exact piece of jewelry I was looking for!! Definitely will come back for my anniversary pieces! Thanks charly for your help!!! 
3554 3 This very nice Resturant near Rocky Point park with the view of ocean. I went there couple of time for lunch and dinner. I found the was very good and yummy to 4 star level. I would return again with fronds for sure. 
3555 4 Such a great gelato place! Met up with one of my girlfriends here for the first time and we both loved it! The gelato was soooo good. I had the cinnamon and chocolate gelato's and they were so rich and creamy! Fun place to hang out or bring your kids! 
3556 0 Did not enjoy this place at all. The Milky Sake wasn't good. The broth for the beef udon was very bland and the Miso soup was cold. The Japanese fried chicken was flavorful but that's about it. 
3557 3 The 30-minute wait is justified by boozy coffee, dense & chewy waffles and Euro-inspired breakfast deliciousness. I'm full, buzzed and optimistic. 
3558 3 Food --- amazing! Try the Chicken/Lamb La Zeez. You won't regret it. Portions are more than generous. The owner is very friendly and the servers are attentive. What more can you ask for? 
3559 4 Been once. That Cubano was so different it was uniquely amazing. They also had a Great selection of sodas. 
3560 2 Not a big fan of listening to gossiping, how much money in tips they made and other shift issues. Little more professionalism would be appreciated and put your phone away when you working. 
3561 3 Really liked the bao. The pickled onions and sriracha mayo with potato bao is very, very tasty. 
3562 4 After working with Kelly we would highly recommend him for your home buying/selling. We found Kelly to be very customer service oriented. He would listen to our needs and concerns with great detail. 
3563 4 Always come here for my curry fix. Today had something different and as usual aswdome 
3564 4 I love Uchiko. Brussels sprouts, anything with yellowtail, hot rock, fried milk. Do not miss the fried milk for dessert. Those pockets of toasted milk are little pieces of heaven. 
3565 0 Worst Dominos. Over a two an a half hour wait no pizza and all they did was laugh about the order while on hold. 
3566 4 Best cornbread I have ever had, fried chicken is extremely flavorful as well. Peach pie for dessert is a must I highly recommend this place. Great family atmosphere. 
3567 4 Haiku review: I'm a giant child So much stuff to see and learn Ooooooh a PINK star fish!!!!!!! Addendum: pink is mah favvvvvvourite colour. And yes, DO come into the Aquarium with a child's curiosity and you're guaranteed good times. 
3568 4 Great authentic food and great staff !! I've been eating here since the last location 
3569 4 Best Mexican I've had in a while. Their Chimichanga was awesome. I tried it filled with veggies instead of meat (or cheese and beans). 
3570 0 Cafe D'Antonio just refused to seat us because our entire party wasn't there yet. My kids were starving and we weren't even offered something to drink. In 11 years we've lived in Celebration this was the worst restaurant experience here to date... Not cool. 
3571 4 Super friendly, knowledgeable staff, great fast service, well stocked (had something I had been looking for that was very hard to find) and better prices than the larger (Kappy's in Sudbury) store. Can't beat it! 
3572 4 Stumbled upon this place a few years ago and I've been hooked ever since. Best bubble tea around. I hit them up several times a week and they're never a disappointment. Service is great and place is always clean. 
3573 4 AMAZING salon! I've been coming here since I moved to Orlando. My person, who shall not be named, because I don't want to share is the absolute best! Everyone is great though. Wonderful owners who understand client loyalty is the key to success. 
3574 0 Very disappointed in the veggie wrap...99.99% lettuce..for $8.59 I expected better... 
3575 4 I saw James Phillips for herbal treatment of IBS at Turtle Dragon and it changed my life. The service was wonderful and very personalized and the treatment made a huge difference in my daily life. 
3576 3 Food is decent, if there is ever a line it moves quickly. I'm not a fan of seeing the cooks drinking out of cans and keeping the can on a prep table. If anything runs out it is replaced in minutes. 
3577 1 What a dump, I went in a couple of times. Will not go back, for all the beer in Portland. You walk in and it gives off a bad vibe 
3578 3 Stopped here for lunch! It was FAST, the cashier was friendly, and I loved the taste of the food. Very yummy! I heard the delivery service is poor, but I ordered and picked up and was quite pleased. I would go again. 
3579 4 I've been about five times now and I have to kick this place up to five stars. Everything is amazing. The food, beer and service are top notch. On top of that Wolf's Ridge is a locally owned family business. One of my new favorites in Columbus! 
3580 2 I just recall having burger sliders and a rye with ginger. The atmosphere was good and the service was not bad. Convenient street parking is always good! It's a-ok!! 
3581 3 We had brunch here yesterday. I loved the atmosphere and the spinach and lobster crepes were so good that I'm still dreaming about them. Coffee and mimosas were very good. 
3582 0 Just got my food delivered to me 45 minutes ago and it sucked. The shrimp rolls were burnt to a crisp, the "fried rice" was basically steamed brown rice and the egg roll was cold on the ends. 
3583 4 Love Cafe 26! Been here a handful of times and the food is always delicious and the staff is very friendly. One of my favorite cafes in Boston. 
3584 4 I found this pizza place via yelp and love it. I'm visiting from New Jersey and this place beats out any pizza shops I've been to (sorry Jersey). I had the pesto sauce cheese and the white. Delicious! 
3585 3 Been here a few times for various events: City Wide Garage Sale, Food Fests, Classic Game Fests, etc. Parking and entry is easy for the most part (depending on the event) and the events seems to always go off without issue. 
3586 4 Fave brunch place in all of Vancouver. Long waits make it a pain to get in, but it's always worth it. 
3587 3 Insanely busy, always- don't expect it to be a quick stop! Great prices, good cuts and good no BS service. Not the best meat I've ever had, but it get's the job done for a great price and consistent quality. 
3588 4 Great place. Always, friendly. They may not always have my favorite flavors but what can I say. I love that they have Movie people come by and give away free tickets, posters and t-shirts too. They also always give my dog a special treat. 
3589 4 Best Hummus EVER! Really, so amazing. I ordered the slow roasted chicken, I think its called chicken shawarma. Definitely going back! Also, get the garlic sauce! Everything on the menu is so healthy and their food looks so fresh, can`t wait to try other dishes. 
3590 4 The food was delicious and the guacamole was fantastic. The prices were very affordable. Food is authentic Mexican with great taste. 
3591 4 This place is pretty groovy. Great atmosphere, great music, and food is all organic and delicious. I really enjoyed coming to the soft opening. Great food. 
3592 4 Always very nice, very accomodating. Quality is definitely there otherwise I would not be coming back year after year, even after moving away from the area. English speaking staff is a plus! Definitely wiuld recommend the place to anyone 
3593 4 Fantastic food and service. Beautiful playing. Worth the price. Only wish I could afford to go there more!!! 
3594 2 Chicken Cooked perfectly...not dry and chicken was juicy! Mac & cheese was a bit disappointing (not baked) but friendly service and would definitely come back. 
3595 2 I love the location and atmosphere, but the food was rather disappointing. I received the wrong meal. The chicken was dry. I will go back for another meal to see if this time was just a fluke. 
3596 4 The Thai food here is so good! The waitresses are so nice!! I love the Rama. My husband loves the pad Thai and they have the best steamed potstickers! 
3597 4 Love everything here!! Always fresh Fast and delicious! Highly recommend the Italian and roast beef subs! 
3598 3 My wife and I came here for dinner, and we had a very good experience. My wife loved the Arnold Palmer Moonshine drink-it was sweet, strong, and delicious. We also really liked our entrees. I especially recommend the Crispy Chicken Schnitzel. Check this place out! 
3599 4 Jason and Steve are great. They have always bent over backwards to get things done on time for our uniform business Their embroidery work is some of the best I've seen and they keep our customers happy. 
3600 3 Easily my favorite coffee shop in Boston. High quality. Highly recommend West Coast sandwich. 
3601 3 Good experience at Barista: nice ambiance, good service. However, the coffee was a bit underwhelming and in my opinion a bit overpriced for the quality. 
3602 3 Scorpian bowls, scorpian bowls, scorpian bowls. The reason this place exists is for the strong bowls that seem to erase all memories of, well, everything. This is a great starting off point, although they do have dancing up stairs if you decide to stay for the long haul. 
3603 4 First time here and wow!!! This place is amazing!!! I ordered the tuscan steak 28 oz and 16 in long bone!! Holy crap!!! Our server was awesome and atomsphere is perfect, def. Will be returning 
3604 3 Lots of grass to throw around the ball with your dog! Wish there was more dogs and fewer homeless people but otherwise a fantastic neighborhood park! 
3605 3 Nice people at this very busy location - I get my propane tanks filled here so periodic visits throughout the year. Avoid on weekends or towards the end of the month as it'll take a long time to be served. 
3606 4 Great Greek dinner. A little pricey but we stuffed ourselves. Leg of lamb was served off the bone and practically fell apart in our mouths. Chocolate baklava cheesecake rocked. 
3607 4 Excellent service and foods! Two thumbs up! Great server made our evening even better. We were brought right in upon arriving. Made a reservation in a busy Saturday evening, it was packed with people in dining and waiting area. 5 star service and foods! 
3608 4 The steak tips are amazing, and the atmosphere is quaint and traditional. Definitely check it out! 
3609 1 I've been here a couple times, but I still haven't been impressed. Fries were soggy, chicken was too dry, and the tables were sticky and a bit dirty. Everything seems to be covered in grease. 
3610 4 This is literally the best restaurant that I have been to in Atlanta! The food was absolutely amazing! They served great portions that were filling. The meat was not cheap and the meal was very appetizing. Our waiter had great customer service. 
3611 4 Freakys is just awesome. Went in looking for a dab setup and was blown away by the prices, also the staff was really helpful and helped me pick out the most badass piece I could get. Hands down a great experience. Will definitely be coming back. 
3612 3 Lovely atmosphere. Service was average. I do not eat seafood but took my mother and the look in her face was priceless. She loves seafood and according to her this was very fresh. Great non seafood items. Wife loved the steak tips. The American burger was cooked to perfection. 
3613 4 Best prices & best selection in town. Loved being in there, super friendly staff. This is my "go to" liquor store now. 
3614 4 great smoothies and açai bowls!! i ordered and after it was made realised i forgot to ask for vegan protein instead of whey and they happily re made it for me. would definitely recommend to anyone looking for healthy smoothies and snacks! 
3615 4 I am so glad Austin finally has an 85°C Bakery Cafe! Can't go wrong with a milk tea and a matcha bun. 
3616 3 Great happy hour! Wish they had more food selection than Mikey's even though Mikey's is definitely not bad! 
3617 1 Other than the bagels. Not so much. Feel ripped off $9 for tiny sandwich and small soup. $2 for tiny apple juice. Quality so so. Bagel and cream cheese is nice but they should really consider more appropriate pricing or portion. 
3618 4 Love this Car Wash! I wish We had a Car Wash Like this in south florida. A young crew full of energy and nice lounge to sit while you wait. 
3619 0 Went into this place expecting someone to tickle my fancy - NOT happening! All sorts of paraphernalia hanging on the walls and in cabinets and such - but owner says no way was I getting my fancy tickled with or without paraphernalia... neva going back again! 
3620 4 Phenomenal food, service, and atmosphere. The food is superb; very few restaurants in Portland can do better and the tapas / small plate menu allows you to pick and choose to fit your hunger and wallet. The only thing wanting really is a menu of whisky or digestifs. 
3621 3 The ambiance is kinda divey, or maybe it's just plain. The food however is absolutely delicious. 
3622 2 Enjoyed the Snow Crab and Chowder, didn't care for the steamers. We were reminded of a few spots in Key West of this place. Probably a lot of fun when it's warm 
3623 4 The eye dr. Dr Yuen is great. She is very detail oriented. She takes her time to listen to your concerens and answer all of your questions. İ had the best eye exam of my life. The other stuff is very helpful and friendly. 
3624 4 On foodie vacation from NYC. Had fantastic lunch Omakase for 5 people. Great atmosphere, service, and sushi sashimi and udon. Highly recommended. Rival top places I go in nyc. 
3625 1 Unfortunately this was an overpriced breakfast for pretty terrible food. The hollandaise sauce sat on the top of my eggs like pudding and the hash brown was loaded with undercooked onions. The coffee was the highlight. 
3626 0 Unitus "approved" me for a loan, then took a week of wasting my time before reneging on said loan. Worst experience I've had with a financial institution anywhere. 
3627 3 Great adorable little place. I had the chocolate chip pancakes and they were amazing. My boyfriend really loves his food too. Took a little too long for the food to come out but they kept the coffee coming. 
3628 0 Flyer and website don't mention that tours are only offered on the hour. I had to wait 50+ minutes for the next tour since I arrived right after the full hour. 
3629 0 It's been 1 hour and a taxi has not even been dispatched to my location yet... When I called for an update the lady just said "I'll keep working on it" no apology no sympathy... I'm going to be so late for work... This is unreal. 
3630 4 Authentic mexican food.. Tasty, clean, great service, reasonable price. We had chicken taco, burrito and chimichanga - all of them are equally good. Very satisfying dining experience! 
3631 4 Mary DeMarco (512) 839-4781) is incredibly personable and will make sure that every attention to detail is given to all your window treatment needs. Customer satisfaction is what she strives for with every account. We have always been extremely happy with Mary and the products to make our home beautiful! 
3632 4 this wonderful company did same day moving with very short notice. super nice phone contact and movers assigned to my job. quick. efficient. very affordable. highly recommended. 
3633 2 It is just like the Fanueil Hall version. Not great food, but right next to your gate!! Certainly better than airplane food, so don't go away hungry' 
3634 4 I've always been nervous to go to the Dentist, let alone get cavities filled. The staff is wonderful and very kind. They've made feel comfortable on every level. Thank you! 
3635 4 This shop is always reliable and they don't overcharge. A majority of the staff is very knowledgeable, they are always so nice and helpful. Good place to go if you don't know anything, they are never uptight. 
3636 4 I love this place. It is a great dessert spot. It was extremely crowded, as it always is but we got in and out very quickly. I highly recommend the chocolate ice cream waffle cone. 
3637 4 Awesome atmosphere and every course was delicious. Don't miss the arancini or the ribeye, but you can't go wrong with anything in the menu. Definitely will be back again. 
3638 3 All must check this out!! So unique....looking forward to going back 
3639 4 We love Me-N-Ed's pizza. We would eat it every night if we could. Sometimes we get on a kick and eat it 3 times a week. Whether you eat at the restaurant or have it delivered, I highly recommend Me-N-Ed's in Burnaby. 
3640 3 Small mom and pop instrument shop that has a decent selection of items for the size. I come here just for pics and strings. Decent price and customer service is okay. 
3641 4 This place is one of my favorites! great food and fair prices. Service is excellent despite the well deserved crowds 
3642 4 Bacon egg and cheese on an English is my weekend cure. Best one I've ever had. I didn't know iced coffee could be better than other iced coffee, but there's is the best as well. Great lively atmosphere. 
3643 4 They always have delicious donuts. Got the bacon maple syrup for my husband. It's his absolute favorite. We got my mom addicted to this place as well. None of the flavors will ever disappoint. 
3644 4 great restaurant! we ordered the whole menu and loved everything. reminded me of the French Laundry. 
3645 4 The pickled dog was delish! This is always my go to place for bubble tea when I'm craving it. 
3646 4 Excellent Italian food. I had spaghetti and meatballs and sauce was the best I have ever had. Excellent taste. Meatballs very good as well. My husband had spaghetti and sausage. Sausage was very good. Generous portions at a good price. Will definately come back if I am in the area 
3647 0 This place is wack! Sucks cause bdubs has dope wings! But this location gives bdubs a bad name. Vibe sucks... staff sucks.. and customer service sucks. Boo 
3648 3 I think they're doing some interesting stuff with their beer. Atmosphere is unique, food is good. Pro-tip: $3 imperial pints on Wednesdays. 
3649 4 Had a great experience with this company today. My fiance and I had a small, local move to contend with, and they made it all painless, sending exactly what we needed: a guy and a truck. Cheerful, timely, professional, and so reasonable. Will definitely use again. 
3650 0 Just got the worst $10 sandwich ever. It's like a burnt crouton. UPDATE: I was so dissatisfied that I called the shop. Spoke to the owner, who was genuinely apologetic and quickly sent me a refund+. I'll give it another chance. 
3651 4 In town for training. Had lunch here today and will be frequenting the place regularly. 
3652 4 Love Olivios!! Best Italian food around! ! Angelo is a great guy and hard worker. The service is always good. Decorative beautiful bar. Chicken Boca is awesome! !! 
3653 4 Having recently moved in to AMLI South Shore, I've needed to submit a couple of service requests. In each case the problem was handled promptly and professionally. It seems they walk the talk here. Great job AMLI South Shore. 
3654 4 Their steak-bomb sub reminds me of a really good Philly cheesesteak. I have loved everything I ate there, and prices are fairly reasonable on a student budget. I go there far more than I really should, as it's not the healthiest option around. Very friendly staff! 
3655 4 Outstanding service with the some of the best tapas I've ever had. They brought out a complimentary dish at the end just because they thought we would like it based on what we ordered. I highly recommend this delicious and friendly restaurant!! Our server Elena J was the best! Thanks 
3656 4 Great lunch spot with outdoor seating. Highly recommend the Mexican meatball sub and hot n cold chicken salad. 
3657 0 I come to here with my friends once a while and most of us are fan of the vermicelli dishes. However, yesterday we had a lunch there and noticed the portion served had significantly shrunk! 
3658 1 Food is great on and off but had a bad experience with the staff many times. I like the chicken biryani in this place but decided to switch to a diff restaurant. 
3659 3 All natural and organic, so don't expect a huge portion, but what you get is tasty and good for your body. I took their suggestions and was rewarded. (Have them use the panini press) (Ask for a sample of their organic soda) 
3660 4 One of the best for Mexican. Great staff, great proprietor -- Marlene! Good selection of premium, sipping tequilas. Gotta get the guacamole! 
3661 3 Had the red curry this time as well as pad Thai. The red curry was amazing but wasn't impressed with the pad Thai. Very dark looking and didn't taste very good. 
3662 4 It's been to long coming back here,totally awesome. Met friends for lunch Ozzy our waiter was great. Thank you Ozzy. Will come back sooner than later. 
3663 0 Don't ever do business with State Farm! Horrible service! They will do everything in their power to screw you and not pay your claim. Don't ever do business with McCollum auto body either. This is a state farm preferred body shop and they do horrible work. Very unprofessional. 
3664 4 Red Robin is the best. They are accommodating to vegetarians with their boca burgers, the burgers are delicious, the fries are great, and the dipping sauces are sublime. I really can't think of a single negative thing to say. 
3665 3 Bombay Bistro has become one of those "treat ourselves" places. The food is good, the service is friendly and you forget you're actually sitting in a strip center. It's not the most authentic Indian food you'll ever have but it's an enjoyable experience. 
3666 4 This time I got to sample the top 4 specialty burritos and they were all spectacular as were the sauces! You should go...now....those vegan tacos are tremendous! 
3667 3 Their pizza is good, but not the best in German Village. The service was quick and we picked our food up in less than ten minutes. 
3668 4 Wonderful homemade taste!! A great selection, and deserving of the many baking awards displayed in the shop. The German Chocolate cupcake was moist, fresh and heavenly I will be back!! 
3669 3 I use them for most of my care and am satisfied with the doctors and the medical center. 
3670 4 Yes! Finally good Italian food when we come to Disney. No more chains. Service was great, but we were the only 9 people in the restaurant. He calzone special rocked. 
3671 4 We love Amplify. Looooove Amplify. Personalized service from real human beings. We implore all of our friends who are with big monster mega banks to leave those banks immediately and come over to Amplify instead. 
3672 3 Their annual Chinese New Year celebration was good. Lots of food, lion dance and other performing arts, etc. Parking was extremely difficult. Probably one has to park in the Marta parking lot which is about 2-3 minutes walking distance. 
3673 4 Jason and Sarah are bartenders who really are amazing. We were there last weekend and had the most exceptional meal. Ravioli and mushroom pizza. Along with a superior Italian wine Vajra Nebbiolo Langhe. Mouthwatering describes all of the above. Its a must and sit at the bar its great. 
3674 4 Went for lunch today with my brother.We were greeted as soon as we entered.The waiter was very professional and friendly also efficient.Our choice was the Ribeye with baked potato and Caesar salad. I think it was the best steak ever ,cooked just as ordered .Will be back soon 
3675 0 Wouldn't give them one if it weren't required. Food is l o u s y. Im so disgusted I dont even want to write the review but, it is so so necessary. 
3676 4 LOVE THIS PLACE! Amanda is awesome! Had Mani/Pedi, french mani came out very good and the pedi included a hot stone massage which i LOVED! I will definitely be going here again! Oh, and to top it off they had the new seasonal OPI colors! 
3677 3 Very good. Nice atmosphere. Taste good and pretty healthy. 
3678 4 Great food! Quiet for lunch on a Monday. Excellent hummus made table-side! Moussaka was filling, good gyro w/ great fries, yummy doulmades! Yum, we'll be back!! 
3679 4 This is one of our go to local Italian restaurants. While the menu isn't extensive, there is enough diversity to cover every palate. Ore pizza is my favorite!! Husband is an Italian foodie, so if he's ok with it.... most everyone else should be. 
3680 0 2.5 hours for an oil change. Yep. Thats right. 
3681 3 Amazing friendly, good for groups or just hanging out with a friend. The food is fresh just like being at home in moms kitchen. 
3682 4 Amazing service and the food was outstanding! The presentation was beautiful. You could tell they take pride in the food they are serving. It was great to be able to watch our breakfast being made. We will definitely be back! 
3683 4 I'm impressed with my visit here. The office is professional and helpful with explaining my treatment. I'll go back to them again. 
3684 3 I had an absolutely delicious breakfast here. The mushrooms were very tasty. The waitress was very professional. I beat the wait by eating at the counter. 
3685 3 Great food and atmosphere. Service usually on the slower side. You think they would pick up the pace since you are at the airport and may have a flight to catch. Last visit it took right around 25 minutes after finishing our meals to pay and get going. 
3686 4 Best Thai in Austin, and I'm so glad it's back. I haven't had anything here that's fallen flat. 
3687 0 Business refuses to offer nationally-advertised deals. Lame. Avoid. 
3688 0 Don't buy the groupon because you will not be able to use it and Groupon will give you too much trouble when you ask for a refund. 
3689 4 You know what you are getting when you got to Black Bear. You will get a ton of diner food for a reasonable price. I have never been able to eat everything! Service is also quite nice. Will definitely go back. 
3690 4 I love going to this coffeehouse!!!! Inside or outside, service is fine and food is really good!!! I have no complaints! Hamburgers and fries are really great!! My partner usually loves their specials!!! 
3691 0 I ate here on Tuesday evening. Service was not good. Lines were long. I got blue cheese on my burger and it had been slapped on the burger and was not melted in the least. The fries were the only saving grace. 
3692 4 We stumbled upon this place while looking for something to eat. It was a popular place and now I know why. Best Greek food I've had. I'm still dreaming of it. The lamb platter was enough to share. 
3693 2 Great deal for oil changes.....be weary of their add-on sales. 
3694 1 Had a chicken sandwich with fries it wasn't that good. Had 2 drinks paid 40.00 dollars. 
3695 4 I am admittedly old fashioned, and I love this place. Food is awesome, service is beyond perfect (thanks, John!). It's a joy. I highly recommend it. 
3696 3 Fantastic brisket. Taste is delicious, but value could be better. Long lines and no waiter service deducts a star from this otherwise fine establishment. Would definitely eat here again. 
3697 4 Love love love! The sides could be hotter, that's my only complaint. I still love this place. We come here every time we visit Atlanta. Definitely get the salmon tibs. Yum! 
3698 3 Solid choice for Korean food in JP. Yummy bibimbop served in the hot clay pot. Service has been kind each time we've been. 
3699 4 5 stars as usual. I will always pick BAR TACO. I need those fried oysters back.... PLEASE..... valet parking and outdoor seating. 
3700 0 So... incredibly... BLAND. Order the cubano sandwich or go somewhere else, because every other dish here sucks. Out of 8 meals I've ordered, just about everything was disappointing. 
3701 4 Great little place! My caramel macchiato was delicious, and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his croissant! Cute pink lids on the to-go cups too! 
3702 4 Eat in or take out. Very small,so I always do takeout, Best Thai on South Shore.Chicken and shrimp pad thai,shumai,tempura,yellow curry,crispy chicken basil, All Good Best is make your own choices,you can't go wrong 
3703 1 The place was really loud for a dim lit, lounge-type place to eat. 
3704 1 Made an appointment for 10am, for an alignment. It's now 11am, and my car just went into the dock. Don't expect timely service here, especially if they already have your money. 
3705 3 Good pizza and a great staff. Just down from NH for the winter and grabbed a pizza after the long drive. Hit the spot. Has become our weekly local spot for a quick bite to eat. 
3706 4 Friendly, knowledgeable service with a large selection of new and used firearms. I'll be back for more! 
3707 2 Cafe Aion is primarily tapas. Food wad pretty good. Wait staff did not suggest ideas off the extensive tapas list but we picked some interesting dishes. Cost: 4 small tapas plates and a couple of cocktails the bill + tip ran $100. 
3708 1 Boulder location. Tasty option in the fast-food category. But I wish they would play quieter music. The hard surfaces and loud music leave me a headache. If 5onBlack is supposed to be Brazillian, how about playing some pleasant Brazillian Jazz? 
3709 2 As of 12/23/2012 they are closed for renovations. The large sign out front says they'll be open for business 'in a few months.' 
3710 4 Absolutely my new favorite restaurant in Portland considering I live 2 blocks away but the food is great. I recommend the BBQ chicken and catfish. Bartenders are very knowledgable and nice. I frequent this place at least once a week. Good ambiance as well. 
3711 4 "I brought my car in for a damaged door, and was delighted with the service I received. They were able to find a matching door that saved me the cost of reprinting. Definitely they went beyond the call of duty! I highly recommend ABC." 
3712 3 Get a sloppy joe or the Rachel- hot pastrami, cole slaw, cheese, hot-pressed rye bread. Wow. 
3713 4 This place is always constant. I always order the fettuccine Alfredo. I get it at other Italian restaurants and it is never the same as OG. Sandy did an excellent job as our server. She was very nice and provided excellent recommendations. 
3714 2 Our experience was ok. The sauces on the special rolls were too sweet. Decent atmosphere, esp for the burbs. 
3715 4 The crispy Brussel sprouts were out of this world!! The flavors and textures in this dish are a perfect marriage. Trust me, you'll wish you got 2 orders! 
3716 4 So far, these have been my favorite doughnuts in Portland. They are fresh and not too sweet. They are very good quality. 
3717 4 This tour was awesome! Definitely the beat activity on Boston Harbor- its fun and exciting and different from all other tours on the water. Great for all ages, kids and adults and the tour guides are very entertaining!! A must do activity for tourists and anyone in Boston! 
3718 4 Coolest coffee shop I've visited! I had the MaryMint Monroe and fall in love! Reading the other reviews, people don't seem as happy about the food, but I haven't tried anything on that menu yet. Entrance to the bathroom is like entering Narnia! Can't wait to go back! 
3719 4 The Q and the news. The rest I don't really hear much but I do like Ideas as well. The commercials? Nada. Zip. Zero. CBC radio has all meat and potatos without the salty gravy. The morning show gets me to work and the traffic reports get me home. 
3720 4 Great bar. Exceptional servers. Food was fast and fresh. Killing a Friday night before a flight in place full of really nice people made this stranger feel at home. 
3721 4 Very relax environment, the chicken was really good. The service was also great. The chicken had great flavor and spicy. 
3722 4 I had the best experience with these guys after another local towing service left me hanging at the last minute. Friendly, efficient, reasonably priced, and super accommodating. Highly recommend! 
3723 4 Great place very relaxing. very affordable sliding scale price. I go there about once a month. I use it as preventative alternative medicine healing. Call them and check them out. 
3724 4 Love everything about this place! Food, atmosphere and service. Empanadas and duck wings are my favorites. 
3725 2 We bought two of the halfsies. There was not even 1/3 ice cream, and the cookie dough alone is waaaaayyy too sweet. It would have been better had it been 1/3 cookie dough with more ice cream. The flavors were delicious though. 
3726 3 Love the leather recliners. Beer and wine are available in addition to normal movie food & beverages. 
3727 3 Great place to spend a summer afternoon! A little pricey, but nice atmosphere! 
3728 4 For one or two dollars, how can anyone complain about this awesome place to visit?Is it grand?No.Is it the Huntington Gardens in San Marino that charges $20 per person; NO.Is it pretty, shaded and interesting and pretty, YES.If you don't like this garden, the problem is not with the garden. 
3729 4 Out of the way location in Cambridge, but worth the trek. If not the best bread in Boston, certainly near the top. Particularly seek out the kamut bread, an ancient grain which is a precursor of wheat. Brioche, sourdough breads, cookies, sticky buns, croissants are also to die for! 
3730 4 Great selection of beer and wide variety of solid food. Staff is super friendly and attentive. 
3731 1 They only gave me two tiny pork buns that cost them like $1 to make and they charge $9 for it. Total rip off, avoid this place. 
3732 1 Buffet is less than impressive. In fact, their buffet food almost tastes like barf. Their non-buffet food is average. There is far better Indian food in Austin. 
3733 4 Delicioso café da manhã Ovos beneditinos deliciosos o melhor que já comi. Ambiente É simples MAS gostoso. Atendimento simpático 
3734 4 So delish! I had the Roasted Eggplant (my fave) and Hot Honey. My only complaint is that the pieces were too big for me to sneak one in the car on the way home. Thanks!! 
3735 3 It's a great place for dessert, though often very busy. I find you get a larger portion eating in than taking out by quite a large margin. If you're looking for tasty, fruity, drinks and desserts, you're golden here. Cash only. 
3736 1 The reason for my low reviews is simple "Quinoa Burgers". The price of my favorite Quinoa Burgers have just doubled in the past two months? Why such a steep hike? Management: Please bring the price of all good Quinoa Burgers down ( not those Soy ones). 
3737 0 Lousy attitude, coffee is so-so. Customers seem to be competing with each other to earn a spot in an Apple commercial. Avoid at all costs. 
3738 2 The was my third visit and I wonder if it was because it was Monday as the brioche were not as good as previously purchased here nor was the black sesame panna cotta which was not set properly and was more like a pudding. The sesame cookies were still delicious. 
3739 3 Restaurant is cute, has a back covered patio that has extra seating, and the entire time we were here, no one had to wait to be seated. Prices are very reasonable, and quite a bit of food in each crepe. Fruit was really fresh also. 
3740 3 One of nicest facilities around. Great location. Nice, new equipment. Bright lighting vs some that are dark, dank, musty. They have pretty much everything you want. 
3741 4 My family and I experienced phenomenal customer service at the Sheraton. A special shout out goes to the valet team for being prompt, kind and professional! The location is also perfect for walking to restaurants, shops and attractions. 
3742 4 I have been using Christine's now for nearly 4 years( as of November 2014.) I have never once been dissatisfied with their service, appt. availability , prices or attitudes! They listen, care and love animals. What else could you possibly want? Love this place! 
3743 4 Hands down one of the best meals I've had in Portland. The 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings was amazing. The staff were on their game. 
3744 0 Way too much sauce and the crust sucks and this is just another chain pizza place added to the west side wonderland of chain pizzas. Thank god bari pizza is not far from grove city or I would not eat pizza at all anymore. 
3745 3 Great store for unusual gifts and fun things for the home. Always a hit. 
3746 3 Pretty good! Food is fresh and tasty, service is good and friendly. Chips and salsa are delish, as is all the rest of the food I've had here. 
3747 4 Excellent job! Rubia and sunny did amazing waxing and eyebrow job. They are quick and accommodating. 
3748 4 This place is so good! Tapa style restaurant, so we ordered lots of small plates and shared it. Small little place, and the wait can be extremely long, but it's definitely worth the wait! The ramen is spot on with flavoring! And the skewers are so good. 
3749 4 One of the few shining, innovative restaurants in the city. Same level as L'Oca D'Oro and Launderette. Enjoy the Goat Barbacoa and a bottle of wine. 
3750 4 Classy place been comming here for years great staff good service convienent location. 
3751 3 Food is good and the selection Is large. The cleanliness of the resturant has gone down hill. 
3752 4 I'm very pleased with the product, service, and price. Paul was very friendly and professional, and the same goes for the installation crew. I couldn't be more happy with my beautiful new windows, and I'm sure they've enhanced the value of my property far beyond what I paid for them. 
3753 4 This place is killer! Satisfied every time I go. Food is always on point. Those truffle fries are dangerous just an FYI. And those sliders... mmmm I dream about them every night lol 
3754 3 Really great meat and 3 place. Tasty food. The beef tips and rice were super good. 
3755 4 Excellent! I went today with 5 other girls for a friend's birthday today. We were all six very pleased with our nails. I don't understand the negative reviews. 
3756 3 I love this place, The closest that I have gotten to REAL Asian food in Austin. Their spicy fried rice is literally heaven. It is very cheap, the staff is nice, and it is open until 2 am. Sounds pretty good to me. 
3757 0 Unfortunate. Slimy blobs of ground beef do not a good taco make. The absolute worst White People Tacos i've ever seen. And I grew up in East Texas. There are MUCH better $2 tacos in our fantastic city than this trash. Go (anywhere) else. 
3758 3 So yummy. Love going there for their roast beef sandwiches, or their french bread, or their chopped liver. So many great choices and consistently high quality. 
3759 4 Finally, an airport joint to get delicious fresh healthy vegan food! It's located on Concourse E which is easy to get to from any concourse on the train since you don't have to go through security. 
3760 3 two words: cheap beer. Eat and drink upstairs while watching the game..or just drink downstairs by the bar...gets crowded at night though... surprisingly when i went a couple of fridays ago. It's a bit cramped though.. 
3761 4 My favorite breakfast spot off the beaten path near Cambridge. Fresh squeezed orange juice, great omelettes and eggs Benedict and gluten free pancakes. Highly recommend 
3762 4 Omg! The food is amazing!!! The diablo is sooo good! I ordered 3 things on the menu just for myself because I couldn't decide..and all options were so good! :) 
3763 4 Shanita was great with us and helped us get the space we needed quickly .She was very thorough .Great experience!! 
3764 3 Really tasty chocolate chip cookie. Macarons are awesome and apple tart is good as well. Glad that I found them 
3765 3 We went for lunch. We had burgers and beer, and we were very pleased with the size of the portions and also the attentiveness of the staff. Our order was taken quickly, and our drinks never got empty. We will be back for sure. 
3766 3 Been back to Loops numerous times, they are always friendly and pretty quick, all items cooked to order. ALWAYS delivered HOT as it should be! They are not shy with the protein portions....have yet to try something that I did not enjoy..they are talking about a 2nd location.... 
3767 4 Sounds me of my favorite pizza in town. Super affordable, open late, by the slice or whole pie. I love the thin foldable slices and the topping, sauce, and cheese are on point. 
3768 0 Wow! Two thumbs down. I wasn't expecting a gourmet meal....just wanted a quick sandwich. I ordered the Club. What I got was a single slice of turkey, barely two slices of bacon, wilted lettuce and 1/2" slice of tomato on white hard bread. Never again, not even if it's free. 
3769 4 This was the place the be on Friday Night! If you're looking for the best French Onion Soup in Boulder, paired with the best craft beer selection on Pearl Street. Go. Go now! 
3770 4 Loved the tonkatsu ramen with rich broth. The pork buns are great too! 
3771 4 Okay so I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but I do admit that I love red robin. I love the banzai burger, their steak fries and their strawberry lemonade. 
3772 0 This place was awful. We waited for 45 minutes for a table then an hour an a half for food. Also when we asked for no onions that's exactly what they put all over the top of our salad. 
3773 4 Outstanding! Ordered dinner and drove home to eat it. Absolutely fantastic tasting, exotic blend of "just right" combinations, and that amazing feeling of being full but not too much. Love this place! 
3774 3 After a long week I decided having a foot massage would be best for uplifting my spirits. The last time I went was okay but I really miss Mickey. He was the best! 
3775 4 This new location at Brigham Circle is very nice, and actually has places to sit! Nice comfy leather chairs, along with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating makes this branch a great place to get ice cream. It's also relatively quiet, compared to the Newbury and Brookline location. 
3776 4 I've been going to Paul for years and would highly recommend his services. Originally got referred to Paul by a mechanic, haven't looked back since. Always reasonable pricing! Irish man in the back does alot of the car work. His work makes cars look brand new! 
3777 3 Chinese comfort food. Good enough to order home once in a while. They also indulge special requests (ex. extra curry sauce, etc.) Good portion sizes. Love the curry chicken! 
3778 2 Sanwiches are tasty, good coctails, a bit noisy. Good spot for lunch post-Newbury/Boylston/Pru shopping. 
3779 3 Just like your average Panera, but with friendly and helpful staff. I hang out here occasionally when I have breaks between business meetings. It is a nice place to get some emails done. 
3780 4 Great korean tacos and wines. Bianca was a doll and super helpful with recommendations. 
3781 4 Best tacos on the east side!! Easy to find, park, order and face f@*k some yumm. Wish they had margaritas to go with. 
3782 1 Do not recertify or refill aviator oxygen cylinders. Did not disclose this on phone, made an unnecessary trip. 
3783 1 Overpriced and nothing special about the meats. Wanted some good corn bread but theirs jalapeños in it. 
3784 0 I can easily taste MSG even though the waitress told me they don't use it. I doubt that they ever wash their vegetables since some leaves are still attached to each other. 
3785 3 Good Food, VERY fast delivery great for late night snack if you are staying in a hotel they deliver until 3 AM which is a awesome 
3786 4 Arguably the best brunch in town. Thanks Mike for your helpful service. This is my new spot! 
3787 4 This place is great - amazing selection. I was in an extremely irritable mood but Carlos went above and beyond to help me find what I was looking for -turned my whole night around!! 
3788 4 We came all the way from Long Beach, CA to the original location and it was so worth it! I had Paul's choice and it was the best burger ever! My husband loved the Mac and cheese. Our waiter Tyler was so friendly. Great experience! 
3789 3 Try the Greek lemon pasta. I didn't think I'd care for it, but it was delish. The lemon was not overpowering. The mushroom soup was to die for. Not salty or greasy. Dunk some sour dough bread and enjoy! 
3790 0 Contacted this company and arranged a time to meet for an estimate. I took a few hours off of work to meet with them and they never showed or called. 
3791 4 I actually enjoyed the food here! I got the 1lb shrimp with sweet potato Cajun fries, it was sooo good. The service was great too, definitely coming back! 
3792 1 generous portions. mediocre food. indifferent wait staff. decent machacado. tacos eggs were cold. ok margarita. salsa from a bottle. decent atmosphere. music on sundays at 11. 
3793 4 Stunning in every sense. The Latin Lovers roast is amazing and the orange caramel latte is the best thing I've ever had in my life! 
3794 4 Best taco truck on this side of town!!! Seriously pick anything and everything it's all delicious. If you would only trust one truck in Austin make it this one! Drunk, sober, high it's good for everything!! Omg I love them so much. El super taco por vida. 
3795 4 This is a nice little hidden gem here in Happy Valley. Such a delectable selection of sweets and savory items, and their sandwiches are delicious! Drop in and spend a few hours and calories - this place is worth it! 
3796 1 I work in Tech Square so I'm always looking for places nearby to grab lunch. Here's all I have to say about my first time at Señor Patron: Bland/mediocre Mexican food: check! Whatever. 
3797 4 I love TT's! My favorite place to see or play a show! Sure, its not huge, but its intimate. Plus, I love that you can escape the bad opening act by going to the pool tables or other side of the bar. Plus the bartenders are excellent! TT's is great! 
3798 4 Scott was our server. He said he would "drive the menu" so we could chat and enjoy our wine. He did a wonderful tasting. I feel like we got all the highlights on the menu. It's a cool atmosphere and was not too loud so we could have great conversation. 
3799 3 Great place! We were directed to Side Bar so we walked in there first. Immediately walked out. Stumbled upon this place and it's awesome! The set up is great and it's not loud to where you can't hear the person you're with. Excellent food. 
3800 4 Just one word: delicious! We've been there just a couple of times but everything we ordered was SOOO good. It has already become one of our favorite Asian restaurants in Austin. 
3801 4 Breakfast, music, board games, edgy environment. Probably not the most kid friendly (use your own judgement), but excellent story, food, staff & coffee. Not crowded yet because people are still discovering it. #cbuscoffee #coffeetrailstop5 
3802 1 Fun to look. LOTS to look at. But, checkout takes FOREVER! And the $14 of fudge I bought, the lady said would be perfect for 3 weeks unrefrigerated; it's been 4 days and are now little bricks. Little hard bricks of sadness. 
3803 4 Simply the best collection of eyewear around. You'll feel like you're friends with everyone there. 
3804 0 Yesterday I ordered a burrito bowl, super disappointed with the food, I ordered rice and i could literally count how many pieces of rice there were in my food, the chicken was hard and there was shredded cheese! I dont like shredded cheese at all! 
3805 4 Place is awesome. Sat next to the window watching people ho by. Perfect summer day. Lobster ravioli was incredible. Service was impeccable. Highly recommend. 
3806 1 I love their clothes but this location has the worst customer service, I have stood at the register trying to check out and return stuff and staff walk by ignoring me or they just stay in the back room leaving no one in the floor to help. 
3807 4 If you want something a little different from your run-of-the-mill donut, this is the place. Very different combinations and textures and they are really tasty. 
3808 4 Great burger. I get the goodnight as I love tillamook and jalapenos. mmmmm. 
3809 3 This is where we hangout along with my grandchildren Missy and Robert. Missy loves the pistachio while Robert loves chocolate and my favorite was cheesecake. There's a lot of toppings to chose from and most importantly they are also cheap than the other Yogurt houses. 
3810 3 I'm still loving this place for my meatless days. My fav so far is the one with potato in it. Delicious! 
3811 3 1A has great pizza, but it takes a while. Their subs are great too. Not much else to say about this: It's a regular Greek pizza shop. 
3812 4 Close your eyes, open the menu and point at something. That is what you should order. The menu is so extensive but everything is delicious! 
3813 0 The server making the pizza was extremely rude and really arrogant. She put barely any toppings and when we asked for more cheese was extremely rude and changed her tone. This is awful customer service and will not be returning to blaze again. 
3814 0 Did not like the service, checked twice for id, was not able to change the gratuity, did not accept the cake I baked for my friend's birthday, over priced and very small portions 
3815 4 Good food! Great service Fun atmosphere for all ages Delicious desserts and drinks The creme Brule is great and lots of machines. Just kidding lol 
3816 1 The sushi was okay, almost right below average. The waiter took for eveeeeeeer to take our order and to get our checks. We also got no fortune cookie!!! 
3817 4 First time here. Super nice waitress!!! She recommended the cheesesteak. A little too much cheese but it was really good! I would definitely come back. Best comfort food. 
3818 3 Lovely outdoor seating on the Willamette. Water bowls for dogs brought table side. Noon to 5 happy hour with a sumptous french and Italian favorite selection. Homemade pesto made from marcona almonds. 
3819 4 Excellent breakfast stop! Probably can't go wrong with whatever to order. Had the breakfast quesadillas and an American (sized to swim in). Good stuff! 
3820 4 It is hard to imagine that any palate could not be satisfied by this menu and the attention to inspired ingredients in every dish. My girlfriend and I love this place. Real food, real flavor. 
3821 4 Best Pho in the city hands down. Staff is friendly, food is amazing and comes out super fast. Portions are huge and the price is super cheap. Never had a bad meal in the hundreds of times I have eaten here. 
3822 4 Super fresh and super delicious. Bonus points for fast service during my lunch break. Everything I've tried here was amaze-balls. You can even see the fresh pita being made by the front. 
3823 4 The food was delicious plus no waiting on a Sunday! I got a tofu scramble. I definitely feel like I got a lot of food for the price I paid. Service was friendly & music took me back to the 90's. 
3824 0 Only way this place stays in business is because there's no competition in Hillsdale. Bad food, runny curries, over or undercooked vegetables. Nice atmosphere and good service though. But food is below mediocre, some dishes inedible. Wish they'd leave and let some better restaurant move in to the neighborhood. 
3825 4 The people were nice and helpful. ..I've been to several shops that seem to turn their nose up at you if you aren't very knowledgeable about cigars. There was cool guy at a desk making Nicaraguan cigars that you could buy. 
3826 3 Ça reste du fast-food mais on ce trompe pas avec BWW la nourriture est bonne, le service décent, propre... Bref un sports bar qui répond aux attentes !! 
3827 4 They took us out on the tour even though we only had us and one other couple (4 total). We did the canal tour and it was awesome. We live in Florida and we thought this was real Florida. Really cool. We saw lots of alligators and other wildlife. 
3828 4 We started coming here freashman year of college, and 5 years later (now alumni) we still return to kyotos frequently! We love going for their lunch special! I do recommend getting the upgrade to white meat. Their white sauce is the best around, as well as their meso soup. Yummy! 
3829 4 Best tea shop in Portland! The selection is amazing and I love the atmosphere (fire place, garden out back patio out front). 
3830 3 Awesome food, good service. The food was extremely creative, well paired, and absolutely delicious. Service was attentive and well thought out, though we helped correct a couple of communication details. Ambiance very chic, quiet, and cool. For a hotel restaurant, I will definitely return. 
3831 4 Really delicious. We got the vegetarian platter with a side of chicken and spinach and we devoured the entire thing. It was boyfriend's first time having Ethiopian food and I am so happy he loved it. We will be back. 
3832 4 Awesome burgers. The food and service here are consistently excellent! The outdoor eating area is really nice and kept clean. This is one of those places that you will put on your go to list. 
3833 3 I've come here for a couple years on Record Store Day and the service is always great. 
3834 3 I love the food here. I've always had the empanadas but today I tried the Colombian burger for the first time. Best burger ever! The only thing that could be better is the wait time. 
3835 4 My first time there and it was the most amazing steak tip dinner I've ever had prices are great they even sell 5 lb bags for $65 in their special marinade you need to call one day in advance what an amazing taste I will be back!! 
3836 3 One of those places where you get outstanding crafted culinary delights. The staff were so accommodating and fun. If you go see if you can sit over by the kitchen window to watch the chefs prepare the food. Great fun and great owners and staff. 
3837 4 Um, probably the best tattoo shop in Portland!!! Adorable, comfortable, accommodating, laid back, awesome artists, cute music always playing... I've gotten three tattoos here from the amazing Carrie and don't want to go anywhere (/to anyone) else. 
3838 4 I already loved Music Millunnium's store and all their support to local musicians and the community. But now, I love them even more for helping to support the Oregon Association for Music Therapy's 2013 conference with their generous donations. Thank you!! 
3839 1 Pretty sure my boyfriend got roofied here. Yep. Seriously. 2 stars for the 33-tini though; that thing's yummy. 
3840 4 I went there couple of times order take-out. Always they have good food I want to try their buffet one day so far with take-out I had good experience. Can't say much about services haven't try dine-in 
3841 4 Amazing i love this place so so much very peaceful and everyone is super nice. Very big, please don't bring babies or kids. 
3842 3 Super geeky and lots of gf and vegan options. What more do you want! It's a fun hangout to meet up with friends and play a few games over nachos and drinks. 
3843 4 Anisa is a true artist! I am very picky about my eyebrows and I would not trust anybody else to wax and shape them. 
3844 0 Stay away. Had no less then 20 visits by contractors in less than a year. Stole $300 from me during the move out by not getting quotes for an appliance door. 
3845 3 Great tap selection and huge bottled selection. The bartender always seems to be super knowledgeable about the offerings. I'm obsessed with the vanilla clove cider they've had for the last few weeks. Great little spot! 
3846 4 very professional and awesomely quick service.definitely will be back here should i need to get my phone repaired. 
3847 3 Love the double bacon mushroom and Hawaiian pizza! Timely delivery and pleasant staff. $30 for 2 large pizzas seems reasonable to me. 
3848 3 I got a great haircut. The shopping center it is in is slightly sketchy, but the haircut itself was great, and my hairstylist was lovely and made sure to cut my hair exactly how I wanted. I am so sorry I forgot her name, but thank you! 
3849 1 Run of the mill New York pizza. If you have never been to New York this pizza won't ruin your day. Other than that its a weak bland version of the pizza you know And love from the north east. Skip it, there are better options. 
3850 3 had their american Sub. Really good bread, meat, and cheese. put too much mayo on it but that is not a deal breaker. perfect food for watching a game 
3851 1 Wir waren selten in einem Hooters in dem so wenig Stimmung herrschte. Die Bedienungen waren auch nicht besonders attraktiv. Nach einer kurzen Einlage mit Hula-Hup-Reifen wurde ohne sich die Hände zu waschen Essen serviert. Das Essen meiner Begleitung kam verspätet. Insgesamt war es geschmacklich nicht besonderes. Die Begrüßung war freundlich. 
3852 4 Great pizza here. We ate and loved it. The service was nice and fast. Price is pretty reasonable too. 
3853 3 On vacation, this was across the street. Decided to check it out. The baked ziti was pretty good. Everything was a little on the pricey side but overall not too shabby. 
3854 4 This is a fresh take on everything from sushi to beverages. Well executed - taste and presentation. 
3855 1 One had breakfast with over cooked eggs that were rubbery. I had a burger that was served cold that I sent back. Expensive for bad food. 
3856 3 Good beer, great wings, pizzas, and pulled pork, French dip had a ton of fat and the au jous was flavorless. Atmosphere is fun and its a great place to watch sports games. 
3857 4 Martha is a personable, experienced hairdresser and I am so glad I found her at Nest. I like the place. Very laid back, funky. 
3858 4 Absolutely wonderful meal and over all great experience. Next time we come to Vancouver for a visit the Nook will be our first place we go to dinner. 
3859 4 Awesome BBQ! This place definitely ranks in my top 10 for BBQ. I ordered the brisket and sausage. For a good size meat serving and two sides, I paid less than $20.00. I really enjoyed the jalapeño cornbread for desert. 
3860 4 Amazing food. Great wait staff!! Went there for brunch. The free bread was fresh and warm. The white sangria with herbs was refreshing. We also ordered croquet, tuna tartar, meat ball and truffle ham sandwich. 
3861 3 Came here for lunch and had the shaksuka. The bread was great, and the skahsuka was huge. It was a little spicy for my tastes, but I'm guessing most people would like that, so I won't knock them. Next time I'll try an egg scramble. 
3862 3 Solid bowl of ramen for a reasonable price, broth was tasty and cha Shiu was plentiful. Above average ramen spot. 
3863 4 Nice location. The food is very good ! I think some items are a bit overpriced but much for the most part it's average. 
3864 4 The quinoa with chicken breast is fantastic!!! A large number of chicken strips! My friend ordered the squash soup, a little salty. But the sea bass is soooooo good! It's worth the price. My other friend ordered waffle with quail, good too!!! 
3865 1 I was expecting MUCH better after reading reviews. Dumplings were good and green onion pancake. But sauce on stirred fried noodles w lamb lacked flavor. Wonton soup was ok. Atmosphere is hole-in-the-wall in a non-charming way. No bathroom. 
3866 3 Really great place and tanning was smooth applied. I forgot the name of the technician but she did great. 
3867 3 I have a serious soft spot for old school diners. The prices are great, the food was solid, and the service was fast. If you're expecting a fancy brunch, keep looking. However, if you love the simple straight forward diner experience, then I'm sure you'll find a winner here! 
3868 4 One of the best Thai restaurants in Austin !! If at all your vegetarian ; Please try all the curries and fried rice here.. It's amazing !! 
3869 4 A must food was delicious. A hidden gem, nice atmosphere , parking great. Server nice. Very unexpected .Fries, hamburger and tomato basil soup. Enjoyed it all. 
3870 3 Great location to eat healthy but not sacrifice any taste or experience. Love the seasonal menu. The desserts are delightful and just the right amount to curb a sweet tooth but not throw your diet. 
3871 4 Probably one of my favorite ramen places this side of Japan. The egg is cooked to perfection along with the the slices of pork. Run, don't walk to this place. 
3872 4 Their macaroons are AMAZING ! The staff is very friendly. Love coming here. Good food. 
3873 1 I ordered takeout around 9pm on a Friday night. I received my not-so-hot food approximately an hour and a half later. The Chicken tikki masala was bland and lacked flavor, as did the naan. Disappointing. 
3874 0 Do not eat here if your hungry...smallest portions everrrrrrr. Service is worse than the size 
3875 4 Tender Lovin' Chix are the best tenders I've ever had. Super crispy outside and soooooo juicy & tender inside. 
3876 4 Awesome service, seriously treated like family! Went there for the live music and Brian Grayson and Ryan Johnson put on a great show! Cheep beers and good food too! 
3877 4 They were so good with my daughter who had her virgin hair dyed. The process was very slow and long. But she has been beeping ever since great colour and it's holding great and it's been about a month still vibrant teal 
3878 4 My husband and I had a great time at Paper Crane Lounge! The atmosphere and service were both fantastic. The cocktails were great. We enjoyed going off the menu by description instead of ingredients. The swordfish and desert were both delicious! We will definitely be back! 
3879 4 I love this place. Friendly staff, great food, clean kitchen. Try it. The spicy basil noodles are bomb. 
3880 3 The best Thai delivery ever! So quick and huge servings. Highly recommend for Hotels around the airport. Beats hotel food any day. 
3881 3 Honestly the cilantro garlic sauce is what makes everything taste so delicious. Whether I choose to get a wrap, grilled chicken, or ribs that sauce will make miracles happen. Everything else tastes fine but I am highly recommending that sauce to go with most meals here! 
3882 4 Love this place. Come here regularly for massage and acupuncture. And they have great showers! 
3883 2 Good vegetarian options-- they even have a dairy-free yogurt (which, unfortunately, they are often out of). Try the avocado+brie rollup (if you do dairy). The mango-coconut combo is good, as is their decaf coffee+orange or raspberry. 
3884 3 Great happy hour! Yumm fire roasted hamburger for $6. Great quality martini at only $5 during happy hour. 
3885 3 I ordered the chai icecream drink, it was very cinnamon-y the service was great! Good study place to keep you caffeinated. Would come again. 
3886 3 Nice decor, good food & service. The servings are big, so it may make sense to split an entree. I like how they had coffee & chairs by the door for incoming customers. 
3887 3 Food was delicious. The standard chicken tikka was tasty. Daal was good enough, but not amazing. 
3888 3 Chocolates were amazing They have so many chocolates.The tour was not my ideal but I tried so many chocolates at the end that I changed my mind. I enjoyed the white hot chocolate it was delicious. 
3889 3 You come in always expecting the perfect customer service which this store was no exception. I love their chicken sandwiches, their waffle fries, and dippable ketchup packets, all things that set them apart from other fast food joints. 
3890 4 Whenever I walk through the iron gate.. I know we are going to have a good dinner. Good specials on certain nights and they never make a bad drink. We normally get the Lobster and several rounds. Very clean and well managed bar. 
3891 1 I ordered the two piece fried chicken. Delivery took over an hour food was freezing cold. I warmed it up in the microwave but the chicken had good flavor would of been better if it wasn't soggy from the microwave. Fries were soggy of course they were cold. 
3892 4 The service was fantastic. They were very attentive and made us feel special. The food had great presentation and extremely delicious. Highly recommend. 
3893 3 Amazing food. Superb service. Beautiful interior. Only issue is it was very loud and a bit hard to have a conversation with people even if they were seated across from you. 
3894 3 Stopped here to meet family, Sharon our waitress recommended the homemade hash, and she was right, it was awesome !!! All of the food was great and service was excellent, especially Sharon ! 
3895 3 This place is a must! I recommend the lobster roll (Stuffed lobster in bread)! I'm so glad I got to try this place out! 
3896 4 We used Brooke for our wedding flowers and I cannot say enough good things about her and her work. She completely understood what I was going for and created bouquets that were better than I could have imagined. Every flower arrangement was bountiful and unique, without breaking the bank. 
3897 4 It was excellent. I had a delicious double cubano and was able to sit and enjoy for hours. 
3898 3 Great option for veggies! I had the BBQ tempeh and was very happy. If you're a vegan, make sure they take off the cheese. There are chingos of options, so definitely go if you want a good sammich. 
3899 3 Pretty good pizza if slightly lacking a bit in taste. Toppings were first rate and service was good( slow lunch period on a Thursday) 
3900 3 The cookies were good and they warmed them up for you, but I thought 14.00 for a dozen cookies was a bit much. We bit the bullet this time, but prob won't do it again. 
3901 2 Not really very impressed expected more of a dive bar. Yes, the atmosphere is dive bar esque but entrees are $20 and limited & drinks are not cheap. Fun to hang out though, younger professional crowd, good amount of space. 
3902 3 All you can eat lobster and crab legs??? This was paradise for the hubby. Everything else that's offered is just bleh. Come here for what they're named after. Nothing else. 
3903 4 Awesome barbecue and a fantastic selection of REAL craft beers! Try the fried okra, you'll be pleasantly surprised! The white bbq sauce is also incredible. 
3904 4 Very quiet spot. Great food and drink, and service is very friendly. The store is also relatively clean and well kept. There are also quite a few regulars that came in. 
3905 3 I've driven by this place dozens of times and we finally stopped in. I was pleasantly surprised! We ordered fried provolone and a Joe's Pile of Protein pizza to share. The pizza had pepperoni, sausage, salami, ham, ground beef, onions, and diced pepperoncini. Very delicious! 
3906 0 The highlight of this meal was the bread... Was very disappointed with the bolognese and the margarita pizza which lacked any sort of flavor. Would recommend 20 different Italian restaurants in the area over Posto. 
3907 4 THIS WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE! The atmosphere was incredible and my waitress was phenomenal! We were lucky enough to have Sophie and the food combined with her bubbly personality made it a perfect night. 
3908 4 Tasty pizza,Awesome customer service and affordable prices! Cant go wrong at Eastvan Pizza! Good job! Highly reccomend. 
3909 4 Reopened as Tea Nails on Highland Ave, right across from Somerville Hospital. Pedicure chairs are now side by side, so grab friends and go for a spa day with Tea and her staff! 
3910 2 The Starbucks literally never has any grilled cheese in stock. Doesn't matter what time of day or what day of week. Edit: apparently this sandwich was discontinued but whoever was serving us tonight didn't know. 
3911 4 The outside dining area is the way to idle away a leisurely sumer saturday with friends. The Steak And blue sandwich is truth. Local bomb Boston beers on tap. Soooo Fu*king good. 
3912 2 This place is o-k-a-y. Food is average, price is average and everything is average. I prefer Bon Chon Chicken over Chuh Gat jib. I was there last weekened, I felt too old. Very young crowd.... people were around 21? or even younger?? (shhh... they often don't check ID) 
3913 4 Awesome store! Love the clothes, bags..drool drool..Owner was very helpful. Cross between urban and girly clothes. Right up my alley. 
3914 4 Wow! Totally different experience when you go before the crowd arrives. Sahara is now my favorite hookah lounge again! 
3915 0 Really atrocious customer service. They were exceptionally rude. Their pizza is good, but definitely not worth being talked down to and called "hun." Never going back. 
3916 4 These guys are the best! They fixed up my MacBook Pro and put in a new hard drive for a quarter of the cost that the Apple store geniuses quoted me. Thanks, Guys! 
3917 4 One of my favorite bars in Boston. Walkable distance from the Garden or North End. Usually has good bands, so the music is enjoyable. Crowded after a game but the crowd is friendly. 
3918 4 Omg. This place is absolutely phenomenal. Every time I go, there's an explosion of taste in my mouth. Everything is extraordinarily amazing. Love love love it! 
3919 2 Good, but Willie Mae's it ain't. On it's own IMO it's a bit salty. The sides are good but again, dang son, the SALT. 
3920 4 Wow. So good I've found myself coming back again and again (3 or 4 Times this week). Its not famcy, but boy is it good! 
3921 4 This place is my very favorite. The outside seating is great, almost every seat inside is a booth, the djs never disappoint, the drinks are perfect and perfectly priced and the food is so incredible that I always forget it's vegetarian. Paloma's and arepas and outside seats all summer please! 
3922 4 Kenneth is the man. If you need to look sharp, give this guy a call. 
3923 4 The Best North indian Restaurant In Town.no one compair with food of this Location.If you realy Love and Like Authentic Indian Food,you should must try once here. 
3924 4 We just had our daughter's 3rd birthday party this morning at the Boston location. It truly exceeded our expectations. Tons of fun bouncy houses and slides, generous amount of time in each jumping room, great service, clean and well equipped cake/party room. We'll be back! 
3925 2 good place for the business expense account crowd or tourists. food is good quality but the prices are not good value. 
3926 3 Nice surprise! Was in drinking some great drink specials, decided to try the 2 for 1 entree special, was excellent! Scallops were cooked perfectly, definitely fresh and at 1/2 price you can't get a deal like that I Boston!!! Nice dinner, great prices and worth a visit 
3927 4 Got my son's graduation cake...absolutely wonderful. .never disappointed in anything I have purchased there! 
3928 1 We ordered two dozen oysters, they were shucked at least 30 minutes before we got there. Super dry, slimy and not good. Could tell they had been sitting for a while. Super bummed. 
3929 2 Helpful staff, but they forgot to take the security tag of the pants I bought. 
3930 4 Friend and I were from out of town. Rebecca was very knowledgeable of the city and friendly. Live band was awesome I would definitely go back and recommend. 
3931 0 Slow as hell, unorganized, always a line. How about waiting 4 hours for a prescription getting home and realizing they forgot one!! 
3932 4 Where did Lelani go? Anyone knows? I went there one day to be told she doesn't work there anymore. She did the best acrylic toenail and i need to know where she went to follow her or find someone just as good as she was filling my missing toenail. 
3933 4 Friendly, professional, courteous organization. The Dan's were great to work with. 
3934 4 I'll be eating here at least once a week, (now that ng bmt is gone) their meat is such good quality and the rib rice box is spectacular! 
3935 4 Great place for some late night food. It was pretty fast, and the firecracker fries were delicious. They are topped with chesse and some other kind of mayonnaise-based sauce, which really hit the spot 
3936 4 I have been bringing my dry cleaning to Sofia for 3 years. She is incredibly kind and always so pleasant. My clothes have always been ready on time with no issues. Her prices are very reasonable as well for typical blouses, dresses, and pants. 
3937 3 Erica did my Health and Fitness Assessment before I begin working with a trainer. I was pleasantly surprised that she spent a long time with me. She is so friendly and professional. 
3938 4 Finally after years trying to find the right doctor, we landed Dr. Christopher Thompson, he is bound and determined to find an answer. By the time we got home (2 1/4 hours), we had 3 appointments set up on our answering machine. Kudos to a very professional team! 
3939 0 Zero stars for unfriendly service. My wife and I walked in, two white guys were behind the counter, barely looked at us, so we just walked out immediately. We were thinking about biking around Stanley Park, guess not. Left with a bad taste of Canadian in-hospitality 
3940 4 The meatballs are fantastic and should not be missed. Also try the Rosemary Sea Salt bread - great with the spicy oil. Menu changes every few months - so if you like something go back. 
3941 4 Stopped in for lunch, was pleasantly surprised! We ordered garlic cheese bread, the pizza lovers flatbread and chicken piccata. All were very delicious. The service was great, the food was great, the music makes you feel like you are in Italy. We will be back for sure! 
3942 4 The best burger place in Austin. Been there with my boss first time, and after that, it was m y number 1 choice. I used to take people over there who wanted to eat a good burger. 
3943 4 Delicious & great service. Host was so super friendly. Had pecan pancakes and was superb! 
3944 0 Used to go to this place quite a bit. Success seems to have ruined their attitude. Asked for a cup of ice because the soda was not cold out of the cooler and they told me that would be 25 cents!!!! Are you kidding me? See ya later! 
3945 4 My favorite Indian in Boston. i recommend the mushroom samosas, mango chicken, chicken tikka, gulab jamun, rice pudding, chicken chaat, dosas,... there is a lot to love about this place. Friendly professional staff. Weekend brunch is fantastic. 
3946 4 Thank you Disney World! So many great vegan options have appeared this year and the Beyond Burger at Sassagoula Floatworks is one of the best! Delicious! Great fries too. 
3947 4 What can I say here that hasn't already been said? This location of Cohen's is great. My wife and I have been buying glasses from here for years. Dolly is fantastic. She's super professional, will work in your budget, and won't sell you glasses that don't look good on you. 
3948 4 A great community store. Amazing selection of new and used board, card, roleplaying and video games. 
3949 3 Ramen ryoma is possibly the best tasting ramen in portland/beaverton area. It is definitely not the most authentic and traditional, but tastes much better. Portions are also big and price is reasonable. Broth is a bit fatty and toppings are added onto ramen straight from fridge so they are cold. 
3950 2 Good. Cool patio. Fish and chips lacked some flavor. Steak salad was pretty good. Curried cauliflower was pretty delish cause of the sauce. 
3951 0 No food, waited while they forgot my drink order 3x. Never did get my drink even after 6 orders of sushi. Had to stop eating because I was thirsty. Nice biz model guys... Did I mention that the same thing happened the last I went there. 
3952 4 I had their Angus AAA Beef Burger. It was the best hamburger I have had in years, it was so tasty. The lemon dessert slices are good too. 
3953 0 $10 cover charge for this place even with a dinner reservation? Ridiculous. Try your luck somewhere else. This food is not worth it. 
3954 2 Vegan options are very slim and the food takes a long time to come out. This is the one place I've been in Portland that couldn't really make anything vegan. Kind of a disappointment. However, my nonvegan family loved the food. 
3955 4 A great experience every time. Try the crazy caesar salad & coconut cake. You won't regret it! 
3956 4 This place is cozy and full of character (read cramped and shabby for snobs)! Loved the Republican burger and Rocket poutine. I'd recommend Raglan's for people at home in a tropical shanty town. 
3957 4 A delight! Serves intelligentsia coffee and set up in an old bank(?)...vault in back...outdoor seating..huge space, never had a problem with seating...always cute pups hanging Out too! 
3958 4 One of the best burgers I've ever had, not sure how they do it but it was incredible. Fries had truffle oil and were just as good. Got a hot apricot beer I really enjoyed, can't wait to go back! 
3959 4 Other ramen place was closed. Worked out because this place, which is just around the corner is just as good but different flavor. Bowl is bigger with more noodles and meat. Would recommend this place! 
3960 4 Great shawarma at great prices! Loved it totally! Comes with fries inside which was a pleasant change! Really cool and friendly dudes working at the truck. You can see the inside is pretty clean! A Must try! 
3961 4 Had a great experience. Casual staff and friendly n accommodating. Food was unique , ample n delicious 
3962 1 Service is sloooowwww. Waited on wings to go for over 45 minutes Must be affected by the government shutdown. Will update the review if the food proves to be worth the wait. 
3963 3 I had the LongHorn Trio and the fish was cook perfectly. I absolutely love the salmon, but the steak was a bit overcooked. Their key lime pie dessert was awesome too. 
3964 4 DELICIOUS! We got the gyoza, edamame, spicy tuna, and shrimp tempura. It was SO fresh. The service was quick and attentive. Loved it and will definitely come back. 
3965 0 Wish I could agree with the fellow yelpers on this one but there door and yelp page have them open till 4:30 but they had an employee standing guard at the door telling people they are closed at 3:45 
3966 4 I literally just had the best sandwich of my life here. The prosciutto caprese is out of this world!! Every single bite was the perfect mix of prosciutto, tomatoes, the freshest mozzarella and basil!! Plus evoo and balsamic.. wow ! 
3967 0 This is the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. They couldn't get bills correct, food was delayed and sub-par at best and more than one order was incorrect. The manager couldn't even apologize and comp dessert correctly. Just terrible. 
3968 1 Food was OK. Soup was a little cold for my taste. The Clam Chowder was not what I expected for a Boston restaurant. As a dining experience, it could have been better. 
3969 4 This is the perfect combo of great food, creative menu and hospitality. Enough said. 
3970 4 Normally food that you buy when you've been drinking isn't going to be first class, but we bought a huge pepperoni pizza and a large coke from here after a night out and it was fantastic and only cost $9.50. Best pizza truck ever. 
3971 4 This hotel is very nice. Worth the money for sure, and sometimes the rates are very attractive for a night out in the seaport. Location is excellent. Right near the harvor and loads of restaurants. Bar area has good drinks. Had the tacos for a snack. Really good. 
3972 4 I love T&T. Their produce is varied, and they offer a lot of foods that I like. Red dates, dumplings, wasabi-flavoured peas, chestnuts, pork tongue are a few things that I like and that I couldn't find elsewhere or would have to pay much more. Yum. 
3973 3 This place was cute and the food was good. We got 4 dishes and spilt them family style. I'd probably get two of them again. The wait was 35 minutes but once we ordered it only took 10ish minutes to get our food. 
3974 4 Wonderful customer service! They have a few unique shrubs and flowers that I haven't seen anywhere else. They also carry zoysia sod by the piece which is hard to find. Most places you have to buy it by the pallet. 
3975 2 3 stars for $25 minimum order. Then they tack on $2 delivery charge, + tax + tip. By the time you order for just one person it's $40. 
3976 4 Great mojitos,chips and salsa, queso, and tortilla soup. Always a treat when I go to eat here. 
3977 2 This corner location gets passed up, but why? Coffee place, plus, bar and live music by talented artist at night We saw Kendall Core there, and also picked up some cd and albums. Didn't try the food though. Look up days and time for their live music. So cool. 
3978 4 Unbelievable concept. Finally someone has brought us healthy fast food that tastes great and is filling. The buffalo pulled pork is amazing, as is the California turkey burger! So hard to choose a favorite though. Even the fries are delicious. The location is ideal and the service is excellent. 
3979 2 Service was kind of slow. But the food was great. I ordered the sampler appetizer which was good. The artichoke dip tasted watered down. The wings were really good it was some new Asian zing flavor (I think). Nice portion sizes for the sampler. 
3980 4 Kathryn was so knowledgeable about hair. I love my Balayage, ombre she did. The cut is a amazing too! I recommend her!!! 
3981 4 I've always loved this place. Luis always shows you a great time when you make a stop here. Come check it out for yourself. 
3982 4 Can't beat Marriott CRM. Checking in @ 10am. Handed over my ID, and after a quick glance at it they say "oh yes, we have your room waiting for you." Made me feel like I'm a regular guest here. 
3983 2 Tess and Charmain behind the bar make this the go to place for after work drinks. The food so far has been average. Atmosphere is better then average. 
3984 3 Ordered on a whim the steak caesar salad and fried wings with a side of honey mustard. Meh kind of dressing for the salad but it was edible. Honey mustard was on point with the fried wings. I'll get the wings again, no so much the salad. 
3985 3 First time there today. Loved the atmosphere, very eclectic. Dessert stand looked amazing. Ordered the Amazing Basil Lemonade. Very very good but tooo sweet for am taste buds. I see me sipping on this in the hot summer afternoon. Good job. Will be back!, 
3986 3 Fun inside atmosphere with a wide selection of savory and sweet crepes, baked goods, and friendly service. 
3987 4 Great beer here. I love just chilling here and Having some delicious poutine. I had my first poutine here and it was a perfect match with my beer. I love the decor and ambiance. We also had the bone marrow but was stuck in devouring the poutine! 
3988 4 Not your typical museum. It is in a house and its a private collection. It is nice for a date, not so big it takes hours to get through, but still a lot of great conversation pieces. It is pretty inexpensive and a must see in boston. 
3989 4 Amazing food for great price. Quick, friendly service, definitely recommend! We got the avocado scramble, the Nutella French toast and the shakshuka and all three were very good! 
3990 3 Thank you Dr. Bendall for your response. I did respond to e-mails as you posted, however I was suppose to get a call back from your assistant and didn't. She was suppose to check with you if you would still come out. I just never got a response. 
3991 3 They have awesome (delicately grilled, not fried) fish tacos and the salsa is just like my host-mom made in Mexico! 
3992 4 Definetly my first pick when it comes to pizza places. The quality of the food and prices are great, and the owner is the sweetest guy youll ever meet! 
3993 4 It checks every box you would want for breakfast. The service was great and the restaurant itself was very clean and comfortable. I thought the prices were fair as well. I will be going back. 
3994 4 Awesome food, surprisingly great sushi, one of my favorite places 
3995 0 Wonton soup was quite strange. Wontons were overcooked. Egg roll had no flavor. Will never order from again 
3996 3 mmmm great sushi good sake and OYSTER SHOOTERS. they have some very unique rolls. i would def give it a try if you are a fan of sushi and sake. 
3997 3 Zen always delivers. Some of the best Takos (that's how it's spelled) in Austin. 
3998 2 It looks like a fast food place, and you get your food pretty fast, but the food is actually pretty tasty. I went there a few days ago for lunch and their chicken teriyaki bento was surprisingly better than I would have guessed from the looks of the place. 
3999 3 This place is a favorite of mine for breakfast, esp the oyster omelette. It had been 6 years since I last visited and still delicious and just as I remembered. 
4000 0 Mediocre at best. Empanadas were tasty ... We tried all kinds. The Cuban sandwich was very good. The roast pork was a disappointment ... The meat tastes old. Food was served on paper plates and plastic silverware. Restaurant has potential but they can do much better. 
4001 1 Lousy service, margarita tastes like it came out of a gun and food tastes like another corporate chain that puts profit ahead of ingredients and creativity. Oh wait, that's what they are now. Pass. 
4002 3 Great, solid food here. Got the honey duck, pad see ew, and massaman curry. They were all reasonable in price and super tasty. I have had some more complex and flavorful Thai food but not at this price point. Also they deliver and some days that is so very necessary. 
4003 0 No where near as good as the old Kool Korners. I feel this place's bad vibes just for marketing themselves as a replacement for the awesome sandwich shop that used to be. The only thing worse than their questionable marketing is their sub-par sandwiches. 
4004 4 This place is a hidden gem! Incredible service, impeccable wine selection, and the freshness of their dinner menu.. mind blowing. This place is, in my humble opinion, Boston's Top 5. Do yourself a favor - Go. 
4005 4 Great way to start our vacation in Portland. Case was a great guide and gave us a 2 hour overview of downtown. Good history without being boring and we were then able to determine which areas peaked our interest and deserved further exploration. Highly recommended! 
4006 3 We have to give this 4 stars for overall quality and service. Oysters excellent but $'s. Fried fish ok. Louis salad outstanding. Fried oyster roll delish. Nice bellys. Clam chowda looked great. Good drinks. Bloody Mary bloody good. Crab cake decent. Ceaser Salads with grilled seafood was huge. 
4007 4 Becca was extremely helpful finding my out of network game. This is the place to be if you are diehard fan looking to watch your game. 
4008 4 The best food. I have been twice. Both times we had the single snack burger, fries, a hot dog and a vanilla shake. Both times the food was incredible! Meat was fresh, fries were perfect. I love this place. Will definitely be back. 
4009 4 Amazing! The weekend wait is worth it. Chicken and waffles is a must have, along with everything else on the menu 
4010 4 Great people, great care! I'm a scaredy pants about the dentist. The folks at Smiles are friendly and careful with me the whole time. 
4011 4 Their happy hour is off the chain. The bone marrow is sooo gooood .... 
4012 4 I love all of their cakes. We got a peanut butter cake with peanut butter icing and chocolate decor. I can't wait to order another one. Thank you Pattycake Bakery. 
4013 4 I don't really care much for donuts but these are DELICIOUS! The maple bacon is good, but a little intense and brown butter hazelnut crunch is really good, but the vanilla bean is my absolute favorite. 
4014 4 Pulp is an excellent place for quick snacks, shakes, smoothies and a number of healthy eating options. Their costs are reasonable and the staff is friendly. 
4015 2 They provide good service and are cheap but good LORD! They are extremelyyyyyy slow. It took them 25 mins to do my eyebrows and no I don't have thick eyebrows. 
4016 3 Although there were new employees being trained at the time, the food was still great as usual. I love Chipotle! 
4017 4 this is my favorite spot to study. It's cozy, relaxed space with comfy seating and great coffee. It's not the place for a large group, but if you're looking for a more intimate coffee house, stop by summermoon. 
4018 4 I had A smoked short rib hash and my friend had vegetable chilequiles. Great food, great vegetarian options! Yummy! 
4019 4 We're frequent patrons to this Pho. The food is so great, and always fresh, and is served so quickly (you can count on getting in and out if you're in a hurry). Wonderful appetizers and soups. 
4020 4 Food pod located a short distance away from Pok Pok and Bollywood Theater. A good number of tables available, but quickly fills up at lunch. There's bound to be something delicious for everyone to try at this pod. I tried the Paper Bag Pizza, Namu, and Doghouse PDX. 
4021 3 The best Lanzhou Ramen is Austin I had. If you are the first time visitor, you should try Beef Hand-pulled Noodels. 
4022 4 Wow, this is crazy off the charts. I can get a custom cupcake even dairy and gluten free. With tons of options for toppings!! I got a pre made gluten free chocolate cupcake with shredded coconut and dairy free chocolate sauce topping, incredible!! 
4023 0 Place is a dump! Stay far away. Dirty, service is bad, food no good and they have the nerve to charge 200 per night. Would never stay here again nor another holiday inn 
4024 3 Great breakfast selection and decent coffee cheaper and better than hilton hotel. Short walk to sw park and you are at taylor st. Atmosphere is light and pleasant and easy to access. 
4025 1 Waiter was the best part of our meal. Pleasant and friendly. The food was very salty. Not a great meal. Have heard good things about pf chang. Not this time. Maybe we'll try another location some day??? Maybe not?? 
4026 3 Solid food and atmosphere. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Definitely check it out if you are looking for a good Italian meal. 
4027 4 Best lattes and mochas in Austin. The Medici cafes around town offer my favorite brews so far. This location on the drag has plenty of tables and study place. It is 2 stories of quiet. Like their sister cafes, no food is offered. 
4028 1 Terrible food. i read plenty good comments here so i went and after first bite i regret that! Good service. Great but dark ambiance. 
4029 3 My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary in Orlando last week and attended Earls for dinner and we enjoyed it. The place had the perfect "date night" vibes. The food was pretty good even though the portions were small. I would definitely visit Earls again! 
4030 4 Ate there tonight. Very hip, chic place. Attentive waitstaff, excellent food and innovative cocktails. Pammy is the consummate hostess. 
4031 3 Nice job, Anh's! The Pho broth is complex and combined with the extra onions and tender filet, this is a definite redo. 
4032 4 I ordered the Eggplant with brown rice and salad and it was perfect. Their vegetable salad was tasty and the eggplants were just right. Also the rice was fresh. 
4033 4 After discovering this place, there is no other place I would rather grab my breakfast from. This place has a great selection of pastries and they are all at a fair price. Really great place and look forward to coming again! 
4034 2 I thought the ahi tuna sandwhich with wasabi mayo was quite good. Can't speak for the burgers. Fries were okay, someone else mentioned they were hard and I somewhat agree. I would come back for their ahi tuna and to try their black bean burger. 
4035 0 Overpriced and not worth it and the people are very rude. I can't figure out why I keep going back here and just keep going to the new 7 11 that just moved in right down the street is a much better deal. 
4036 2 Try the pumpkin pie cupcake!! Moist and tasty! I could go for another one right now... The last batch I had from Sweet was much better than my first. 
4037 4 This is my go-to place for a girly happy hour- the mojitos and margaritas are fantastic! My personal favorite is the prickly pear marg. 
4038 4 This place is so much better than its name suggests! The interior of the restaurant is really nice and sleek/sophisticated. The food has been great both times I've been here. I particularly liked the mango tango roll, and my bf was a fan of the bibimbap. 
4039 0 Awfull experience. I'm surprised there were no bugs in my bed. We paid $300 per night for two night and it couldn't get any worse. Sink was plugged everything is very unpleasant and jail like. Very negative experience. Don't stay here. 
4040 0 Ive been sitting here for 15 minutes and no one has come to serve us. This food better be good, no one has even checked up on us. Customer service here is wack. 
4041 0 Literally the WORST Brazilian I've ever experienced. Too hot wax. Double dipping in the same wax pot as a friend I went with. Left over wax on skin. Lack of privacy. Extremely painful. I would not suggest coming here for a Brazilian ever 
4042 3 Sushi sushi sushi!!! Very Clean and a great place to have some Japanese Food. Very tasty, quiet, and inexpensive. Sushi was good by the soups are even better for some reason. i would rate this place a 4*. Thank You Sushi Katana!!! 
4043 4 They were great! Had them out to correct some previous work done by another company and to make a number of repairs. They were at my house early and called when on they were on their way. Great work all the way around! Professional and friendly! 
4044 3 real neat idea, not very many places you can get sandwiches conceptualized by some of your favorite chefs around the area. Real good specials, keeps things interesting with simple and honest to fancy and complicated sandwiches (that is if there is such a thing as a fancy and complicated sandwich). 
4045 0 when we got there service was good but the food wasn't that great ( salty and the water taste really bad) 
4046 4 This is my first visit to Wild Chix & Waffles/The Factory. It's a chill please to hang out. I got the Basic Brunch waffle and hot chocolate. Both were delicious. 
4047 3 The ingredients are always fresh and I really love the empanadas. Service is a little iffy but at least its consistent, and its a suave place for a small party. The music is a little... bossanova though. 
4048 4 Great Italian restaurant. Fantastic food at a reasonable price. The ambience is also very nice with warm lighting and lots of conversation. I love this place though it's a little hard to get to. 
4049 4 Hands down one the best Chinese restaurants is ATX! Service was incredible. Staff was very friendly. Menu was extensive but clean cut. Food was amazing. I ordered the Lo Mein dish it super delicious and flavorful. I will be back for sure! 
4050 4 Love their taco shell and salsa selections. Awesome specialty store. Please come here to get your stuff when you are looking into hosting a Mexican themed party!!! 
4051 1 cute place, WONDERFUL STAFF (ask for Carolina), but giving a low rating because of the gendered bathrooms. will happily change to 5 stars once the space is more inviting for all folks 
4052 1 Breakfast bar is terrible. Dry eggs, undercooked greasy bacon and no one around to help satisfy the desire for fresh eggs and crisp bacon. And by the way..OVERPRICED! 
4053 4 Delicious coffee and breakfast sandwiches + the nicest people! Very kid friendly too! 
4054 4 amazing. fried. chicken. you cannot go wrong with the spice filled chicken. Service was quick, near downtown, they provide a piece of white bread under every chicken piece to soak up the flavor that tries to escape. 
4055 4 Awesome spot with a nice patio! Everything we order was amazing. My favorite was the pork belly tacos and grilled corn! Definitely wash it down with a mojito! We'll be back for more 
4056 4 Been coming here about 7 years Lynn does a fabulous job! Very quick, clean, and friendly! 
4057 3 Have been coming here for years and love the food! It doesn't get any more authentic than this Cuban food. Great sangria, toasted Cuban bread, empanadas, chicken and rice...so delicious! Be careful if you order the chicken and rice, as it does have pieces of bone in it. 
4058 3 What a wonderful little neighborhood bar! My wife and I stopped by here in November, having just arrived in town for a weekend. This was the only place open. It felt a lot like home, if home were, you know, cool, and had great cocktails. 
4059 4 Bomb!!! Thanksgiving Benedict and wild hog hash on the specialty menu were amazingggggg 
4060 4 What a great experience!! My boyfriend and my first time at the hot pot experience and Bear made it so easy and amazing. Fresh ingredients, great atmosphere, best fruit tea, and more. Will definitely be back! Sweet touch to the free dessert! 
4061 1 I ordered the Seafood Po-Boy and Miss Shortcake. The po-boy was stuffed with fried oysters. Fried on fried? Not very appetizing to me. There was way too much oil. Miss Shortcake was better, but I couldn't help but feel like my insides were submerged in oil after the meal. 
4062 0 I'm going to havevto disagree here. I walk in, the restaurant Is a mess, the food is mediocre and I can only have water as the soda machine Is not working, very dissatisfied, employees walking out the bathroom with out washing their hands, and handling the chicken wings 
4063 4 Best meal ever! Most unique food and atmosphere Amazing hospitality and the food was orgasmic! Ingenious The owner Erick is also very handsome n sexy 
4064 1 Waiting 25-30 min because I have a child and there e empty tables by the bar. Terrible customer service on that 
4065 4 Always fresh crepes! i always get the savory as oppose to the sweet ones! Everytime i go its not packed, never really have to wait in line. The place is always clean they also offer mimosas for 3 bucks 
4066 2 Food was good, and staff was friendly, place is clean and well maintained. Portions are a little on small side. The food could use a little more kick and seasoning. 
4067 1 I only come here for an oil change, they always try to encourage additional services but I refuse to give them any additional money. The staff isn't very friendly at all with the exception of William he is normally very helpful and informative. 
4068 0 Room had been spayed to cover the smell of smoke. Yes in a non-smoking hotel. Great fragrance gave me a migraine!!! 
4069 4 I recant this previous statement. I've had such great experiences since I have not been dealing with the same person. They have improved greatly. 
4070 4 Excellent communication....very professional, thorough inspection with attention to detail and received the inspection report same day of inspection! 
4071 4 Great food, great beer, great staff, I love this place. Beer is a one off kind and the menu is a little different but the experience is worth the trip. Staff is great for conversation and they have black toilets!!! 
4072 4 My family and I eat at Sabra quite often. I love the Spinach Pie and the Mazah Plate. They are always super friendly, clean, and fast. I would definitely recommend trying this place out. 
4073 4 Love this place, never disappointed!!! Specials all week...Food is always excellent!! Im picky about my drink and i can say AGAIN never disappointed!! 
4074 3 Really cute spot in a nice market. Only disappointment is the food is pre packaged and can only be ate there in a nice bowl during lunch. The burger is incredible as well as the zoodles and beets marinara. I adore the brownies as well for pre workout snacks 
4075 4 Very friendly staff. Prompt service. Our pancakes, scrambled eggs, and french toast were delcious. 
4076 0 Very bad service and food was served cold. They don't take order in time or serve in time. Even beer was late and served after appetizer. I am visiting from California and I have never experienced a poor service like this before. 
4077 4 When we moved to the area recently we discovered Gaya... and yahooooo to that... best sushi... quick friendly service and great great food... we love their avocado salad - a fresh meal in itself... and good affordable pricing.... highly highly recommended!!! ...thank you Gaya! :o) 
4078 4 Keep going back for their Buffalo Mac and Cheese. Can't beat this place. Great environment and great food. Definitely one of my favorite places in Boston 
4079 2 This a good place to pick up just about anything one needs for the kitchen. Of course I primarily shop there for convience when I need to pick up just a few things. Fiesta is always busy busy busy, so don't expect to run in and run out. 
4080 4 Fantastic burgers. I especially love the Llano poblano ( grass-fed ) Skinny fries are a perfect. 
4081 1 The food is good when they get it correct, but beware take away orders. They can't seem to distinguish between corn and flour tortillas. 
4082 4 Super yum!! Best burger ever! And the fries are delish as well. Love g lines on the weekend so get there early...we opted to sit at the bar. Quick and friendly service too! Will definitely be back!! 
4083 4 Good place to hang out with a friend and eat pie. Too busy and loud to read or work 
4084 2 Good to come with the group and party. if yer huv no where to eat for late night, this place is answer:)) 
4085 3 Wow the food is awesome! The atmosphere is great. Both indoor and outdoor seating is nice. But the traditional bibimbop was soooooo good! Also got two sushi rolls! Wayy too much good for one sitting but awesome as leftovers! 
4086 4 This place rocks. The owner is really cool and really cares about her studio and students, and the instruction is top notch. The classes are not easy but as always, you can go at your own pace 
4087 4 Great customer service and the food was delicious! We were very impressed by the management. A woman walked by and thanked us for coming to visit and gave us a card for a free pizza since it was our first time. Would definitely recommend, we will be back! 
4088 4 Love getting their wonton soup that has ramen and +BBQ pork! Def get the BBQ pork here, it's a must have every time I visit here! The Peking duck is really good here with the little buns to stick the duck in and sauce to pour over! Delicious. 
4089 4 Today they have Mississippi Mud Pie flavor! Woo hoo. Low carb, low calorie & the kids love it. A great alternative to the sugary stuff 
4090 3 Place is always excellent!!! Great food cold beer!!! 
4091 3 The ambiance isn't great, but the food and service are. The authentic Pad Thai is a perfect mix of sweet, sour, spicy and peanutty. The curries are traditional and delicious, but the duck wasn't anything to write home about. 
4092 4 Stayed here for a work trip. Really great service. Appreciated the hand written note from housekeeping. Rooms were quiet and very spacious. Also enjoyed the view from the room. Would definitely stay here again. 
4093 3 While the lines can be insanely long, the burgers are always amazing. If you want to go all out, get one of the milkshakes. You won't be disappointed. 
4094 4 great place to relax. Keep a lookout for garter snakes, turtles, watersnakes and anoles. 
4095 3 I wasn't aware there was two locations as the first location I went to on Stark street i wasn't impressed. Went to their second location in Pioneer Square and ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and it was good. 
4096 1 I've only eaten here twice. It's good but you will leave hungry. I also didn't think the price matched the quantity. I probably won't return now that Chicken Salad Chick is open right around the corner. Much better food, choice and price. 
4097 0 Food and atmosphere are equally terrible. This establishment has gone way downhill and I will not be back. 
4098 4 This was the funniest thing ever! Book this asap if you want an amazing time!! Can't wait to do this again!! 
4099 3 One of my favourite Dosa Houses. Always delicious always friendly kind servers. Great choices. 
4100 4 everybody already knows this place has no flaws so just go ...get anything they sell and prepare to be satisfied 
4101 4 If you don't mind spending a little extra to get a little extra this place is awesome! Sooooo many good flavors and everything is so fresh and good for you!! It has all the right things Get good nutrition plus make your tummy happy you can't go wrong! 
4102 3 Very nice establishment for some evening cocktails and dinner. Haven't had the food yet but I've been to the one in Dunwoody. I think once they get the ambiance right with the music and live performers it will definitely be even more of a hit. Nice wide bar and upscale 
4103 4 Great neighborhood coffee place. Food is good, coffee is great. It's dog friendly and has a great indoor/outdoor vibe. Love that they have alcohol too. 
4104 3 I avoid Starbucksy type places because the pastries and coffee are usually shiite. This place brings it. Pastries and french press spot on. 
4105 0 15 minutes and no service, place is dead. Got mixed drinks before the beer pitcher. Salad came, no silverware and waitress took off before we could ask, and hasn't come back yet. Sitting here now while writing this. Will not come back. 
4106 4 I've been to many other local breweries and this one is by far my favorite. David the brewmaster is a genius with hops. I wish PSCB were open in Sundays because that's the only day I ever buy beer anywhere else 
4107 4 Carrie was amazing. She was so low-key but colored my hair like a pro. I can't believe how great it looks. I've been trough a lot of stylists in he last year and Carrie is perfect. 
4108 4 I love this place. The owners are so nice. Try the broken sombrero! It's amazing. And in the summer get your mango margarita! Delicious! 
4109 3 Well-made mocha frappuccino, not too icy or liquidy. And we were able to use my Starbucks gift card. Awesome find inside Animal Kingdom! 
4110 4 Delicious, spicy, enticing. We took the waitress' suggestion for the drink of the day which was gingery, strong, and delicious. All our four meals were incredible, delicious, spicy. Will definitely be going back. 
4111 4 Trey Harris kicks my ass every workout. Midtown Trainers is where it's at if you want to be pushed to your limit, lose weight and mix your workouts up. I definitely recommend checking out this spot. 
4112 4 I've been seeing Sue now for about 7 months and I adore her. My hair always turned out exactly how I want and she's so great to chat with. Must try! 
4113 1 The sushi is okay and I haven't been poisoned, but I only get egg or vegetarian sushi and additionally the staff are rude and honestly have no knowledge of standard sushi roll types and names. Its cheap and in a pinch its fine, but I'd never recommend it. 
4114 4 Bought a Roadster thru DJ today. He was very helpful and not pushy at all. Very impressed with the dealership so far. I would recommend DJ if looking for a mini. 
4115 4 Great place! Angie was awesome! Steak cooked to perfection just wish we had room for lava cake.... next time! Also perfect place for dinner before "Shear Madness" 
4116 4 Very quaint pub. Lots of outdoor seating and a fun vibe. Good beer selection and food that sounded and smelled amazing even though we didn't eat. Definitely a cool place to check out if you're in Austin. 
4117 4 Great store for moms and moms to be! Must check out all of their stuff. Really cute boutique! 
4118 4 What beautiful owner and what beautiful customer service ! You don't even feel that you are in a restaurant, it feels like big family kitchen and everyone knows each other ! 
4119 4 Wild Ginger is consistently great. Really not a bad dish on the menu. Best Thai food south of Boston. 
4120 0 Rude blonde young hostess. Needs to work on her people skills. I understand it's summer and busy but she could've said her two word answers to my questions a little more politely, maybe with a smile. It is after all her job. I wouldn't want this person representing my establishment 
4121 1 My friends keep dragging me here...this place seems more like a hang out for locals who like to judge and make rude comments to non-regulars. The beer is average and the variety is limited. 
4122 4 ginger pear martini and a lively crowd keep me coming back. also, i find the pasta dishes to be excellent. 
4123 2 The best part about this place is the dollar drafts. Sometimes that's worth it enough to go. It serves better as an eatery than a bar; and they wont let you play cards. Nothing incredible about this place. 
4124 4 The crew that came to my house were quick and efficient, not to mention professional and friendly! I would definitely recommend them. 
4125 3 I do love the food here ,but you have to check the togo orders before you leave. They have gotten it wrong twice now so be careful. 
4126 4 Best chocolate chip cookies in the city. They're tons of other flavors too that are worth trying, though I stick with the original. Why mess with perfection? 
4127 4 Best steak in the area. I compared Mortons, but for actual flavor I think Ruth's comes out on top. Plus better priced. 
4128 4 Loved this place!!! YUMMMMMY I had the margarita flat bread and a salad and it was sooooo good!!! fast- fresh-delish-and not expensive. I prefer this place over PANERA.. I wish they had them in DC!! 
4129 4 The best place for this type of food. My wife and I order here if we are in the mood for such a thing. The people that own it are very kind and generous. Large plates and great tasting. I highly recommend this place! 
4130 1 I used to LOVE this place when I lived in Arlington but I just went back today and it was not great so now I'm SUPER embarrassed that I've been telling everyone how great it is. SORRY! 
4131 4 This place is a treat. Great food and service. We were there on a very busy day for a late lunch before heading to Logan. My wife had a salad and sangria, I had a beef bourbon panini. It was all very good. Served quickly and with a smile. 
4132 4 Came to town for some Texas BBQ and it was fantastic - had to try all of my favorites. Hope my hotel has a microwave bcuz my leftovers are coming home with me! 
4133 4 There's never a wait and they do a great job. I like that it's busy, the technicians are nice and it's relatively cheap. Easy to walk in. I've done gel and regular polish here and been happy with both. 
4134 4 Dr Annette Cabiac is awesome. She is funny and her staff is pleasant at well. I highly recommend her. 
4135 3 Quick, Friendly service! I stopped in while in the area, ordered the lamb biryani + veggie samosa, for take away (ready in 10 mins), and both were very good, and the medium spice level I asked for was spot on! 
4136 4 Stopped in for dessert and some Pacifico after not visiting in a couple years. My wife and I sat at the bar and enjoyed socializing with the other locals. The place is beautiful and the owner is a sweetheart.... 
4137 4 I am such a fan of this place and I've only been once! lol I can't wait for them to open up during dinner/late night with beer. I need to try the wings next time! BTW, honey bbq means honey buffalo sauce...it's good! 
4138 2 Interesting place tasty bowls....which leads me to question nutritional info which is not available in person or on the website.... I'm afraid that if customers knew between carbs from grains....sugars derived from honey, fruits etc might turn customers away if they knew what they were putting in their bodies???? 
4139 4 As an Australian travelling through, I stumbled on this place. The staff were amazing and helped me out with USA knowledge for the rest of my travels! Can't rate them enough and look out for the Australian $5 on the foreign money wall! Thanks Muu-muu's! 
4140 2 This place is fine...nothing more. I've experienced better service, and attitude from other locations, particularly the Peachtree @ Piedmont location. 
4141 4 Why is this place not packed all the time? We love this Italian bistro in our hood! Service is awesome, fantastic wine list and cocktails, breezy patio! This is one of the best places in Rosedale! And they do gluten free pizza! 
4142 4 Durenda and the gang at Get Coffee are super fun and just awesome. The coffee just plain brewed, has me switched from Starbucks to them. I love their stuff and the atmosphere is so laid back. Yaay Durenda im so happy you opened your shop! :) 
4143 4 I seriously love Belly. When I'm in town visiting family from Los Angeles i make a point to stop in a minimum of twice during a trip. The Rosemary bagels are fluffy and tasty and the fresh OJ is awesome! 
4144 4 Anything short of 5 stars is an affront to the gods of beer. Best beer store ever. Wine and Liquor section is small, but pretty good for what is there. 
4145 0 This place is great if you like paying $3.25 per adult to sit and watch your child play games. 
4146 3 This place is a cute sandwich place that sometimes has live music. It has a coffee shop feel and you order at the counter. I enjoyed my grilled cheese there a lot! Yummy and standard. 
4147 4 Be warned, these are dangerously tasty! 
4148 2 I would say this is just an average place for food. Cool little dive bar. Interesting pizza toppings (soul food with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and collard greens... yeah, don't know about that). Calzone was good. Decent beer selection. 
4149 4 Super authentic Japanese food! A little on the pricey side but its totally worth it! They've got some special sushis and sashimi is really fresh! Definitely a hidden gem! 
4150 3 It's been quite a while since I've visited Papi's but I remember having awesome food and an awesome drink! Parking is a bit insane but I would brave the parking a lot again for those black beans! 
4151 3 Located in the Atlanta Marriott Marquis hotel, high speed as the crowd never ends. Want food? Time it right. This is Starbuck's coffee. Salud! 
4152 3 Most amazing chicken pita I ever ate. In fact calling it a pita makes it seem in significant. The food was divine - absolutely fresh and delicious. I highly recommend their food. 
4153 4 Came here for a quick lunch with my husband, and we will be back! I had the chicken gyro, he had the regular. Both were very good and a good value. The service was fast and very friendly. Looking forward to exploring the menu a bit more! 
4154 3 Beer is good, solid stout & nice pale. Food is inventive, a little heavy on the Sriracha but good. Oh & growler fills are $10!! 
4155 2 The Cottonwood is mediocre. I ordered the Twice Stuffed Chicken and my boyfriend got the Seafood Gunpowder. Both were just ok; things I could make at home. The atmosphere was nice, but the food was too pricey for a mediocre meal. 
4156 1 Week business traveler. Will not stay again. Staff was nice and friendly. Hotel was outdated. My room was physically clean, but smelled old and moldy. If I wasn't so tired I would have found another hotel. 
4157 4 Great team. They took car of my car, were courteous and polite. They use a cool app instead of a valet ticket so you don't have to worry about losing it. 
4158 3 Chill spot. Lax atmosphere. It gets smokey... 
4159 4 I had my first mani-pedi here yesterday. I will definitely be a regular. The salon is very clean, wonderful massage chairs and a very nice staff. Be sure to ask for Kevin, he is wonderful! 
4160 4 Thank you so much for quickly accommodating my last minute request. Everyone was so incredibly friendly and helpful. Plus, they even offered us some dipped apples while we waited. Beautiful arrangements & friendly service. I'll be back for future gifts. 
4161 4 These guys are awesome - super knowledgeable and go above and beyond to get repairs done quickly. Prices are very fair. They also stock a good variety of parts/accessories/clothing and have been glad to order things for me when needed or make recommendations. 
4162 1 An hour and a half to deliver a salad and a slice of pizza. The pizza was ice cold and the salad was wilted. Maybe just an off day? Not very impressed. 
4163 3 They have walk in workshops and you can watch the workers make glass designs right in front of you! It really makes you appreciate their craft! 
4164 3 I love Red Robin every time I go. Always the same good burgers cooked right and some of the best fries in the business. 
4165 0 This used to be my favorite place for a sinfully delicious treat, sadly it's changed. The cherry bomb cupcake had strange colorless cherries with an odd texture within it. The frosting was greasy, salty and just not yummy in any way. I miss the old Tea and Cakes. 
4166 4 Loved this place. Great service and the food was dynamite. I had the corned beef hash and it was REAL corned beef. Whenever that happens, it's a five star review from me. Thanks for breakfast, ladies. It was a great experience. 
4167 3 First time here the staff was wonderful and the food was very well prepared and tasty. I am very particular about Italian restaurants and this one is very good. We will be back often I am sure. The only problem I see is they might need more room very quickly 
4168 0 I don't know how can anyone can rate this place more than a Zero? Most tasteless food EVER!! Ended up paying over $18.00 for this plate and a bottle of water. Highly NOT recommended 
4169 3 Imagine if P. Terry's grew up a bit and started making adult money. 
4170 4 My boyfriend and I came here for a date night and had the most wonderful experience. From start to finish it was flawless. Food and drinks were delicious and the service was outstanding. 
4171 0 Place used to be great, but after closing and reopening it hasn't been the same. Smaller portions, lower quality food ans service isn't the same. Unfortunately not a place i would recommend any more 
4172 3 Great little joint to grab a cold PBR and listen to a local band. Pretty dang fun place to chill at if you ask me. 
4173 4 Food was amazing! Atmosphere is very cool and clean The staff is really friendly. Loved it here! 
4174 4 Check out the new green sauce. Its has the same seasoning as the red, but if you are a green sauce fan, you will love it. You can take home a huge 32 ounce cup of it for $3. 
4175 3 We've been back a couple times since I wrote my first review. The dinner service is much better than the lunch was. Maybe I just caught them on the wrong day. Anyway, four stars for the dinner shift. 
4176 4 Excellent fish tacos!! My wife had the shrimp tacos and she really liked them. Awesome home made lemonade. The owner is very friendly and service is great. Very happy we found this hidden gem, it's at the back of a small strip mall right after the train tracks. 
4177 3 I've been getting my hair cut here for almost ten years, I'm not the type that has a fancy haircut, but these guys have always done a very good job and they use a straight razor on your neck when they are done. 
4178 4 '' Amazing... Quick service, knowledgeable staff and affordable priced. I would definitely recommend them. Also while waiting I enjoyed some complementary coffee and snacks. These guys rocked... 
4179 4 This place is amazing! The staff is great, friendly, and helpful. Burgers before 4pm M-Th are $8! I had the Alabama Yard Bird, the white BBQ sauce is fantastic! Will be back! 
4180 1 We ordered three donuts and when we opened the bag, one of them was the wrong kind. There has been so much build up and the donuts were pretty mediocre. They were all chewy except the cake kind. And all for quite a high price. 
4181 4 Great people and back patio. Quiet most of the time, just like I like it! 
4182 3 This was definitely an experience! A little pricey, but I get why. The show itself was really cool and impressive. You get to see so many different parts of Canada all in one trip. I'd definitely recommend for anyone visiting for Canada for the first time. 
4183 2 Had ¢59 pancakes today yummy it was great! It was Worth ¢59 they only let us get one short stack per person! I waitress was okay she could have been more friendly 
4184 1 Food is great but delivery is a nightmare. On two occasions my order has either not been delivered or taken close to two hours (I.e. They forgot the order until I called and complained.) If you are going to try Noor, go to the restaurant. 
4185 1 I don't recommend this mall. Too many cheap stores in here. I have two words for this place. "KEEP DRIVING". Yep, I have to admit. Camp Creek Marketplace is a GEM compared to this dump! 
4186 3 Beautiful decor, love the creativeness of the menu created by the chef. While the flavors fall a bit short of a homerun for me, it certainly is a place I recommend trying and finding your favorite. Some might complain about prices but it's fairly priced for the experience you're receiving. 
4187 0 Horrible service. I was sitting at my table for 15 minutes before my waiter showed up. Do not go to this restaurant. It is a waste of time and money. There are so many other restaurants that are 10 times better on south congress that would be a superior choice. 
4188 4 I'm not even a customer (although that is likely to change) and yet Austin, a teller here) remembered me by name after coming in a couple of weeks ago. He helped me with a smile and got me out quickly. Awesome service. 
4189 2 They got me there in once piece. So, by all accounts, I'd say A-ok. An extra packet of pretzels too!! THAT made it special. 
4190 4 Service was great, good was amazing, portions were huge! I had a fritay with goat, had so much food, and was delicious. Will come back again! 
4191 3 Got a cold brew (they use a Toddy) and it was delicious! Good ambience although slightly pricier than in used to. 
4192 1 Disappointed with the food but everything else was fine. Good staff, nice set up. I've been twice and the food just wasn't tasteful. I don't like writing negative reviews but it was disappointing. 
4193 4 I must try is there a lamb chop with their nicely done asparagus and their a hi tuna they're both delicious it was well done and I really like the prices here affordable 
4194 4 The best Mexican restaurant I ever try in Orlando! I love it specially la chimichangas de carne asada and the California burrito! 
4195 1 I went to play poker here and it was not a good spot. If you are not a regular the service is poor. The food is typical of a bar so nothing special. 
4196 4 My wife and I come here for a decent pint and no-frills dining after a shift. Love the noise. 
4197 4 The best Italian food ever. The bread you receive before the meal is out of this world! It is so soft with a crispy outside. All the items on the menu are great too, you can't go wrong here. 
4198 4 Good service and there is a ton of stuff to pickup at the last minute. Worked out great for our little girl's birthday. 
4199 4 Love, love, love. The jumbo shrimp and black & bleu savory options are favorites and dessert standards lemon & lavender, and strawberries & cream have us leaving the house more than we'd care to admit. All are simple yet flavorful and served with charm. 
4200 4 blown away by the vegan and vegi menu. Vegan miso, unique rolls and ultra friendly owner 
4201 4 Some of the nicest vets you'll ever met. They offer 24 hour emergency services (you have to call ahead), grooming, and ever run an animal shelter. I don't trust my pets to anyone else. 
4202 4 The food was super-awesome. I had the pulled duck sandwich, and it was heavenly. 
4203 4 The food was wonderful, but the best part of this location was the team. Pam and Delores were great. A few regulars came in for lunch and it was like they were coming home to family. Great, welcoming atmosphere. Great job! 
4204 3 The burgers are amazing, lots of interesting sides. The drinks are a bit on the pricey side but will definitely be back! 
4205 4 I like this a place a lot. It's a good cafe to work from when you feel the need to get out of the office. Available power plugs and good WiFi. The coffee and bagels are great. I do prefer it to Starbucks. Staff are always super friendly. 
4206 4 The food was delicious, I had the bacon and spinach skillet, BOMB. The staff is super nice and they have very nice art pieces for sale at very cheap prices. Will definitely return when back in town. 
4207 2 It's ok kind of pricey and not the best food. Been to several places around here and had wonderful food. For a lot cheaper. But a cool place in soco 
4208 4 Amazing service!!! I ordered nine springs rolls split between me and my mom. I had one of the hot curry dishes with tofu and vegetables delicious. I will definitely be back!!! 
4209 1 Service is excellent, chicken saag is very good, goat curry is horrible, lamb vindaloo is not good, meat platter is average, naan is good and the quantity of food per dish is disappointing according to price... 
4210 4 This is the best place ever they are great with the kids and staff are super friendly. I hate going to the gym I always feel uncomfortable but everyone is so nice 
4211 4 Jesus took care of us he did an amazing job at checking up on the table Freshly food 
4212 0 Never again will I ever step foot in this horrific institution that they call a hair salon. Rude and even Ruder customer service. 
4213 4 This is definitley a hole in the wall kinda restaurant. Authentic korean food serve by korean owners. They have a bento box and its not expensive at all. It comes with 3 to 4 dishes. Their spareribes kalbi is so good that my kids even loved it! 
4214 4 Really incredible cupcakes. Placed an order for 3 dozen for my daughters baby shower. They were delicious and beautiful. Everybody loved them. Best cupcakes in Columbus. Can't wait to order more 
4215 1 I used to love the roast beef from here but lately it has not been as good, hopefully they will overhaul the menu and add quality ingredients soon. At least better buns. 
4216 3 1st time here and the food was really great! Had the bruschetta which was wonderful, the house made bread was very tasty and our mains were both delicious. Service was prompt and friendly. Would go back. 
4217 0 Friendly staff but the skill set is not there and tend not to listen to the style you want 
4218 2 The food was okay and the service pretty good. I thought the menu was fairly expensive for what it was. I would go back. 
4219 1 Way overpriced, severely bland and every server seemed to actually be in pain having to provide service. Would not ever recommend except for their outside patio which is cool if you're already drunk and won't notice the service. 
4220 2 Great location...usually service is not too bad...food is consistently good but not over the top...not sure what it is about Milestones but they need some type of a boost from the kitchen to step it up a notch 
4221 0 Cashier is rude, service is worse, and burger sloppy. First time here & figured I'd try something new. Bad choice! 
4222 3 Awesome pizza and great beer list! My boyfriend and I hiked here in a blizzard for his birthday dinner and it was so worth it. 
4223 4 Last weekend I took my daughter to Sunday Brunch and the bloody mary was absolutely fantastic and the food was SO SO GOOD. The outdoor seating was a nice added bonus. The indoor aquarium is so nice! 
4224 4 I was surprised how much I liked this place.I have a lot of food allergies and the cashier helping me was really really informative and pretty much chose what I ordered. Great staff and surprisingly good food! 
4225 2 Overall nice and clean hotel. Construction is going on right outside and the rooms are small and the sounds carry. No bar. Good place to stay for a single person. 
4226 3 Can be crowded and slow on weekends, but the covered patio is a relaxing place to enjoy a local brew and great pub food. Their burger and fries is delicious! 
4227 1 Can't say I enjoyed this. The food was bland. The other customers were loud and obnoxious. The gin and tonic was pretty good though. I was relieved to leave though I found the staff very friendly indeed. 
4228 1 I have been a few times, and each time something has gone wrong. (Either they gave me the wrong part, or they couldn't fix the problem but another shop fixed it in a matter of minutes etc). I wouldn't recommend it. 
4229 4 We go to this mexican restaurant because the reviews where great so we walked in the door and the staff start greeting us and take care of us the way we where expecting and better I wanna be simple two thumbs ups for this restaurant 
4230 4 Great service.. Repairs and cleaning done in a timely manner. Very pleased with the work and am very impressed with the owners work ethic and attention to detail. Happy to recommend this establishment. 
4231 4 Authentic flavors, food portions are generous, I dare you to try and finish all your food. My favorite was the Tortilla soup it is amazing and can't get enough of it. 
4232 3 We tried Xinjiang stir-fried chicken and steamed soup dumplings. It is pretty good. The price is okay. But too many dishes are not available in the menu. 
4233 4 This place is is kinda loud. Seafood is good ( not excellent however the price point is awesome! There food is very good. And they are casual! This is the second time we've been here. I'll be back again! 
4234 0 Just sat here for 10 min after being seated with no service. No drinks no introduction nothing. The host seated us and gave us menus and we just sat. Decided to get up and leave. Won't be back. 
4235 1 Only good for lunch or if I am not paying. I like the RI calamari, but that's about it. I've never been impressed. The $6.95 clam roll down the street at Ma Magoo's is better than Jasper's (which is twice the price). 
4236 3 Old school place with great food, what's to go wrong. Def recommend if you looking for a great breakfast at a great price. 
4237 4 Fantastic food and service. Rainbow roll was amazing. Steak was delicious. Lava cake was the best I've had. Five stars! 
4238 4 I've only had the breakfast burrito and tacos. Both are excellent. I usually have them delivered when I'm at work. No complaints in my jurisdiction. 
4239 2 The sushi was surprisingly good and cheap. The menu features a lot of choices- for those who like raw, and for those who don't. Their seaweed salad is also a good deal- a big portion of two kinds of seaweed. Best to take it out because there's not much seating. 
4240 3 Update: Had their margaritas. Holy jeebus, it is amazing. From now on, definitely getting guac and margaritas from now on! 
4241 4 Extremely helpful! I took in my wedding dress that another alterations place had messed up and they made me feel very confident that everything would be okay in a short amount of time. 
4242 4 I Found this location on yelp and was very pleased with my experience , the food came out fast and was delicious , good service and had a great nostalgic vibe 
4243 3 I liked this place. Very chill attitude. Awesome beer selection and very tasty burgers. 
4244 2 Nothing all that special about this place. They made a nice burger and had some good collard greens. A quick place that offers a decent amount of choices that vary more than you might assume with a place called Farm Burger. 
4245 4 Super friendly and helpful staff! Tasty sushi every time. Best affordable sushi place in the Hillsboro Beaverton area! 
4246 4 The best menudo I've found in this area!!!! The Carne Guisada was awesome too! Good size portions for a great price!! 
4247 0 Rude server. Not baby friendly restaurant. I do not recommend this restaurant if you have a baby less then 2 years old. They are not accommodating. Food is average nothing special. 
4248 4 The best breakfast spot to get French toast and scrambled eggs with cheese, yummy and they only accept cash but there's a few bank around to withdraw...the staff is the friendliest but the food is great. 
4249 4 Very good pizza by the slice.. Loved the veggie margarita and cheese pizzas a lot.. Friendly staff to the hilt... 
4250 4 Great place to get your car worked on. See Nick j. He's the best! 
4251 4 I enjoy this place for the proximity to my house, drinks, and general shenanigans. I need to come for a yoga or comedy night situation. 
4252 1 I never post but had to share so that others didn't make the same mistake. Got a flank steak Bao. Steak was cold and inedible. Many delicious places in china town that you should try instead 
4253 4 Been here many mornings for their cheap breakfast tacos. They are glorious, cheap, filling and make sure you get the mole with them. You will not regret it. 
4254 4 I love this place. The Buckeye protein shake and turkey avocado sandwich are my favorite things on the menu. 
4255 1 I agree with Will P. (other reviewer), the cake was very sweet, low on flavor. Depends on what you like, I guess. 
4256 3 Good pizza my friends. And fairly cheap. If you're standing in front of BHOP for some reason, walk down Huntington to Mass Ave., take a right and walk to the corner of Columbus. 
4257 1 Food was excellent but we had to wait over 20 minutes for chicken tenders. The rest of us were well through our meals before my son went back to the counter to get them. 
4258 2 Halal meat right next to the T entrance is a gift (I barely have to be outside when it's negative 20 F in Boston). Other than that, the quality is average and prices decent. 
4259 2 Second time here. Won't return. Mediocre food at high prices. Salmon was badly undercooked and had no flavor. The veal meatloaf was very salty. Better restaurants around. 
4260 0 Did not do the buffet, ordered dishes instead. Food was very bad, not authentic chinese taste at all. Always seems to be very empty 
4261 1 the food was good but my husband and myself were not feeling well after we ate i needed to send my hamberget back becuse it was not cooked all the way 
4262 4 Erika was amazing! After months of trying to find a place on my own, she swooped right in and helped me find the perfect home in a couple of weeks! I couldn't be more excited or grateful! thanks Erika! 
4263 4 Three words: vegan breakfast burrito. Really cool bar with a super unique set up and ridiculously yummy vegan food! 
4264 4 This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Boston. Actually, my favorite restaurant in Boston altogether. This place is legit. 
4265 2 usually the last spot of the night, but always a good time. friendly waitstaff, good prices, karaoke (!) and fun crowd. always important, they have clean bathrooms -- but beware the hand dryers...they *could* blow your skin right off. 
4266 4 Really good team. Cesar and his crew did great work and answered any questions or concerns i may have had. Highly recommend these guys for your flooring needs. 
4267 4 Sooo good!!! Everything was great and the service was amazing. Kaitriana (spelling? Maybe kiatriana? Katrinia) anyway she's literally the sweetest best most genuine server I've ever encountered. Wonderful food!!! 
4268 4 Great meal. The orange chicken was miles away from "the usual". Great presentation, too. The Tom Kar Gai was some of the best I've had. Very fresh ingredients. Great service too. 
4269 3 Good stop for brunch. The hot sauce on the table is Delish. Love the patio during summer. 
4270 4 Elite was so easy to work with. We recently used them to stage two properties and everything went beautifully. Both properties has offers very quickly and I attribute a large part of the low days on market to how well the furniture and artwork made them look. 
4271 4 Clean new fish market. Good stuff. Stopped by after a trip to Whole foods and prices seemed cheaper than whole foods plus they have lobsters which nobody else has around for some reason. 
4272 4 It's a Walgreens that is well stocked well staffed easy to access and clean not a whole lot to review other than that you can get your drugs here, you can get your supplies here, they have snacks. 
4273 3 Never had this before, really good food- kinda back alley looking though. Saw a drug deal out the window. Lmao FOOD IS REALLY GOOD. 
4274 2 The staff is always super nice and helpful. The food is well seasoned and spiced. We always enjoy our visit here :) 
4275 4 Dan and his crew (Carlos and Oscar) were incredibly professional and skilled. I enjoyed working with them. They provided a free estimate, comfortable quote, timely services, follow-ups and touch ups. They were respectful of our space and I felt comfortable with them in our home. I would highly recommend them. 
4276 4 Austin Mail Express offers top notch, white-glove, personalized, red-carpet service! Greg should be training companies on customer service! 
4277 2 I don't quite get it. Everything I've had has been unexceptional. Head down the road to Thailand Cafe for their (surprising) Sichuan menu. 
4278 3 We really enjoyed our delivery order from Rice Bowl Cafe. Ordered it online and received it within 35/40 minutes. Where we are located, delivery is a bit tough to receive even though we are still in Austin. We were very happy to have found them whilst visiting. 
4279 4 Had the chicken fingers with Mac, fries, and dirty rice. The fingers were very large, the sides were divine. The fries are curly like the name. Dirty Rice was made from scratch and also great. There's a wait, but its worth it. 
4280 4 Good atmosphere, staff, and best of all food. Lots of options. We will be back! We ordered their Grilled Romain Salad, burgers and fries, and soup of the day. 
4281 4 This place is AWESOME! Any topping you could possibly want made it SO hard to choose! Fresh fruit? Cereal? Mochi? M&M's? Cookie Dough? What??? Can't wait to go back and try another concoction! 
4282 3 Paneer tika masala is sooooo damn good especially with garlic naan. I love the crispy bread and sauces they serve while you wait. Cocktails are a bit pricey but creative. 
4283 4 Amazing food, cozy atmosphere, great music, attentive servers. The chefs are geniuses. Highly recommend it! 
4284 4 Our go-to Mexican restaurant. Food is ALWAYS good. Drinks are ALWAYS good. Get the queso. Ask for a Mexican martini with the jalapeño infused tequila. No complaints. Ever. 
4285 4 Best place for meats! The bacon and chorizo are amazing! They occasionally have a blended ground meat (beef like) - I could eat this everyday, it's so good! The young guy that is always working is so helpful and fun to talk to! Glad they are in Edgewood/Kirkwood! 
4286 4 One of my all time favorite food carts, even before "food-carting" was popular. I was pleased to see Fuego at the Mississippi street fair!!! 
4287 3 Good food and service. Thank you! 
4288 4 Get a bear claw! And pumpkin pancakes. Great service and always large portions of good food! 
4289 4 Mario's is THE GREATEST! He knows what to do with my mass of curls! Expert coloring stylists, great service, wicked friendly staff, reasonable prices. I love this place! Highly recommended. 
4290 1 So much for my tuna burger. IT has started to suck now. I couldn't eat beyond two bites. Highly sad and disappointed! I loved this place. 
4291 4 Great and affordable donuts in a variety of flavors. Blue Star is a fantastic alternative to Voodoo, without the long wait. The staff are incredibly nice as well. 
4292 3 Bottles, cans and taps oh my! I love me some beer, and this is a frequently visited spot for my wife and I. Haven't tried the food, doesn't look to appetizing. But the beer, dear god the beer, is amazing. Beer! 
4293 4 Excellent service, neat atmosphere & tasty treats! 
4294 4 Went to this restaurant a couple of weeks ago. It was a quite place in Natick downtown. My food was tasty and great quantity. I could eat it for two meals. I would recommend people to go here. They have good amount of parking space. Not very pricy place. 
4295 4 This place is pretty great. Whatever service problems they had from previous reviews must have been fixed. The service was great. Very friendly. The food, "el Diablo" especially was amazing. The mezcal was great too. Love being able to sample smaller amounts. 
4296 0 NEVER GET IT DELIVERED!! Only good when you Dine-in ..food is completely different! 
4297 3 Loved the atmosphere, decor, service and food. The only reason I'm not giving five stars was the time it took to get our desserts, but they did comp them for us. Otherwise, a great experience. 
4298 4 Great burgers at a great price. I had the black bean veggie burger. Apparently their milkshakes are amazing (Nutella pretzel?) so I'll be going back for sure! 
4299 2 Huge portions of tasty Mexican food. We tried the shrimp tacos, wahoo tacos, and chicken enchiladas. All of them were great! My only gripe is the beer selection--if you're going to offer beer and you're in Boulder, you've got to have some local ones! 
4300 1 I wasn't impressed, and have fun nearly getting smacked in the head by trays of Chinese food whizzing inches away. Dated interior and typical Central Sq jackoff clientele. No thanks. 
4301 4 The only rental company that hires college grads. They have an incredible training program. Every employee I have ever encountered is polite, upbeat, and most of all knowledgeable. 
4302 4 Such a great nice dinner or lunch for dining plan!!! Chris our server was by far the best server we've ever had at the parks (been coming for over 10 years now). Unique food, 10/10 
4303 4 Did take out. But if a wait but worth it. Okra and fried pickles. But the chicken is great 
4304 3 Will def be coming back here. Great for a saturday lunch and excellent service and food 
4305 4 What a great place for breakfast or lunch. Its best to come later in the morning to avoid long lines. Service and food is really good. Would definitely be back. 
4306 4 Pleasantly surprised by how good this place is. Went in expecting very little since its in the Barton Springs mall, but this has become our go-to sushi restaurant in Austin. The nigiri is on par with anywhere in the city. 
4307 0 The guy told me a lens was $1599 and looked online at Canon itself selling it for $949. Definitely don't shop here!!! 
4308 3 Casual atmosphere. Great for kids. Quick service for our party of 8. I had the grilled swordfish dinner and it was fantastic. Will definitely be going back. 
4309 3 Perfect for drinks - been there a few times and absolutely adored the scene and service. The orchiette was divine - and the drink selection is good. Perfect for a girls night out! 
4310 2 Soup is not hot, soup base is not rich enough (could have been better) Price was reasonable. Staffs are friendly. Environment is casual. It's a good restaurant for quick lunch. 
4311 3 I would definitely re-visit this place. I had 3 tacos and plantains. I will skip the plantains next time. Tacos were tasty. 1 chicken, 1 pork carnitas, 1 steak (carne asada?). Jarritos guava soda to top it off. Delish. 
4312 4 My favorite growler fill station! The selection and service are top notch. A couple of blocks from my house, too. I hear they are trying to provide an area outdoors for summertime sipping - excellent! 
4313 4 My wife and I go here almost every week. Great pizza and have to get the crispy brussels sprouts appetizer every time. 
4314 2 Fair for American-Asian taste. Quantity is not enough for an adult. If you want to try small quantities would be fine. Won't try again though 
4315 4 Such a great place. Chicken is on point. I lived in Korea for a few months and this is the close I've come to the authenticity of Korean Fried Chicken. The owners are also really nice people. 
4316 3 My friend and I went here for the first time a couple weeks ago for brunch, she got the catch 122 and I got the madam croque, The service was okay... Our server seemed uninterested and not really friendly but the food was very delicious all brunch items are $12 
4317 3 my fav place to get banh mi in Chinatown! cheap and fresh and delicious! $3-4 for a whole yummy sandwich. u can ask for spicy, less lard (!?), they're v quick and reasonable. small place but good sandwiches. love. 
4318 4 Tasty and unique beverages, animal friendly and grey casual outdoor atmosphere! Plus the Italian food truck in the yard knocks it out of the park! Quintessential casual and quirky Austin. 
4319 4 Very recommended good food, good service and you get your food very quick with smile I eat in many places nothing not compare to this restaurant I will very happy to back again 
4320 3 Thinking about their chicken and paneer korma makes me all happy inside. A must are the mussels with naan. I would probably lick the plate clean if no one was watching. Actually, I would probably lick the plate clean even if people were watching. 
4321 3 Good service sometimes. Lots of value for $20 bucks. Some of the meatballs and meat didn't seem as fresh as they should be for a place serving raw food. All in all its a bargain shabu place. 
4322 4 Dude this place is totally legit! It brings a new life to airport food. Beverages aside the food is fabulous. She had the BLT, I had the duck sandwich, both were off the charts good. 
4323 0 I used to go here all the time as a kid. I used to drive up to the back window and order reasonably priced rock shrimp. This place is now an over priced tourist trap. No thanks. 
4324 1 Decent burger. Thinly shaved red onion, cheese and two patties Pickles as well. Had this small burger not cost $12 I would have given an extra star. $12 for one small burger-no fries or drink is just crazy. 
4325 4 Everything; drinks, food, atmosphere, music, service. It's all fantastic. Do yourself a favor and try their specialty bellini. The seafood is always excellent, as is the wine list. Great place to start the evening off with a drink. 
4326 4 We had a blast. The food is great. The wine delicious. We had a family reunion on the private section and the service provided was awesome. The staff is very profesional and will return soon. 
4327 2 If HEB tried to do Gourdough's you'd get Voodoo. 
4328 2 I found the burger nice and tasty but I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's certainly not something I'd wait in line for. I've driven by and seen long lines often. Congrats. 
4329 4 Without a doubt, the best place in Atlanta for breakfast food, and atlanta knows it. If you try to get a table on Sunday, the wait time could be in excess of 1 hour. 
4330 4 I ordered creame corn, green beans, peach cobbler, potato salad, brisket and beef ribs. I like the beef ribs and green beans. The flavor was really good. Nice place to come back. 
4331 4 Beautiful and delicious sweets!! Almost too pretty to eat. I only wish they had a larger patio area. There wasn't any room to sit so we took it to go. 
4332 3 Great place to get a nice salad or sandwich. If you are in a hurry, this is a good choice and the food is healthy and tasty. Friendly staff and nice soups. 
4333 4 Best service/hospitality in Austin! Leonard is fabulous! You have to try the PIZZA! So delicious! The calamari is also amazing to start off with along with the house bread and olive oil :D 
4334 0 This place is at best badly managed, at worst running a scam. Pre charged me for extra services, didn't do them and now I'm left chasing them for a refund / disputing charges with my credit card. Fast Park across the freeway has far superior customer service. 
4335 0 We had these guys cater as part of Fooda. It was the saltiest worst food I ever ate, made me embarrassed to have brought friends to try Indo chinese. Never again 
4336 4 I used them clean the windows of a very picky customer of mine last week. Did a great job! Showed up on time and finished quickly! 
4337 4 Super friendly family owned restaurant. Smoked chickens are amazingly juicy and flavorful. Not expensive great to feed the whole family. Burritos and tacos mucho popular here, can't go wrong whole MENU has hitters 
4338 4 Great food, ample portions and reasonable prices. Highly recommended when you're in the mood for fried food. Yum! 
4339 4 My SO and I were hankering for a gooey comforting cheese steak and that's exactly what we got here. We both ordered the original, regular size, and it filled us up. Our sandwiches and fries were all made to order- hot, crispy, melty as appropriate. Will come back! 
4340 0 This KFc is the wirst. They would not let me pay for extra cheese. How stupid. I was told there's no button on the register. I even spoke to the manager Marco. I wont spend my money at this KFC ever again. Just plain rude. 
4341 3 So happy to see this place open. Hector the chef owner is such a great guy. The food is authentic and good. It has such vibes unlike anywhere else in the battery. We are very excited to see them open near us by tech square as well! 
4342 3 Friendly staff. They are able to keep the line moving when the going gets busy. I like when the barista remembers my order... they are good about doing that at this location. 
4343 2 Not a place I would frequent. The food was not that good. Mediocre fare that seemed bland to me. It is an OK stop if you need somewhere to eat. 
4344 4 Went in here the other day to work. I'm so glad I found this place. Awesome, quaint environment. Awesome for a nice, relaxing lunch or coffee 
4345 4 Amazing food, amazing service every time!!! You won't find yourself waiting for a long time for your food or seat because of the efficient concept of this place!! 
4346 4 Took my dad and his wife for a day kayaking this place was fantastic had a great time! I highly recommend and if you have never been kayaking staff is very helpful. 
4347 4 Food is always great been eating here for years never disappointed!!!! I tried just about everything. Yum yum!!! 
4348 2 Had dinner delivered. Tom Ga soup, clearwrap spring rolls and Pad Thai. All food was decent, not great, but good enough if you have a hankering for Thai. Portions are very large! 
4349 3 Cute little pub with nice servers and good ambiance. Drinks came out a little slow, but it was a Friday night and they were quite busy. The decor is super cute, very library/cabin like. Cocktails were very nice and smooth and the servers were nice. 
4350 3 This place is my go-to when I'm craving shrimp!!! The seasoning and sauce is amazing not to mention the tasty green mussels. No need for forks here folks!! Just throw your bib on and get ready to get messy. Well worth it!! 
4351 4 Tried the red velvet tonight and it was very good. It was actually satisfying, and not overly sweet. Definitely check this truck out! 
4352 4 Great place!! Love the beer, food, and great people!! Owners are always around making jokes and doing whatever they can to make you feel comfortable! Will always come back!! 
4353 4 Great place to hangout, great decoration,several games, the view is very nice, beers, snacks, food, bring money to spend. 
4354 4 I adore this cute store! Lots of fun extras and the people are SO nice! I usually go for the white chocolate raspberry but got pecan praline today and it was amazing. Whichever you choose, they are always fresh and moist and the frosting is the best. 
4355 4 Just had a great night here. The food was outstanding, only topped by the friendly staff. I will definitely be back! 
4356 2 Interesting selection, you can get bits of hot dog on a roll with scallions, custard buns, minced meat (asian style), taro, raisin..etc. My favorite use to be the corn&egg salad in a bun, but the last time I had it, there were barely any corn in there. 
4357 4 Tasty sausage with great potatoes. Definitely have fo try their dessert - chocolate cake 
4358 3 I found this place by accident, but their food is delicious. The people are always friendly. I usually load up on the veggies and the meat- the plate is by the pound (down with carbs). I have never eaten in, as the sitting area is very small. Great place! 
4359 4 The best spaetzle in the southeast. No question! Come for the food, stay for the dinner show. It's Octoberfest whenever you want! If you dig the German beer, be sure to bring a designated driver! 
4360 4 Remind us of Europe. Very clean with friendly staff. When you walk in the front door you are met with a greeting and a view of their gourmet pastries you need a napkin so you won't drool on yourself. The lunch specials won't break you and were very good! 
4361 3 Nice portions, GF crepe options, decent wine, lovely dessert - and vegetarian French Onion Soup. Yay! Not a TON of vegetarian options for savory crepes, but what I had was lovely and generously packed with cheese. Looking forward to returning and trying breakfast 
4362 4 Great place, like $7 for a tasty breakfast burrito + some coffee. Can you really turn that down? Reaaaaaaaaly??? 
4363 4 Calling all Non pork eaters! Great beef pepperoni pizza. If you don't eat pork, it's great because it's all beef! You just put it in your mouth and it tastes so good 
4364 2 I'm a design student so I come here alot for fabrics and such. The store is very well organized and they have quite a few things. The prices are not that great though. 
4365 4 Great food and excellent service! Prices are fair and steaks are amazing!! My daughter loves the peanuts! 
4366 4 Amaaazing. Their pressed-to-order tortillas are SO GOOD and the False Pastor is my new addiction. They also have their own hot sauce to douse your delicious taco with just to take it to the next level. You will not be disappointed, can't wait for them to open their 2nd location! 
4367 2 Pizza was kinda meh. I've had much worse but I've also had much better Don't think I would give this place a second try based on this experience. 
4368 4 If you like to splurge on a fancy date night, this is absolutely the place. Incredible food, professional waitstaff, diverse menu, and the oysters are fantastic. 
4369 4 I had the Bistec Con Pamillo with tostones and it was delicious and my son had a ham and cheese with fries and really enjoyed it. We highly reccomend trying ZaZa's! Also the Quesitos are delicious!!!!!!! 
4370 4 Spoke with both the Salem Nh store and Saugus. Both locations worked together to get my truck done fast and easy! Great price, I will return soon to have tonneau cover installed! 
4371 1 Canned olives and flat flavor for everything else. I did like the crust, but the toppings weren't worth the price. When I can taste metal in the olives, something is wrong. They use canned ingredients. Massively disappointing. 
4372 0 The customer service at this place is so poor. They change their hours at will without posting them, so when you walk in a good thirty minutes before the business closing time printed on their door they can turn you away. It's a shame for them, losing money and business 
4373 4 I love my nails! Jenny is awesome!!!! She listened to what I needed and what I wanted. I got a manicure and gel color. I will definitely be returning to TD Nails! 
4374 1 Burnt americano, dry muffin, light piano music like a delta hotel lobby but without the wifi. Thankfully the staff was friendly. 
4375 2 Let me start off by saying the chowmein was absolutely delicious. Why am I giving Hot Plate only three stars? Because everything else was greasy and mediocre. The three people who ordered various dishes ended up fighting over the chow mein and the fried food was eventually thrown away. 
4376 3 Had a good time here. Roberto was awesome, very knowledgeable, and always had great recommendations. Definitely plan on coming back! 
4377 3 Delicious brisket and pulled pork. The fried okra is wonderful! This is a great spot for late night. 
4378 0 The beer was good. I had a Caesar. It was wilted. I had the pork. It was fatty and flavorless. I tried the burger. It was grey. Enough said. 
4379 4 The food was delicious and the service was great!! I'll definitely be checking it out again a time or 2 before leaving Boston! =) 
4380 1 Unfortunately you have to ask the owner/cook to wear gloves when cooking. I have been here numerous times and they have yet to improve there sanitary practices. So needless to say I am again in search for a Philly cheesesteak spot near my home... 
4381 2 Just another Asian buffet. The hibachi could use a little more flavor but they had fresh seafood and they kept bringing fresh food out. You get your $11.99 worth with just the seafood. 
4382 2 Pretty good dim sum. Huge rooms as noted Service is fairly impersonal. If you're staying downtown this may be one of the better bets for dim sum unless you want to go to Richmond. 
4383 4 Wonderful food. I think this was the best french toast I've ever had (the Brioche French Toast). The fruit (came with blackberries), and all of the rest of the food was incredibly fresh. And great/friendly service too. 
4384 4 Love love LOVE this place! Must get their white pizza with extra tomatoes & extra ricotta... It is amazing! Even if you order anything else you have to get their garlic knots.... Also amazing. Never had bad service either. 
4385 1 I cannot recommend this place. Scrambled Eggs were powdered, hashbrown are cheap pre-pressed patties. Nothing is made fresh except my BFs easy over eggs (he enjoyed them). No decaf coffee. Very little seating. No table service. All this mediocre food came at a high price of almost $30 for two. 
4386 0 Walmart used Newgistics for shipping their online sale to us. Very poor packing practices, basically crushing product with no concern for our needs. 
4387 0 Ordered meal delivered at 7pm on a Monday night, it arrived at 9:45pm, after being told twice it was out for delivery. No email listed on website and person who kept answering phone was clueless. 
4388 3 I can't speak for much here because I don't like Thai food (mostly the curries and coconut) but I had the pad thai here and it was AMAZING. I'm telling you, it was fantastic. 
4389 0 If I could give 0 stars I would. Their express wash is an absolute joke. Wasted every penny spent there. Poorly washed, poorly dried, minimal effort on the staffs part. I'll never return. 
4390 0 The first room they gave us was already occupied by other guests. The second room's carpeting was soaking wet and they wouldn't give us another room. Plus the bar across the street played loud live music until 2 am 
4391 4 Great service! (young bartender from Nepal was amazing). Love the sushi and drinks selection. A+ 
4392 3 Had the Lamb Shank with yellow basmati rice, it was great. The meat was cooked perfectly and rice was delicious. 
4393 4 Very friendly helpful staff. Very clean property & room. Also it's very close to lots of restaurants and other conveniences. 
4394 4 Food was excellent. They actually use real feta. Definitely will be back. I think they could have actually charged more than they did. I can't wait to go there again. 
4395 3 We tried the Mango & Cheese and Green Tea Toast. Mango was okay but this green tea though 
4396 3 They were efficient and thorough, especially vacuuming the dog hair from the carpets. We are very happy. 
4397 3 I work in Peachtree Center and am all too familiar with the "mall" food options. Tumeric was a welcome addition. I am a vegetarian and the variety of well-seasoned dishes at Tumeric never disappoints. 
4398 4 This is a fantastic Salon. Dolly is amazing... This facility is clean and welcoming... They have a very large menu to accommodate any needs... They have a wide range of hours to allow flexibility.... I love it here. 
4399 4 We just ate there. everything was tasty. We got stir fry and sushi. Super man roll was my favorite. Totally deserve 5 stars. 
4400 4 Thanks to Yelp reviews we stopped into this little pizza place. We had the sausage pizza and Emilia sandwich. Killer..... both were delicious. The local beers and wine top off your meal If ever in Salem - Bambolina's is a must try. We will be back for sure 
4401 2 This is a good restaurant with a lively atmosphere. The servers were friendly and nice. The food was pretty good - the best part was the shake! Caramel sea salt is the best!! 
4402 1 Store is very nice and clean and overall very efficient. My two star rating is because the manager is a robot and needs to be more personable. 
4403 3 My favorite Cuban restaurant in Atlanta. I always opt for the special rice platters, which is usually some type of meat accompanied by rice, black beans, and sweet plantains (maduros?). The waiters are very friendly and punctual. I feel like I'm in Miami everytime I stop by here. 
4404 0 Crappy place. Draft beer means Bud light. Sllooowwwwww service. Blah blah blah. Cramped pack with 2 person tables. No elbow room. Big line at the bar. 
4405 4 OMG- check my pictures to see what they did to her for their "Christmas Surprise"- hysterical! I didn't even try the antlers this year- thought there was no way she'd put up with it, and they got her in the antlers and the jingle collar and the jacket. So funny! 
4406 4 My bf and I were visiting downtown Boulder and wanting a different dining experience than offered near the mall. The dining experience was top notch with reasonable prices. They offer very flavorful dishes and has something for everyone. Tip: Come on your birthday and be treated to a divine dessert 
4407 4 Authentic Chinese foods! Lovely lady helped us( i think she might have been the owner...). Tired a few different kinds of fried rice, so far it's been a success everytime :) strongly recommend! 
4408 4 A great take-out/eat-in/catering option for high-quality greek classics like lamb chops, souvlaki, pizza, etc. George and Chrysti are wonderful hosts, and bring old-world charm to their enterprise. I would recommend Argo for casual dine-in of groups less than four but not larger groups, and not for formal occasions. 
4409 2 Came in expecting...... well noodles, but like an asian noodle house. This is basically just fast food thrown into a bowl with noodles. Definitely nothing special..... 
4410 4 I have always been promptly accommodated by all the staff at Viet Nails. They are very kind and professional. Everyone who comes here seems to return as you can't beat the prices either!! 
4411 4 I just love this place. I've been here often and have never been disappointed. The food is delicious and you get a nice serving for the price. It's a bit cozy in there, but that adds to the charm. 
4412 4 Ok the skee ball is not broken and is still free yay!!!! Just make sure to get tokens from the bartender. 
4413 3 Great prices and clean... Did the trick for what I needed. No complaints and if I remember correctly it was the cheapest in town. Price did go up in the year I was there but I suppose that is expected? 
4414 4 I have had great luck with this Credit Union. Very helpful customer service 
4415 4 Great breakfast tacos! I found my new morning stop on my way to work great tacos at a great price, what more could you ask for? 
4416 4 Max & Dylan's is one of my go to places. Menu items I recommend: Ahi Tuna salad, Mac & Cheese, Clam Chowder. Sooo good the staff is friendly and the drinks are amazing. 
4417 4 Great attitude, hardworking, and did a great job cleaning my suit. She's been around Mission Hill for decades. What's not to like? 
4418 4 Really affordable drinks and snacks Their "cheesecake" flavors are interesting, there's a ton of ice cream choices too 
4419 4 Very good beer especially the porter and stout. Staff is very friendly, the brewery in Boulder I prefer to go to whenever I'm up there. One of Boulder's best kept secrets 
4420 4 Dr Lopez was all business and very thorough. He took extra time with my visit. Thomas was really patient and explained many times the choices and billing. He worked hard to make our visit right. 
4421 4 I've only been on Friday nights with the Mariachi band. Excellent experience. You have to come. 
4422 4 Solid antipasti and fresh pasta. Huge portions so be ready to eat! The spaghetti with toasted garlic and olive oil is so simple but well executed. Also love the ambience, very nice mood lighting. A great south end staple. 
4423 3 The food is ok... but the drinks are the best i've ever had in my entire life... Soooo yummy! Love it! 
4424 3 Fish sauce wings are good but (to me) not better than another Portland mainstay. I was very happy with the luc lac. The service was prompt and the ambiance very casual. I will definitely be coming back. 
4425 4 Great atmosphere and food comes out fast! I really recommend the prime time burger and truffle Fries. The portions are really generous and everything is either organic or locally sourced. You can't beat that!!! 
4426 3 I'm inlove with the chicken wings at this place , amazing sauces , great appetizers and fun times :) always crowded on game days but service is always good .. 
4427 3 After driving around aimlessly trying to find a place to eat, we decided that this place looked good.. I had the clam with pasta , that was amazing They have a great happy hour.. Downside they charge for bread at the table.. But I would recommend 
4428 4 I haven't been to a US coffeeshop like this before. Tiny, standing room only, and magnificent. I wish I'd made it here long before now, but I'll be back. 
4429 4 delectable food and inviting, quirky, homey atmosphere! i love fat city and have grown up going there! the breakfast is to die for and the lunch is delicious!! definitely a place to go if you have a stomach and a heart! 
4430 4 Sooooooooooooooo GOOD! Hit all the right spots on a rainy week night. Will definitely be back! 
4431 4 Happy Hour Love it! The food is great, inexpensive with great selections. Plus, the great river view! 
4432 4 Great restaurant. Often quiet. Worth trying! Their deviled eggs are delicious and they do have a kids menu just have to ask! Great burgers too. Cozy bar 
4433 4 If you live in the South End, this is your place to get coffee. Unique, friendly staff and amazing coffee. What a treat for those that live around the area. 
4434 0 Update: I have called to speak to the district manager at least 4 times and have yet to get a call back. Then they decided to turn me over to collections. Save your money and go to a dental office that knows how to respect their patients. 
4435 4 Cannot recommend high enough. Dave (the owner) and Patrick (designer) put together several beautiful arrangements for catered dinner/ 40th birthday party that I threw for my wife. Two tables and one large centerpiece on console table. Everybody was impressed. Arrived on time and on agreed upon budget. 
4436 4 Try anything and you'll love it. They pack so much flavor into every dish. And the bartenders make an awesome Bloody Mary. You must go! 
4437 4 If you plan on doing your wedding registry here, ask for Mary! She was awesome, helpful, and made the whole process fun! 
4438 4 This place is amazing. I love the food and the staff, everybody is so nice especially the owner. The food is fresh and very good qualify. 
4439 2 Generous portions, a great variety of dosa options, and Indian sweets. It is a straightforward back of a grocery store, eat your chicken tikka dosa in a booth experience. 
4440 1 Too much anxiety for one shopping center. Although, pink berry ta die for. We weren't exactly sure if we were still even in the right area at some point. Too much pressure. I bought a Vera caddy tho.... Love it! 
4441 4 The best pizza around Debary/Deltona/Orange city area If only they weren't closed Sunday and Monday 
4442 3 This is a quick and friendly place. They are always very attentive and I've never had to stand in line very long to check out. 
4443 3 This is a funky record store that has gone a little too corporate. Once they only had a few locations, now they are quite the chain. Still they maintain an alternative independent feel. They have a good selection of music, posters, stickers, and funny nic nacks. 
4444 2 open late, did the job nicely. order from the window, eat sitting on the curb! not the best pizza i've ever had, but much better than the food truck pizza i had across town. 
4445 0 Wow. This place has changed since they moved from west broadway. Now terrible service, terrible food. Terrible everything. Almost like they didn't care. Also out f lot of stuff. Completely dead. West broadway location used to be packed. 
4446 4 Finally I purchased my nespresso machine.., I can't be more pleased... The espresso is delicious!! No more standing in stressful Starbucks lines!! Ruby at bloomies in chestnut hill is knowledgable and most helpful with everything!! Thanks to her I made the decision to finally buy!! I highly recommend to all! 
4447 3 awesome!! they were very helpful! it was our first visit and our first time buying skates. We LOVE the sweet, loving mew-mew too!! We will most def be shopping there more! I can't give 5 stars because the shop is very tiny and crowded and uncomfortable. 
4448 3 Under new ownership [well, since September of 2011], by the people who own Gold Dust Meridian on Hawthorne. Dive bar at it's finest. Live bands [great acoustics in the building], cheap ass beer, nice patio. See this" http://endhits.portlandmercury.com/endhits/archives/2011/09/12/club-21s-grand-reopening 
4449 4 We went there for lunch and had the special. Great tasting food and had enough left over for dinner. The waitress was very entertaining as well! 
4450 4 Excellent service. Michael was amazing and made our transaction easy, was very knowledgeable and helpful. 
4451 4 The mulled apple cider and tisane crimson berry is very good. The meringue and chocolate silk pie also divine. First time here and very good and cozy place to have snack and warm drink with friends and family. Will visit again. 
4452 4 D'Lites is literally my favorite frozen yogurt space in Austin. It is extremely health and delish!! The staff is very nice and helpful. Everyone should try this place! 
4453 4 Great stop for some fresh and authentic food. The Colombian empanadas were great and the accompanying salsa was fresh and delicious. I wish I had more time in Orlando to work my way through their sandwich varieties. 
4454 3 Fun for the kids! We love going out for apple picking and then shopping for baked goods. Their snicker doodle cookies are addicting! 
4455 3 Great intimate venue to see your favorite band play. I saw Sloan here (who i wasn't really into), but I can see how it's a fun place, and a staple of the local live music community. 
4456 4 Came here again with 2 co workers. We have a awesome time with excellent service. James, Hakim and a new employee Barbara were at the con and Maria managing the counter. We had our expectations met with no problems. Great work guys, thanks. 
4457 4 Chanel Roll, Rolls Royce, Burger appetizer, and the yellowtail shots. Youre welcome 
4458 4 One of my favorite places for a special occasion. You can be adventurous or can keep it pretty familiar- my children very happily eat here with me! 
4459 1 Don't come here. None of our food came out right after it came out room temperature. Fixing the problem took over 15 minutes. I've been here several times hoping for a better experience and continually am let down. 
4460 4 I really like this place. But I haven't been here in months because of this one guest who always comes in and gets blacked out. He has slicked-back hair and always talks about how hes a member at this country club. I bet he sucks at golf. And life. 
4461 4 The pizza was absolutely delicious! We stumbled on this place while driving through and ordered a couple of slices to go. Great atmosphere, decent prices and overall good quality pizza. 
4462 3 Tomatillos is a fantastic neighborhood restaurant with great people. The food is yummy and the drinks are always terrific! If you appreciate local businesses, you'll love the great value and amazing food here. SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS YA'LL!! 
4463 2 Try their shake... Tasted like chocolate milk nothing good. Service wasn't that great. They came twice only to change the coal and been here 2 hours. She went to check up on 3 different groups and skipped us twice. Order water and never came. 
4464 4 Really enjoyed it. The pizza was good, friendly staff. It was a really nice spot, not overly complicated with junk on the walls. Lots of neighborhood folks just chilling. Will be back. 
4465 0 Sub-average quesadilla. Got the chicken one and was severely disappointed. Not tasty, similar to a Taco Bell quesadilla except for the fact that this was $9. I'd rather eat Taco Bell, at least they know their worth. 
4466 3 The Pretzel pepperoni pizza they have is amazing only problem is that it is rarely n the menu and when it is it is for a very limited time. The wait is always less than 10 mins. 
4467 4 We had a fantastic lunch here!! Everything from Boullibase, Seafood lLinguini, Filet of Sole to BBQ pork sandwich. Great service, fresh, quality ingredients and reasonable prices with a great view!! 
4468 4 These tacos are life changing, man. I wholeheartedly recommend the fish taco. The only downside is that they're pretty pricey for tacos, but these are seriously as good as they get. 
4469 3 Azteca is a great place to eat. The food is much better than your alternative in the area (El Vaquero) and the prices are great! 
4470 4 The food is awesome! The staff was awesome! Great atmosphere! We went here New Year's Eve and had a great time! 
4471 2 I thought this place was just okay. Stop by for some sustenance, nothing special though. 
4472 4 Ordered the Chai Ya Noodle with Chicken to go. It was very good, especially for the price. Highly recommended. 
4473 4 Went today and it was lovely! Great atmosphere, delicious coffee and pastries, and adorable cats - what more does anyone need??? 
4474 3 best burger in town, long long lines but worth the wait! turkey burger that is actually juicy is a miracle in its self and the fries are addicting. 
4475 3 Food this awesome.... I tried the sizzler, must try. Best chicken tikka masala. The staff is very friendly. Place is clean and nice. Manny attended us and he is super friendly. Thanks. 
4476 4 Best Dim Sum in town. I think the more traditional offerings are actually better than some of their specialty offerings (and cheaper). Although there can be a long wait, it's definitely worth it. The food is delicious. It's pretty tight quarters, but again worth it for the food. 
4477 4 My husband bought me a carrot cake cupcake on a whim from here and it was AMAZING. Best carrot cake cupcake I have ever had. 
4478 4 I'm not usually a soup and sandwich gal. I want more effort if I'm paying for lunch but this place is just lovely. Great funky atmosphere, friendly service and good food. Thank you! 
4479 3 This place has a nice ambience to it. It is steeped in history and you can feel it. The food is good. The staff is friendly and attentive. 
4480 4 Some of the best sushi roles I had. Very creative menu and impeccable service by Ken. Don't miss their katsu dishes as well. The crawfish spicy tuna is fantastic. Reasonably priced for a family meal. 
4481 2 I saw a rat running through it. It's on the pier and very much open to the outside. It's a good place for a late night drink, but I wouldn't eat there. 
4482 4 Neil was very knowledgeable and my prints turned out amazing! I was so impressed! 
4483 4 Loved their vegetarian menu! The margaritas are delicious, guacamole is ok, staff is friendly and the ambience takes you back to Puebla, Mexico! Oraleeee! 
4484 4 Sooo GOOD!!!! I ordered the chicharron taco and it was easily the best taco I've ever ate!!! If I wasn't full I'd order another!!! I will for sure have one more before I go back to Cali!!!! 
4485 3 My daughter set up reservations for my wife and I to dine here for the first time for my birthday. We really enjoyed ourselves and the food is delicious. We will definitely eat here more frequently. 
4486 4 Had lunch there for the first time and was delighted with the food, atmosphere and service. I truly enjoy Asian food and this restaurant more than met my expectations. I ordered a Lunch box combo featuring beef bulgogi. Extremely tender and very flavorful. 
4487 0 Waitress passed by our table three times. Waited on the people that came in after us and ignored us when we asked for a menu. We were the only African-Americans there. Racist establishment. Avoid it. 
4488 4 Pricey but worth it... Drink and food are fabulous! Must add those sushi cupcakes are Bomb! Must try! Plenty of space, good music and nice ambiance 
4489 4 Super awesome food. This is now my new fav. Love the out of control roll. It was OUTTA CONTROL 
4490 2 What happened to this place? Where are all the people?? Yes, it used to be too packed, but now it is essentially empty. ???? Drinks and appetizers were still good, though... 
4491 4 Gluten free goodness!! The beignets are delicious and hot!! A chef comes out to talk to you and prepares your food. It's a fun resort and you can take a scenic boat ride over to Downtown Disney. 
4492 3 A coworker suggested this for lunch. Had the el pastor burrito with a Pepsi to wash it down. Wowza this was a bit to much for a work day lunch for $10 it was so good I regretted finishing it was ready for a nap afterwards. 
4493 4 Fantastic service, beautiful food, and an exquisite dining experience! Thank you Uchiko and major kudos to the servers and kitchen staff! 
4494 3 Great spot. Traditional German food, fun atmosphere, and good service. Worth the stop if you like good German food. I recommended getting the wurst and the Black Forest cake...amazing! 
4495 4 Hotel rocks. People are nice and rooms are clean. Beautiful view and window and staff are friendly. 
4496 4 I had such a great facial here! I've been to a quite a few different places in the city for facials and they were so great. They paid great attention to detail, and had a friendly demeanor. I'll definitely be back! Thank you ! 
4497 4 Everything I've had from here has been a home run. You really can't go won't. The portion sizes are huge, be prepared for leftovers. 
4498 0 Went here with a couple friends and the food was cold and they took back the food and the food was hot but the cheese steak bread was so soggy so it just picked off the cheese steak pieces and eat it never going back 
4499 3 Interesting environment, much larger than I expected. They had live jazz music playing which had drawn in quite the crowd, but ample space in another room for seating if you didn't want to be in the mix. The beer was great and for good prices. Very enjoyable experience. 
4500 3 Try the Lemongrass Vermicelli bowl. It's HUGE! And Delicious! And the leftovers taste even better the next day. Service is always super friendly and when I'm feeling indulgent, the Jackfruit smoothie/shake is one of the best things I've enjoyed through a straw. 
4501 0 The place and food is correct but I ve never have such a bad experience in term of service. A waitress absolutely unbearable and they change the 1 for a 7 on my tip!! I highly recommend to avoid that place considering all the nice restaurants just nearby 
4502 4 This place is awesome! The crab cakes were to die for, we had the traditional lobster roll, a grilled lobster, the lobster Mac and cheese and fried clams... All were good and fresh! Definitely coming back for more!! 
4503 3 There best dishes are all in weekends!! And please don't order American style Chinese food like General chicken or pad Thai (this is even not Chinese food) Be sure you order like a Taiwanese, the Taiwanese breakfast dishes are the best!! 
4504 3 Great atmosphere and great food. Bruscetta plate was so good. Cuban sandwich was one of the best I've had. Amazing cold brew, as well 
4505 3 The photo shows what's left of my fillet mignon and Yukon mashed potatoes.... need I say more!.... The sourdough bread was really good nice ,hot fresh.... my Caesar salad was a little too acidic ...hence the four stars versus five... well worth the drive ... 
4506 3 Friendly staff here....good deals...theres always sales becaues its on Northeastern University's campus, ( you know college kids need the deals.) 
4507 4 Love this place. Friendly and creative and clean and awesome! They make their own base, unlike some other uber popular ice cream places. And they make the waffle cones right there, which makes the place smell soooooo good. Also, the ladies were super friendly to my slightly difficult parents. 
4508 0 Mears sucks. I just spent over a half an hour trying to book on-line. Nothing but problems. I can imaginge what their car serivce is like. 
4509 4 The customer service rep who deposited my cheque today offered me a cup of their freshly brewed coffee when I told him how good his smelled. How hard is that? :) 
4510 0 Personally insulted. A rude lady with blonde hair decided that our group wasn't worth their time. It was unusual and sad. I felt bad for her she was clearly dealing with things not related to us. 
4511 4 Truly the best breakfast tacos in town and the Dona makes the world go round 
4512 4 Loved this spot! It's family owned and operated. Everything is done in-house and is fresh to order. They make a slamming pizza and calzone! I usually call ahead and pick up. The family loves it. Always a great consistently good meal from friendly folks. Recommend a try! 
4513 4 Across the street but forever in my heart. Love the coffee and super sweet and helpful staff here. Whole mexican beans are my treat to me and I'll also indulge in a house made cup from time to time. Very much a neighborhood intergenerational place to hang that feels welcoming. 
4514 4 Great customer service, food takes about 20 minutes to cook, but it's expect for the quality and quantity of food they service. One order can definitely service about 5 people. Love, love, loooooooove their food 
4515 4 This was a fun way to eat. The food was tasty and the team was helpful in explaining how everything works. 
4516 4 Best Greek food in the area. Lots of variety. Authentic dishes to eat in or for take out. Owners are super friendly. 
4517 3 This restaurant served very authentic and delicious Greek food, as well as great Tiramisu. However, the only thing that crossed my mind was that it was kind of overpriced for some of the items. 
4518 4 Bob the parts manager was great and was very responsive. can't say enough good things about my experience. 
4519 4 The only place i know that offers vegan pizza..and it's amazing. So good. Staff soooo friendly. 
4520 0 I put a 'hold' notice on mail from April 5 through April 10th because I am out of town. I received an email confirmation of the hold. On April 7th I got an email from USPS saying a package had been left on my porch!! 
4521 4 Great staff, wonderful wine and amazing food. The bruschetta special was so good. GET THE CAESAR SALAD! I have NEVER had such a special salad. I think they have someone in the kitchen who sits back there painting the dressing on each piece of romaine. 
4522 2 I had heard really good things about this chain, but I was not impressed. Beside the illusion of fresh and healthy ingredients, it seems to me that the food is bland and overpriced. 
4523 3 The Fried Chicken and Waffles is a huge serving and a strawberry butter and sweet and spicy sauce for the chicken are delicious. Are Fried Chicken was a little bit burnt but still good. The service was great and we will definitely be back. 
4524 2 mix feelings but over all they did a good job and quick for less then other company no more nor less no more dog hair on couch on the carpet or anywhere I can see I might use them again we will see about that 
4525 0 Just threw out my food I wanted chicken fries not cold chicken nuggets. There IS a difference. And you didn't add the chili on the whopper dog. I would call and complain but I don't think anyone would understand me. Sucks, man 
4526 4 The food here was delicious, definitely will be going back to try more of the vegan sushi! 
4527 3 I've been going to Lucas since Nov 2014 for haircuts and he's done a good job each time. He always takes time to listen and understand what you want and pays great attention to details. Very friendly and pleasant guy. Also, bang trims are free for returning clients. 
4528 3 The BBQ burger (Donnie's favorite) was tasty. But the brioche roll seemed a little out of place. Some interesting items on the menu, like the "Creamsicle". I think that's an ice cream float. 
4529 0 Used them once, lost the pants to my $700 suite. They didn't follow up with their cleaning factory or call back. Had to track them down and still don't have an answer. 
4530 4 Randomly walked by this place and had to try it out for breakfast. I'm so glad I did. It's a quaint place family run with fresh ingredients. So delicious! 
4531 4 Yummy, fast, tasty. Seems new, decor is modern and clean. Great variety. You have to try the Gilberto sweet crepe. 
4532 4 Under new management. The food has improved drastically and have to say the pasta is great and filling. Good portions and new crispy fries with burgers. 
4533 3 Very, very cool vibe here. Along with the delicious drinks and desserts, the wait stuff was fun/lively. Bring cash. Raspberry chocolate fool = yum. 
4534 0 One star is too high of a review for this despicable restaurant. Everything about this place is horrible. 
4535 3 Have a breakfast in Medina cafe. Great waiter serviced us! Though wait for a long time, we got the tasty food and coffee. The waffles with passion fruit and Earnest Cardamom Ice Cream tastes very delicious, love it! 
4536 3 I always get the bistec de encabollado, with rice and beans (habichuelas) and tostones. Always a great meal at a good price. The service can be a little slow at times. 
4537 4 Best sushi place in Altamonte by far ! Love the crunchy onion roll and the spicy salmon roll. I would recommend this place to anybody is looking for good sushi and quiet place to eat. 
4538 3 I love this place! I haven't ordered a dish yet that I didn't like. Much better than its predecessor at this location. Good service, friendly staff, reasonable prices, pleasant decor. Beware of the bamboo shoots in the green curry though. They are woody, chewy, and most cannot be swallowed. 
4539 4 Authentic. Rivals Italy itself. Amazing one can get such AMAZING food from a truck. This guy is a true artist. 
4540 3 My family enjoys their Ramen bowls. The food comes out quickly and the price is pretty good. Inconsistent at times with how much pork you get in the ramen bowl. Sometimes a level 1 is not and sometimes not much at all. Service average. 
4541 3 Good pizza, always thin and crispy the way I like it but the staff is always a bit weird. 
4542 4 THE BEST RAMEN IN THE CITY. I seriously crave this place - especially their spicy red ramen. It's so delicious! So happy that Portland is the first location in the U.S.! 
4543 3 Went here for lunch...excellent service and my food was delicious! I ordered the Cuts Knife and Fork...their version of the Cobb Salad with Chicken, and it was magnificent! Reasonably priced as well. I will definitely go back for lunch again! 
4544 0 Worst shopping experience I've ever had! They have a horrible return policy, rude employees, the manager is zero help, and the store is a cluttered mess, and it smells. 
4545 4 Excellent food and service. Had the Sunday brunch buffet. Fresh, delicious ceviche and employees were friendly and helpful. Can't say enough about how good it is. 
4546 4 What could be better? Salads with meat and veggies on top. The owner is super friendly and accommodating to all diets - gluten free, vegan, paleo, etc. He makes everything from scratch and it's all delicious. 
4547 4 Love the unique burgers! Our table had Butcher's Cut, tuna tartare, steak tartare, lamburger, and Oaxaca. We all tried a little bit of each and all of them were delicious! The sweet potato tots are also worth trying! 
4548 3 I am not dating anyone. I don't need to. I have Blue Star! And I am in love. 
4549 4 I had a good experience here. I was greeted right away and had a very short wait. The price was reasonable, and my nails look very good. I would definitely go back. 
4550 3 Food is fantastic. Skip the fries and the strawberry goat cheese, but otherwise really great. 
4551 4 This is the second Burgerville store, FREE Wi-Fi, the original 1960's layout, and a unique menu of American fast food. They have no inside seating, so you can eat at one of the few outdoor tables, or in their private parking lot. 
4552 4 They're the Best Ever! The sales department is right on top of everything as well as the Service!! 
4553 3 Not a bad place on Davie. Decent portion and great price value. Food is prepared right. One downside is anything roaster is a bit burnt -- wings and kebabs. Great ambience for a laid back night out with food and drinks, and can seat a bi party. 
4554 2 The food here is really very good but as far as a bar goes it is way too spaced out. Good place to eat and drink a few beers and watch a game, awful place if you want to get caught up in an exciting atmosphere to watch a game. 
4555 4 Friendly staff and great food. It's the perfect place to grab a quick bite or takeout when you crave delicious comfort food. The soy simmered beef bowl is amazing. 
4556 2 Nice presentation but the vegetables in my salad just had no flavor. Crab Cake was salty. Very professional service. Heads up: they do not take Discover Card 
4557 4 Great happy hour: food, wine and beeeeeer! Did a show here about a month ago. Owners and workers are cool as beans. :) Pizzas and brushettas are yummmers. Nice warm vibe in there, too. 
4558 0 Disappointed in this place. Picked up a bunch of sandwiches for my colleagues and they would only let me get credit for one sandwich on my frequent diner card. Will do all my future group and catering orders from places that appreciate my business like Boloco around the corner. 
4559 3 Great food! Worth the trek through their unreliable customer service and disorganized waitstaff. 
4560 1 This place is nothing great. Been here a half dozen times or so. Food is meh, loud as hell inside, drinks and service are sub par. Find other mexican, although Boston doesn't have much

4562 4 Food is very authentic and the staff is so nice. They're on top of everything. I brought a few people with me and this was their first time eating Indian food and they all loved it. 
4563 3 good food, professional staff. I book company parties here and take customers to lunch. the menu is somewhat stagnant. I wish they would have seasonal updates. Great wine selection 
4564 4 I wanted to give a shout out to the team at Crawford Thomas Recruiting. Their advice and guidance through my friends and family's career search was unmatched. If you're looking for a new job, and don't know where to begin, give these guys a call. 
4565 4 Great guy. He's been working on our AC for the quarter century we've owned our now 120 year old house. We had him install AC in our addition 10 years ago. Does good, honest work. Won't try to upsell you or fix something that isn't broken. Can't recommend him enough. 
4566 4 Delicious food. It's hard to find authentic mexican food around here, but this is as good as it gets. The huge portions sizes are only a plus! 
4567 4 Had a BLAST tonight. Service from Ryan & James was fast & fantastic. They are sweet, professional & HOT! My fav item was the fried oyster taco. Drizzle a little of the table hot sauce .... Amazeballs. Have fun! We did! 
4568 3 Good pizza. Nice geeky decor that suits kendall square. 
4569 3 Solid breakfast lunch spot. This is just a feeling but I feel like the dishes here are healtiher and slightly higher quality ingredients then the other Portland comptetitors for your brunch dollar. It's a tad smaller then average and it has a lot of veg/vegan options. 
4570 4 Best Asian food in the area. Delivery is fast (they are at GrubHub), delivery guys are always friendly and the food is amazing! I really enjoy Cathay 
4571 4 I love food fight and I love the owners. Dedicated vegans always out to support the animal rights community. Plus the store is awesome with all the best vegan stuff. Portland is so lucky to have this store! 
4572 4 Outstanding. Appetizers all great. Food so tasty and plentiful. Waitress (Amanda I think?) was super. Attentive, good suggestions and really made us feel welcome. Totally love this place. 
4573 0 Worst selection for its namesake that I have ever seen. Embarrassment to the word Whiskey. That said. The service was not bad at all. They did the best they could with what they had to work with. 
4574 3 Here's a short review to save you time: The sushi is decent, not the best I've had. I love the atmosphere, which is why I come here. Friendly Staff. Great place for a date. Try the Kiss of Fire roll and Dragon Roll. Done. 
4575 4 Great cars at a great price. Staff was friendly and helpful. Need to work on wait times. Will rent again. 
4576 2 Compared to all the other places it's not quite there. The staff are still learning. Today's visit chips are stale, pickup order waiting on the counter, better once it was heated up 
4577 4 This place is very good!!! Food is always fresh and restaurant is always clean. A good choice for organic healthy foods!!! A bit on the pricey end but in order to eat healthy you have to spend a little more unfortunately. 
4578 4 Excellent selection of toppings. The cheese sauce is A+. Tommy is doing a great job of maintaining Herb's legacy and more! Highly recommend. 
4579 3 love this place. has such a great atmosphere and good, diverse selections of used records. it also seems like they are constantly getting new stuff in, so stop in once a week if you're hunting for a particular record...chances are, you'll find it there eventually. 
4580 4 After a long day at Universal, exhausted and tired of junk food, Zoe's was perfect. Straightforward, healthy choices, perfect serving size. Cheerful surroundings and friendly staff. Would definitely return. 
4581 4 I love this place. Good, fresh food, many vegetarian and vegan options, including (free-of-charge) substitutions for meat products. You can get your standard breakfast or less traditional breakfasts that have delicious ingredients like roasted red peppers or sweet potatoes. 
4582 4 The greatest staff Edgemont has to offer. Local company supporting local initiatives. Coffee is great to go or to take home and don't forget the summer Chillers! 
4583 4 Snakes and Spiders in the pet shop was the coolest! Massage guys hit the right spot. would love to come back.. 
4584 3 The menu has a variety of things to choose from which is always nice! The duck is a must though. Cooked to perfection. This place is so versatile that you can go for a relaxing brunch or a nice date. Recommend south congress cafe to all! 
4585 0 服务员态度极差，说话阴阳怪气，侮辱客人 差评！！！！对待客人特别不友好，饭菜口味一般 不会再来第二次。让服务员倒杯水都不情愿，反正就是差差差差差差！！！强烈不建议去，最后给小费嫌不是整张的是乞丐 找零还回来 我真的是无语 第一次在美国遇到这么态度差的餐厅 。 
4586 2 Decent korean food bar. I love their cabbage pickles. Rice cake.was a hit. For me.this is a affordable spot to grab some yummy sides everyday. 
4587 1 Very slow service and frustrated servers. This is not a good choice for lunch on a work day. The restaurant was mostly empty, but we still waited an hour for lunch. I was with a group and the server was rude when we asked to split the check. 
4588 4 These guys went above and beyond what they had to do!! I would recommend them to anyone, clean shop and very professional. Make you feel at ease. 
4589 4 yes, three OMGs because it's that good. Order the Tayosa from Taylor and the bacon lardons are priceless. 
4590 4 I stayed at the hotel over the weekend and had a fabulous experience - specially enjoyed the spa and deep tissue massage I got. Staff was attentive, caring and very professional. Highly recommend the spa! 
4591 3 JJ's makes some great sandwiches. Both on their signature french bread or the wheat, all of their subs will fill you up with yummy goodness. I really like their own salt and vinegar chips. 
4592 4 One my my favorite spots in all of Portland. Eat here. Eat here often. The burgers are creative and flavorful. The sandwiches are unique and delicious. The staff rules. I can't say enough good things. 
4593 4 Best peaches I've had in a long time. Great variety of tomatoes. I don't think it's as big as Wilson Farms, but still a great place. I just wish they had an ATM. 
4594 2 This place was just ok nothing to get real excited about, but the lunch special ( I had sweet and sour chicken) was a great value It was 4.99 and had plenty of food and included the drink (can) and egg roll 
4595 1 The building is really cool and the cheese sticks were awesome but the pizza itself taste like a pizza kit you could pick up at Walmart. The wait staff was cool and super nice but the main thing you come here for is pizza and it was bad. 
4596 4 I have been trying so many hair salons around Chinatown in Boston. Edie Zhao is the best one! He cares about your hair and knows how to cut Asian's hair. I will definitely come back again. 
4597 2 Wouldn't recommend ordering here (and certainly not via uber eats). Wings were mediocre and Cajun fries were awful. A huge let down! Also the fries didn't come with any ketchup. Overall, it didn't seem like much effort went into this meal! 
4598 3 Always fast preparation and friendly staff. Never disappoints. We always get the "quesadilla" which is our alternative to a burrito! Rolled and grilled! 
4599 0 This place was terrible as the Treehouse, and even worse as the Burke. If you like miserable food, sub-par service, and clowns for owners, this is the place for you! 
4600 1 Ughh... The limited menu and bad service do not add up to a good time. The steak is good as is the fish but the menu does NOT have enough seafood choices or sides. What is up with the sides??? Not worth it. 
4601 4 Awesome Food! Great service! Texan native, so I was excited for their opening and will frequent Chuy's! Great Happy Hour with drink specials and free nacho bar! 
4602 0 Just chatted with these guys online...they told me to go to a local store. I have a virus on my laptop and need memory. Thought it was funny because their website tells you to choose them instead of Geek Squad. I guess I'm going to Best Buy now.... 
4603 4 I've never had better, more creative doughnuts in my life. Don't miss the crème brulé, the blueberry bourbon basil, or especially the hard apple cider fritter! 
4604 3 Owners were really friendly. I had the grilled cheese with macaroni. Yummm. Definitely not diet meal. 
4605 3 Best Doughnuts in Portland! Hands above the other famous competition. Much more artisanal flavor profiles and selections. These doughnuts also are nicely presented and crafted. Great cake texture and flavor with a bit of a light crunch on the outside of some. 
4606 3 5 dollar Pho on Wednesday. I give four stars because I've only tried the Pho on several occasions, nothing else. Their Pho is the best in town no joke. 
4607 4 Saporo beer, musk broth, veggies, salmon, white rice, and noodles. Drove out to this place and was worth it. Very authentic tasting and good quality. 
4608 0 Worst breakfast I paid $35 bucks for 2 in a long time. Avoid eggs Benedict and corned beef hash. 
4609 3 Friendly staff, good location, good sushi. You can get a great lunch special with includes 5 pcs of fiah, 6 pcs sashimi, spicy tuna or California roll, small salad and miso soup all for $13.50 Good deal! 
4610 3 My girlfriend and I stopped for a glass of wine and ended up getting some appetizers. The antipasto was made authentically and the wine selection is awesome. I will be going back really soon!!! 
4611 4 Very good ice cream! Cute lil shop with plenty of choices to satisfy your sweet tooth. My favorite is the cake batter, it's excellent. Make sure you have cash, because that's all they take. 
4612 4 Must chime in on this one. Ever since I lived in the Hawthorne neighborhood this place has been a favorite. If you don't think their truffles are the best, you don't like chocolate. There're great, fresh, and local. I declare Ja Civa's A #1! 
4613 3 Excellent on the water location, and to find food that matches the location (excellent) is rare. I had the Cod sandwich, that was excellent, My wife raves about the steamers. Desert was a chocolate doughboy, it was to die for. 
4614 2 I've ordered from this place numerous times and every time they get the order wrong..i would definitely say go inside if you want decent service. 
4615 3 Got a tune up recently. Did a great job and the bike is riding smooth the way it should. Thanks guys! 
4616 3 First time here. Line out the door on Sunday morning. It was super fast, got right in and ate. Food was great. Great service. Servers got wireless tablets to take orders and cards. 
4617 4 Great little place in Hapeville. Great service and very friendly. If you are in the area and hungry definitely stop in. The portions are huge. The Cuban was amazing. 
4618 3 Good gyros and fresh hummus. Service was cheerful and prompt. Definitely a great spot for lunch! 
4619 3 Still the best Soul Food restaurant in Atlanta! They are most famous for their southern fried chicken, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The food is always fresh and the dishes are seasoned to perfection. The closest thing to grandma's cooking! 
4620 0 So how long until this is an empty, closed up building? I've been twice now, the last time only to walk through to the other bars. It's so sad how cheesie and bad this place is in comparison to how awesome and great BBQ was. Sad face. 
4621 4 Great scenic hike with breathtaking views of lake Austin and downtown,fun and super easy 
4622 4 I've always found the service to be a bit spotty (especially when they were set up on E. Riverside), but the food more than makes up for it. Their breakfast tacos are mind-blowing, and it makes me with that they still had a truck closer to my area. 
4623 4 Excellent atmosphere, service and food. You can tell a lot of time, effort and heart was put into every aspect of Via Toscana - rich and tasty food, amazing selection of wines and divine deserts. A family favorite! 
4624 4 Took the soy candle class here, highly recommend it! The studio is pretty cool, lots of work from different artists/crafters. Looking to take the soap and indigo dye classes next! 
4625 4 soft opening so they were out of cold-brew coffee, but man the seats are so comfortable and they recline...this will be the new bar for alamo drafthouses... 
4626 4 Love this place I refuse to go anywhere else. I have never had a bad experience here The women here genuinely listen to you and don't try to push other services 
4627 4 This was our very first time here , we came from CT driving and were super hungry. The service was exceptional Food was great , even though it was very good price , the quality was very good. Plenty of options. Loved it , totally recomend it ! 
4628 4 I love this place! People working here are amazing and very friendly. We go here whenever we are craving some authentic Italian food. I think it beats any place in North End. I definitely recommend it to anyone that's looking for some really good italian food. 
4629 4 I have been using them for a number of years after giving up on another local cleaners with cranky/rude help. They are consistently polite and pleasant and do a good job. The clothes are always ready when promised, and the prices are fair. 
4630 3 Buffalo Wild Wings is awesome period. I love ANY type of wings place, and I one time came here with my family and friends and we all screamed at the hottest wings on the planet! 
4631 4 Love this spot. The food is pretty awesome. From burger to sushi. Great ambience. Best sake in town 
4632 3 It's a little far out from where I live but the people at the desk do their job, the place seemed pretty clean and the clientele seemed to enjoy the gym. 
4633 0 Called ahead and asked if they could rotate the tires on my Pilot, said they could. After they changed my oil they let me know the could not rotate my tires but graciously would not charge me for it. Unbelievable... 
4634 4 Perfect in every way. Service was friendly and efficient. Food and drinks we're outstanding and reasonably priced. Live music. Perfect place for a sunny Saturday afternoon. 
4635 3 Great weekly specials. Friendly staff and great service. Parking can be a pain due to the lines are not painted on the pavement. People park all over the place. Karaoke on Wednesday nights. 
4636 4 Always good service but the food is AMAZING. Everything from healthy scrambles to shrimp and grits! Highly recommended!! 
4637 4 Excellent experience in this amazing pleace. The people are really cool the food it's excellent and we should Definitely think about a dessert ! 
4638 4 This was a very cute hip place. The food was amazing and fresh. Lots of gluten-free and vegetarian choices to choose from. Service was very friendly. 
4639 2 Pros: Nice ambiance Clean Good service Big portions Cons: Food was OK but not great Would most likely not revisit. 
4640 3 Was packed when we came for brunch on the Fourth of July! Great coffee, friendly service, although not super quick, and yummy waffles. Definitely coming back 
4641 4 Our new favorite Italian place! Authentic Italian food, fresh ingredients, so good! We will definitely be back 
4642 4 It was my first time at this salon today and Kirby was fantastic. The salon is bright and airy with a lovely atmosphere and friendly staff. I'm growing my hair out and I wanted a very small trim which Kirby did wonderfully. Will definitely be coming back. 
4643 4 The service was very fast, and the food was good. Overall a good choice when looking for something to eat here at the airport. 
4644 1 Small, cluttered, not that clean or organized. The food was good, the people friendly but not super service oriented. This place is worth a try - if it works for you great, but I can think of three other coffee shops more worthy of time and dollars. 
4645 4 I really like this place. Their food is good and their drinks are priced nicely. It often gets very loud in there but I guess that it to be expected when people are drinking. I like their cod roe pasta, french fries, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and skewers. 
4646 4 Love this place great music , fantastic wait staff, great prices,I had the ceviche and a mixed green salad, wife had the chicken fried oysters and the beet salad I had 2 beers and wife had a glass of 43 bucks ....,,,. 
4647 2 Not bad. Not great. Mod is better, but your mileage may vary. Can't complain about the price, but like I said, for a similar price you get better pizza at Mod - and you can get beer in air conditioning. Needs more seating. 
4648 4 Great clam bake, oysters! Kids menu is super cheap. Attentive service. 
4649 4 One of the best donuts place in Portland. Yes it is way better than voodoo. Highly recommend to any donut lovers out there. Got a box of assorted donuts. Was impressed! 
4650 4 Quiet and peaceful. I call it my sanctuary. Go in stressed, come out rejuvenated. It's probably one of my top places to hike in N.Austin. Lots of shade for when it gets warm. 
4651 1 There are better options for good Indian food in Atlanta, but maybe not that many in the Perimeter area. Tikka Masala was ok, Chicken Jalfreze was bland, the bread was good. The service was not great. Overpriced. 
4652 4 Good, fast service. The bug problem was taken care of immediately, and treatment is still effective over a month later. 
4653 4 great service and tasty food. good portions and very authentic food! 
4654 4 Quick and helpful service. Friendly staff. Was in and out for an oil change in 30 mins. Thanks guys. 
4655 3 Super friendly staff. I truly like this location. The product came right on time and it was really tasty. I loved my shake. 
4656 4 Yes!!! Finally chicken and rice close to home any day of the week. I no longer have to coordinate my cravings with the food truck schedule at malden center station. I have only tried the chicken and lamb but both were tasty. 
4657 4 By far the best pizza I've ever had in Boston. Thin crust, fresh ingredients, great variations. I loved the antipasti and pizza #9 with thyme flavored mushrooms, spinach, mozzarella... Great and friendly service! 
4658 4 Great design store with almost everything needed for elegant living. We are addicted to the orchids. My wife rates the bathrooms as the best in Portland. 
4659 0 Don't eat at the restaurant there! I just witnessed this lady put chicken tenders in the fryer that someone took bites ok and everybody there has a piss poor attitude 
4660 3 Was pleasantly surprised to find this gem conveniently located right at the entrance of security! My server was exceptional, funny, and fast paced! My steelhead citrus salad was delicious and came our within 10 minutes of ordering! Will definitely return. 
4661 2 Rolled in here with 6 people after 8pm. Place was about half full, the servers were very polite, helpful and fast. Food was as expected, typical Denny's. my experience was good/positive, not like the other posts... 
4662 4 Place is delicious. Best tacos in town! Chicken mole & pastor are my fav! 
4663 3 Pretty decent. Cane for a staff appreciation so I t wasn't busy. We're pretty much the only ones here so it's easy to have fun 
4664 3 Good food. Nice atmosphere. Somewhat inattentive wait service. 
4665 0 Not good at all. Service lacking food very average too many other decent choices in the area. No Italian feeling to this place at all. Like a bar that had an afterthought to try and serve Italian food. Won't be back 
4666 1 The How to Close a Business Equation Poor Customer Service + Overpriced and Run-of-the-Mill Merchandise = 25% Off Going Out of Business Sale, 50% Off Books and Synthetic Yarn It's still expensive, so bring your cash so you don't blow your recession-strapped credit. 
4667 4 I'm always happy to get ice cream and ice cream sandwiches at Frozen Hoagies! Their coconut macaroon cookies are delightfully chewy and brown around the edges, and their ice cream is gooey and delicious! It's perfectly balanced and not overly sweet. I have no complaints about Frozen Hoagies! 
4668 4 This museum is breathtaking! I'm a huge John Singer Sargent and Anders Zorn fan so I was ecstatic to see so much of their work in her collection. Definitely worth a trip! 
4669 4 I did Ryan's hot Stryder class. It was an amazing work out. I could feel the burn while rowing and squating. I've also done hot yoga in the past. Even though I don't live here I always do their classes while I'm home for the holidays!! You feel great afterwards. 
4670 0 Long lines, only one polite employee, so unhelpful! Only one person mans the front with 20 people in line! 
4671 3 I dig it. Wish the bar and the patio were not so narrow, but on a slow day, it's rather lovely and the staff is great! 
4672 3 This is a top notch Zooquarium. (Zoo/aquarium) A little on the expensive side but the interactive exhibits and knowledge you acquire about the animals and ocean conservation efforts seems worth it. You can easily spend 2 hours walking around and getting an up close view. 
4673 4 The best oyster selection in the city - fresh and chilled to perfection. The service is always perfect and the food is always prepared to perfection. This is a perfect place for a small get-together as it is not too loud or overwhelming. Lovely. 
4674 4 Be Fit Café is delicious! The food is fresh and fast. I also love that there is a drive-through for healthy food options! I love their Buffalo Chicken Wrap the best! 
4675 3 Went here with a bunch of friends after our plans fell through. Good food, good beer selection, and a nice homely atmosphere. 
4676 4 Amazing food and beer, great atmosphere, this place is wonderful! We shared the kings platter and loved it! I can't wait to go back 
4677 4 Believe every good word you read here and ignore the others. Staff is great and the chicken is UNREAL! Oh yeh, they also sell beer by the quart. 
4678 3 Really good food , complimentary chips and salsa ( chips were warm ). The fish tacos were really good so was the quesadillas. The house margarita was also very good I Will definitely go back again 
4679 0 With change in ownership the food has gone downhill. It's terrible and I won't be back. 
4680 4 Nice price and awesome room. The big guy concierge rocks. He is always so helpfull. Too bad I cant remember his name. This hotel has everything. My husband and I love there. 
4681 4 When our regular taco joint closed, we had to find a new one. I looked on Yelp and found this gem. LOVE IT! The tortillas are delicious. Definitely recommend this place and we will be back for sure!! 
4682 4 Was just in Columbus (AGAIN!), and went to Yau's for lunch (OF COURSE!). I swear I would beat up anybody who would dare think that Yau's is not the most delicious Cantonese food around!!! 
4683 3 Place is not expensive and food is pretty good! I tried the crepe and it was really good! I take one star off because I was waiting a pretty long tone until my stuff is going to be made. 
4684 4 Pros: water park, pool, hot tub, bar, restaurants, ice cream shop, Starbucks, grand lobby and beautiful rooms. Face painting, ballon animals, make a cookie bar, for kids on the weekends. Good rate for everything included. Comfortable beds. House keeping everyday. Clean. Wonderful 
4685 4 Shucking got fixed. Catch of the day is always awesome. Lobsters can be had big. This is my go to seafood place again. My favorite when available: Atlantic blue fish. 
4686 4 One of my old favorite resteraunt closed and I gear they got the chef here now. I went and the food is super!! Greatly a quality experience great bloody marry. 
4687 4 This place was awesome the purple drink is awesome the food was awesome and Jacques Brown was awesome!!! 
4688 4 Pleasant and fast service. I had the Spider Maki and the chef definitely put a lot of thought into it. Server was attentive and fast as well. 
4689 4 Renee Is the worlds best barista! She just served my hubs and I the best iced mocha and blended Carmel drinks!!!! Mmmmm, just right , not too sweet!!!! Coming back soon for ice cream 
4690 1 While I liked a particular cleaning professional I made a follow up appointment. Less than 24 hours later I was given a new one professional. I would have preferred an opportunity to reschedule with my preferred professional. Now I've cancelled, my house isn't cleaned and I've rearranged plans. Such inconvenience! 
4691 2 Dr. Kim did follow up regarding my review which I appreciate... She apologized, stated that she didn't intend to make me feel guilty about not coming in or mislead me about my post-dilation condition. 
4692 3 Best Indian you will find anywhere.Food is aromatic, tasty and traditional as it should be.Could do a little more with the wine list but overall a great dining experience. 
4693 4 Nestled away in the heart of German village they are cranking out some out of bounds dishes that are lights out delicious! The tomahawk pork chop is the real deal and is a hot tub of flavor town! 
4694 3 This is an awesome intimate venue to see bands play. I recently saw the Sterns (who were freekin awesome) and the cover was only 4 bucks. It was HOT. Of course it's loud during shows, but that's why you go there. LOTS OF FUN. 
4695 4 YESSSS!! finally good ramen in Beaverton!! the broth is legit. the noodles are legit. the cha-shu is legit. the miso broth is off the chain. forget Kizuki! this place actually reminds me of Japan. 1000% noms. 
4696 1 This has the feel of a total tourist trap. The service was nothing to rave about and the food was bland, especially for the price. Boston has so much more to offer. Save yourself the trip and go somewhere else. 
4697 3 The Mohawk is a good place to see a show. The bar area is a bit tiny, and can be difficult to get a drink when it's crowded. I enjoyed my time here, and would definitely go back. 
4698 4 Got a medium birthday cake with vanilla ice cream and devoured it. Could've eaten a large it was so good. Tried Mango too and it was awesome. Reminds me of Jerry's in Memphis. Definitely going to come back here every time I visit Austin. 
4699 2 Real potential here. But (and this is significant) the bun had that frozen and defrosted in the microwave flavor and consistency. Gotta fix that. Otherwise my classic sausage with grilled peppers and jalapenos, a touch of yellow mustard and curry ketchup was tasty. 
4700 4 I really liked this place. Food was delicious, not too salty or overly spiced. My pho was really great. Definitely coming back to this place! 
4701 2 The food is good, not great. Way too expensive. Do yourself a favor and head to the north end. I got the Ravioli ai Quattro Formaggi. Again, it was good, but probably served better as an app that you could split at the table vs. a $25 entree. 
4702 3 Great location, great food, great staff, great drinks. All in all, Watershed is pretty damn great. 
4703 3 Went in with no expectation and was blown away by the food. I had the gnocchi and it was out of this world. Paired with a nice Cabernet this was truly worth it! 
4704 4 Amazing BBQ without the Franklins wait. Highly recommend the brisket and german potato salad. Also buy some sauce and rubs to take home. 
4705 4 This is a clean dog run where artists, innovators and others brings their dogs. The park stays pretty clean. My hope is that a tennis club or local school that has retired tennis balls leftover is that they can leave some in the park for the neighborhood dogs. 
4706 4 People that work here are nice, helpful, and knowledgeable. Coffee is consistently delicious. I can get decaf bags of ground French roast here too. Been drinking Peet's since 1985. 
4707 3 I really enjoyed this place! This is my favorite Ethiopian restaurant that I have ever been to. The food was good, but the service was so much better than any of the others which really made it stand out to me. 
4708 2 I'm a fan but the attention this place gets is completely disproportionate to quality. Unlike gordough's, the quality of the underlying donut is not that great. They are just very creative with toppings and names. The line was very long, too. 
4709 4 Just like everyone else is saying, awesome experience and food for the price. Had a great date night there before a concert at Boulder theater which is just a nice walk down pearl st. Have I had better french food? yes, but not in Boulder;) 
4710 4 Great brunch menu, great service, great for large parties, kids, couples. We had a great time and really enjoyed everything about this restaurant. You can't go wrong with anything you order. 
4711 1 Good taco pizza. Not impressed with staff but its not called The Magabite and Friendly Staff. Bring quarters for games. 
4712 3 Great hummus and homemade bread, for starters. Comfort food, strong drinks, and not too hard on the wallet! Sometimes, I want great spaghetti and meatballs! My husband always wants lamb chops, and he really likes the chops and risotto here! 
4713 1 The smoothie was good but it was small and $10. Really $1.50 for a tablespoon of peanut butter? I could have gotten at travel pack of Justin's for $1... Wouldn't recommend it just because of the prices. 
4714 3 The atmosphere was great. Rustic and modern. The service was on par. My entree, the tortellini, was good not great. The food my family ordered was delicious. Next time I'll try a different entree. 
4715 1 Ugh. I'm slightly disappointed in the quality of the cake that I bought from here. Picked up a pre-made birthday cake. (Small green tea, $18), and although it does look very nice, I wasn't a fan of the flavor or the texture and I'm unconvinced to come back. 
4716 3 Memorable nite. Band was outstanding. I ordered the BBQ salmon, which comes smothered in a creamy bbq-like sauce that was quite tasty. But there's no avoiding it turns out you don't like it. It is COVERED. 
4717 3 Heard about the burgers for a while, and finally went to the Ponce City Market to try one. I must say, the burger was good, the fries were great and the shake was well worth it as well. 
4718 3 Service with a smile- clean, AC, & the patties all good- spice is just right! jerk chicken with rice & cabbage also delicious- Parking around back Next time I'll try the rice & peas.. 
4719 2 Went here on a Sunday for dinner. Clam chowder was good. Grilled jumbo shrimp with some veggies and potatoes was also good. Casual atmosphere. Service was average. 
4720 4 My favorite place to enjoy sushi and hibachi. Kind of pricy if you miss the lunch menu but great quality food. The service is wonderful, my favorite bartender is Kevin. Highly recommend this place for a lunch stop or a night out with fun hibachi! 
4721 4 The very best food I've eaten in ages!!! And, I'm from NYC! Great food, great service, so much fun!! 
4722 0 Complete disaster. Waited 45 mins for dessert before walking out. Don't waste your time 
4723 4 Amazing cannoli and customer service! Seriously, the best cannoli I've ever had, and the bakers were so friendly to my daughters. 
4724 2 Ceviche was good but the shrimps should have been cut up to smaller pieces to my liking. Tacos de pollo better than asada. Pupusas- nobody makes it better than my mother-in-law Service was good and the tamarindo was thirst quenching 
4725 4 Best all around breakfast taco place in town. The Shack Taco is hard to beat, yet so is a classic Bacon and Egg tago. 
4726 4 Nice place. Very friendly staff. They helped me out and offered advice without being pushy or condescending. Definitely laid back but knowledgeable. They answered questions without trying the whole "up-selling" shtick Very much recommend this cool locally owned shop. 
4727 4 Very fresh, fairly priced and customizable made-to-order Asian fusion dishes. Generous portions. 
4728 3 Delicious chicken dumplings with done interesting sauces. Beef noodles were also amazing. Flavorful without being overbearing. 
4729 2 We visited this fine restaurant on Saturday, March 15, 2014... this is my video review: http://k-o.me 
4730 4 Went in to this new saloon style bar to watch the Blazers. Great vibe, cool mix of people and amazing service. Food and drinks are good and fair price. Ill be back for more. 
4731 0 this place is pretty cheap, but not worth the savings. I've tried a manicure here twice since it's a very convenient location for me, but both times I've left with a bloody finger. employees are too rushed and not at all professional. 
4732 0 Unfortunately, this place misses the mark. The food is overpriced, and the service is very slow. We live in town, and are extremely disappointed, as we had such high hopes for a "Tavern". We won't return. 
4733 4 Came in for lunch on Saturday, pleasantly surprised they had a great lunch menu. Their "extra spicy" Kung Bo was definitely spicy and flavorful, not just cayenne. Soups were full of flavor, more than just broth. Service was friendly. 
4734 3 Great, authentic Italian home cooking. Albeit a very small venue, it does not feel overly crowded. It can get slow and you may have to wait for your reservation as there are only 10 or so total tables. But if you have some patience, the food is worth the wait. 
4735 4 What an incredible place. Great beer & cocktails. Happy Hour was great. Onion Rings, Perogeries where intense!! 
4736 4 Amazing. I have really bad anxiety when it comes to the dentist but this place and the people made me feel really comfortable. They were funny and calming all at the same time and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thank you guys so much! 
4737 4 Great great salads and PIZZA The Manager "Eli" basically runs the place He has great customer service skills Always treats customer with dignity STOP AT NWEYORK PIZZA NEAR WALLEY"S for a huge slice!! 
4738 4 Service Great, Waffles FREAKING AWESOME. Coming from SD and finding this Gem on Yelp is a great beginning to being in this beautiful city. Great Staff, Fresh ingredients, and most all a Great Casual Environment make this establishment the BOMB 
4739 2 I shall give 3.5 stars. The dining environment is great and you can tell how food is cooked by sitting on the bar seats. The food is nice but a little salty. Other is good. 
4740 4 I took the introduction to soap making and it was fantastic. Great instructions from an experienced teacher. Friendly atmosphere. Cute studio. Great fun. 
4741 4 Great food and ambience. The goat curry was awesome, the meat was soft and preparation was very authentic Indian. 
4742 4 I'm changing my previous review. Ventured back after some encouragement from my friend. Had a great bottle of wine and some light appetizers. Had a great time. 
4743 4 Very friendly and knowledgeable. I recommend it. I took my bike for a minor repair and they did it on the spot for a very reasonable price. Easy access from the 183 Hwy. 
4744 4 Great service!!! As i landed, and turned on my phone, a message from Hertz was waiting for me to advise me of my car, its location and instructions. I went to the spot, got in the car and drove away! Love it!!! Keep doing what you're doing Hertz, its working. 
4745 4 Very impressed! Food was great! I wasn't sure what all I was eating, but the flavors were wonderful. I love trying different food that I dont normally get to eat. Great people too! 
4746 4 Staying in a hotel near I-4, - ordered 16" thin crust pizza and dayuum it's good (coming from a person living in Chicago) Was quoted 45 minutes delivery but Delivered in 20 minutes. Whenever I'm back in town I will reorder!!! 
4747 4 Mr. Kim is owner and he is running this shop by himself. Very skillful and gentle. This is my favorite barber shop! 
4748 4 i am NEVER disappointed when i eat here! the food is amazing and the staff? fantastic!!! The staff is ALWAYS warm and friendly and the atmoshere can NOT be beat! 
4749 3 i love sichuan food. but mary chung sichuan food is not spicy enough to my taste. try the egg dish in hot oil. it was sooo good. it's like spicy scramble eggs with some pork in it. delicious. 
4750 4 Customer service was fantastic. Their pastries are the best I have had in the Portland area. 
4751 0 We were really excited to eat here; unfortunately, we received horrible service, food came out cold and under-seasoned, waitstaff was rude, and manager was even ruder. We will never come back here. 
4752 0 This location is terrible. Rude manager works there. No doubts they have no success at the location. We like Winners, but something should be done there to improve Customer Service. 
4753 4 The staff is so warm and friendly. Loved the setup. It felt like an old western saloon! I had the pink sun cocktail and was thoroughly impressed! I would recommend it to anyone in that area! 
4754 4 Ohhhhh boy. Come for the good vibes and great space.. Stay for the 2$ lonestar and 3$ drafts( for happy hour) Vegan truck in the front Kombucha on tap Great service(shout out to flowers and beans for giving real hospitality) CHEERS UP CHARLIE! I'M DRINKING THIS ONE FOR YOU! 
4755 3 Very good Thai food. Don't let the surrounding area deter you from eating here. Zabelee is great, with friendly service and good food! 
4756 4 I gave this place 5 stars because they deserve it! The food is delicious first and foremost, but the place is very clean and put together and the people are extremely kind! I will most definitely be back! 
4757 4 Noah and Kevin were very professional and efficient. They showed up early and made great use of their time. They were careful with our belongings and very accommodating to my requests on placement. They navigated the 1912 craftsman bungalow stairs and hardwoods like a boss. Highly recommended! 
4758 3 Thanks to Yelp for the event tickets. While this festival was on a smaller scale, there was a good variety of beers/ciders. My favorite item from the festival however was not alcohol, but the maple water. That stuff is awesome. I would go to this festival again for sure :) 
4759 4 I've learned to make the edamame wrap at home, but I still can't get everything quite right, which keeps me coming back. I would eat here every other day if I could. 
4760 4 Had a great experience with my sick cat. The Vet and his assistant were very knowledgeable and identified the problem and explained all my options to get him back to feeling better I will return with my 2 dogs for all their check ups. 
4761 0 I'm not sure if I can really add more to what's already been said. I've used these guys twice (I try to give people a second chance) and both times were truly awful. Incredibly rude, late, lost, etc. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. 
4762 4 Rhododendron flower show is ongoing, great selection and awesome varieties. Nice weather, perfect time to visit this garden. 
4763 4 I have had several alterations done here with pants and dresses because they usually are too long. Everything I have had altered is perfectly fit to me. I appreciate that I can ask last minute and get something back the next day or two from turning it in. Highly recommend! 
4764 3 Totally dependable. It's a great place to have in the neighborhood. Nice wine list and the menu is reasonable. The service is great. 
4765 2 Small but very kid-friendly. They have a really interesting set of desserts that I haven't seen elsewhere. 
4766 2 They were okay, but too sweet. The prices are cheap though. There's a long wait, which wasn't really worth it just for some donuts. 
4767 4 My friend and I stopped by this place on a whim this Friday after having a drink. This place has the most amazing donuts! We got the Mexican hot chocolate and cinnamon and sugar flavors. They were fabulous! The texture, the taste, such detail that made every bite worth savoring! 
4768 4 The food is amazing, and the desserts are authentic I strongly recommend the pionono. My only advice is that I wished the play Argentinian music!!! coming back. Downside, they are closed on Sundays and USA bit pricey but worth every penny! 
4769 4 Nice cute place for drinks! Have may different cocktails and also mixologist can make you whatever you want! Just tell them your taste and they will impress you with their drinks! And their Indian fries OMG!!!!! It's the best fries ever!!!! 
4770 1 Would've given it 4 stars if the staff were courteous ! Lame workers in kitchen ! 
4771 1 I used to love this place but recently quality and taste of kabobs here have recently gone down for some reason. Kabobs are either broken and burned or raw! And they always mess up your order. 
4772 4 Great alterations.... willing to work with you and cost effective. Owned by a woman who does most of the alterations. 
4773 4 Ole!!! I freakin love you...breakfast burrito with bacon and jalapeño ?! Yes please ;) 
4774 2 It's a popular franchise the world over for a reason. Good coffee served quickly. 
4775 2 Good food, outstanding service but my $39 seafood entree did not come with real drawn butter, it came with some kind of oil for dipping. Gross.... you must ask for butter if you don't want artificial grease with your meal 
4776 2 The meatloaf was good, but my vegetables were too salty. The green beans were good, but too much salt was sprinkled on them. The broccoli was way, way, way too salty -- salt overload! Our server was superb! 
4777 4 Quaint little coffee shop is fabulous for studying and getting your coffee fix. Their pastries also look delicious even though I have no yet had one. 
4778 4 This is hands down our new favorite happy hour in Portland. Order a variety of things and enjoy! 
4779 3 Damned good burger! Got a classic burger, added avocado, bacon, and an egg. Yummers. One draw back is my burger fell apart. The meat just didn't feel like being a team player. Whatever, would come back. 
4780 4 This place is full of cookware and other curios. For example, I found a rooster- (er, "cock"-) shaped bottle opener, as well as a small bottle of hand sanitizer whose label reads, "I [Heart] My Penis." Also, maybe I should've bought the wasabi-flavored lip balm. 
4781 4 Wow thanks you folks, got there a few min early , these people really helped me out, huge selection of glass, and about anything you'll need. Awesome parking too which in Boulder is extremely rare. 
4782 3 Nice family run restaurant for breakfast and lunches. Their greek salads are HUGE! My mom and I refuse to get them anywhere else. Be prepared to wait on the weekends. It is worth it! 
4783 4 UNIQUE place connected to a Bakery, two different businesses. Good news is the 'student crowd' is linited, meaning the schleps using chairs as study hall, while buying a small water are few. 
4784 4 Best Chinese food I have had in a long time. Their egg flower soup was delicious! Everything was hot and fresh. The server was pleasant. Only down side was there was no music or background noise. 
4785 3 Good food and great service. Definitely worth the try - the alternative is driving off Disney World or taking a shuttle into Disney Springs. 
4786 4 Great atmosphere and service. The food had great flavor and was out before I knew it. For travelers like myself just a heads up they only take Visa and MasterCard. Will be back for sure and look for there second location opening soon. 
4787 2 Huge sashimi pieces for cheap-- great value! The sushi is huge too--- but have too much rice in them, in my opinion. Go for the Sashimi and you will not be disappointed. 
4788 3 Crispy oysters, frog legs are excellent. I took a group of 25 people here and it was a unanimous thumbs up! Service was exceptional although started slow. The drink quality and choices are very high. 
4789 0 This place will not even answer their phone... Alleged to be the beat florist in Texas!!! 
4790 4 Great prices and great coffee. I got a Samoa cookie flavor that was delicious. I went on opening day and am excited to see small coffee shops popping up around here. 
4791 0 Super slow service...don't go here for lunch if you're on a timed break! 
4792 1 St. Patrick's Day. Crowded (obviously) but good staff and music! However. My drink, whiskey and ginger, was TINY!! Awfully small plastic cup. About 1/3 the size of s normal drink. 
4793 3 Had an americano on my way to my gate on my PDX airport world tour. Hit up a bunch of places here before my morning flight. The coffee was nice, hot and hit the spot. It had good flavor and not too bitter or that burnt flavor. 
4794 3 Was looking forward to this. It didn't seem as high as I thought it would be. Would love to get on at night. Great experience. 
4795 4 A nice classic sub shop with reasonable prices and nice specials. 
4796 4 This place is very good and it was super busy. The meatballs are delicious and they sauce tastes like it has a hint of BBQ sauce in it, which made it even more appealing. The Lasagna bolognese was a huge portion and very meaty. I couldn't finish it! 
4797 3 Both times I've eaten here has been wonderful. Appetizer and a half plate of pasta hits the spot. Great wine list? Desert was not equal in quality to the entree, especially for the price. Love the service! 
4798 2 This Olive Garden offers everything you expect from a chain restaurant: helpful servers, large menu, large portions, and reasonable prices. The only thing that stuck out during our meal was the bartender commenting on our pronouncing gnocchi correctly. What hoot! 
4799 4 Such a cute spot. Great atmosphere. Great shakshuka. And great service. French toast was ok but not impressive. 
4800 4 The units have been renovated recently and have nice esthetics The property manager, Savannah, is the bomb. I'd recommend living here. 
4801 1 My first visit last Tuesday the Chicken Special was great, moist and tasty so I decided to try it again this Tuesday and the chicken was dry and the mashed potatoes were room temperature at best. Both visits were at 6 pm. The service was good. 
4802 4 Followed the yelp reviews and it paid off. Better than Fisherman's Wharf in The City (SFO). Great meal. We are coming back again. 
4803 3 come here for the pie! they are unique, seasonal and simply delicious. the coffee is good too, but i preferred some other pdx varieties more. 
4804 4 This is the best massage I've ever gotten especially considering it only costs $50 for an hour! The whole body massage also includes hot stones and towels. This really helped with pain I was having in my shoulders. Highly recommend! 
4805 4 Exemplary service, a grass-fed beef option, and the best gluten-free bun I have ever tasted, hands down! 
4806 2 MUCH Better than VOO-DOO. I've had donuts I've loved and some I haven't-- like the beignets with fennel pollen dust-- wretched. Very bitter and non-delicious. Jus sayin'. Dough they use is good. Just a plain donut is delicious. Chocolate nice, too. 
4807 3 The mussels were great, as was the gnocchi. Buckhead seems to be at peak saturation with similar restaurants, but Seven Lamps did a great job of standing out with its food and good service. 
4808 2 I went during the day. Decent food and the beer selection was surprisingly good. I'll have to see what the night life is like. 
4809 4 My visit to scoreboard was awesome! The food was delicious, and the costumer service was outstanding. This was truly a five star experience! 
4810 4 As stated in the previous review, I went back for two more tires and once again, everything went like clockwork. In an out in under 45 minutes, great customer service, nice waiting area and a follow-up email the next day. WTG Discount Tire. 
4811 4 We go here pretty regularly and have never been disappointed. Service is incredibly friendly and fast, food is delicious, and the green salsa is the best I've ever had 
4812 0 Awful cleaning. Nothing ended-up to be clean, dirt everywhere, carpet, windows, dash, no exception. The work was done by teenagers, and probably had no training and no equipment. I didn't see any trace of water been used. https://www.facebook.com/pages/US-1-High-End-Auto-Detailing/1652225861675637?sk=timeline 
4813 0 For those looking for a great watch buying experience, I'd suggest paul duggans, bobs watches , and bernard watch. These are businesses I've done business with and have had great experiences with. They all will take in trade for purchases that will give you the most for your watches value. 
4814 4 Carne Asada was perfectly cooked, grilled jalapeño was a nice touch. The salsa was very tasty, I liked the smokiness. Overall a great experience, good service from Alex. 
4815 3 Great seafood, good atmosphere. Food was hot and fresh. Captain's boil sauce medium spicy was great. Lots of garlic, yum! Big mussels. Snow crab legs were good, shrimp excellent. 
4816 0 We order an appetizer while waiting for our food. $80 for a seafood tower. well i was quite desapointed. there is nothing that looks like a tower!! then we waited 90 min and when we asked, they didnt even start our food. Not a great experience as expected! 
4817 3 Wandered in with a friend. We shared medium frites with pork, bacon and gravy. 8/10 would have it again. The variety in the menu is very appealing and I'll defs be back to try more!! 
4818 3 All that stuff y'all said, plus Mariachi Music on weekends, and the only Wells Fargo Bank Branch, hell maybe the only bank branch PERIOD that is..... wait for it........ ....open on Sundays. 
4819 4 Belly bagels are back!!! They are now serving breakfast at the new place that replaced it every morning! These bagels are by far my favorite. so glad they are back. 
4820 4 The food and setting was incredible. Sat on the deck outside overlooking bay pointe The shrimp appetizer was so big you could have it as your meal, surf and turf outstanding and seafood was fresh and plentiful. Great place to go on a summer night 
4821 4 This is our favorite local bar the bartender is great it is good company delicious food and of course a large variety of drinks we go here at all hours during the day and it is always nice 
4822 2 I came in at noon and got the Chicken Gyro.The gyro was a bit dry but a abundant. They are very fast from order to pay, and I was out the door less then a min. After all of the hype I was expecting a more flavorful gyro. 
4823 3 I'm addicted to the dumplings here. Great bubbletea and delicious dinners for only $8. Love the late hours! Lose one star for being cash only, who carries cash anymore?!!! 
4824 4 Order the curry rib noodles. You won't regret it. Chen's noodle house is probably the only place in Austin that you can find authentic knife shaved noodles. This place is a local treasure that I hope never closes. 
4825 4 my favorite place in all of atlanta. get the regular wings (not boneless), a cold beer off draft, kick back and watch some sports. what could be better in this world? 
4826 3 delicious! i recommend going simple -- though all the flavors look amazing, it can be overwhelming! cute decor too. fun to sit and play the where-s waldo type games at the bar. 
4827 4 We got several dishes, all uniquely delicious. The food was great and we will go back again! Try the Gobi 65 as an appetizer and the Chicken Tikka Masala was awesome!! 
4828 3 i love this place. their calendar looks my ipod on shuffle. five stars for constantly booking bands i like. oh, did i just deduct a star for not being able to park anywhere close on the weekends now that the teacher's lot is closed? yes, i did. 
4829 4 I love this place. My wife's birthday was Sunday she had her pick of any place to go to eat. Here was where is wanted to go. It was early so we decided to have the lunch buffet. The food was hot and wonderful and the service was tops. 
4830 4 Excellent gel mani and pedi. I am notorious for not being able to keep gel on for more than 10 days - but I get a minimum of two weeks after going to Bellacquer. 
4831 2 Even though i think it's a waste of money, it is time for this venue to be updated. It's dark and cold. I look forward to seeing the new stadium. 
4832 0 The eggnog was spoiled and I have a stomach bug that will last me through the new year. Happy New Year?! #rolltide #ew 
4833 4 Best Bar in ATX, been going since 2004 Gets bigger and better every-time! Firemans 4, LoneStar on draft! Chris has done a great job. Love Willis he always takes care of you! 5 stars. 
4834 4 Excellent rib eye with Parmesan fries and broccoli. Rib eye cooked perfectly. Great server and nice atmosphere. Will return.... 
4835 2 Not a true Regina Pizzeria experience. The slices are small and undercooked. This place really shouldn't bare the name of Regina Pizzera. If you want pizza go here, but don't expect it to take like a true Regina Pizza. 
4836 3 If you're looking for breakfast this place is tucked away in the North End Italian neighborhood. It's pretty small, pretty basic but pretty good! Wonderful, friendly staff. 
4837 4 I don't know why this place get such negative reviews by some. Over the years, I have used play this business to sharpen everything from kitchen knives, camping/hunting knives, axes, hatchets, and tree loppers. Everything comes back razor-sharp and in a timely manner. 
4838 4 Wow where to start?! Everything from the decor to the food was amazing! The chef personally came out to greet us all. Really unique menu and amazing cocktail list. Would highly recommend. Can't wait to try their sunday brunch! 
4839 4 From drinks to foo and service all was really amazing. I don't know why it took me so long to come here. Strongly recommend and will be back with family and friends for sure! 
4840 4 Beautiful salon. Best place to apply and maintain the "dip" nails. The nail product has the color built in so no possibility of chipped polish. They always have the newest and greatest stuff. 
4841 3 I really liked the Bourbon and Caramel I got here. It was like a booze milkshake. I drank the whole thing and it was great. The burger was ok. I would come back. 
4842 4 Absolutely delicious food. Whether I order the steak tips or the chicken parm it is hot and tasty. The red sauce is a special homemade treat. I have recommended Tony's to friends and family alike. 
4843 3 Great shop - service is good, but not necessarily fast Ed is a solid business owner. Check out second location on 4th Avenue 
4844 4 the owner is an amazing lady and very nice to talk to. a friend and i went as newcomers and she was so helpful with technique and such! 
4845 3 I really enjoy this Italian style cafe. The upstairs of the house makes a great place to hideaway and do some work. I love that they're serving locally roasted 49th parallel beans. 
4846 4 I have zero comprehension why this place doesn't have better reviews! They have one of my favorite happy hours in town. 4-6 every day even on weekends. Try the fingerling potatoes and purple mountain oysters! 
4847 4 Dr. Nikhilesh was very personable and thorough during a routine check. Best dental experience I've had in the Cambridge/Somerville area. 
4848 0 The guy is a asshole. Every time I've seen him interact with anyone he's yelling. Been to the food carts multiple times and it never changes. Angry old man. 
4849 3 My family and I loved it! I recommend the Blackened Fish and Carnita street tacos! The taste is fresh and the time proves it. They took a while cooking our food but it was worth it. That was the only problem: the time. 
4850 4 Dr. Bellville was excellent, took her time with us and really checked our dog over. Highly recommend this office. The staff was friendly and professional. 
4851 0 I ordered pickup twice this week. Today I found a bug in my salad. I probably won't go back. 
4852 3 Yummy pretty good for the money. Jason was our waiter we had the FISH OUT OF WATER and fries with the fried Gouda Mac and cheese 
4853 4 Alterations Unlimited is amazing! I brought in a bridesmaid dress that was 4 sizes too big and the woman who helped me worked magic and altered it PERFECTLY!! I can't thank her enough for her work and I'll definitely be back! 
4854 0 Terrible customer service! Heavy set man who works in the office was rude and condescending. I had a hard time doing the self checkout and asked for help, he was being really rude during the whole thing. Never been to a place with such poor service. 
4855 3 Delicious food, attentive staff, decent prices, and cute decor. I give two thumbs up on the goddess pizza. They also have an excellent selection of microbrews! 
4856 4 All I have to say is "Chicken Shwarma Plate" with "Tabouli" on the side!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
4857 4 Love, love, love Lucile's. The biscuits and homemade jam are awesome. Super cool vibe - can be busy on the weekends so we prefer to visit as a weekday treat :-) Absolutely recommend! 
4858 2 Just got my usually chilli zucchini bowl, but not sure if they gave me the soup or someone just when HAM with the yum sauce. It's too much sauce. 
4859 2 Didn't understand what the big whoop was about. It's a good burger but just as good as P.Terry's, not worth the line. 
4860 3 Came here for brunch and really loved the unique cocktails they had. Bloody mary was super good and the beignets I got were amazing. I read the yelp reviews recommending the beignets and they did not disappoint! Seriously amazin 
4861 4 Meire is a reliable cleaner who does very thorough work. Highly recommended! 
4862 0 Almost literally half of my orders the times I have been here have been wrong. I used to think it was a language barrier but even ordering food online is the same way. So inconsistent. Either the staff or the chef's do not understand what's on their own menu 
4863 3 Good bakery, great prices. I love stopping in here. 
4864 4 I love Varnish. I've been going there for a for just under a year now and I've always been really happy with the service and results. 
4865 4 Arrived at 10:14 for late night happy hour - drinks came fast and so did the food ( we knew what we wanted) always delicious ! This is my regular late night spot. 
4866 4 Best flo filet ever! Been to plenty of longhorns in Kentucky and here n there, but the chef here takes the cake tonight!!! Ribs were fall off the bone! What a dinner. Bartender had amazing attitude and great personality! What a dinner!!!! 
4867 2 Typical Wendy's, nothing special besides they close early. So if you're looking for food late night you're going to have to drive down to 270. 
4868 3 Always quick to be seated. Wait staff is very friendly. Food is yummy. This is my favorite place to go for yummy Mexican up north. Great food and great prices. 
4869 4 place is Great with a Capital G... cold coronas and good salsa, food comes quick and tastes authentic. I'll be here often 
4870 2 I found their service to be a little snooty at times, and the products not particularly effective while carrying a price tag on the heftier side. 
4871 4 So so good. This is Portland fine dining defined. Amazing service, wonderful atmosphere, the chef cane out and said hello. A truly extraordinary dining experience! 
4872 4 Great service very nice people. I have been here several times and one of my go to Thai spots. Tom Kha is delicious and pad khee mao are my favorites! 
4873 4 The PHO authentic and amazing! The large bowl is enough to feed two people! I went during the day but this is normally a popular place and very busy! Friday and weekend are very busy! They have various types of dishes for your taste! 
4874 4 legit tapas, treat to have in Woburn, staff are friendly and in middle of town. parking a bit tough. 
4875 4 Timm and his crew did an amazing job on our pool deck and concrete areas. Highly recommended!!! 
4876 4 Hands down the best (vegan) tacos I've ever had in my life. Wow!!!! Must try!!!!!! Loved everything about it. The patio space was also cute and chill. Prices on point. 
4877 0 Ordered food for delivery. It arrived super late and when I called to enquire about the order, a very rude person answered the call. 
4878 3 Update: I visited the other day and had the Italian Grinder. It was great! I also enjoyed the Hop On! IPA. The experience was even better then last time out. 
4879 4 We just had a ton of pressure washing and windows done with them and they did a great job. Everything looks so clean! They showed up right on time too which was an added bonus. So happy to have found them! 
4880 3 mmm mmmm mmmm - VERY nice Indian food, great service (funny owner but he means well :) ) We love going there - eat as much as you can and they keep piling it on.. you wont go hungry and the food is delich! enjoy!! 
4881 3 Good food. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala with an order of naan bread. I had to order it as take out, but I was surprised at how great the quality and taste of the food was after a 10-15 minute drive home. I will definitely be back!!! 
4882 3 A friend told me to try this place out and well i was not disappointed! My usual is the cookies n cream with vanilla soft serve. They offer free samples so gives you a chance to find what you'll like. The place can get pretty busy on the weekends. 
4883 0 I ordered food from China Wok one week ago and got so sick I ended up going to the ER. Hospital told me I had salmonella poisoning. Please keep this in mind before ordering from this restaurant. I don't want anyone else getting as sick as I did. 
4884 4 The tower is incredible. The shaded paths are lovely. The flowers are always in bloom in the spring. It's magical. 
4885 4 Went there for lunch today and what a great find! I can't believe I didn't go to Raglan sooner. The pull pork sandwich is amazing and so were the yam fries (cut like potato chips but thicker). Definitely will be going back there. 
4886 4 Fantastic menu selection. Crab cakes 2 for $15. Side of herb risotto $5 both dishes really delicious. Salmon dinner with 2 sides. $24 Salmon grilled to perfection. Moist, tasty not overcooked. Chocolate mousse on the next table looked so good but we were full. 
4887 4 This was my 3rd time ordering from Wingnuts in 2 weeks and it was great. The guy who owns the place is soo nice and is always making sure we have everything. The boneless wings are the best. 
4888 2 It was so so. I mean so so is hard to explain in words. The best way to say it is; its inexpensive and very filling. However I have had better for the same price. The sushi just seemed warm. I usually like my sushi a little cold. 
4889 4 I got a tattoo from Erika in March 2017. She crafted my tattoo based off of a couple images I got off of google and it was perfect. Highly recommend anyone at New Rose the studio is awesome!!! They were very professional and friendly. 
4890 4 It was our first time and we loved it good service and even better food the prawn basket was amazing and a huge portion we will be back for sure .....oh and loved the jalapeño tarter sauce was terrific. 
4891 4 Had a great experience. Brought in a total junker I needed to use for a few days at burning man. Paramount did a very basic tune up, just enough to work in the desert, and didn't charge much for the trouble. Would definitely go back again! 
4892 3 I love their soul food. It outshines their BBQ. They do their oxtails & rice perfectly with a little kick of spice. Someone put their foot in the greens. For folks that don't know the saying, it's a huge compliment to the chef. One star missing for lack of seating. 
4893 3 The car selection was fair, but checking in and then having to wait to be escorted to a vehicle took a while, and then having to wait at the exit point to wait for paper work is taking to long. Need to use a system similar to National Car Rental. 
4894 4 Love this place. Small but the food is fantastic. Chef special seafood salad is my fav. Octopus, salmon shrimp and tuna over greens. Very flavorful and best of all not over cook. Perfect. 
4895 4 I had the most amazing stay at this hotel! The concierge Sheri made feel at home and so comfortable I would recommend this place to everyone. Awesome! 
4896 4 Great barber shop with a very reasonable price. Katrina cuts my hair and always does a great job. Always consistent and always remembers exactly how I like my hair cut too. Give this place a try. 
4897 4 great food , good services , upscale interior decoration , have a delivery services too. will definitely comeback for some more tangerine beef and general tso chiken. btw its my first time and wont be the last , thumbs up !! 
4898 1 Great desserts but the service is unbelievably slow. Order immediately and ask for the check as soon it arrives otherwise you will be waiting awhile. 
4899 2 it was ok overall food drinks where all ok bartender was nice forgot his nmae big black guy 
4900 4 Sean and Paul are freaking awesome!!! love them! 
4901 4 We had the chef tasting menu with wine pairing and we were blown away! Everything was perfect. The dishes were innovative and perfectly executed. Best food we had in Austin in years. Service was great and super friendly. Thank you Nitza, Stefan and all the chefs for an amazing night. 
4902 0 If I could give less for customer service I would.. they tell you all kinds of things when u ask questions and the reality is opposite and later the staff actually tries to prove you wrong when u tell them their statements! 
4903 0 Bad, rude service/low quality sushi/expensive. Don't waste your money here, it'd be more satisfying to burn it with a zippo. 
4904 3 Was fun had a great time.. family friendly great place to take the kids out and enjoy the sun... only wish parking was alittle more convenient when it's pack it's pack... super busy with tons of car all fighting for parking... 
4905 4 The most amazing green chile pork queso fries!!! The hamburger and fries was delicious and juicy and flavorful! The drinks...just delicious! And they let babies come in! 
4906 4 Food is ALWAYS good! Service is usually above average. If you don't mind eating on the patio or in the bar, you can usually skip the wait for a table. I eat here once every week or two and it never disappoints! 
4907 4 The service is particularly good here, the staff is always friendly and attentive. The burgers are excellent as well. Great neighborhood spot. 
4908 0 Terrible teenage chefs over cook not-so-fresh seafood. Service was lackluster at best. Pain to get to as you will be frisked by homeland security. I had better food at a Red Lobster - now that's just sad isn't it 
4909 4 We love this cupcakes! always diverse and moist and for so far very consistent. totally recommended. 
4910 4 owner and staff have always been helpful and knowledgable. I think they are honest and very reasonably priced. I don't think you'll find a better place in Portland to take your vehicle! 
4911 2 They arrived on time and the driver was friendly, but the cab smelled awful and had cigarette ash everywhere. That whole NO SMOKING sign in the cab apparently is just a suggestion. 
4912 2 Good, consistent shawarma and falafel at this old trusty standby. 
4913 3 Perfectly acceptable DD. Quick service, good coffee, and clean establishment. 
4914 0 Customer service was excellent but the food there is horrible for my opinion maybe I ate too much but as soon as I got home I threw everything up 
4915 4 BEST pork shank ever. Love the ambiance and love the staff! The chefs pretty hot too! 
4916 4 Amazing craft beers, locally made and good sale prices. I like giving my hard earned money to these nice people in exchange for delicious seasonal booze. They frequently hold tastings and carry a lot of harder to find items. 
4917 4 I LOVE THIS PLACE! Uniformly positive experience. Great 50's diner decor, friendly staff, short wait, fantastic food (and value; $25 for two), family friendly. Even the other customers were lovely. We'll make a point to come back the next time we're in Columbus. 
4918 2 Nice people run the shop, but it is too hot; they are Asian and they don't like A/C! They have TV, but they only have about 13 basic channels. 
4919 2 Visiting from out of town, happened across this great little place for lunch. Family run, friendly staff. Sushi is carefully prepared and good, and we were surprised at the quantity. The bento box sets are plentiful, good variety, good price. 
4920 2 This was a very mediocre italian restaurant. The bread was the highlight of the meal. The zucchini with goat cheese would have been good it had been served hot. My pasta with fontina cream sauce was ok, but nothing to write home about. I probably won't be back. 
4921 2 Staff was very nice - much better than I was expecting! Food was good and there was a nice selection. Place was neat and clean 
4922 4 Love this location. I work nearby and stop by several times a week. The bagels and other items are amazing, but more importantly the service is so fun and friendly. The gals that work there make our mornings better! 
4923 3 It's a nice change from some of the other Thai offerings in Boston. Enjoyed the freshly made foods. 
4924 4 My go to tapas place in Austin. Great selection of tapas! A bit outside downtown area but worth the drive. 
4925 4 Delicious food + wonderful service - Posto is a new favorite. The gnocchi is masterful. 
4926 3 Victor was great! Helped me out with car mats. 
4927 4 Extremely reliable and safe drivers. We use this shuttle service very frequently and appreciate that they will arrive both to our home or pickup at the airport on time. I would very much recommend them. 
4928 3 I ended up here on accident today because I was super early for an interview, but loved the coffee and marionberry scone I had. Better yet the service was top-notch. If I get that position down the street, I imagine I'll be a regular here. 
4929 1 Its ok. Big weirdly configured room, nice service. Full service restaurant/bar. Its ok. Close to the airport, and won't break your wallet 
4930 0 Wrong delivery day. No vase included, which I paid for. Third call to customer service answered after 17 rings. No callbacks yet, after 7 days. Would never recommend-will never use again. Worst floral experience ever. 
4931 3 The best Chinese restaurant in coquitlam. The dishes they serve are delicious and always consistent. 
4932 3 Love Devan..... he gets 5 stars. Handy has moved up to 4 in my book because of Devan. Had some bad experiences with a no show and incompetent disorganized cleaners. When you find a good one if you can keep them coming back it works great. 
4933 3 Noodles at their finest! Love the hole in the wall atmosphere and the food is great. So much better than Chen Z. Ill make the extra drive and you should also! 
4934 4 Our cat developed skin allergies and after multiple tests and unanswered questions we were referred to SkinVet Clinic. Dr. Plant and his assistant were kind and helpful. Was not shocked by the bill, which is always a good thing! 
4935 4 We agree with Dillion. The food is authentic and you have to be a true Chinese food lover to understand. 
4936 3 i like the place in the afternoon, for late lunch... cold beer.... the menu got redone a little bit ago and i am making my way thru it!!!!! I have not been disappointed!!!! Cudos kids, keep up the good work!!!! 
4937 4 Throw on your dancing shoes!!!. This restaurant/ lounge is absolutely wonderful. Great food, customer service and energy. This is a great place to go with a group of friends. 
4938 0 Received the absolute worst customer service experience in a long while from the night shift employee named Patrick. Extremely rude on the phone with a completely unwarranted attitude. That's not how you treat customers. I'm never staying here and if I could submit this review with zero stars, I would. 
4939 4 I love this place. I stop by every time I'm in PDX and I've never been disappointed. The chicken and waffles and blackberry basil lemonade are the best! 
4940 4 Loved the chicken and waffles! Amazing! Awesome service! Great ambience and love the decor. Overall wonderful experience and would come back again if I'm ever in the area again! 
4941 3 Their lunch bento boxes are the bomb. Kinda expensive for dinner, but reasonable for lunch. Service is slow so get the take out. 
4942 3 Great location. Clean. Friendly staff. Great food. Tables are small for the way they serve their meals (everything on a different plate). Overall, it was a good dining experience, and I'll be back. 
4943 4 COLOR IS PERFECT. waiting to see how it fades throughout the week, but this place is no joke. Such a job well done. 
4944 2 Decent place to go for lunch if working the square. Has the Boston Chowda company..great lobster bisque and other soups, a burger place, Ben & Jerrys, Pho Posteur. The stores definitely cater to the teenage "alternative" crowd...not very exciting for those of us well past puberty. 
4945 3 Really cool food truck. Can't say enough about the flavor of the tacos I ordered. Plenty of spice and flavor with a little kick but without the pain. Would definitely order again if I see them around again. 
4946 4 The best wax place in Atlanta!!! Ms. Claudia is the only person i will let wax me in atl, period. Staff is always nice and helpful. Offer many services and discounts throughout the year. 10stars ! 
4947 2 was there for Portland Dining month. nice atmosphere, nice customer service. Food wasn't impressive. 
4948 4 One of the best pho places here in Portland!!! The size portion is decent, the soup and meats are in good quality. I just wish I live close by and can come here to eat everyday. 
4949 2 Nice hotel, with good rates for the area. We paid 46$ and were content with the value for the money spent. 
4950 4 Good combinations; good balance in the Berry Dose, strawberry and banana didn't overpower which is highly unusual. Chocolate Factory was incredibly silky and delicious as well 
4951 3 Cleanest pho joint I've visited so far. Love how the store is bright and clean. Service was fast and friendly. Food is decent; average quality nothing too special/memorable about it. 
4952 3 Love this place! So close to my house I wish I went here sooner. Food was delicious and the price was great. The people helping us were so friendly. I will definitely keep coming back. 
4953 3 Love the ambience, Decent Veggie food. The deserts were great. 
4954 4 OMG new fave! BIRHTDAY PARTY in my cone! that is the best! they are all good though! SAMPLES! 
4955 4 They have a very comprehensive selection of quality, reasonably-priced products for vegans. 
4956 3 Just went here this weekend with friends for breakfast. Customer service was wonderful, customers around me were friendly & happy. Their menu was quality and my breakfast muffin and coffee was top shelf. So happy Bob's Red Mill is in our area. 
4957 4 Excellent selection of plants and gardening supplies. Plants all seem healthy and well taken care of and staff is very helpful. Also have gardening events on occasion :) 
4958 4 Great wings especially on Tuesdays. Too bad they are closed for remodeling until August 2nd. 
4959 4 This is truly an amazing space! If your looking for a peaceful place to practice, you need to try Sanctuary Yoga Studio. 
4960 3 Very delicious. Great ambience. The servers not very friendly. Pricey!!! $47.50 breakfast for two and no, we did not order mimosas, lol. 
4961 3 Damn good Sandwich (Porchetta) We ordered it take-away for the Plane ride back to Honolulu. They put mustard inside which was really good. We noticed Meat & Bread as we were walking back from Nuba where we had a really good lunch. 
4962 3 Delicious pizza! My only complaint would be they need a bigger space. They would definitely thrive off of more atmosphere. 
4963 1 Where can I get good fried chicken? I thought with a name like Famous chicken I would get good chicken. Well the service was good and the wait was not long. But the food was not up to par. I'd say if you're looking for famous chicken go to Popeyes. 
4964 1 customer service COMMUNICATION needs to be improved. If you can order online then someone should be monitoring those orders and not wait an entire day for an email that states "we can't fill your order". We want to try the cake but can't :( 
4965 4 Great service, our large order of food was out promptly! Friendly staff, Judith took our large order without any difficulty. 
4966 4 Cool place. Sushi with outdoor seating. Some very interesting rolls. Get the dynamite shrimp or you will lose sleep due to overwhelming regret. 
4967 0 We ordered the number one with combo. Tasted very normal. IT'S JUST A NORMAL HOTDOG. But more expensive. The fries was a failure. McDonald's even taste better than theirs. Place wasn't clean. The table was dirty. 
4968 0 Absolutely horrible service. Staff is slow and very cold. Makes the atmosphere awkward and unwelcoming. 
4969 2 Was so excited for real Spanish food and this is just not the place, unfortunately. Wah wah! Try again! I wish I read the bad reviews before we went. Bleh. Of the patatas bravas, fried calamari and shishito peppers, none were good. 
4970 0 Horrrible!! Waited 90 minutes for a 5 min ride!!! The inside where we waited was exciting than the actual ride. What a waste of my time. If the wait time is more than 10 min. Skip it please. Save yourself the disappointment!! 
4971 3 I love love Pizza Hut. Food is delicious fresh and fax. My kid's like to eat Pizza Hut everyday Some time they have very good deal too. 
4972 3 decent burger...not the best but I will def go back.. 
4973 2 I really enjoyed my meal here a few months back. I have tried to go back twice now, both times, closed. Tried to go for lunch today, checked the website, they are open for lunch Fridays.... But not today, under renovations? No indication on the website. What's the deal Habaneros? 
4974 4 Tiffany was awesome!!! We had a great meal, great atmosphere and great food!! The Belgian Tour flight was great, Tiffany recommended it and it lived up to her billing. 
4975 2 Hours of operation are hit and miss to be honest, however, they do an awesome meat and cheese platter. I've had their platter on many occasions. They give a good assortment of meats and cheeses of different variety. I haven't eaten anything other than their platters. 
4976 4 Just got a much needed haircut, shave from Gabriel at Ritchie's. This is a real barber shop! Feels like home. Great prices too! 
4977 2 Meh. It's a bar. It has bar food. It needs service. It needs to not overcharge for things you didn't order. It's a big city with lots of choices. You decide. 
4978 2 Burgers and burgers. I recommend the avocado club ! It's a common chain around here in Columbus Ohio. It seems clean and tidy. Great place. 
4979 4 Try the Goodnight burger and the spinach salad. Probably not worth a 2 hour wait, but if there is no line, go for it. Food is delicious and if you aren't dieting, the specialty shakes are not to be missed. 
4980 4 Delicious and fresh eggs Benedict and grits!! Great service and open early on the weekends. Definitely worth a visit. 
4981 1 Fast delivery... But the food was not that great very oily. I ordered the lo mein and was just not appealing and ended up throwing it away. The chicken wings as mentioned in previous reviews are huge but they lack in taste also. 
4982 4 One of the best Punjabi food I've eaten. Very authentic with a homely feeling. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for good Indian food. 
4983 0 Ew, I hate Spelp. In case my previous reviews weren't really clear, this is the worst doctor, with the worst office and worst staff, I've ever been to. It's a den of horrible. Take it from a real person, not an Orangehead. 
4984 4 THE best place for frozen yogurt :) All the flavors are handmade and fresh so anytime I'm back in town I make sure to stop in. Bright lights, clean store, delicious flavors, good pricing, and a sweet staff. What more can you ask for? 
4985 4 Annie was awesome in doing the massage in the specific problem area that i have. Will Definitely come back to her :) 
4986 3 Bacco is good. Not the best food in the world, but certainly good. I came for restaurant week, so the prices that everyones complaining about didn't factor in. The service was a little slow, but the drinks were really good, so that made up for it. 
4987 3 the food is different and delicious Big portions and I had left overs Will come here again 
4988 0 They did not treat me well, I feel they saw a younger female and decided not to try with me. Never heard from them again. I have experience and I write 50 wpm. I am not a waste of time. 
4989 4 I love love love it there! They're awesome they have great prices and they know exactly what to do to have you walking out of there refreshed & relaxed. The older Chinese gentleman is the best there, he is highly trained in his field, I request him every time! 
4990 4 Wow great pizza and cheap strong drinks!!! I've been back five times since this review and they never fail 
4991 0 I really wanted to like this place after reading the reviews. I got the combination plate to taste a bit of everything, but it failed miserably. Forget what you heard, definitely pass on this. 
4992 4 The guy who sits on the very first row in the corner and Michelle are really good with shape here! Very nice they take there time 
4993 0 I don't know where these other folks went...mediocre service and they could not get the order right on several folks. Including me twice. I am not coming back here for " the best burgers in Atlanta " the place is pretentious, underserved and truly overrated 
4994 3 Post baby snack! Milkshakes on point. They were quick to give us our order. Great service. 
4995 4 Awesome! Great customer service. I didn't even know you could have blinds repaired until a blind shop referred me here. Excellent repairs, speedy, no nonsense. These guys know their stuff. Worth the drive to support this small business! I won't go anywhere else for blind repairs. 
4996 4 Great food, quick service and nice atmosphere. The corned beef hash was delicious. It was "home made." You can tell it was fresh meat and potatoes and not from a can. I can't wait to go back! 
4997 4 The gentleman that we dropped our 5 month old off with was friendly and other dogs seemed to be excited getting there. Just picked her up, she's exhausted!!! They said she did great, and more importantly it seems like she enjoyed herself. We will be regulars. 
4998 3 Still great after all this time. It fills up fast on Saturday night so be sure to get there early (not a moment past 6) or be prepared to wait. We were five and they happily accommodated us, if not a bit squished. Great mojitos and great food. 
4999 4 Best meat knish and corned beef sandwich outside of Manhattan. 
5000 4 Love to coming here, foods are delicious, specialty kimchi fire rice. Big place but a little bit old , sometimes they don't have enough servers so you gotta wait; but still worth. 
5001 4 Best beer selection in Newton. Wine, too. A nice deli counter and some good gourmet groceries, cheeses, etc. The people there are helpful too -- they really know their stuff. 
5002 2 Big dad with Mac n cheese. I was fooled by the pics they had for the big dad. The sand which presentation looked like just two breads & small amount of meat hidden inside. Mac was a bit tasteless. Felt like Elementary cafeteria food in all. 
5003 2 is it just me, or is the produce section really small? it feels like a watered down version. they didn't have bananas or artichokes last time i went. whaaaaaaats the deal, safeway? 
5004 4 Crowded on a Monday night at closing time!! Do I care? Nope because the burger was awesome!! Atmosphere was hopping with hipsters and young people. You have to try and when you do you will go back. 
5005 4 We booked a 50th birthday party with Premier Party Cruises on Sunday afternoon and everyone had a grand time! The captain & crew were awesome! Next time we plan a party on a boat - it will be with Premier Party Cruises again! They are top-notch! 
5006 4 Sissy K's is absolutely Amazing and a people friendly environment. The bartender Cat is the greatest.. highly recommended if you are in the Faneuil Hall area 
5007 2 Catchy name, looks great online but was disappointed with the meat quality. Service is good friendly people working there but way too pricey for the lack of quality. The turkey breast has a strange taste it made my sandwich not enjoyable. 
5008 3 As always, oyster was very good. Fish and chipa was just average. (Jo fortes was best, personally) Mussels was also medium taste. Beer and cocktail was delicious. Dessert was most delicious one. Server was attentive and nice. 
5009 4 Went in for a State Inspection after reading all of the great reviews. And they were spot on. Fast service. Friendly. Many thanks! 
5010 4 Love this place! Always consistent, never messes up my order, good price and fast!!! Win-win!!! 
5011 4 Been coming here since it was District 7. Liked it then. Love it now! This is my go to spot in Malden. Great beers. Great bartender. Great times. 
5012 4 Probably the best Jamaican Food I have ever had. Bang for the buck.. Definitely going to keep visiting. 
5013 4 I had the Pad ke mou ( drunken noodle) It was very fresh ingredients and very tasty. friends had lo-mein...also amazing. 
5014 4 They squeezed me in on NYE last minute. The service was great and the experience was super relaxing. Also, my hair looks nice :) 
5015 4 Great place. Went there for our anniversary. Both the food and service were fantastic. The kakuni is a must-try. 
5016 2 Inexpensive, tasty street food. Sloppy service. Longer than average wait times. The location is good, and since the neighboring competition operate at much higher standards, there really isn't a reason to come here over anywhere else in Decatur. 
5017 2 very good fries plus liege waffles. the home made nutella sauce is very nice 
5018 4 Superb! That's all u need to know. Seriously. Great staff - friendly, pleasant, cool. Decor - fresh, contemporary. Food - inexpensive, delicious, extremely fulfilling, sexy. Variety of options. Strongly recommend them. 
5019 1 The food was just ok, very pricey for breakfast. Inside is dated. Gravy didn't have much flavor or pieces of sausage. Would not eat there again. 
5020 4 Food is a bit expensive but really good. Love the Veggie Biryanni and garlic naan. 
5021 2 Ordered chicken and waffles and the meal came out luke warm where it was almost room temperature. :( other than that, the chicken tasted good. As for service, it was great and the place has a southern charm with a mix of some "hipster" vibe. 
5022 3 The bowls are so yummy! I come here almost once a week and have never been disappointed in them! The workers are are nice as well. My only complaints: not too crazy about the tortas and as far as the atmosphere, they often have the music on way too loud. 
5023 4 Love it!! Great mom & pop shop!! Friendly, food was great (western omelet) my dad got the rodeo special he loved it and the prices are very reasonable!! Will go back again!! 
5024 3 Food was mediocre and expensive. Service for great. I wish I could give 3.5 stars. I do understand that its the domain area, so I may again for the ramen. 
5025 4 This hotel is conveniently located near North Station and the TD Garden. Staff was friendly, room was clean, and beds were very comfortable. Great experience. I would definitely recommend this hotel. 
5026 3 Good food, service and wine. The interior was a bit loud, but overall, the ambiance was nice. 
5027 2 Tasty, but over priced for what little food we received. The soup and cheese appetizer was so small we had to hold back giggling. We felt like we were in a Portlandia skit. Left hungry and underwhelmed. Highlights were the cookie, service and ambiance. 
5028 4 Delicious food and helpful staff. Every item was well prepared and never over cooked. Even the salad was properly flavored. 
5029 4 great food! took an Uber to get here from our hotel. whats in the beans? they are the best i ever had. The lengua tacos were amazing! 
5030 4 Fantastic service here. Ann did an incredible job with my pedicure. Stone massage was SO relaxing. Then Angel did the solar nails. Beautiful. So friendly and excellent customer service. Everything super clean. Highly recommended. 
5031 3 A lovely surprise. Had a very nice meal, interesting menu, helpful/friendly staff and a very good space with plenty of parking. definitely will return and highly recommend. 
5032 4 This is a real Japanese restaurant with variety of small dishes. Very delicious and authentic. Unlike many over priced Japanese restaurants which use cheap materials and run by non Japanese, this is actually a real deal, one of the best in Boston. 
5033 3 Underrated little park. Nice walking trail. Decent play areas for kids. Places to fly kites or drones, and an okay dog park. Overall not a bad little spot. 
5034 4 One of the best place for Hot Pot!!!! If you love seafood or meat dish, this is the place. If you like spicy food, omg, bring a fire truck to help put out the spicy feel. 
5035 4 Great place for seafood. Not a huge platter/combo selection but they are awesome at what they make. Amazing flavors! 
5036 0 Terrible pizza, poor service. Grilled chicken on the Caesar was good. I think this place is one way Boston puts one over on unsuspecting New Yorkers. The pizza here is not even close to good, traditional NY pizza. NY should sue. :) 
5037 2 The food is pretty authentic, which means be careful what you order, a lot of it greasy and gristly. The place seems none to hygenic on the inside either. But some of the food is dynamite. It is usually crowded and noisy and has a kind of no frills atmosphere. 
5038 3 Taco Tuesday is great deal and get yummy four rivers BBQ to enjoy. Wish you can add a side for a dollar or two more instead of normal pricing. 
5039 3 The server was rushing us to order. We ordered 15 wings and got one thing of ranch, seriously? Then make us pay for the second one we clearly need for 15 wings. The food was good and came out fast. 
5040 3 Good German traditional food plus pub food. Great selection of beers. Sports bar atmosphere. 
5041 2 Decent beer, but not so impressive menu. I'm not sure what they are trying for here. When I go out for beers I want regular food, not some crazy olive, foi gras, duck fat grilled burger. Just have normal food please. 
5042 0 Extremely dirty, slow service. It's a shame really because we use to love SteaknShake. 
5043 4 Khadija was awesome!! Love my lashes! Can't wait to go back, I think this is going to be my new addiction. 
5044 3 Group fitness classes with Janelle, Brad, Abe, Colleen and Melanie all rock! If you want to work up a good sweat, drop in and don't forget your water bottle. :-) 
5045 4 Love this studio A great selection of classes and easy to sign up 
5046 4 Lyn was awesome. My first time in a shop and she walked me through all the choices and helped me weed through the jibber jabber. I'll be back! 
5047 1 Meh, indeed. I *want* to like this place. I really do. I *try* to like this place. But it's so generic. So bland. So blah. They could do so much better. But it's like they're not even trying anymore. I'm bored just thinking about it. 
5048 1 This Naked Fish location, while once decent, has been closed for months and has been replaced by "Lucille's Fine Chicken" 
5049 3 Their food is always great, but I think their service could be a little better. For some reason I am never too crazy about their hostesses, but love the place anyways because of their delicious food. 
5050 3 Its always really good. I went during lunch. Super busy. It was pretty packed. I usually get a meat combo. I like their ribs and smoked chicken wings. Brunswick stew is pretty basic. They do have nice chunks of meat in there. 
5051 0 Showed up for an inspection at 5:30 and the guy told me that he had just turned the machine off. Why advertise with a giant STATE INSPECTION advert if you're going to only have it open selected hours that don't match the hours of your business. 
5052 4 Best service, great promise of delivery expectations, flavor of venison is the best we have ever had hands down for processing, very professional staff. Hudson's will be our go to for meat processing for life! 
5053 4 Food and service is always on point- never a disappointment. Our server Helen was super sweet, attentive and quick! Great spot- don't miss out! 
5054 4 Great experience! I made reservations for four at 8pm and they were ready for us when we arrived. We walked in, got seated and drinks came shortly there after. The DJ and band were AWESOME! I had blackened salmon, grits and spinach and it was delicious. Strongly recommend BQE!! 
5055 4 Thanks to Josh, Matt, Adam, and everyone at JRA cycles for their friendly, expert, and economical work on my bike! Every interaction and communication instance with JRA has been pleasant and if I need anything for my bike or any repair I am heading right there. 
5056 4 The meat pastries for an appetizer were great. I love the puff pastry. For an entree I got the Iskander and it was delicious and it was a large portion. The atmosphere and service were great too! 
5057 4 I really like this shop. Great people and GREAT service. Amazing selection of upper end eyewear too! 
5058 3 Nice place. Good ambience, friendly staff and good service. The food was very good. No complaints. 
5059 4 Great atmosphere, above average food, great drink menu. they're busy but our servers were attentive. make reservations, they get busy. cant' really go wrong with any of their plates. great date place. 
5060 3 I had the rice and black beans only. The beans were really good! I also loved the salsa bar. 
5061 1 Friendly staff one star, location one star. Chai tea $4 for medium I've had way better. Pastry dry & half the size of the one in the case. Cookie a few days old. Coffee of the day good. 
5062 4 Ate here last night. Food was excellent! Great atmosphere that is intimate but not crowded. Great hospitality. I highly recommend the Galbi (short ribs) and spicy pork bulgolgi. The signature cocktails were also quite good. 
5063 4 I was lucky enough to attend a soft opening there with my family and they did it buffet style. The food was all wonderful and everyone was extremely gracious. My favorite was a vegetable dish (not sure what it was), the tempura veggies, and the sushi! Try all the things!! 
5064 4 Amazing Biryani! By far the best I've ever had. All their variations are top notch and I recommend you try them all! 
5065 4 Awesome people, great food... everything I've had here has been delicious... Cozy and casual, and you can bring your dog! 
5066 1 Cash only. The food was mediocre. Service, other than seating, was non-existent. This place is known for their broth, which I found just OK. Not worth the 30 minute wait to get a seat. ~$10 a bowl...Personally I'd rather have Pho. 
5067 3 The wings were really good, the pulled pork sandwich was good. For some reason all the draft beers were out when I came and the bottled list isn't that impressive. A for food, C for beer selection. The space is nice and they have a cool outdoor patio area. 
5068 3 The food was yummy. Servers were friendly and thoughtful. House wine was actually good. Prices are reasonable. Atmosphere is casual but not at all dumpy. 
5069 4 I have been to other nail salon here in Austin but this one is good quality with very affordable price.I encounter a not very good pedicurist but that does not represent the business and a lot of them are really good. 
5070 4 This was my first time here, and they did not disappoint. I got the captain crunch doughnut. It was sooo good. My mom loved the butterfinger and blueberry doughnut. The employees were very friendly and helpful. I can't wait to try something else the next time I'm in Austin 
5071 3 They only do natural nails but they do them so well. No machines just pure talent. The free drink is nice and the shop is nice and serene. The technicians are nice and good at what they do. 
5072 4 I have grown so much in my relationship with God because of this church. My teenage children LOVE the inside out program. I have been involved with small groups for the last 6 years and have been able to surround myself with good Christian friendships. What a blessing! 
5073 2 had the matcha custard cup which was just okay, I didn't try the food, bread or pastries but I'd def go back if I'm in the area 
5074 4 Good atmosphere and energy! Janae is awesome and sexy ;-). Think I will try their food...stay tuned 
5075 4 Best drive thru experience I've ever had. Laura was so pleasant. She greeted us so politely and was great with taking our long awkward order. She made our day! 
5076 1 Meh. I've experienced better. Not a very memorable meal. It was similar to Panda Express but worse... :( 
5077 4 Our family loves this place. We have so many beef noodle soups before. I think this place is good for 5 stars. We will return again when we visit. 
5078 4 fantastic food, super friendly staff, awesome cocktails! everything is great - I recommend the Jackfruit Flautas, Crab Cake Benedict... oh, everything is great! 
5079 3 It is what it is. OK service, good chicken fried chicken and mashed potatoes, Ok burger. Not bad if you are in neighborhood watching movie at regal have a quick beer and walk to Cinema. Good fries tho. 
5080 4 Lily is AWESOME!! She made Marathon Monday awesome! You rock girl! Good food, good atmosphere, but even better rock star service 
5081 3 We see Dr. Patil. She is warm and gentle with my son and takes plenty of time to answer our questions. Her advice has been wonderful! Great pedi, we feel blessed to have her. 
5082 3 Good property here. Nice staff. Close to the airport. 
5083 1 The internet here at the laptop stations is slower than 3G. DSL reports showed 784 kbits/sec download, with a half second latency. That's insanely slow. 
5084 4 Service and food are phenomenal. Almost felt like we were royalty. Would eat here every day if I could Looking forward to my next visit 
5085 4 Amazing flavors! As tourists, we were looking for a hole-in-the-wall restaurant and this fit the bill! Great food!!! 
5086 4 These guys are great. I needed some parts and they explained the most efficient solution. Doug ordered the parts for me and I got a call when they were available. An employee even held the door for me on my way out with my bike. A+ 
5087 4 Great place.. Nice small cozy atmosphere. We had quail legs, it was delish. The garlic shrimp was good.. Get the white chocolate bread pudding thingy omg soooo good. I would go again. Staff was great. 
5088 1 Bummed my steak was cold and the fries were soggy on my steak frites. The pigtoberfest beer was good and the bacon old fashioned is a hit. The food just didn't seem as good as the last time I was here. 
5089 4 What a gem! The cider here is truly top notch and the frozen tepache is my favorite summer sip. 
5090 4 Extremely sensible and straightforward advice. My impossible divorce was made tolerable. 
5091 0 The food was mediocre at best. Why do they soak everything in soy sauce? My sirloin tasted like shoe leather, but the good thing was that they gave me a boat load of rice and noodles. Don't bother with this place, just go to your favorite Chinese fast food place. 
5092 3 Cute & cozy spot for tea--beautiful decor upstairs..middle eastern /zen/traditional vibes ..perfect spot to casually meet up and hang with a friend, or solo! 
5093 3 Chicken here was good, but didn't live up to the world famous ego. Thin coating, juicy, seasoning was meh. Mac and cheese noodles were a bit soft sadly. Prices are pretty good. Parking royally is terrible! Like I had to pay out the azz for a lot 5 blocks away. 
5094 3 We had Chinese brunch and it was awesome~! Yum Yum. Price was definitely cheap cheap. It's a small place, and it as packed! We got there around 1:30 so we didn't have to wait long for lunch to be served. But I would go back for food. 
5095 3 Great tasting ice cream place located in the market. I'd say go with the regular vanilla and get crazy with the toppings! The employees were really patient and let us try all the flavors out. Cool spot to grab a quick cone or scoop. 
5096 4 Best local beer selection we found while in town from Atlanta, including Jester King. The owner was really nice and helped us find the exact beer we were looking for. Def a great little grocer. 
5097 4 Always friendly, always attentive -- thanks for getting me on my way fast Thanks, Rene (I even asked for the name of owner)! 
5098 3 Good food, great atmosphere, especially watching and hearing the construction. We got the kid's grilled cheese, chicken pot pie, and superthin choc chip cookie. All were very good. My one caveat is that this place is most definitely $$. They were small portions for a total of $38. 
5099 2 Food is good and fast. The lunch servers could use some better service and speed skills. 
5100 3 Absolutely love the restaurant. However, I feel that the restaurant off exit 10 on 400 does a better job. I've been to that Hajime about 6 times now, and prefer to drive further to that one. 
5101 4 Easy to access. Had not tried their food before. The burger was tasty and Gabby and Boe were really friendly and helpful. 
5102 0 Awful. No flavor rice dry and old. How in the world are they open. Windows and chairs are filthy. 
5103 3 Good pizza and friendly service make me happy. 
5104 4 Time after time they amaze me. Freshest food, best service, friendliest staff... The best sushi in town. Their creativity also extends to the items on the regular menu, each item as pretty as it is delicious. This is an extrodinary dining experience every single visit. 
5105 3 I loved the food. We had Thai Iced Tea, Larb Hed, Pad Puk, Jungle Curry, corn fritter tamale and ended it with Sticky rice with mango. Simply delicious meal :) I want to go again!! :) 
5106 4 I highly recommend the salmon kakbob, it's served with rice,salad, a special green sauce, with yogurt sauce. In addtion, they just squire their liquor license, and have hookah. 
5107 2 Pretty good. Great happy hour. Excellent service. But not sure if I'd remember what we ate at Ten Ten a couple a days from now. 
5108 4 We went there for drinks and dessert. The staff was pretty friendly and the desserts were really good. 
5109 3 Great place to get a burger and the margarita I had was made from scratch and tasted great. Very fresh ingredients. I recommend showing up before Noon to avoid the lines. 
5110 3 Update: Pizzas are now available for lunch and dinner for eating-in! I am so glad the business has changed their policy and I can not wait to have Friday-night-pizza-night again! Thank you for being receptive to your patrons' feedback! 
5111 4 Fantastic bolognese- done more in a creamier style, but heavenly nonetheless. Great service, nice atmosphere. 
5112 4 It was the best egg drop soup I've ever had. The fried rice was pretty good too! Don't let the small size of the restaurant fool you, this is some of the best Chinese food you'll ever have. 
5113 4 absolutely fantastic pizza!!!! real crust, a nice sweet sauce (i like both bitter and sweet sauces and gallo nero has a fantastic and addictive sauce) - perfect amount of cheese and the customer service is great (they let you keep your coupons so you can use them again!) truly awesome 
5114 3 Loved my time at Brigham and Women's. The staff were great. They were always professional and caring. Whenever they put in IV's they were as gentle as you can be putting in an IV. 
5115 3 It is great place to eat for a simple 'just like home' meal. Parking is a bit difficult and usually busy so anticipate waiting. 
5116 4 Voodoo who? LOL. Totally different vibe but a nice new options. Definitely worth a stop by. Staff outstanding. Passionfuit guava....OFF the chain! 
5117 4 I trusted them for what is the biggest day of my life, so far, I revealing my baby's gender (our first child)! The cake I ordered was everything I wanted, down to the last detail. The cakes flavor was great! Everyone asked when I got it. I highly recommend them!! 
5118 4 Awesome services. We used BBB for our wedding, and we could not be happier. The bartenders were fun, friendly, responsible, and clean. Booking was easy and questions were answered promptly through email. 
5119 4 Very Nice Date spot. The food selection is awesome because you have the choice between seafood and different Greek dishes. 
5120 4 What a great restaurant! Food GREAT !!!!Service Friendly and fast. Been all over the world truly great Mexican! 
5121 1 Not worth the money... everything was salty and they weren't happy that we had kids with us. The ribs were very charred on the outside with little smoke flavor. The rotisserie chicken was salty and a bit dry. 
5122 3 Been here like 100 times in my life. Order up at the counter and sit down to get served, cause the pizza is great. It's also just a fun spot. Great for families or just hanging out with some friends. 
5123 3 We get food here every week, great Chinese food, chicken wings are my favorite. Sushi is just ok. Great atmosphere and nice bar. It is one of the best foods in the are of Rt 138. 
5124 4 This is where my friend from Italy goes every summer when he visits. We went there after coming back from Italy and this is the only place that measures up. Basta Pasta is Italian American, this place is really Italian. Just ask the Italian owner. :) 
5125 4 We always get great service here, also they are constantly helping some non profit or another. They are great to have in the community. I can usually get my favorite flavors plus they change out flavors to coincide with the season. 
5126 3 Good decor, prices and quaint laid back service. I really like to huge wind breaker curtain at the door, this is something most Boston restaurants should invest in because of the windy draft when someone opens the door. I was happy with this place, great for brunch. 
5127 4 It's a small, cozy, and very friendly cafe with outdoor seating! I got the affogato with stracciatella gelato. It's a little pricy, but the flavors were very strong! My friend got the hazelnut gelato which was delicious!!! 
5128 1 I will not return. The injera is terribly disappointing and the rest of the food doesn't make up for it. I brought two friends here telling them how yummy Ethiopian food is, only to say after "Please don't judge Ethiopian food on this." 
5129 4 This is my fave for indian food in the brookline area. I love the butter chicken and the naan. It's always warm and prompt delivery (also free delivery is awesome!) I've visited for the lunch buffet which is great as well, and the price is really good. 
5130 0 They sent me a bill for three separate co-payments that were already paid at the time of service! Luckily I saved the receipts. They tried to blame my insurance but even my insurance said, "they're trying to double charge you." After the third "mistake," I am skeptical of this establishment. 
5131 3 Family vibe ,bar seperate ,great specials,nice people,some days kids eat free,great parking , its quiet ,good prices, will me and my 4 kids go back yes. 
5132 4 Tampiquena was incredible. Everything looked great. Wide variety of margaritas, all generous and well made. Chips are a little thin and processed. Old diner atmosphere is typically Austin roadhouse casual. 
5133 4 Very good service, staff went above and beyond to ensure customers are happy, food was outstanding! Chanda was amazing, what an awesome experience! 
5134 4 They are so friendly. If they don't have what you want, they get it for you. It is a great store and the managers and staff are magnificent and very helpful Diane K West Linn 
5135 4 The chicken and hoecakes are a nice blend of sweet and savory. Chicken is cooked to perfection, crisp and moist with just right seasoning. We've been twice and plan on returning often. 
5136 3 Burgers and Service was good. No refills on lemonade :-( The place was very busy but the service was still alright. Is return for their burgers. 
5137 3 Awesome chips....very light,and not excessively salty like many other places and very fresh food. 
5138 3 Never know what you will find. This establishment had four stars on Yelp so gave it a shot. I had the braised beef in noodle soup with the steamed dumplings. Looking forward to other surprises in the area. 
5139 2 Over priced food. Glad we got the travelzoo for the tasting menu. I wouldn't pay that much for the 6 course for sure. The food wasn't that amazing and our glasses were always empty. I've tired few Michelin Stars restaurants. I would say this place is at the bottom. 
5140 4 Loved it! ELLEN our server and bartender made the experience because she knew it was my first time here and recommended a perfect first time pizza! Sweet and really cared about my experience. Thank you Ellen, I'll be back. (Ellen Brady!! :) 
5141 4 Cute, quaint place. Enjoyed the chips and salsa along with a couple of drinks. Great service from the girl from Chico, CA.... didn't get her name, but friendly and enjoyed our visit to the establishment. We were there from out of town and would return next time! 
5142 4 I got a gift certificate from here for a gift. Super cute space and a really nice selection of kids books. The staff was really helpful and friendly too! I will be back. 
5143 3 i always go here for sox games! i love it. the downstairs is the place to be and wherever you sit, you will have good view of the tv's b/c they have soo many!! service is good, and the drinks are reasonably priced. 
5144 4 The Steet Tacos were so good. The salsa is also great. We have a lot of good Mexican restaurants in the Midwest, but this place could be st the top of all of them. The Mojito was great as well. 
5145 3 This is a good default breakfast place. There service is always very good. They have a large menu. Nothing is truly amazing here, but everything I've had is good. There is something on the menu for most people here. 
5146 4 Just as good as the North End and in Mission Hill! Fresh pasta and cannolis. We had the Cajun shrimp and chicken fettuccini alfredo and buffalo chicken ravioli - both were delicious. 
5147 0 Currently sitting in their parking lot after wasting $60 on awful soggy fish that I couldn't finish and didn't even want to take home, really gross and really expensive. I wouldn't recommend this place at all and will never be back 
5148 0 They never get our To Go order correct. I'd rather drive a little longer to the Westminster IHOP for better service. 
5149 3 Whenever I fly into Portland, I take the earliest flight and drive straight to the Tin Shed. Delicious Blood Marys and very good food. Anything I've ordered has not disappointed. 
5150 3 Great atmosphere, good food, and excellent Italian wine! Waiter was very friendly, and service was excellent. 
5151 4 I love this place! Especially for new to organic food people like me, it is an affordable alternative to Whole Foods. Check out their daily deals online (www.harvestcoop.com); sometimes you get a cup of coffee for 25 cents! I will always be loyal to this store. 
5152 1 Sheets are super scratchy. Heater unit very noisy. Thermostat not accurate, I do not believe it was 94 degrees in my room. Why does my room smell like body odor? FYI, breakfast is extra even for honors members. 
5153 2 Sit down, shut up and order a Guinness already. 
5154 3 I came in from passing by. The location is very clean. The offer daily specials and the food is fresh as well as the salsas. Friendly staff- definitely recommend. 
5155 2 The burger was really good. Very tender and cooked just right. My disappointment were with the fries. They were a bit too soggy for me. Also, when you order a coke, you just get a can of coke. 
5156 3 Pretty rad place if you want to see beards, tattoos, suicide girls, punks, & art snobs all in the same place. My kind of mix. Bring cash bc you cannot run credit cards. 
5157 3 Loved this Place .. Seats were kinda crappy but the food is to die for! Naked Lobster Roll and Calamari ! 
5158 3 Great place. Everything is solid, food, service, atmosphere. More like a place after your in a relationship or with friends. Good solid neighborhood sushi place. 
5159 1 Not bad. Pretty tasty, fast and hot. I would have given a star extra, but they got rid of the saté sauce! Not cool! The sizes are small for the price you pay (another star missed) plus the staff isn't very friendly, making it two stars from me. 
5160 3 Hopdoddy is a little more expensive than I would prefer to spend on a burger, but the truffle fries alone make it worth it!! They have tons of options and every bit of food we ordered was amazing. So glad they have one in Round Rock now!! 
5161 1 This place has been so many different places over the years they dont have any identity. The bathrooms are filthy. The staff are the best part of this place. Although he large outdoor patio is nice as well. You get what you expect for a college town dive bar. 
5162 0 Just like acapulcos but with much higher prices but the same food. Not a place I crave to return to..ps, service is appalling. 
5163 3 My favorite South End go to! The ever changing, seasonal menu makes it ideal to have on your repeat offenders list (they change the menu every 4-6 weeks - just enough time to discover a favorite and have once or twice more). Drinks great and atmosphere very very cozy! 
5164 3 They were able to schedule me within a week, took my insurance and did a thorough exam. They also did a great job with my filling and cleaning. Would recommend! 
5165 2 Not a bad place, would go back. Have watched a few NBA drafts at Tom's when the Blazers were drafting in the lottery. Haven't ordered the pizza's yet, the food I have ordered was regular greasy comfort food. Decent service. 
5166 4 This place is the real deal. Hand-made pasta, "real" Italian-style pizza, and strong beer. This place does it from scratch, and they do it well. I can't recommend it enough. 
5167 4 Excellent BURGERS! Super fresh! Didn't leave there feeling blah! I would definitely go here again! 
5168 3 So I don't have much to compare it to, but I couldn't expect much more out of whatever one might consider the standard. THE friendliest staff I've encountered in most establishments in the city, and they all know what they're talking about. 
5169 4 Overall a great experience. After a long day at a conference, it was nice to sit down to a warm meal. We tried the burger and the chicken pasta which were both cooked to perfection. Everything is made from scratch!! Have to come back to try the chicken pot pie! 
5170 4 Julie our bartender was the bomb!!! As soon as we walked in she made us feel comfortable and her service was fantastic!! Thank you Julie! Can't wait to come back! 
5171 0 The place was a dump.What a waste of time.Cheap food,cheap taste.Tables and chairs were old and broken.Not a good place to eat,will not go back. 
5172 3 The queso- hands down best I've had. The veggie taco salad is so good and the dressing is very good. But the down side is the inside is very small and clustered. The outside seating is good though. 
5173 4 Great cast of people. Everyone there is helpful and very patient. Buying a $50 wand is pretty expensive. The stations don't do alot 
5174 4 Being skeptical of "modern" Italian, I was prepared to drop a pretty penny and leave hungry, but Juniper hit all the right notes and pleasantly surprised us with exceptional service along with complements from the chef. Beautiful decor and even better cuisine. Mi raccomando, mangia qui. 
5175 1 Cheap clothes. Unexpensive and made cheaply. In a crunch, if you are in need of something, go here but do not expect great quality. If you just want a t-shirt, you might consier Tello's over the gap because the quality is basically the same and Tellos is cheaper. 
5176 4 FANTASTIC. Service = Personal Food +10 Huge, Tasty, Unique, Excellent Presentation Parking = EASY Clean = 100% Decor = Clever + Tasteful + Colorful + Airy Pricing = Amazingly Reasonable Great Place for Kids. 
5177 4 Amazingly talented! Every time I have shown the nail techs a picture of what I wanted. They nail it every time!!!! (Pun intended LOL) I highly recommended spending your hard earned money here!!!! I am never disappointed! 
5178 1 It was ok, the food was poorly put together and they didn't include my fries. Only good thing was burger. Also took 30 minutes. 
5179 3 Great food and drinks. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. Had the French dip prime rib which was amazing. 
5180 2 I don't understand the hype. Donuts that sound good but end up being weird. They need to stop putting birds on everything and just go for a plain ole good donut. Fancy isn't always good. 
5181 4 Yummy yummy. The app asked if this was a hipster place. Well, hippy would be a better description. Worn but clean. You need to check this place out. 
5182 4 Beautiful restaurant with a diverse menu (modern take on German comfort foods). Service was impeccable and the octopus dish was a favorite. 
5183 0 Shouldn't the drivers keep their eyes on the road and not be flipping through the passenger tickets while driving 50 miles per hour on the expressway and only one car length away from the car/truck ahead??? 
5184 2 I like this diner but they continuously sit us 4 at the table for 2 across from the entry even though a table for 4 is open and then they'll sit 2 people at a table for 4 immediately after us. It's just a lack of consideration. 
5185 3 I couldn't find anywhere to eat around 11:00PM in boston (Whoah, what a surprise!) so my friend and I decided to go to Stella. I ordered a burger and it was dynamite. Good service as well. Can't complain. 
5186 1 I'm not sure what type of cuisine they're attempting here but it's not sze chuan. My dumplings came out with soya sauce and Dan Dan noodles came out with satay sauce. Not sure if the chef was drunk or not. This place was terrible 
5187 3 great bread and pizza. and inexpensive too. i agree about the service being a bit odd. sometimes they're friendly and sometimes they're not. 
5188 4 I has lasik last week and am so happy with tlc and the results. They made everything very comfortable Jim was amazing and so was everyone else I worked with. I am so happy with the results and am amazed and how quick the recovery time was. 
5189 4 Quick, cheapest and quality fuel. Not sure what else you would need. Occasionally they're backed up a little because of the best price in town. No credit cards keeps the price down. 
5190 4 Excellent food & great service, I highly recommend!!!! Burgers are juice & fresh did I say that the service was quick fast and in a hurry. Best BURGER Joint in ATLANTA patties down!!!! 
5191 0 What a dump. Even if i was in college - i wouldn't go here! The stench when you walk in is terrible bathroom is taking your life in your hands!! So many other dives that aren't so scary. 
5192 3 Food is good but I feel slightly over priced. I only come for the waffles, because they are awesome and I think their price is very reasonable. 
5193 4 Great food and service. Good size portions. Waitress was very sweet. Food came out quick. Had carne assad large portion of well cooked and season meat. Side trimmings also real good. Corn/grits and bacon delicious. Highly recommend 
5194 3 Awesome place to start the night. Great service, good food, perfect happy hour and the ambiance is delightful. A definite stop to check out when touristing around Portland. 
5195 4 I've only been to the Tabernacle twice but both experiences were overall pretty decent. The parking is a bit complicated but that's normal for being in the city. It's a pretty clean place and nothing crazy really happened while I was there to see Megadeth. it's a good venue. 
5196 3 Very adorable cafe in an Heritage House. Lovely patio outside. Good sandwiches and coffee, plus very nice staff make this a favorite of mine! 
5197 4 They've got lots of yummy desserts, opens till late, and have darts that you can play on the side. Got the Mille crepe cake and loved it! Friendly staff. Will definitely come back. It's a nice hang out place with a couple friends :) 
5198 2 Had the Singapore Noodles one of my favorite dishes. It was too greasy but not to greasy to eat most all of it. The won ton soup was hot and delicious. Decent food. Casual environment. 
5199 4 Great shop! right in the center of the Boston bombing. They have rebuilt and recovered nicely. They offer a wide array of running shoes, clothing and advice. I went in to purchase a Boston Strong shirt. 
5200 0 Had a party here. Catering menu is overpriced. Guac was $600 for 3 bowls. Plus bad service. Mediocre food. Don't bother. There are so many other good food options in the area. 
5201 4 My favorite Thai place in Boston. Their pad see-ew is the best! 
5202 4 They really took care of me. They were friendly, helpful and made sure that I was satisfied with what I went to go buy. 
5203 3 We went in on one of the busiest nights of the October madness. We sat at the oyster bar and the two guys working that were fantastic. Drinks and food were slow but hey, it's October in Salem. Every place in town had two-three hour waits. 
5204 0 Rude and aggressive manager, awful pizza and greasy arancini, avoid this place, for late night food and pizza head to bova on salem st 
5205 4 Got the bacon, mushroom, spinach pasta with extra parmigiana. OMG! It was soooo tasty! Don't let the small size of the regular fool you. It is a good portion of food. They also do a great shaved ice! 
5206 4 Simply love the no fuss food they serve. Good serving for a person and amazing Momos. Even their thukpa is really delicious and yummy. Good ambiance and i always recommend it to people who like to try new cuisines 
5207 2 Snagged a couple seats at the bar on a lovely Saturday night and were very pleased with ourselves. Also pleased with the friendly staff at this now established Italian joint. Highlight of the night was definitely the pesto.. like wow. Try it!! 
5208 4 Super fresh, warm, delicious sushi. Very cute, romantic interior decor. I love Shakai 
5209 4 Great family owned and operated place. Not like any of the chain Brazilian restaurants. Wonderful atmosphere and service and really good food. Came in for a quick business diner and stayed for a couple of hours. Really enjoyed the place. Highly recommended! 
5210 4 So first visit the samosas were about a 4, and the mango lassi was a 1,.. however the chicken vindaloo was very good which brought me back....my second visit everything was a 5.. samosas, naan, chicken tikka massala 
5211 2 Service dreadful on a Thursday eve around 6pm. One waitress who just didn't care. Had to fetch our own menus, ask twice for bill and water refills. I had veggie sampler which could have been warmer. Partner had beef berebere that was really tough. Injera very flavorful. 
5212 2 Ducked into this restaurant for lunch while doing errands. Food is good, decent price and portions. A Chinese/American restaurant that can handle more business as the rooms are "largish." Oh, and the wait staff is friendly, personable 
5213 3 I recently tried a different chinese restaurant Lee's Garden. I ordered egg flower soup and egg roll. Didn't come close to Chu's. Egg flower soup is awesome and egg roll lightly crispy on the outside and yummy inside. Always good service and plenty of food. 
5214 4 Food Fight! is the real deal. Good people trying to do good things. You will not find many grocery stores that care as much about people and animals as these fine folks. 
5215 1 Not sure what the rave is, coffee was watered down and meh. The cold brew with nitrogen seems okay. Overall, there's better coffee elsewhere. 
5216 2 Great service, good food. I was surprised that the menu features more Japanese food than Chinese food, but my Udon noodles and tempura was amazing! Easy parking and super cool environment with an authentic feel. 
5217 4 Such a thoughtful florist! He always know just what is needed for each occasion! Unique, attractive, local business. Treats you like a friend not like a #. 
5218 3 The staff is super friendly and drinks are usually cold and properly made and reasonably priced! Great beer selection and wonderful gals behind the bar!! Just what bee cave needs!!! 
5219 0 There brunch is horrible for an outside patio they sure don't use it that well. And what a great location all the restaurants and bars next to the place has great food the food is horrible there for brunch. 
5220 0 This company drives me nuts! It's a RECYCLING company in PORTLAND that still relies on paper invoices, and snail mail. No online bill pay, no payment over the phone by credit card, and no paperless options. It's the only bill I still have to pay the old-fashioned way. Grrrr. 
5221 4 Try the spinach dip... delicious! We had the steak, fetuccine Alfredo and tuna salad. All super nice! Great ambient and service! Mojito really good! 
5222 3 I really enjoyed this place! The restaurant itself was very nice- a lot nicer inside than I expected. The server was extremely patient and prompt. Never a long wait for anything- drinks and food were great! I will definitely be back! 
5223 3 Very good! Small menu but the food and service were excellent! I had the chicken katsu and my boyfriend had the takoyaki and udon soup. I recommend! 
5224 4 My go to place for Chinese. Amazing rangoons and a huge selection of Asian cuisines. Not a good dinner idea if you are feeling indecisive. 
5225 2 Stopped by and found the chawanmushi to be heavily over salted? I didn't even know what this dish was an first had it at the upper Fremont location. My mind was blown! So amazing! But found 90% of all the dishes were over salted 
5226 3 I had a huge party - over 20 people, and they were more than accommodating. We had 2-3 servers always helping us and making sure we had our drinks and food. Love the wings, obviously, and there were plenty of TVs around for us to enjoy the football game on. 
5227 4 Excellent prices. You're taking to an actual service technician at the counter. They're friendly, they smile (!), human approachable. Wonderful product selection...never again am I buying a tool at HomeDepot, Lowes, or the general hardware stores. 
5228 3 So far I had the lobster roll, Miso Seared Salmon Rice Paper Wrap and crispy slaw. Everything is perfect. The Miso Seared Salmon Rice Paper Wrap is like a flavor explosion. 
5229 3 Great service and the food was excellent.... best place on the water. 
5230 0 This ride deserves no stars... my tv at home has better graphics lol... such a bad experience, 
5231 0 If you really want to have food from here, make sure you make it to go. Horrible service. Also I saw a customer getting kicked out from the restaurant for complaining. Lots of drama here. 
5232 2 Waited so long for my order but the food was good. The staff were friendly and the place was neat. I will definitely come back but hoping for more improvement though. 
5233 4 Dude, best pizza ever. I brought my drunk friends here and we ordered the black bean pizza. I was not feeling confident about it, because I've had some bad Mexican pizzas in the past. But this one changed my lyfe! [weeping face emoji, heart face emoji, double heart emoji]. 
5234 0 Food could have taste better if heated properly. Gujju food pretty bland. Surprised how this place still running apparently after 13 yrs in service... 
5235 3 The won ton noodle soup and dumpling noodle soup was very good. The dumplings were all very tasty and very large. The noodles were firm and not soggy. The soup was a bit plain though since it only had noodles and dumplings with nothing else. 
5236 4 Originally planned on coming for the beer. Ended up eating in the restaurant. The food was excellent. We first started in the taproom with appetizers. Then went into the restaurant. The scallops were excellent. The beer selection was excellent. Was not disappointed. 
5237 4 Recently enjoyed a family feast at Comfort and all were pleased with the food, drink, service and venue overall. The meats are prepared to perfection and creatively paired with tasty sides. 
5238 4 Wonderful vegan ice cream options! And really interesting non vegan flavor options too. Check them out. You won't be disappointed! 
5239 4 I love marathon sports... The supply, the staff, and the vibe are all super! The deal: marathon sports is your sporting goods destination to get fitted for the perfect running shoes for your individual feet! 
5240 3 It was a good and intersining movie blindspotting. Staff was very good with my indecisiveness about what to order. The French toast was too sweet but the shake was delicious though. Great promos as well. 
5241 4 Great experience! Went there for the first time tonight, and everything was perfect. Delicious salad, pasta, and pizza...everything very fresh, friendly staff, great service. highly recommended! 
5242 3 Ok, lets get through this. The pizza is on point. Its not the best in the world, maybe not the best in town even, but you cant go wrong with any pie on their list. Good service, good food, lots of parking, cant go wrong. 
5243 1 Service was nice. But the bed was so uncomfortable. It will be my last choice the next time I'm on. international drive 
5244 2 I bought something from here the other day and learned that they now charge for shopping bags. Tip is to bring your own! The shopping experience was A-OK. No screwups at the check-out! 
5245 4 Good coffee and service. I was visiting and just stumbled upon it. Nice staff, good food and great coffee. 
5246 3 Overly crowded and priced but still a one of the best places to a have family trip to. My daughter enjoyed the shows and we enjoyed watching her face light up with awe as she watched the animals. The dolphin/whale show is a must see. 
5247 2 Food is average and overpriced. We have visited this restaurant on a number of occasions, and while it's ok, it's nothing to write home about. 
5248 3 We went here to celebrate my husband graduating from college. The food was great! Tons of options for unique burgers (including bison!). Rather pricey but definitely a must try! 
5249 4 The tour of the history of chocolate was impressive. Did the wine and chocolate tasting after the tour and that was awesome and informative. The quality of the products here is very good and. 
5250 4 Never disappointed it is just extra yummy! When I think of all the times I went there, all the different things I ordered and that were always perfect, I have nothing to say but: when's the next time?? 
5251 4 When I visit Sanford to do business twice a year, I eat here for lunch. I always sit outside as they have a very large outdoor seating area. The German food is very good and I like the half soup and sandwich lunch option served with chips, carrots and celery. 
5252 3 Great breakfast tacos! The bacon is a strip instead of little pieces and the potatoes are nicely browned and a bit crispy. Haven't yet tried anything beyond the tacos but looking forward to the rest of the menu :) 
5253 4 I was scheduled 12:00 and was not disappointed. Christian was on time (early even) and was just so friendly and accommodating with what I wanted cleaned. He utilized the entire time and was professional. Would recommend Handy and Christian. 
5254 3 Aside from the icy glare of the other Asian chick behind the counter, my experience with The Meadow one sweet evening breezing into Portland was made even sweeter with some of their best international chocolate brands and tasting salts (Maboroshi Plum made to sprinkle over white fish and fruits). 
5255 2 Went there as heard some rave reviews. Eh....salty, but crispy and decent. I prefer Popeyes....or KFC. 
5256 3 First time here. I had Pad Thai with Tofu. It was GOOD. And I'm picky about Pad Thai. Service was efficient and friendly. 
5257 2 Decent food but poor service while dining in on 2 occasions--once during lunch time and once during dinner time. 
5258 3 Been many times and never disappointed. Best all you can eat Japanese from soup to dessert. Delicious, fresh sushi and everything else on the menu. 
5259 2 One of my neighborhood go-tos when in the mood for Thai and don't feel like driving to Cobb or downtown ATL. 
5260 3 Went with good friend for ladies night out. Great tapas..loved ambience and wine options... will skip sushi next time. Everything else was great! 
5261 3 Great service, great ambiance and some pretty good burgers! I love that I can order it with no bun. They are very moist and full of flavor...not to mention the awesome fries!!! Yummm.... 
5262 4 Awesome spot for live jazz music, decent selection of beers & well-mixed cocktails, and cool, dimly lit atmosphere. Only a few blocks away from the Congress Bridge, so we popped in post-bat-watching. 
5263 3 Great decor. Great staff. Great atmosphere. I liked this place. Highly recommended for anyone who likes a bar that's a little rough around the edges but doesn't scream "too cool for school" or "ALTAMONT." 
5264 3 My favourite ramen place. Love their miso ramen with all the toppings. 
5265 4 Sleek interior, great food, kind waitress. had the halibut special. Amazing! 
5266 4 I've been a faithful customer of Stan's for 7 years. They continue to be honest, reliable, and affordable! They have a coffee machine and fountain drink station. The service guys are so nice that sometimes I just pop in to say hello and have a cafe mocha with them! 
5267 3 What a gem of a place. Only wish they had music or something playing, but creates good area for conversations to be heard. Teriyaki chicken box was super tasty. Perfect amount of food if you have an appetite Service was on point. 
5268 2 They have moved next door! IThe $2.50 margaritas keeps bringing me back. It is pretty standard Mexican food. Not ming Blowing, but not mind numbing either. I will warn you that you might go into a food coma soon after consumption...and a few margaritas. 
5269 4 Consistent and fast service. Friendly staff and clean sitting area. Best experience: I ordered a Starbucks Reserve coffee but the machine was down so the cashier ended up buying me a Cascara Latte to make up for it! 
5270 1 Called in my pizza order an hour ago... I'm still waiting for it. Guy is super nice but they need extra help. 
5271 2 Very decent deli! I enjoy their tuna and the chips that they provide aren't bad at all. The free ice cream is a great addition! 
5272 3 I'd have to agree with the general consensus. The Momo's are great (and the other food) and the service is slow. 2 for service. 4 for food. 
5273 3 I got Burger Joy delivery and the service was awesome! It was delivered sooner than expected and it was piping hot. I got the house special lo mein and it was awesome! Decent Chinese food, affordable, and great service, couldn't ask for more for a quick dinner. 
5274 0 Flavourless. I actually lost my appetite. And when I asked for my money back they refused saying it was against policy because I already ate some. Well obviously. I bought it to eat it. I had two bites and called it a day. 
5275 3 Legit. Previous reviews are right in the money. Delicious with a capital D. I tried the lemon pepper and garlic parm wings and they were perfect. Ambiance and possibly cleanliness behind the scenes prevent a 5 star, but I'd definitely go back over any other local options for sure. 
5276 0 Cold food! Tried to charge for extra packets of BBQ sauce for their cold hard chicken tenders. I realize it is fast food, but cold food is unacceptable. 
5277 3 It is a good Ethiopian restaurant. Not the best as it is hit and miss qith the food sometimes. Service ia great. I usually get my order to go. 
5278 3 what happens to krispy kreme? i like variety of brands donuts. 
5279 3 A great place to buy whatever you need in the north end. I also like the cat that runs around the store freely, often sitting on the counter where you are supposed to pay for your stuff. 
5280 4 such a great place!! we had roast beef, which was tender and juicy, and a huge steak bomb, well worth the money. we will be going back more often even though it will be some distance for us to get there. 
5281 4 Absolutely love SkyBlue! They are so accommodating and make you feel at ease leaving your pups in their care. Julie and the staff are so beyond friendly! My pups come back happy and exhausted. Highly recommend! 
5282 4 The best arts event in Orlando that most of Orlando doesn't know about. Great venues, great talent, and a great sense of community. Find time in your schedule the last two weeks in May to see some amazing shows! 
5283 4 Best donuts in PDX. I love their Tiramisu, Lemon and Passionfruit but Apple Cider Fritter can be better 
5284 4 The wings and fish were off the chain. The DJ did his thing. He had us up most b of the night 
5285 3 Had a very good dining experience at Myers + Chang. Pork belly buns are out of this world. Can't stop thinking about those). My friend loved the noodles. The decor is very inviting and relaxing. Excellent place to get a drink. 
5286 1 12$ for mediterranean omelet with coffee (1$/refill). no olives, barely any spinach, not real feta (felt like melted mozzarella), lot of milk in the omelet. Staff is very friendly. Not going back. 
5287 0 Had the worst experience at this hotel from the second I walked in the door. They caused such an inconvenience for me and I will not be visiting again. Ever. 
5288 4 Great food and atmosphere. Elese and Mandy are great. I've worked in restaurants for over 20 years and they're as good as I've ever seen. The prime rib sandwich is excellent! I'll definitely be back! 
5289 4 Just, Yes. Not only is this the best sushi I have ever had, every time I go, but the staff is incredible. You have to be ready to spend a bit of money, but it's worth it! 
5290 4 Very good Indian food. Definitely better value for the money than any of the Indian food places near downtown Vancouver. 
5291 4 Chose Sixt bc of the horrific reviews of most other car rental places here in Orlando. Typing this after being checked in and got my car in about 3 mins. Could not have been smoother. 
5292 3 Solid Italian food, nice atmosphere. The carpaccio and bolognese were good, the homemade gnocchi was the stand-out. The only drawback here is that it gets super noisy. We had a hard time hearing our waitress and our table of 8. 
5293 4 A great place to get brewing and beer service equipment. They had exactly what I needed, the staff were very quick and helpful, and I had a nice time chatting with them too. I'll be back for all of my beery needs. 
5294 3 Ordered here from work once. Got the steak and cheese with mushroom sub. Portions are big. Quick delivery. 
5295 4 awesome owner and bartenders, recommended by a friend to watch some games & good vibes 
5296 4 Don't be fooled by the location. They have what you need and they do a great job. Outstanding customer service; they only charge for what they really do after a thorough diagnostic. They've maintained my clipper/trimmer for many years. 
5297 4 100% recommend!!! We had THE BEST server, Anna, and she recommended the poke nachos which were out of this world! She took amazing care of us, and accommodated us and our two kids. We had a great time and would recommend Yard House to anyone going to a Braves game! 
5298 4 Overall yummy, great place! The service is amazing here and the food and drinks are perfect! 
5299 1 The sandwiches were great and the coffee was good and strong. But I'm amazed at how clueless the kids working here were! They had no clue what they were doing and the ear pieces made it so the could not talk to us or each other. They could do better 
5300 3 This place is also one of my go-to places for a burger. I love their super melt. It is like a combination of a grilled cheese sandwich and a Big Mac. Their tater tots are really good as well. 
5301 3 The scrambled egg tortilla (I always get it sans avocado) is the best! It's a wonderful breakfast to take to go. 
5302 4 Love the juice truck. Their smoothies are delicious. I especially like their almost chocolate, green protein, and coco matcha smoothies. They also have good healthy snacks and salads. Their Caesar salad is great and though it looks small is decently filling. 
5303 3 Love this Jamba Juice. Used to live rift down the road and still roll by a few times a month. Clean store. Friendly staff. Good product. I love the all fruit smoothie, strawberry whirl. 
5304 2 Food is tasty here but I feel like it always takes forever for my party to get our food. 
5305 0 I would be able to review the food, however we sat for 10 minutes without even an acknowledgement. To bad we were excited to try something new. 
5306 3 Good service and tasty meals..had the pancakes with walnuts and roast beef Reuben sandwhich...been here 3 times and always satisfied with the food. 
5307 4 Damn I love this place. The toast is lit. The short and sweet is lit. The duck empanadas are lit. Every day we lit. 
5308 4 The donuts are delicious!! And for this reason they do sell out of certain ones quickly so go on the earlier side. 
5309 3 Brand new Ace Hardware nearby so I needed a 13mm wrench and thought it would be the best opportunity. Hey had a great selection and they even had one made in the USA with internal ratcheting. Can't beat that. I will definitely be back. 
5310 2 Not bad. Nothing fancy, fairly run-of-the-mill Mongolian. Owner is very friendly and there are lots of options to experiment with. Good value if you are starving. Little to no ambience....this ain't a date place. 
5311 3 Port Coquitlam can be small at time, but at least there is a great, cheap, friendly small Thai restaurant. The waitress and chef are very friendly. The food is great, well cooked and not greasy. And best thing of all it is cheap. I like very much this little restaurant 
5312 4 For over a year now I have come to Border Grill and they are still the best taqueria in Orlando. Don't be afraid... Try the lengua (tongue) taco! :) 
5313 3 They have a good Colombian coffee! I bought dancing goats blend bag and it was good! The attention is great ;) 
5314 1 Positives included the burrata and lobster ravioli. Negatives include the chewy calimari which in the North End is inexcusable. Overall it was a good restaurant, but not exceptional. 
5315 3 Traveling through Salem, Ma, we stopped in for dinner. The food was very delicious. The presentation was beautiful. Devon, our waiter was great. I wish I lived closer so I could enjoy it more often. 
5316 3 I love this Publix. It stays very busy but still quick and easy to get out of. The keep the place clean and organized. 
5317 4 Loved the pizza and the service was amazing! They definitely loaded us up on toppings so it didn't feel like we were getting ripped off. Would definitely eat here again. 
5318 4 A nice and cozy place for desserts. I had tiramisu and royal rose milk tea. The tiramisu is the one I want. Very tasting. In the end I took out sesame milk tea but this one was not my love. 
5319 4 I went to the Weymouth location yesterday using a Groupon deal. Beautiful salon, great staff, and my Stylist, Meredith, was fabulous Definitely would recommend! 
5320 3 Pleasant experience! Friendly, timely, hot food, and great taste. Had it delivered to our hotel. We ordered chicken, smoked bacon, and pineapple. So good. They even gave us plates and napkins. 
5321 2 Great selection for vegans and a fun, relaxing environment with friends. Loved the presentation of the food and it's easy to tell that all of their vegetable selections are fresh. However, wish the service was better and that they can create a more efficient process for waiting times. 
5322 4 The Steel Bridge is one of my favorites. Great looking, great bike and pedestrian access, the complete opposite of the Ross Island Bridge. 
5323 4 Came for open house, which was fabulous. Great ropes course and activities for kids. 
5324 3 Everything about it (service, food, coffee) is great! But waiting over an hour is just too much. Wish there was some room for reservations online and walk-ins. 
5325 1 The pizza is fine but the service is subpar. We ordered takeout, were told to pick it up in 15-20 minutes, went and bought ice cream at a nearby Publix, returned 15 minute later, and were told to wait 15 more minutes. 
5326 3 This is very decent for an airport. Service was excellent, the food was cooked very well and served hot, wine list is ok. This is probably the best airport restaurant you are going to hit. 
5327 4 Consistently great experience whether eating in or taking out! Service is always attentive and the food brings memories of when I lived in Thailand. Kin Kao do it right! 
5328 4 I've been to many Ethiopian places in Atlanta. Ghion Cultural Hall is one of the very best. It's hallmarks are a charming, warm decor, equally warm service, a great price point and PHENOMENAL food! My husband and I look forward to going back soon! 
5329 4 Love the raw food, have never tried the yoga or body stuff. 
5330 2 Had the baked chicken, mashed potatoes, and greens. The meal was ok. Highly over priced. Would probably prefer not to go again except for the atmosphere and the live band. Next time would only order appetizers and dessert. 
5331 4 I am starting the love this place! This place has a huge menu of food! My favorite is the taco salad here with the mushroom and spinach empanadas! This place has a good vibe and also very fast service compare to their other locations. 
5332 3 Family-owned Dunwoody staple. Must try the Dragon Roll! I ordered the shrimp teriyaki Bento Box, and it was the perfect amount and combination of food! 
5333 4 I loooooved Mongolian beef. It was amazing. I felt like I was in Chicago. I can say this place is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Austin. 
5334 3 One of P-towns best breakfast spots for sure. Awsome homemade hollandase sauce. As another reviewer mentioned, you have to smuggle ketsup in, but it's small beans compared to all that is good. Get the biali ... topnotch. 
5335 4 Mifuyu helped me finish my taxes. She was kind and efficient throughout the process and helped ease my stress of filing. Thanks! 
5336 4 Great chowder, great food and great atmosphere. I am from the midwest and wanted some good sea food while in boston and it did not disappoint. Very good dinner. 
5337 4 Awesome adventure! A must try when you are in Orlando or near one of their Ifly indoor skydiving locations. 
5338 0 We came here for a two small plates and waited about 30 mins for the food to be ready. Definitely not coming back, although the food was okay, Id rather a place with better service. 
5339 3 Delicious food! A real arabic restaurant. Taste like only the arab food tastes. The only thing that need some improvement is the floor cleaning. 
5340 4 Brian and his team were very accommodating and proactive while I was planning an event for my office. The day of the event went off without a hitch and everything was great! Definitely recommend booking with this company if you're looking for a great day on the lake. 
5341 4 This is a great establishment. The owners and staff are professional and will answer any question. The cost of cleaning is very good. I don't use dry cleaning often, but, when i do...I use Rockwood. 
5342 0 Do not buy a mattress here!! My mattress started sagging but not enough in their opinion for them to replace it or offer a refund. I spent almost $3,000!! Totally disgusted!!! 
5343 2 Solid lunch spot in Ansley Mall. Service and food is always on par and the pricing is solid. 
5344 1 Had the oyster po' boy, nothing to rave about...oysters were ok and the bread was a little hard and extremely dry. 
5345 4 Very clean establishment, friendly service and great food. I can't find a better chicken pad thai. 
5346 3 Great beers on tap. Been a huge fan of The beer for a long time and even if this place is not that close to where I live I always make a trip! 
5347 4 Quite possibly the best cafe in the center. Everything made with fresh ingredients. Had the best Caprese I've ever had here. Cozy cafe within arm's reach of the Thomas Crane. 
5348 4 Came here at about 4am one morning. Cultural, indulgent, and delicious! Very well made, and the hours are convenient. Love this place! 
5349 2 This is a great dive....good food good drinks. They recently raised their rates...they used to have a lunch menu but now it's all dinner prices. 
5350 3 The place is very clean and the employees really try to get you in and out quickly. It is a non traditional fast food joint meaning you get a "meat and veggie" meal instead of a burger and fries. The prices are not that bad either. 
5351 3 What can I say but DONUTS - lots of choices, some are over the top but I guess that is why Voodoo Donuts is so popular. Pricey for a donut but they are one of a kind! Definitely a "weird Austin" experience for residents and visitors. 
5352 4 excellent tonight. very tasty salads, succulent duck breast, the side vegetables were complementary without being overpowering. great balance! and the service was outstanding. It helps to come during uncrowded hours re: the noise factor. 
5353 3 Nice bartender. Can't go wrong with a beer called "Lotion in the Basket." Stubbs BBQ is in the back, which you will have to go order separately and bring your table. They have a nice patio as well. 
5354 4 Fantastic in service and steak. I had the truffle lobster tail and filet mignon, which were great. The atmosphere is exactly what it needs to be in that area of the city; professional and classy. Would reccomend if looking for a nice meal in boston. 
5355 4 They have gift certificates at the downtown costco where you save a nice percentage off your meal. 
5356 4 awesome - stopped by on election night with the kids and was an all around solid performance. Tacos Tijuana are excellente! Margaritas were awesome too! 
5357 4 I had the best experience at TLC in Waltham, after my procedure I can see 20/20. The Doctor and staff were first class. After years of considering Lasik and researching side effects, I'm 100% satisfied. They deserve more than 5 Stars. 
5358 4 Hands down the best brunch that Ive ever tried in my life. Absolutely amazing food whatever dish you would order. The service was excellent and the Memouna drink??? Oh boy. Must close the note with a Belgian waffle. I went twice and that rarely happens when I am traveling. 
5359 4 Best sushi I've ever had. I am honestly Not a fish fan and I only ever get crab sushi but this was something else. Other worldly, and worth every penny. I recommend this place a million times over! Try the shag roll for sure 
5360 0 Another update - they price gouged during the hurricane FYI. This is an awful place to stay, done give a dime to them. GREEDY 
5361 4 Outstanding good and service staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and wines is very convenient. Food is not only beautiful but full of flavor and technique. 
5362 2 The mussels in white wine were delicious, and others were just okay, not the best cuisine I've been to but pretty decent in Woburn Burlington area. 
5363 0 So the bar staff was cool and the band played some great songs. Problem is, the overanxious bouncer crew messed up our entire evening. They were unnecessarily rude and obnoxious, and we will never go back there. Avoid. 
5364 4 Delicious! Such a cute little spot. My boyfriend and I love coming here for date night. It's never too crowded, and it's a delicious, affordable dinner. I love the maki combo. Everyone is friendly, and I'm always excited to return. 5 stars!! 
5365 4 This eating experience is so memorable. Our whole family, non-Spanish speaking, by the way, has made this our favorite steak house! Portions are large and delicious, especially the Bistek a Cabello. If you want relaxing atmosphere and casual attire, great service and wonderful food, Que Bueno is a must! 
5366 4 Great local diner! The staff is always friendly and the food is great. I could do without the holiday decorations, but the food and service are amazing! 
5367 4 Went here for brunch. The wait wasnt nearly as bad as it is at most trendy brunch places in town. The food amd coffee was good. Little pricey for my usual but worth it 
5368 4 Been many times and couldn't be happier with the quality of food and service!!! There aren't many places that make their own pasta these days. 
5369 3 Well I'm back... And all is right with the world... Nice new friendly, sweet employees and my wangs EXTRA WET... 
5370 0 Don't like this place. I went a couple of times, pedi was ok, but the ladies seem arrogant and I can tell they are talking smack. Just made it uncomfortable. Rather give my money to someone who appreciates it 
5371 4 I love every flavour ! Inside is so nice and the design is cool. I love this place but I don't go too often. 
5372 3 Ate at the bar, great service! Very friendly! Sushi was amazing!! Find them on concourse E!! 
5373 4 This little shop is amazing. Waffle with strawberry and ice cream is only $4.50. Ice cream is so delicious. And the Mango slush I ordered was made with real fruit. The taste is just so nice. Definitely gonna recommend to friends and gonna come back again. Yum. 
5374 4 Took my two dogs here a few days ago to get nails done, I can't remember the young woman's name but she listened to my concerns and request and I am 100% satisfied with her and how she treated my fur baby's ! 
5375 4 Come for the tapas, stay for the charcuterie board. 
5376 4 Great selection of meats and veggies. The flavor is off the hook. Definitely making this our spot! 
5377 4 Really enjoyed dinner here. Do get the green chile mac'n'cheese. And make sure to share it because it is very rich. Will be back again when I'm in Texas or Arizona! 
5378 3 Food was good and the place was cozy! Definitely a small place so I wouldn't recommend it for a large group. 
5379 3 Great option if you want something hearty yet somewhat healthy. Very customizable. Also beer and wine. Outdoor seating. 
5380 4 Perfect, intimate little restaurant. Had the wedge salad and grilled to perfection shrimp. First dinner in Austin and it is going to be hard to beat the service and atmosphere here! 
5381 4 Super friendly staff very easy going and helpful. Great prom makeup, I will definitely be returning ! 
5382 3 Tried this place after seeing great reviews. Sandwiches did not disappoint. Had the corned beef #15 and smoked salmon #47 with curried lentil soup. Both large enough for two, and delicious. Would definitely come again. 
5383 3 Bae and I had the wraps, his was beef and mine was chicken. They were both outstanding! Table sauce was spicyyy just like I like it. Definitely coming back to try the rice bowls! 
5384 4 Torchys was awesome on Sunday! I recommend it to everyone who hasn't tried it yet especially the one on Lamar. The queso will never let you down! 
5385 4 My husband and I are visiting from OKC and I found this diner. The food was perfect! Great flavors. Good atmosphere. Mimosa's are on point! Gluten free and vegetarian options. Highly recommend this place and next time I'm in Austin, I'll be coming back! 
5386 3 Fun place for KIDS The LAZER TAG is great. BUT , A bit pricey 
5387 1 This place used to have great pho. Went last wed for the $6 special and place had 2 tables occupied. The pho was water down and noodles tasted like they were out of .15 ramen noodle pack. Try Tan Mi. 
5388 4 Best ramen in PDX. Flavor balance is off the chart, ingredients are fresh and cut with elegance. Staff is awesome. Menu varies and every day is great. Vegan and 'with meat' choices equally delicious. 
5389 4 Great eggs Benedict! That is always my go-to when visiting a new breakfast place and Valerie's did not disappoint. Highly recommend this place for a fast, good quality, affordable sit-down breakfast. 
5390 3 Food is flavorful and really tasty, price is good. Environment is a little noisy for me, but overall I think it's a nice place to eat in. Didn't care too much about their desserts though. 
5391 4 A great selection of whiskeys along with bourbons and nice cocktails. Also the ambiance is perfect for socializing with friends or observing other connections. The only drawback is parking! 
5392 0 The older blonde lady with short hair is so rude! I made a mistake in ordering and when I went to get the right one within 30 seconds of it she gave me such attitude and was extremely mean about it. I'm just human mistakes happen. I won't be back. 
5393 4 Their grilled fish is HEAVENLY. I couldn't help but keep ooing as I ate my meal. 
5394 3 Pretty busy... But well organized. Everyone was friendly. I got my meals to go since I wanted some quiet time. It is a bit noisy but not too bad. I will take pics of food once I'm home and critique. ;) 
5395 4 Sitting at the bar during happy hour, one may feel one has struck gold with the caliber of offerings on the discounted menu. Don't be fooled by the prefabricated cocktails on tap. This mixologist knows his way around a contemporary bar. 
5396 4 The food is delicious and the service is excellent. Simon, our waiter, made our dining experience wonderful!! This is my new favorite spot. 
5397 4 Consistent, great service and food. That doesn't make it sound that great, but with a lot of hit or miss places downtown, it's good to have a place to go to where you know what you're getting because it is always good. 
5398 4 1 year later and this place still rocks. Jason may be one of the best severs in the biz 
5399 3 I've been here a few times. One of my favorite is the blackberry apple. Its good and its different than your average pie. Their coffee isn't bad either. 
5400 4 Good food - great weather for sitting outside. We enjoyed the sangria, pizza, and all the goodies. The pizza. Rust was crispy. 
5401 4 This is one of my favorite restaurants in Portland. The menu is always great, and every time I have been, the food has been perfect. Very good beer selection and service. Nice vibe. What more could you want? 
5402 4 I had my Kia detailed by clean ride and had not seen it looking that good in years. Would absolutely recommend them. 
5403 4 Love Allen! Have been going to him for all sorts of ailments for about 20 years. He is exceptionally knowledgable about both eastern and western philosophies, and is always clear regarding my expectations. 
5404 4 Stumbled while walking in the neighborhood. Awesome friendly service and coffee. My cappucino was well prepared with a pretty heart. 
5405 2 Decent portions, but still expensive relative to cost. I got the BLT today and it was okay. Vibe a little pretentious. Server a little too disconnected from the orders and a little in a rush to get us out the door. Nothing special. 
5406 0 NOT A REAL INDIAN PLACE. Food is very much fusion. If you want to try real Indian food go to Swad for South Indian vegetarian food or Taj Palace or any other places in Austin where they have North Indian Food. Over priced for the quality. 
5407 3 In a rush. Use slick computers to add to order or pay! 
5408 0 Ridiculous wine prices. They sell you on a glass of wine without disclosing the price, which is outrageous to begin with. Avoid 
5409 4 Yummmm... best mochi and bubble tea I've had. A fun place to pop in or stay a while and play their board games. 
5410 3 Delicious Green curry chicken with brown rice. Bathroom was clean. Nice, friendly waitstaff. Comfortable environment open and airy-yet a bit intimate. 
5411 4 This is a hidden gem, that is delicious. The customer service was great and the food was excellent. I would come back to eat here again. 
5412 3 I have been wanting to go to this place for a while and was not disappointed. Great food and service. The lamp pops are amazing. 
5413 4 I came back to Zo for lunch today and I just had to give them the full 5 stars. I got the original gyro (lean pork) and it was just as amazing as the chicken. Awesome. 
5414 0 If I could give a 0 I would!! I've eaten here before. NEVER ever again!! The chicken taste like water!! Called in to let management know. The lady was so rude!! Get online, and see similar reviews! Horrible customer service and poor food quality/taste!!!! Save your money 
5415 4 I eat here ALLLL THE TIME! I dont eat meat and this is the best veggie place in Boston!!! 
5416 4 I have taken a wedding dress, coats, blouses and suits here to be cleaned and they have always done a great job. Items are always done on schedule, price is fair and staff is friendly. 
5417 2 It's OK. Curry chicken sandwich was good, crab croissant wasn't that great. Decent brew selection and good mimosas. Food just isn't anything special, but I enjoyed the experience overall. 
5418 2 Lunch here is really good and the bento box is a good deal but when we got dinner here it was only okay. I would not recommend the calamari either - it was very disappointing. 
5419 4 Hands down---the BEST potato skins I've ever had!! Plenty of bacon and cheese snd seasoned just right! Great pizza too!! Love Ange's! 
5420 3 Only had a brief visit, but it was very conveniently located and the coffee was great. Service was great, too. I'd definitely return. 
5421 3 Like this theatre a lot as they usually have all the new indie films that aren't at your usual neighborhood theatre. Also helps that there are lots of bars and restaurants nearby. Traffic and parking not great but that's what happens with trendy areas! 
5422 4 This is an amazing place for anybody that likes authentic Mexican food. It's not such a nice place but the food and people are really good and nice. This has to be my top 10 places to eat in Orlando. 
5423 3 A good place to go for a #justwannahavedinneralone situation. The owner/chief is really nice and able to customize your order for you. 
5424 1 What happened?! The food is great but service is horrible and the restaurant is filthy. The bussers were just using towels from their back pockets to wipe the tables?! Therefore, our menus stayed on the tables because they were too sticky to be removed. Overall experience: GROSS. 
5425 4 Loved the pizza by the slice! So convenient if you just need dinner/lunch for one. Very reasonably priced too! 
5426 4 Another great Ramen option in the Austin area. Great broth and other ingredients. It will definitely be on my food map! We ordered: Tempura Shrimp Pork Gyoza #1 Kanji Ramen #2 Spicy Mi-So Ramen All great choices! 
5427 4 The best butcher shop in town. Awesome home-made pepperoni sticks & sausages, cuts of pork & steak. Their eggs they sell - way tastier than the boxstore runs. Their cuts of family-sized birds, roasts? Excellent. Service? Thumbs up! - great, knowledgeable staff. Always a pleasure to order from them 
5428 3 I liked my room, even though I didn't buy much because of the price I did like their gift shop and I stopped by three of their restaurants. I was there for a conference and I like the size of the rooms that the sessions were held in. 
5429 2 Overpriced and overrated! Nowhere near as good as Yeah! Burger or Grindhouse Killer Burgers!! 
5430 0 I had a hot dog. the worst part was the sausage was from oscar mayer and they didn't make it. I think i can have a better hot dog at home from a better sausage than oscar mayer. 
5431 0 1. The sushi was warm and sketchy looking. After my 2nd piece, I had to go to the bathroom because I thought I may throw up. 2. They gave me IMITATION crab as one of my sushi pieces...wtf. 3. See #1 End of story. 
5432 3 Working in the area, I have gone there several times for lunch and have yet to be disappointed. The food has always been good and the service is consistently great! It's not too expensive considering the location, so I would definitely recommend this place! 
5433 3 We had lunch here today and really enjoyed it! It was too hot outside so i only had a cobb salad. It was fresh. My boyfriend had a rib 
5434 4 Great beer and even better food! You can even order sushi from the neighboring restaurant. Good pinball machines and a covered smoking patio to boot. Everything I need in a bar. 
5435 3 Great food, the cheesesteak is a must. Cheesy meatball sub was a good choice too. Waiter John was courteous and funny, definitely coming back when we're in the neighborhood. Looking forward to the cheesecake brownie next time. 
5436 4 Yum! Bring a group and get one of everything on the menu. Dill froth never taste so good. No really, you end up eating things you never knew existed, but that's what makes this place exciting. Go to Lick next door afterward for dessert! 
5437 4 I am not a hipster, but I must say that every time I come to Nerd Nite, everybody in the audience looks hipster-hawt! 
5438 4 Excellent meal from start to finish! Our server was prompt, attentive and helpful with our choices. Highly recommended. 
5439 4 Nice place! It's small and a little crazy on the weekends, but IMO, they are professional and helpful. 
5440 4 Ordered a Caribbean Queen and breakfast smoothie. Very happy with our choices. Little pastries and lettuce wraps looked good too. Fun and unique atmosphere :) 
5441 3 I had a bad experience here and they made it a priority to make it up to me. I usually stop by here for a coffee in the morning and they are very nice and even let me use my own thermos. 
5442 2 We enjoyed a quiet dinner crispy red snapper with baby bok choy in sweet panang Curry and shrimp stir fry a bit pricey for a former Chinese buffet setting. A bit sparse menu mostly clean lots of carry out 
5443 3 We eat there every week and always see a dedicated seating of regular customers. Jess is great and it is a cozy and tasty change from the usual chain restaurants. They aim to please. The food is addictive and we are sure to frequent them at least once a week. 
5444 4 It all looks very good. I had the burrito and it was delicious! Loaded with ingredients and very filling! The steak was tender and very flavorful. I will come here again! Sundays they give you a dollar off! 
5445 4 Got the "Waylon & Willie"...I think thats what its called...doesn't matter...because it was HEAVEN in my mouth. nom nom nom. The buttery bread was toasted to perfection, the caramelized onions with the cheeses and pepperocinis and bacon sauce...wait, whats a bacon sauce?...you know what? I don't even care. 
5446 4 My 14 year old son just went through a class and is now SCUBA certified! The instructor (Scott) was fantastic - very patient and professional - we trusted him completely! I highly recommend TDS. 
5447 4 I love this place. Heather is as sweet as can be, and the shop is both cozy and clean as a whistle. Sunlight streams in through the floor-to-ceiling windows as you relax and rest. It's a treat to come here and be pampered. 
5448 3 The most authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Boston --and yes, it's this location only. The others are good too, but there's something about this location that's special. Plus you'll notice that it's filled with tons of Asians --which I always take as a very good sign. 
5449 3 I miss the pre-fire set-up where you could order from your table, but this place is still great. Try the number 33! 
5450 3 I buy my chicken food here and it's a fast stop. Run in, pay and pull around back where a guy will probably already have you feed ready to load. That's good service and that's why I buy here now instead of the big farm store in Battle Ground. 
5451 3 I go here to work every couple of weeks when I want a treat. They have good wifi, a gorgeous grilled cheese sandwich, and a delicious coffee cocktail. I CRAVE their coffee cocktails. If they had comfy seating, I'd probably be in there every day. 
5452 2 Decent food for a pub. Okay place to watch the game, depends on where you sit, not all seats have a good vantage point. A plus is that they usually put the game sound on... which is rare. 
5453 2 Pretty good, have eaten here a few times now. Wished I could give them 3.5 stars, can't say I am fan, but definitley better than just ok. 
5454 4 I came for the boneless beef ribs (pressure cooker, yum) and was impressed by how well trimmed they are and the fair price! 
5455 4 Having several bad experiences with other local Dry Cleaners I was hoping, but doubtful, that Five Star Cleaners would live up to its name. But, good friendly service with quality and timely work equals five stars! Also, the location is great for OHSU employees. 
5456 4 We love this place. Simple, easy, and so delicious! I always for the carnitas! But my husband eats many of the others and loves them all. It can get busy but the line moves quick, food comes out pretty fast and tables turnover quite readily. 
5457 4 Breakfast or lunch you can't go wrong! Service is always good too. Even if you're full take home a fresh-baked treat as well. Off the beaten path but well worth the find! 
5458 4 Wonderful experience! Most pain free brow wax I've ever had and Lexie was wonderfully understanding with my pickiness in getting all the little hard to see white hairs! And there's no tipping so what seems pricey is actually more affordable than you think. Will definitely be back! 
5459 3 very nice, casual lunch. Creative pizzas and a glass of wine. Not the same vibe as the one in Charlestown, but then again, this is Wellesley and I'm not in college. 
5460 4 Best customer service i've ever had. This guy knows his shit 
5461 4 Very cute store with great service. Roger was a hoot! The shakes were delicious, especially the Nob Hill if you like hot fudge. 
5462 3 Very clean fast service hasn't tried them in awhile still giving White Castle a run for the taste 
5463 4 This place is amazing. Fried quail, oxtail on polenta; beet salad - better than what I can find in Santa Cruz. Don't tell anyone about this place. 
5464 4 Melanie gives amazing faciasl! They're extremely relaxing and they really help my skin -- with acne and huge pores, that's no small task. 
5465 3 Been here twice & have enjoyed both times. Went for a girls night out and ordered a bunch of apps & drinks. Our server Mindy was really friendly & kept checking in on us throughout the night. Will definitely come back! 
5466 3 I like Jillians for going with a group of people. I have only been here for bday partys. If you're lucky enough to get a lane, the bowling is really fun. The bars on all level are huge so it's never hard to get a drink. I'll keep going here. 
5467 4 Best Italian I've ever had. Better than North End. Most authentic Italian cuisine.. Hand-made pasta, delicious Caesar salad-- it's amazing. Don't see EXACTLY what you want on the menu?? They'll make it anyways. Most recommended Italian restaurant!!! 
5468 4 We eat here at least once a week! Food is super yummy, service is fast, and nice modern decor inside. Get the chicken pho (the beef is good but the chicken is better), thai iced tea with boba, cashew chicken, pineapple fried rice, or spring rolls and enjoy! 
5469 4 Ordered through grubhub. Faster than expected delivery. The order was accurate. The food wasn't skimped. The taste was good (normal chinese takeout). Don't see why I shouldn't give 5 stars. 
5470 4 Such a neat place! Great outdoor seating and dog friendly! The mahi tacos were unreal! Loved the retro video games! 
5471 4 This was my 3rd time here and it does not disappoint. Excellant food, great service and amazing quality for a theme park if you are a foodie. I have a gluten allergy and can order most things on the menu, plus gluten free churros!!!! 
5472 4 Brought some of my work colleagues for lunch today and they loved it as much as I did! Amazing food! Honest prices and great down to earth atmosphere! Service was great and our food was served super fast! This place is a gem!!! 
5473 4 I love this place! They take so much care in making every cup. It is my Saturday morning treat! 
5474 4 Good place for high quality tools. Great staff, good dog, and they have endmills. They're one of the few places you can find quality endmills in Portland. Only gripe, I couldn't find a US made ball-peen hammer there once. Vaughn makes hammers in the US guys... Just a tip. 
5475 4 Scott and his crew are awesome. One word- honest. They only fix what needs fixing and change only the part that needs replacing. Scott is very friendly and honest. I drive 30 minutes to go to European Motors- I wont take my BMW's anywhere else. 
5476 3 Went there for lunch and food was fabulous. Would be a five star but the wait is too long and you can't make reservations. 
5477 1 Walked upstairs...the downstairs and pool hall were both deserted.....bouncer couldn't find my name on the list and wanted to charge $10 to get in.....but the place was empty so we left. 
5478 0 Charging a $20 cover to watch a rugby match on TV is criminal. If you want to be extortionists, at least put it on your website ahead of time so people don't bother taking the train into the city first. 
5479 4 We had lunch there on a Sunday afternoon and it was great. We ordered 2 gluten free pizzas and both were uniquely delicious! The service was great and it was an overall fantastic experience. Will definitely be back. 
5480 3 If you are ever in East Vancouver with pizza on your mind, Twilight Pizza is your go to place! The T-Rex pizza was top notch. Service was better than expected, and we got right in on a Friday night! We had a wonderful experience that will bring us back again. 
5481 3 Cool little bar. Nice tap and has live music on the weekends. I really like their menu. It's unique, has lobster rolls and crab cakes. I haven't eaten there yet but plan to. 
5482 4 A real mom and pop place! I search these places out and I was not disappointed. Had a great conversation with Lisa (sweet mama) and enjoyed an amazing home cooked meal. BIG portions and amazing environment. 
5483 0 There's nothing like driving halfway across town only to find the doors are locked. Please update your hours. 
5484 1 It's not up to Hampton Inn's normal standard. Fridge didn't work and I found a tick crawling in the sheets. That somewhat ruins a stay. Staff was friendly and the price was about right for what we got...... I just hoped for more. 
5485 4 Amazing food great service would be back forsure Ordered the Hawthorne and Chicken arugula slider which were both almost too good 
5486 4 I ordered the pulled pork and was mistakenly given the fried chicken sandwich. WOW! It was amazing. Great service, bartender (Alonna) was very thoughtful and attentive. My new favorite pub in the Pearl. 
5487 4 We had our anniversary breakfast here. So much to choose from! Very friendly employees and the food is amazing. The sweet potato hash is to die for. We can't wait to go back. 
5488 4 Excellent meal and they did a very good job hosting our large group (hillsboro chamber ambassadors). They knew their food and gave us excellent recommendations. I'll be back here again soon. 
5489 2 If you're looking for Hawaiian shave ice, it's definitely not this but it's a good treat to have when it's 90+ outside. 
5490 3 The best hamburger in Austin, so far. A regular medium cheese hamburger and fries does it for me. The last one I had was eaten in about 5 minutes. I couldn't believe I ate it all and so fast, but I did! 
5491 4 If you are in Sandford, this is a must place to eat. Excellent food and exceptional service. The deluxe potato cakes were devine. 
5492 4 Yes, I've been to Hoppdoddy Burger Bar. Yes the line for this place can look ridiculous. But Most of the time those lines are because the product inside is worth the wait. Here that's definitely true. 
5493 0 Run by a bunch of bigots. Go to pollo tropical ... Or hell go to KFC. Anybody that sells white meat will have better food to digest than what this joint serves up with their discriminatory marinade. 
5494 0 The only place graduation weekend that had a reso for 6 at 6:30. Now I know why. Decent food, but there is definitely better. Fiery owner who apparently not only doesn't know how to speak to guests, but also has never heard "The Customer is always right." 
5495 3 The eclair was this side of heaven but still not the best part of the bakery for me. Nice booths, sunlight streaming in, comfortable, relaxing ... and then oh! What's that? A Russian lady playing traditional / folk songs on guitar? Awesome. 
5496 4 Always consistently good donairs. I get the same thing every time beef and chicken mixed donair and it always hits the spot. Nothing amazing but if you are hungry and looking for a good affordable bite from some really nice ladies this is your spot 
5497 4 Service was awesome and friendly! Food was great! Their vegetarian mushroom burger was spectacular. Told them it was our first time and the gave us our fries free. Food is made fresh, no sitting under a heat lamp. Highly recommend! 
5498 4 Come for take out and the food is piping hot until I get home! The Steak Pad Thai is BOMB! Massive, delicious, consistent, and I've tried it at many different places. Late hours make this one of the best food options past 11 pm. Yum! 
5499 4 The frequent line out the door says it all - this place is awesome. Delicious burgers, and they have a focus on fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The line generally goes pretty quick, and you can grab a beer while you are in line ;) 
5500 4 Holy cow this place is amazing! I had the biscuits and gravy and the hashbrown casserole. Insane! The mimosa carafe is huge! Service is outstanding! 
5501 1 Never order Hot Pot here. Too much vegetables and not enough meat. The broth was so plain. 
5502 4 We came here before heading out on a cruise and the food is amazing. Add a funky atmosphere in and it's a great stop! 
5503 4 Definitely the best oxtail and beef patty ive ever tasted in my life!!! Its not expensive too! Their jerk chicken is also really good! But i always come here for oxtail and beef patty!!! 
5504 4 The service is amazing. Especially considering how incredibly busy that place gets. Sriracha Candied bacon is amazing. 
5505 4 Just recently started shopping at sprouts. Wanted to find a natural grocery store that was more approachable than whole foods. I was suprised at the variety they have. Everything you could need and more, amd its affordable! My new favorite grocery store. 
5506 0 I just ordered online on Yelp and they called and cancelled my order. They refused to deliver because I am "way out of their area"! am exactly 1.8 miles away!. So irritating! 
5507 3 Maintenance is very friendly and is always willing to help with anything needed in my apartment in a timely manner. Front office staff is very friendly. The coffee machine in the office is also a huge plus!! 
5508 4 This is it, this is what I have been looking for in Boston since the first time I visited Canada, high quality poutine. Friendly service, and a great atmosphere added to my great experience here. 
5509 4 This hidden gem on the lake is ideal for sitting back & soaking up the Austin vibes. The vanilla latte was delicious! 
5510 4 Awesome little place to eat. Breakfast and lunch available. I had the corn beef hash and some pancakes. I am a breakfast type of guy and this place rocks!! Go try it if you love breakfast!!! 
5511 4 So yummy!!! Everything I tried is great including the falafel, chicken shwarma rollup and especially the spinach pie- I get cravings for them in the middle of the night! The family who owns King is so nice and even gave us free food to try!!! Highly recommended!!! 
5512 4 Omg this was such an amazing experience angle was so great I came in with some busted nails by some ding dong at another nail place and she was able to fix them and make me feel amazing I will be back forever now!! 
5513 4 Holy crap this place is good. Open late night, consistently delicious chicken and they even deliver! Always an interesting after-show or after-bar crowd on the weekends. For fried chicken in Columbus, this is your place. 
5514 4 Efficient! They came to do a move in clean. They showed up on time. They brought all of their own supplies. They did the ceiling fans, baseboards, cleaned the refrigerator and cabinets. Very thorough and reasonably priced. I would have them clean my house anytime. 
5515 3 Good place to get a quick lunch for tacos! PRO TIP: They'll have a special promo on twitter, mention it at the cashier and you'll get that twitter promo deal! Some of the deals are pretty good. 
5516 3 So interesting and informative. Our tour guide, Tony, was awesome. We didn't have lunch there but the menu had many delicious options and the food looked great. There were families on our tour and the youngsters were even engaged. 
5517 4 Outstanding work. I had a pedicure and full set of acrylic nails. Both were done beautifully. The pedicure came with a nice massage of the lower legs. The acrylic nails look natural. Because the work was done so carefully; it took a while - more than an hour. 
5518 4 Best crab boil I've ever had! The hush puppies are amazing, and the service is awesome! 
5519 3 Great beer and staff. Super dog-friendly. 
5520 3 ​Work in the area and definitely on ​the take-out list for us at the office. Fast service. Good food. It is what it is. 
5521 4 Favorite Vietnamese restaurant in boston. There pho is so good as are there fresh summer rolls! Very nice staff too. 
5522 4 Great club. Funny opener and main guy. They charge the cover but don't require any additional purchases (drink minimums etc). When we asked if they had a drink minimum she said "we already charged a cover charge!" LOVE that. 
5523 3 Tasty Indian food! Would eat here again. Good portions and presentation. Delicious naan. 
5524 2 we went for lunch. however we were expecting better food and service as it is a Michelin star restaurant. 
5525 3 Very good donuts! Great flavors to choose from. Some pretty simple and others very complex and unique. Decent part of town and very nice and clean inside! The only downside- the coffee was very bad, I had to dump it out. 
5526 3 Staff is always very nice. Food is great. Large portions. They have a seasonal wine/beer permit, which isn't always convenient. The decor fits well, though I personally would of went with a darker wood stain and the bar area could be a little bigger. Minor stuff. I dig it though. 
5527 4 What a GREAT PLACE! Took my wife here for her birthday. Premium seats are wort h the extra price , very comfortable We went an hour early to enjoy the bar, then another drink and food for the movie..love this place, we are hooked!! 
5528 0 Drivers leave you behind and when you try to reschedule they wanted me to wait an additional hour so I would be cutting it close to missing my flight. Paid for a cab to ensure a peace of mind. Drivers also heavily hint and pressure you for a tip. 
5529 4 Tiny hole in the wall but the sushi is awesome and cheap. The spicy salmon is particularly good with a good amount of heat and huge chunks of salmon 
5530 4 Very clean room. Great Service. The breakfast is delicious and the to go bag is agreat idea. I wad there on business and the location was great as well. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others. 
5531 4 This laundromat is nice. Air conditioned and very clean. There are always enough machines to use and they accept debit/credit cards which is convenient. 
5532 3 considering we just came back from kyoto and osaka, this place held its own. the basic ramen broth keeps the flavor strict to its origins. the pork melts in your mouth! 
5533 1 The restaurant looks very nice, I had high expectations for this place but it was a disappointment. I ordered ham eggs Benedict, the eggs were overcooked. Pricy for small portions. The coffee was good tho. Service was OK 
5534 3 This place is great! The tapas are generous portions and delicious. My boyfriend and I always get the meat paella for one which is plenty for both of us and we usually take some home. Great atmosphere. Even the bread and olive oil are delicious. 
5535 4 Even though it was an hour before close they did not rush getting my nails done! And the foot massage was amazing after walking all the Disneyland Parks the past 4 days! Thank you! 
5536 3 Cool place for a Wednesday night. Live band, full bar. Karaoke guys that sang "living on a prayer" should get a record label. Seriously, that good. 
5537 1 Took an Uber from the other side of town only to find out that they were closed at 4:00pm when their sign and Yelp said 6pm. Was looking forward to spending my money here but left extremely dissapointed. 
5538 4 I went there for the first time today and I loved it. The food was delicious, I had shrimp,rice and potato stew. One of the best meals that I ever had. The customer service was impeccable. I'll definitely come back. 
5539 3 lovely little place from a classic Deep Cove building. They've lovingly restored the building and have built a nice little business from within. Good food, pricey, but I am so happy to have some quality food at hand way down here in The Cove! Thank you! 
5540 4 The ultimate electrical company. Ralph and his crew are top notch and always remember their customers. They are on time and most importantly: CLEAN!! These guys know it is your home, not your junkyard they are working in. 
5541 4 Ordered delivery from happiness seafood restaurant. Food came faster then I expected. Food was actually hot when it arrived. Portions were good size and tasted great. Highly recommended 
5542 0 You call this a deli? no pickles extra charge for onions, 95% bread, processed turkey meat that feels papery, low low low quality, high prices, run 
5543 3 This place is awesome!!! I ate here for the first time last week and the food was amazing. Very authentic compared to other most "mexican" in Texas, which are really tex-mex. Everything on the menu sounds good and the servers were great. Loved it! 
5544 0 Pizza and 3 salads took TWO hours to arrive and when it did, of course it was cold!!! When I called, didn't even get a simple apology!! My company and I will NEVER order from here again!!! 
5545 0 Terrible... I've been to many buffets in my lifetime and this was the worst. Couldn't even finish a whole plate. Egg drop soup was a gross pale color. The food was cold except the sushi it was nice and warm (grosssss)!!! Would not recommend to anyone !!! Waste of 25$.... 
5546 3 I've been here several times and have never had a problem. I love cinnabon, and added to the atmosphere of city walk, it's a nice night out. 
5547 3 I stopped here today and tried the Chicken-Mango Quesadilla. Just the right amount of crispy and very flavorful. 
5548 0 Came here for the first time last night and a fight broke out and my friend who happened to be nearby was stabbed in his leg - scary to think that people in a drinking environment are carrying around knives and pulling them out. Won't be going back. 
5549 4 best freakin grilled cheese ever!!! come here with an open mind and a hungry stomach! 
5550 3 Love it! A must go while you're in the area. There are so many different varieties and so many yummy flavors. Be warned that if you go in the mid-afternoon the selection may be limited. 
5551 4 Atlanta's best crablegs in the hood! I once drove to ATL from Dallas just to get a plate. True Story. 
5552 3 Great comfortable place for wings and a beer. Staff is super friendly and the whole place has a good vibe. All walks of life are welcomed here and fit in seamlessly. Wish this chain existed in Cincy. 
5553 2 What is happening to Nick's? We usually rave about Nick's to everyone as the best pizza around -BUT the last two weeks have been so disappointing. Pizza is extremely well done and gross. We are so sad! 
5554 4 Clean, professional, courteous staff. Have tried many others in the past, but find myself most comfortable here. 
5555 4 Parking sucks, too loud, not enough seating, have to jockey for a table, you get the drift. Why all the 5 star reviews on yelp? It's the d4mn food !!!! Leave all pretension behind and chow down on some awesome Cuban food, you will not regret it. 
5556 4 Very pleased with the service and workmanship - very affordable. It's nice to have a local business that is true to it's customers. 
5557 4 Awesome wings - best I've ever had. Been many time and always consistent. This isn't a fine dining restaurant so don't expect more that a sports bar. We have taken many, many friends to FC and all agree the food is great. 
5558 4 We ate in the restaurant although I believe most of the business in take out. We had eggplant and tofu which was excellent, beef, noddle rice and that was good although it needed a little spice. The service was fast and they spoke some English. 
5559 4 Clothes are so cute and at a very good price. Everything is clean, doesn't feel like a thrift store at all. 
5560 3 Great burgers, good beer selection. Saw a great band play recently - 3 guitars, bass and drummer, not sure of their name - but they were excellent. Pretty tiny kitchen, so I can see them getting backed up with a big crowd. Love the atmosphere. 
5561 2 Not my favorite pizza - it's fresh and tasty but I don't like sourdough crust. Nice outdoor seating area, though 
5562 2 This menu is just weird. When you try to be an expert at everything you end up being an expert at nothing. Guacamole, muscles, Mexican street corn, fillets. Server was patronizing too. Not a lot of help in filtering this menu. Meh 
5563 3 Great pizza, tons of different choices to choose from, will def. be coming back for more 
5564 0 First timer - ordered one thing, received inedible other pieces. Paid too much for nothing. Glad we only lost $4.00 instead of what we usually buy - the Colonel's bucket!! Rude manager! 
5565 2 It didnt blow my mind! I wanted to be blown away. My burger overcooked. I asked for medium but it was well done! Yuck. My mac and cheese was cold. I want to love it..... 
5566 2 Pretty good pizza and subs but its overpriced. The staff are also jerks and not friendly at all. 
5567 1 So sad! Had meeting space rented with dinner. Food was just a bit warm sure not hot. They put tea out but no hot water. Room was very cold, we all had our coats on. One star because the room is clean and one because it's easy to find. 
5568 3 Great place to chill out and enjoy few drinks and snacks with listening to live music during the weekends. 
5569 0 Food is average at its best. Ordered three dishes the fresh summer rolls have nothing but cabbage in it and the flat rich noodles with veggies was pretty bland. The veggie pho in chicken broth was decent. Order delivery was quick. 
5570 4 I came in last night with my friend and had an amazing time!​ Our server Theresea was great, very personable and I​ will definitely​ come again. 
5571 1 Did not like the food at all ... we tried appetizers, lassi and main-course but nothing impressive at all .... have certainly had better Indian food in Boston 
5572 4 By far the best manicure and pedicure from Natick to Boston. Angie is meticulous and knows her polish colors. Love this place. 
5573 0 I love French toast, and so it doesn't take much to satisfy me. I actually had to send mine back because it was soooo dry. Then they brought it back soggy and disgusting. What the heck is all the hype about with this place? #portlandsheeple 
5574 3 If I could have their iced tea every day I would! I absolutely love it!! Along with their pineapple fried rice and their mango curry shrimp. My roomate loves the sauteed chicken and the southern pad-thai. Delicious! Totally recommend. 
5575 4 Yelp gave us great recommendations with the Floridian French toast and the eggs Benedict with turkey and avocado Busy but fast friendly service! Good quality 
5576 3 Cool vibe, great drinks , but the food is overpriced (A LOT). Go somewhere else for dinner, but here for a chill night with some great drinks with friends. 
5577 4 First time here food and service was excellent. If we lived in the area we would definitely be a frequent geust. 
5578 2 It is what it is - Chinese food served from steam tables prepared by non-Chinese to recipes. It's decent if you want something quick and reasonably priced, and are not a connoisseur of Chinese food. 
5579 3 Friendly staff. The usual expectations of Starbucks. Pastries were better than most though. 
5580 4 Great customer service... Anthony Davis really helped me find the car I wanted.. Thank you 
5581 3 Food was really good especially the shrimp tempura. We also had really awesome chicken fried rice, shrimp lo mein and steamed pork dumplings. The service was great and the food was hot and fresh. I'll be visiting again very soon! 
5582 4 Wow, the lunch specials are definitely special here. Don't be fooled by the underwhelming front of the restaurant, it is classy inside and very cozy. Very friendly and attentive service. Top notch! 
5583 1 Thursday 11/14/13. Went to Ginza on Colonial for dinner. Service was horribly slow. They forgot to turn on the grill. One couple had to wait 30 minutes for their drinks. The food was so salty we couldn't enjoy it. Will not go back. 
5584 4 Best Coffee shop in town. Great baristas, great atmosphere, great Live Music. Good stuff! 
5585 3 Nice place to get some work done. Decent wifi, comfortable chairs, power available at most tables. I'm knocking off a star only because they don't have many choices in the way of tea and don't carry any kombucha. 
5586 4 Favorite place to eat and drink in malden. Great atmosphere, awesome brew selection, phenomenal food. Never disappoints, highly recommend! 
5587 4 Fantastic place with really friendly staff and great food. When in Portland I always make it a point to stop in here on my way over to Powell's bookstore across the street. Try the Japanese Pan Noodles and the cucumber salad. I've never been disappointed. 
5588 0 Horrible! Play LOUD music at pool area till 11pm. Toilet did not flush. Dirty rooms. Horrible customer service! Would not return even if stay was free.... 
5589 0 Gave it a try... twice. Shame on me. Not very good BBQ. Unfortunate as I live across the street. Will not be back. 
5590 4 Have to start off with a frozen Margarita and a Diablo! I highly suggest the Regular Dinner, their enchiladas are the best in town!÷ 
5591 3 Lanche de frango excelente, vale a pena experimentar! 
5592 3 I met clients here on their recommendation. I had an iced tea, we sat outside by the fountain. There is ample seating inside and out, I would come again if I was in the area. 
5593 3 Excellent place if you're in need of a ramen fix, but don't want to stand in the lines at the other places. Portion size is enormous and the Sprouting Ramen is delicious. 
5594 4 I loved the entire experience. Our chef, Toshio, was fabulous both in his meal preparation and presentation and in the entertainment value of the evening itself. What a great night out for our first night in Orlando. 
5595 3 I was looking for a place to watch a Steelers game away from home. This was a great place to do so. Friendly, great food, comfortable, with all the games showing on tvs spread throughout the place. 
5596 4 I love, love love this place! I'm always impressed by how friendly the staff are, for a coffee shop they definitely go above and beyond. The lentil soup rocks, and they have some of the best hummus in town! 
5597 4 Love this little restaurant! My sister and I love to go here! The food is served quickly, and it's always super delicious. The staff are friendly. Get the fried rice and the spicy wings! :) 
5598 4 Best Fried Chicken in town! I eat it every time I am downtown for work. It is true to the original location in Tennessee!! Highly recommend to anyone who likes good fried chicken. Nice crispy outside and tender on the inside. 
5599 4 EXCELLENT! Barbacoa Taco is Great! Im so lucky to work nearby... Parking might be tricky though. 
5600 2 The pizza was really good but kind of spendy. A little Caesar salad with only lettuce and dressing cost $7, which was a rip off. The people working here can be a little annoying, and get overly upset over nothing. Overall, it was decent but expensive for what it was. 
5601 4 While my car was getting an oil change, I stumbled upon US nails while walking around. Kim, was amazing and very kind. She did a good job my my feet. The best ever. 
5602 0 Walked in the back and it smelled SO BAD they never cleaned they're bathroom or have a sewage problem but it was so gross I left. Can tell you about the kinda place. 
5603 4 Great fast service for warranty covered repaired. Staff all very friendly and efficient. 
5604 2 Well I was back in town for a customer meeting and wanted something close to the hotel. I have eaten at Tommy O's before and have to say it's okay. I was no overly or under impressed it was just middle of the road. 
5605 3 I would really like to give it a 3.5. The coffee was pretty good. limited selection. not very friendly staff. 
5606 2 Service was good, chicken parm sandwich was good, seemed like a good price but didn't come with fries or anything 
5607 4 I LOVE THIS PLACE! Great staff, great food and great drink specials! $15 margarita pitchers on Mondays. I'd highly recommend the Senor Patron Burrito. Can't wait to go back. Mateo and Ricardo are the best! 
5608 4 I live in Scituate, and I drive to Dennenos' all the time to enjoy their world class pizza. Mama D is legandary. This place blows Maria's in Scituate out of the water. 
5609 1 Screw this theater. Every auditorium has a table on the seat, whether the showing is dine-in or not... and the seats in IMAX that don't have tables are small and don't recline. The concession stand is basically self-serve, with stale popcorn and overly-overpriced items. I won't be back. 
5610 3 I have dreams about going here. Fast and friendly and the ramen is so yummy! Not as authentic as I would like, but still wicked yummy. No egg in the ramen :( 
5611 3 Jacks is the place to be. The food is exceptional, I recommend the calzones! Or one of their funky pizza slice creations (hotdog pizza ect)! They have some good alcohol prices and a good atmosphere. During dinner it's always packed though so be prepared to sit out back! 
5612 4 Love Kim Wu!!!! Always great food and great service from everyone ... ESPECIALLY SCOTT!! He's super attentive and courteous 
5613 4 A Monte Cristo is tough to make right. This is the place that knows how to do it. A diner with comfort food and good service makes this place the best. 
5614 4 This is the BEST nail, wax, facial Salon around. The staff is unbelievable friendly and cater to your every need. I have very dry hands and nail polish is not my friend - My manicure lasted 2 weeks and my hands never felt better. Well worth the $12 weekly treat! 
5615 4 What a deal! My all time favorite samosas, 3 curries, dal, rice, puri, pickle, and dessert all for one low "daily special" price. 
5616 4 Excellent burgers, fries and onion rings. All fresh homemade not frozen! I also had a huckleberry margarita that was delicious! 
5617 4 I got the Pastor tacos they were absolutely delicious!!! And don't get me started on the wings!! It's a must try!!! So so good. Service was also great everyone was so nice, great customer service. 
5618 3 Good service, dogs allowed, no pre made tequila mix, and filling tacos What more can you ask for? 
5619 4 Made a small takeout order tonight. 90% Asian people in there. They speak perfect English. The food is GREAT. Even got a free miso soup, delightful. Some of the food on the tables looked quite unique. Especially the flaming appetizer I saw. Must go back soon! 
5620 3 After searching for a salon I've finally found it!! Clean friendly staff with quality products. The massages were great. Relaxing atmosphere. I would def recommend. 
5621 4 We ate here today for the first time so good We try to eat at a different bbq place every few months , we loved our lunch so much we are coming back next week 
5622 4 I spent a wonderful afternoon taking The Harvard Tour with my mom and I loved it! Or tour guide Aidan was knowledgeable and lovely. 
5623 4 Bought a whole banana cake here the other day for my wife's birthday. The people at the counter aren't particularly nice, but man the cakes are great. I don't think you could go wrong with any of them, but the banana is particularly outstanding. 
5624 3 Love this place for breakfast. Personalized caring service. Food: great basic stuff. Great hash. Setting: clean and genuine north end. Prices: Very reasonable. 
5625 4 I love this place! Yummy abundant quality food with great, non-disturbing customer service with an unbeatable buffet price. On my way there now for another awesome meal. 
5626 4 I really enjoy my time at this little theatre! It is tucked nicely inside the grandview area and isn't crowded. I love watching movies there. 
5627 2 A fine lunch spot for vegetarians. Long line developed just after we arrived around 12:15 on a Wednesday. Much better than the typical chain restaurant. 
5628 2 My complaint is this place is likean oven. 85 outside and hotter i side! Had fish and chips. Fish good. The Shepards pie is better. Fun band and staff very friendly. I eould return in the winter. 
5629 4 The General tso chicken sandwhich is my fave so delicious and hits the spot every time! Yummmmoooo 
5630 4 Amazing breakfasts and smoothies, I like sweet breakfasts so the PB&J waffle really hits the spot. I love bringing friends too because the staff is warm and welcoming. Also make sure you try The Carlton, it is so incredible! 
5631 4 I just couldn't ask for more for the price or location. Food is by people who like food and beers are by beer people.... Awesome! 
5632 0 Do not call that number. It's fake. It leads to a motor club ad that wants you to sign up with them and never goes to BCBS 
5633 4 Been four times. Each time great food and great drinks. Had Malaysian Chicken Wings, Hanoi Noodles, and Vanilla Lavender Old Fashioned. Wow! Server was friendly and knowledgeable. Get the Sambal Oelek on the side! Love the dog friendly outdoor seating. 
5634 0 This place is dirty. One of the booths smelled like vomit. The bathroom has never been remodeled since it opened. Nasty dirty. Complained to corporate no response. .. I guess they don't care. Friend got SICK. I THINK BAD MEAT!!! 
5635 3 I have eaten at the Jacksonville Beach, St. Augustine, and the Altamonte Springs locations. The menu is diverse and the portions are large. It is always busy. Worth trying! 
5636 0 Literally the worst Raman I've ever had in my life. Raw chicken and pork. Over priced appetizer. The pork in the Raman was all fatty and inedible. I was hoping to find a good new Raman place and this one just isn't it. 
5637 4 Enjoyed beef bibimbap with a side of kimchi and sweet potatoes. blossom Tree was very clean and service fast. Food was flavorful and I will certainly be returning. 
5638 0 They were out of several of their most popular bagels at 10am. They obviously don't know how to forecast sales because the man ringing said "yea those are our most popular bagels." so if you know that, make more initially. So you don't run out. 
5639 4 The best sushi and Chinese in all of Metrowest! Do not let the outside fool you! They also delivery... But not to my office in a Framingham. 
5640 2 It's very OK. We excused a lot for being local owned and fresh. We did not like the thick tortilla soup at all.We do like the corn tortilla tacos 
5641 3 Good tacos. Reasonable pricing. Al Pastor is my favorite. 
5642 4 This bakery is outstanding. I've had cupcakes at all the supposed best places including magnolia bakery and buttercup in New York city and these are just as good if not better. I want them to cater my wedding! 
5643 4 I saw Amy Randall yesterday for Gramma Maggie. She is wonderful. Spent at least an hour with us. She did the most comprehensive exam and we are definitely on the right travel. Thank you Dr Randall 
5644 0 Horrible, horrible service. Probably one of the worst Chinese restaurants in Vancouver. They do have nice congee but why bother coming all the way here and paying for the bad service that will upset you for the rest of your day? 
5645 4 Awesome Po-boy sandwiches! Best in ATL! 
5646 4 It's usually pretty busy but the gentleman remembered my name and it was like maybe the third time I've ever seen him. Very friendly staff... 
5647 3 Awesome diner with great breakfast. Never had anything bad here. Stick with the staples. Doesn't hurt that they have only attractive girl servers every time I've been in here. 
5648 3 Great food!! The steak was delish!!! Food came out cold and the manage was nice to redo the dish and have to say it was very good. Guacamole was a winner. 
5649 2 Extremely busy, and it was hard to flag down our waitress. If you're a germaphobe, this is not the place for you: silverware is kept in a communal bucket on the tables. Portion sizes were very cheap, but we enjoyed the atmosphere. 
5650 1 New location with poor service. Very disappointed with our lunch today The salad was over priced with one small dollop of goat cheese, the Shrimp tacos tasted frozen and the Brisket dip was forgetful. 
5651 0 When I called them the first time to check about the menu, the man who answered my phonecall replied that "you can go to my online menu" and then hang it up rudely. This kind of service does not even deserve one star. 
5652 2 Lunch is better then dinner - the sushi is pretty good - but it could be a little fresher. Service is inconsistent 
5653 4 I went for happy hour. The service was great and I had the best sake and best sushi roll I've ever had at any local or non local sushi place. It was such a mouthgasm and I'm craving it again. 
5654 2 OK chicken, honestly nothing special. Missing 2 big things in my opinion, pepper gravy for the chicken and whipped cream for the pie! 
5655 4 This place is awesome. Food is excellent!! I'm from Orlando and came for dinner last night. It was so good that I had to come back for lunch today. Great atmosphere to boot! 
5656 3 Store was clean and well laid out. Shopkeepers were very helpful. 
5657 4 One of the coolest things about Portland is the river, and one of the coolest bridges over that river is the Steel Bridge. I love going across it every morning during my bus commute to work. 
5658 4 Great experience - I came with a group of 5 and was seated immediately in the cozy dining room. Service was exceptionally fast and attentive. Patty is personable and passionate about what she does! 
5659 4 Very good. We stopped here as we were passing through. The portions were huge. I highly recommend the steamed dumplings. They were large and full of flavor. The chicken and broccoli with a little bit of spice (ask them to add it) was great too! 
5660 3 Very clean operation. Professional and nice staff. Will definitely go back! 
5661 4 Change is hard, we know... I love the new Bodega! The new clean design is really nice. I don't remember the garage door before but I love it! Another great beer selection too. Please, always have Mad Tree on tap! And the food was delicious. 
5662 0 Steer clear. They lie and don't care. Consider yourself warned. Have had two shady dealings with this store. First time shame on them. Second time shame on us. We should have known better. They are not even a real Verizon store and it shows. 
5663 2 I like the coffee, I live around the corner. But the staff is pretty slow. 
5664 4 I remember when they opened the first CPK in Orlando. I love the BBQ chicken salad. Good service and great food. Always a great stop on our VACA's to O-town. 
5665 4 Super Muss man gewesen sein. Waffeln extrem gut. Rechtzeitig vor Öffnung da sein. Lohnt sich 
5666 4 Fantastic. I've been here dozens of times but found new respect today with the 12 wing plate. Easily the best wings I've ever had. 
5667 4 This is one of my favorite local spots to bring my laptop to or just stop in for a quick cup of coffee. The coffee is delicious and quick. The owner is super friendly and cheery. Ample seating, yummy snacks and warm atmosphere keeps me coming back more and more. 
5668 0 Poor shuttle service; expect to spend at least 50 minutes waiting. Don't book through DTS. 
5669 2 Ok I live here and understand that the residents have been ignored for years without proper maintenance, but Ms Jane the new leasing office manger is trying hard to fix things and already addressing the AC issue vigorously. Hopefully if she stays longer things will improve... 
5670 3 I like the vibe at Judy Jetsons, and Maureen was able to give me the cut exactly as I asked for it. Very skilled & asked the right questions, not pushy at all. Paid $48, I've paid more for cuts I didn't like. 
5671 4 I got my lashes done for the first time mid September and have been keeping up with them ever since. Stephenie is amazing. She offers fair prices and does an exceptional job. She takes her time to make sure your lashes look fantastic. I wouldn't go anywhere else. 
5672 4 She did a great job! Our place looks great. 
5673 4 Delicious food. Had the Oso Bucco con risotto special - fantastic. Friendly people too and a cool setting. Recommend 100%. 
5674 4 Amazing!!! Went in today on my way to work. Found a nail/screw in my tire. Yikes. Worried $$$$ only took less then an hour. They fixed it for free!!!! #blessed 
5675 3 Went there with the wife while I was in town for work. The crab cakes were on point and the lobster roll was delicious. The staff was awesome and we never wanted something, it was brought the table before we even asked. 
5676 4 So good. Amazing coffee. The service was great and they were on too of helping the guests! I went out of my way for a return trip before leaving Portland. Must visit. 
5677 4 Have ordered from here a few times and we always receive great service, super fresh ingredients, and just what we ordered. Thanks for your continued great products and service. 
5678 3 The food is so good like the waffles and bubble tea!! But the service is kind of slow. 
5679 4 Amazing little brunch place inside with a bunch of rotating 'pop ups' with a super eclectic and cozy feel. Steak sandwich was AMAZING! Perfectly cooked, and with just enough spice for brunch. Definitely worth the stop. 
5680 4 Best and most flavorful tacos in Atlanta! Don't let the exterior fool you, it's a classic hole in the wall. 
5681 3 Breakfast was excellent today. I tried the Veggie omelet and it was very tasty. Our waitress was attentive and we seated right away on a Sunday morning at 11:30. 
5682 1 $10 cover for standard bar scene with a dj. Major ripoff. Find a different spot without the profiteering. 
5683 0 This is the absolutely worst Starbucks I have ever been too. The drive thru people have no people skills and the makers clearly was not taught how to make drinks properly. Go somewhere else. 
5684 4 This place is great! The coffee is strong, the owner is friendly, and the decor is really cute. So glad I found it! 
5685 4 Chris Haupt, my trainer, is extremely supportive, yet he also pushes me to my limits. He's an awesome trainer! The weight training machines are good. The treadmills are good. The staff is friendly. They keep the place very clean. 
5686 4 The only thing you need to think about ordering are the Bacon-Wrapped Jalepeños. Well, and the fish tacos ! 
5687 2 Some good food, but generally over hyped and a long wait. 
5688 4 So much Austin charm. Lots of art hanging, really friendly. Food is delicious!! Smaller place, didn't have a long wait. 
5689 3 Fantastic places in NOPO for veggies (vegan and vegetarian). Even if you're in a rush, run in and grab a pre made sandwich or nori wrap! So delish, just a little pricey. 
5690 3 I love baby greens! The only reason I gave them 4 stars is bc they are just so darn pricey! Plus the girl in the drive thru always gives my dog a treat, which makes him a happy camper:) 
5691 3 The food was excellent and the service was on point. Very flavorful. The only thing i would caution is with the prices. It's listed wrong I think. Almost everything costs at least $10. 
5692 4 Great food, ambience and staff. Every one was helpful and welcoming. Enjoyed every time I have came and visited. 
5693 2 I wish they had an option for thicker crust but the pizza is good and I love that you can put any topping on that you want without extra fees. There's always a small line when I go in. Most of the workers are friendly! 
5694 4 Great service! They came over the next day to look at our broken air conditioner. Good communication, very reasonable rates. They had the needed parts in their van, and didn't waste any time. Will defintely use them again and would recommend to others. 
5695 4 My fiancé and I usually come every Friday night and request Maria. She is an amazing, hardworking waitress at this restaurant and we love coming to see her! Such a friendly personality. The other wait staff is amazing too! 
5696 3 A nice cafe setting, since there is a diverse selection of beverages too. - loud music - no milk available for your coffee, only powdered creamer 
5697 3 Had my watch battery replaced here a few times and had zero issues. Also, the sales people were happy to answer other questions I had about some items while I waited. 
5698 4 Great bar and surprisingly good food. I have never got a more serious bar burrito. Service was excellent too. 
5699 2 This is the first restaurant I visited in Boston. I had dinner here with my family. The ambiance was really nice. The service was really good. The servers where very attentive. The food was good but could have been a little more creative. 
5700 4 Dim Sum brunch is fire. Pork Buns are an awesome choice. 
5701 3 Been there, done that... Excellent happy hour food on Wednesdays. The price is right and the ice tea was perfect! 
5702 4 wasn't expecting a lot from a 24/7 donut place, but surprisingly the yeast donuts are so good. Especially the apple pie one, cake donuts were just fine nothing to standout but at lease they were not dead sweet. 
5703 4 On return visit we were not disappointed! Steven our server was great; payed special attention to make sure our drinks were done right and our food too. Greatly appreciated, and made for icing on a wonderful day at the mall! See you again; hopefully soon. 
5704 3 Found ourselves on bunker hill at dinnertime. This was the closest restaurant with decent rating. Thrilled with the history of the place. Casual, great for kids, inexpensive, food was yummy, and Guinness what more could you want? Bacon,cheddar burger cooked perfectly, and shepard's pie delicious! Wait staff friendly. 
5705 4 Love this place! Best borch I trade in Orlando! It's always remind me of my home country when I go the People who work over there are very nice. And food are amazing. 
5706 1 Been here for about 2 years. The staff recently changed and has gotten pretty bad. The manager, Katie, actually parks in the handicap spots when it's cold out. Maintenance is new and sluggish. Will not be signing a new lease here. 
5707 3 Adorei pullled delicioso , costela no ponto, acompanhamentos deliciosos, preço justo. Costela macia e suculenta 
5708 4 How have we just now discovered this place! The whole pizza is perfect.. Sauce, crust.. Everything! 
5709 3 MANGO SEASON!! Ripe and delicious! Stop by with the family and everyone enjoyed the Mango bubble shake. We tried bubble waffle .. little bit on the sweeter side then expected. Other then the cramped space, we love the drinks. 
5710 4 We had a wonderful anniversary dinner at Tiffins! Our waiter was Mike and he was absolutely fantastic! Beautiful inside with delicious food! Highly recommend! 
5711 0 This visit confirmed that qdoba is better every day of the week. Also, not kid friendly, no changing station, ridiculous rules for getting a "side", can't move the tables to accommodate groups, and finally 10 bucks for the smallest of portions. 
5712 3 Nice place to grab a quick snack or drink. I have tried their teas, almond biscotti and almond croissant. A great spot to meet up with friends or work. It is lively in here so if you're looking for a quiet place to work bring your headset. Friendly staff 
5713 4 Awesome place to drink some locally brewed beer! Visiting from Michigan and we had a very welcoming experience. Will definitely be coming back when visiting Boulder in the future. 
5714 3 Go for the view, stay for the food. Fish was cooked perfectly. Meal was fabulous. Cheese plate came with toasted raisin bread. Asked the server if it was possible to get a different bread. Absolutely was the answer. Out came non-toasted raisin bread. 
5715 3 Who knew you could find nice GF baked goods and smoothies at a pharmacy? Nice austin vibe, ill be back. smoothies are pricey at 6+ bucks 
5716 3 Great food. I love the carne asada tacos. Would love an online order option. 
5717 3 Delicious Khao Soi Gai soup. The tofu was quite nice in this combination (special request). Service was a tad slow for the entreees. A little bit more pricey than other Thai places, but very nice nonetheless. Looking forward to trying more. Appetizers were average (we had some triangle) 
5718 4 The service, music and atmosphere here is great. My favorite brunch item is their Dirty Breakfast. Bonus: if you like to sleep in, brunch is served til 4pm! One downside for me is that it doesn't have much natural lighting so try to get a table by the window. 
5719 4 I ordered Turkey Bacon Club, and it was very tasty. Friendly staff and delicious food make it a pretty good choice at Terminal E :) 
5720 4 Got my snow tires put on both of our cars quickly and at a good price. New manager seems to be working hard to provide good service. 
5721 3 Good beef and chicken sticks, great fried salmon. Price is a little high for such small portion but the taste made it for it. I would visit again if I was in the area. Good for college town food truck. 
5722 4 I went here the other day and ordered "The independent" and I was impressed. The Barbacoa and avocado went perfectly together. Love the service and fun environment 
5723 2 Helpful. You can call the store to check stock for an item and they will put it aside for you. Gladly. Decent selection and prices. Watch for sales. Excellent return policy, which they honour. Hassle-free. 
5724 2 Lots of people working on their laptops. Love how they serve coffee by Intelligentsia. Love the natural lighting of interior. Great baked goods variety and breakfast. 
5725 4 Excellent staff who answer questions and help you resolve your sewing problems. Wide selection of cloth and notions. 
5726 3 We loved it. Had the lamp plate and the Mousaka plate. Both were tender and tasty goodness. Ordering up at the counter is simple style. Building keeps it feeling home like. We will be back to try some more. 
5727 4 Everything was amazing, the Kobe Beef and Lobster is the way to go. The staff was great the whole way threw, the cook gave an amazing performance with several funny jokes. 
5728 2 Meh. Just meh. Their rice is pretty bland and the egg rolls taste funky. If you want some quality Chinese takeout go a few blocks down the road to Chin Chin. Pretty disappointing. 
5729 4 Amazing all you can eat! Need I say more! Well I will. $29.95 for great fresh sushi that is so good!!! The service is A+. Amazing for taking a date. The menu is light. You can try anything. Everything is good. Love the seaweed! Will be going back! 
5730 1 Don't go on Monday night. Steak sandwich,our reason for going ,was dry as a bone. Onion rings burned. That said the service was excellent. Spaghetti meals seemed ok. 4adults, 2 sandwiches,2 spaghetti meals, 1drink,1 salad,1app.,2 ff upgrades with 10$tip....62$us. 
5731 4 Another really good dinner. Service was very nice, eggplant parmesan and pizza were both delicious. Wine and beer selection quite nice, And as always the owner and staff were gracious, professional and pleasant. Our family dinner was very nice. 
5732 2 Good food, a little bit hard to find, and a little pricey, but I really liked what I got. The staff was kinda grumpy when I came in to get my take-out. Dunno why, maybe they're just kinda curt generally. It wasn't offensive, just not friendly. 
5733 3 The best place for calamari!! It just melts in your mouth!! And the pasta dishes are awesome!! Great service and atmosphere..what more can you ask for!?! 
5734 1 Environment is nice, staff is ok, fish and chips was a total let down. Nice fries, tartar sauce was plain, fish was bland, killed it with malt vinegar to make it edible. Other menu items look promising, may try again at a future date. 
5735 3 Solid sports bar with good food. The pdx (fried) broccoli was dynamite! The pork rinds were tasty, but quite large. And the street tacos had a couple extras. Almost wish I would have ordered more friend broccoli. 
5736 4 This place is the best! We have been there twice and it is the best pizza I have EVER tasted! I had the thai pizza and my friend had to Jester pizza. We stuffed ourselves silly. 
5737 4 I like the atmosphere here and how convenient it is to my house. Their food and wine are delicious. It's a cozy place to bring friends. 
5738 1 Maybe I'm just a hard to please customer but the stay was rude and the fried rice i ordered was bland and the rice was undercooked. The red curry tofu is good though. Even though the portions are something to brag about. Not very much parking. 
5739 4 Great bar, good prices ($5 beers). It's one of those old school joints that have been around for a long time. Good layout, conveniently located. Only offers wine and beer though. Dartboard in the back so that was definitely a plus. Would go back when I'm back in Boston. 
5740 4 Güzel bir mekan, yemekleri Türk lezzetlerine çok yakın. Menüler çok büyük, bir porsiyon lahmacun istediğinizde iki lahmacun geliyor mesela, veya bir porsiyon adana istediğinizde Türkiye'de Adana olarak gelen etten iki tane geliyor. Her çeşit alkol var. Pazar'ları brunch var. Çalışanlar çok cana yakın ve ilgililer, kesinlikle denenmesi gereken bir yer. 
5741 4 Our families new favorite Joy Teriyaki!! Large portions. One bowl is two meals for me. Fast and friendly. They even let me purchase a bottle of their sauce. We just love it 
5742 4 This place is amazing!!! Joe recommended it. Best wings and pizza in the colonies. Great service and ambience. Place has a comfortable air and quirkiness about it. My family LOVED it!!!! We'll be back. 
5743 4 If you think you have already tried the best burger, you are mistaken. These burgers are so flavorful, nothing compares. Definitely worth a try! 
5744 3 Good place for quick ramen. Selection of broths and toppings is excellent. Would recommend spicy miso ramen with spicy noodles. 
5745 3 Tight seating but has delicious tofu soup. The spicy is more like medium spicy to me at first and the heat quickly felt like a mild. Next time I'm going with extra spicy! 
5746 2 Just ordered a bunless burger and thought it was good. Wasn't cooked to medium rare as I requested. Cooked well done. Didn't notice since it was ordered to go. At least it wasn't dry. Pricy since it was 10 bucks for just burger. Really prefer fudruckers but better than MacDonald. 
5747 4 tastefully appointed décor cheaper than i thought it would be fast seating surprisingly-fresh fish crowded, but expected on a weekend night some of the best sushi in town what's not to like? 
5748 3 They recently switched the male/female sides and I like it much more. They always have a great sale items section. On several occasions, I have gotten great deals, such as full, pleated skirts and a blue fitted puffed-sleeved jacket for $20 each. Try your luck here or the Rockingham Mall. 
5749 4 Excellent place, excellent wine excellent food and excellent service 100 % recommended The only bad is close to early, need to open more late, 
5750 4 The most proactive, responsive and capable team I have had the pleasure of working with. I highly recommend connecting with Kershaw to form a valuable and lasting partnership for your business and personal finance needs. I cannot speak more highly of their capabilities. 
5751 3 This is seriously a great deli. The sandwiches are piled high with meat. So much that it may be difficult to get your mouth around it. The staff are always so friendly and helpful, especially the server Chrissy. 
5752 3 They took us without a reservation and it was great. I will definitely go back. I asked for massage and got head to toe pampering. 
5753 3 Good service and good food. I've order the same thing each time: the beef&lamb kebab. I get the house sauce, spring greens, cucumber, and jalapeños. 
5754 4 OMG! This is the best fried chicken, evah! It reminds me of why I miss the south. Austin is the best!! 
5755 2 Small mall offers only a few stores but has a decent food court and movie theater. 
5756 4 Comfortable atmosphere in the bar, deck and/or in the dining room. Excellent happy hour, but the bar area gets packed because of it. 
5757 3 Great food with huge potions. Place is REALLY small though so beware you will be sitting next to a stranger 
5758 3 The soft serve was good 'n cheap. Just what the doctor ordered on a hot summer's day. 
5759 0 I observed an ugly incident early one night and the manager handled it about as poorly as it could be handled - he showed a sad combination of ignorance, a hot temper and complete lack of respect for anyone. Avoid! 
5760 2 everything was fine except my main dish,i ordered medium rare steak but it was dry like a cracker,my appetizer was humus and it was great.the hostess was polite and very quick.the place is fine and not noisy. 
5761 4 Fun colors, relaxing environment and great attention to detail! Ryan took his time and filed every nail to squared perfection. He used high quality glosses for my manicure and was an extreme professional. Need your nails done in downtown Portland? This is the place! 
5762 4 Very easy to work with. We needed a repair and they came out the next day to fix it. I would recommend... 
5763 4 Always has good food and it's a nice place. I tasted the Jonny's jam guacamole and... Oh my God! It's delicious, it should be a must in your life. 
5764 4 delicious pizza with interesting, delicious, appropriate toppings. Great for a lunch slice or dinner with friends (esp. with movie theater proximity). One of only two (Regina's being the other) acceptable pizza places I've found in Boston. 
5765 2 Had the jerk chicken meal. It included the chicken, rice, beans and plantains. The meal was decent. It wasn't great, but not bad. The tres leches cake was pretty good. The staff was very friendly and I'd go again if in the area. 
5766 2 The burger and the bread were great. I would've given it four stars however they forgot the bacon on my bacon cheeseburger. Overall I would go back being sure to check my burger before I leave. 
5767 2 This place could be amazing if the service wasn't horrible all the time. I live close so I frequent shenanigans often. Reggae night is fun. Their food is great but service is painfully slow and no one is friendly. 
5768 3 Such a good place! The restaurant is really beautiful with two huge aquariums. Staff are so helpful and give me some recommendations. Everything was nicely presented and good. In summary, good food, good service. 
5769 4 I went there long time ago but I still remember how delicious the dessert was and I totally recommend it to food lovers like me. :) 
5770 3 Really good home style breakfast. Had the Egg BLT. It was great except it came with mayonaise. I probably should have expected that, but mayo in the morning was kind of off putting. The home fries with some Frank's Red Hot hit the spot and got me going though. 
5771 2 CLOSED. I've been going to Elsy's for about five years. I liked going there because the prices were reasonable and the blow dryer wasn't too hot. I recently called the shop because I noticed she had moved. When I spoke with her she said that she no longer does hair. 
5772 3 Yummy breakfasts/brunches. I have eaten there 5 or 6 times. Every meal has been delicious! The only detractor is that it can take a while to get your food, but it's always worth the wait. 
5773 1 This company is way overpriced and takes way too long to get to the destination. Honestly, pretty disappointing since you pay so much and expect it to live up to its price but it definitely doesn't. Too bad... 
5774 4 Amazing place to have breakfast. Amazing environment and food. We ordered vegetarian omelet and bear special. 
5775 4 This place is by far the best Columbian restaurant in town. My favorite food is steak with mofongo and chimichurri sauce. 
5776 4 Great ahi tuna. Love Chianti's. The service is always consistent and the chef special's are always delicious. The filet mignon is prepared perfectly (medium rare) so if you are in the mood for something besides Italian food, Chianti's is the place to go. 
5777 4 Perfect place for a summer happy hour! Vodka gimlet is fantastic; burger with egg a must! And any pasta dish will be cooked to perfection! 
5778 3 Really good Thai food. Had been looking a decent place in Mount Pleasant area and here it is! Had the green curry, pad thai and coconut chicken mushroom soup - all great. The springs rolls are meh - kinda oily and a more like an egg roll. 
5779 1 Oh man. The gyro was good, but my tabouli salad was brown lettuce and brown mint and hardly anything else. The spanikopita was inedible, and the samosas were soggy and greasy. I'm kind of in awe that I spent 43.00 on this. 
5780 3 This place is a hidden spot soon to disappear. I love the underground short bar. Bricks everywhere ..the feeling of an old time under ground blind pig 
5781 2 Good spot for friends and family. Kids enjoy an open restaurant with the food on a merry-go-round. The wait staff was very patient and helpful since it was our first time. The food is average. 
5782 1 The rehabilitation hospital looks like a VA hospital. Drab, not well maintained visually, room needs a paint job, holes in drapes. Not what I'd expect from a world class hospital. 
5783 3 Excellent Upscale Food and Awesome Bartenders and Drinks. Also, Don't forget most Friday and Saturday nights Great Live Bands..... 
5784 4 Stayed at this hotel recently for a company conference and really liked it. Great front desk staff, decent sized rooms, comfy beds, and spacious bathrooms. I'd definitely stay again if work ever brings me back to Buckhead. 
5785 4 This "experimental kitchen" is one you'll want to check out if you're into healthy, feel-good foods. Their dads are phenomenal and they feature some seriously incentive smoothie flavors. Try the carrot cake smoothie- so delicious! 
5786 3 Although I've never been big on Mexican food, I'm a fan of Sol Azteca. Seating on an outdoor patio + gazpacho + refreshing Sangria = great summer meal. 
5787 4 Had the Walleye. Cooked to perfection. Wonderful mashed potatoes. Had the crispy calamari as an appetizer. Always consistent. Very good. 
5788 4 this place has the most authentic Taiwanese street food in Austin. Very delicious Taiwanese food！ 
5789 4 I have been going to Vincents for years, when his father-in-law (Vincent) ran the business. Frank is just simply fantastic. No matter what your age or hairstyle Frank will do whatever you want. He is patient and always ensures the customer leaves happy. Try him out, I strongly recommend him. 
5790 4 Dr. Navid and his team are amazing!! They took so much time to give me a good thorough cleaning and removed cement from where my braces were that has been there for years!!! This place deserves all 5 stars!!! 
5791 4 The black pepper and honey omelette alone is worth a visit! 
5792 4 Second visit was just as speedy as the first. No appointment necessary either time. These guys are friendly, professional, and prompt! An excellent find. 
5793 0 Can I give it zero stars? Living here was one of the worst experiences off my life. Beware, it is very unsafe. If you have any questions feel free to pm me 
5794 4 What an awesome little bar. Somehow managed to be a Johnny Cash tribute without being totally cheesy or feeling like a weird museum. 4 beers on tap, friendly staff, cool space. 
5795 4 Omg .. Best place in town for brunch. Their specials are so creative always.Love their waffles , paella and Mimosa. 
5796 0 Zero service, Zero cleanliness. 1 hour to get food after you order. 30 minutes to get a table. So avoid! 
5797 4 Service and people were amazing ! Honestly I've been to so many McDonald's around the country and everyone was so nice!! Especially the cashier girl with the blue eyes !! 
5798 4 We had the dim sum basket, pork spring rolls and the Korean beef. They were all excellent, highly recommend this restaurant!!!! The service was the best, our waiter was one of the best ever! 
5799 4 I love this place. The staff is friendly, helpful & extremely knowledgeable. I always find what I need. They have great coffee & snacks. Yummy smoothies! Their sandwiches are wonderful. Hell... I can't think of a single bad thing to say about 'em! 
5800 4 Paneer Paranthropus, Aalu Or Gobi Parantha or amritsari kulcha... you just can't go wrong. The best in town and made fresh making you eat them unstoppable. We tried chole bhature and chat and I say pretty good. Defiantly coming back for more!! 
5801 3 used just one time my 15 shirts, press and light starch - good price $1,75 per one men shirt! pretty happy with result! 
5802 3 Great array of food. The typical bar fare that you will find most places but good quality at a decent price. They have a great drink and beer menu with many specials. This is a great place to watch a game, sporting event or just hang out. 
5803 4 Excellent hotel great service and room was clean, definitely walk around and check out the pool and savannah outlook to spot your favorite animals 
5804 2 Crispy chips and good guacamole they had. Ghostly was the cheese dip and beans. Never thought I would want a bean to taste bean-y, but somehow they only managed to capture the fragrance of bean and cheese and not the flavor. Good margaritas. 
5805 3 Wish I would have taken a picture to share. The Beef Pasty was tasty. Will definitely be back before we head home. Potato salad was yummy as well. 
5806 4 The ghost burger was awesome. Best use of ghost pepper in a sauce that I have ever had. I love flavorful hot sauces!! 
5807 3 I'n not quite a burguer person, but this place was really good. I had the burguer with kobe, incredible. Not a fan of the line system, but it was really quick considering it was a saturday at lunchtime. The service is really good. Probably will be going back 
5808 2 Since I last wrote a review, all Starbucks (including this one) have settled on a price for my "Customized Tea." Cheers all around! 
5809 3 Yum!! Their vegan gluten free Quinoa-Flax Bread was a surprise. It is light & airy. The vegan gf Oreo cookie was so-so. Coffee cake was very good. I'm trying the Focaccia Bread tonight and the Quinoa Bread (just w/out flax) this weekend. Will update... Girls there are very nice. 
5810 2 The food is not bad nor is it mind blowing. It's basic Americanized mexican. You may have to find your server or you may see your server hanging out with their friends in a booth while serving you. 
5811 4 I had the salmon and rice...it was a very generous serving of fish on my rice...it was cooked properly and was very delicious..I would definitly come back a second time. 
5812 4 I just kept on ordering the crab Rangoon over and over again. Pad Thai with crispy chicken or with regular chicken - both are a divine experience for your palate. This is a place for no-frills, just good authentic Thai food. ... and I used to live in Thailand! 
5813 3 The staff were very nice. The good was also great. It's very easily accessible on Robson St and we just ran into the spot because we were walking back to our hotel. Try it out! 
5814 4 Fantastic breakfast !!! My wife and I both had the bad ass bacon and eggs. Thick cut bacon and it was fantastic. We shared a stack of pancakes with my daughter and had to take a whole pancake home because of the size. Great service and great food. 
5815 4 Staff was great. Make you feel welcome. Good quality gear with some good sales to choose from. Really enjoyed this store and will return. 
5816 4 Quickly seated. Nice artwork. Fun waitress. Great food that really hit the need for New England Chinese. 
5817 4 Great bulgogi and bibimbap. Service is friendly and attentive.If you need a quick and delicious lunch spot I'd definitely recommend. 
5818 2 Had the Pad Thai & it was really good. Can't wait to try a few other dishes. Service was a little sketchy, kinda felt like I was putting them out but I will go back. 
5819 3 the food is good ! nice serviced i love the mushroom satted with spinach and baby pork. Beautiful place open until 12am Abslutely be back ! 
5820 3 I went to M&D's for my birthday dinner celebration and had a fantastic time. I highly recommend the buffalo chicken dip and their fantastic mac and cheese menu. It was just all sorts of deliciousness!! 
5821 4 Make a reservation!!!! The four of us made the lamb,croquettes,hanger steak, and empanadas our favorites although we didn't stop there. We also enjoyed a charcuterie board of mild sausage, sliced ham,Manchego cheese and quince which if put in your mouth together makes magic (Thanks Diego). 
5822 4 It's a dive, get over it. If you are not in the mood for that, go to another place. But if you are, this place is awesome. Best fried clam bellies around. Drinks are stiff, vibe is great, lobster galore. 
5823 4 Chipotle is great for accommodating food allergies, they will change gloves and bring fresh ingredients out to avoid cross contamination. My favorite thing to get is the carnitas bowl. 
5824 3 A cool place for any meal. Love the funky underground atmosphere and the food is always great. Alamo Benedict is a spicy fav and beautiful coffees. 
5825 0 My first attempt to go there - epic failure. They weren't open even though they were supposed to be. There's a Dozen Disappointed lost customers this morning. 
5826 4 Excellent dinner with friends last night. Warm, welcoming, relaxed atmosphere. Excrllent food. Owner and staff were so friendly, too. 
5827 4 I love an organic salad bar that has free ice cream at the end! 
5828 0 Most disgusting place I've been to. And staff doesn't know anything about the product they are clueless 
5829 3 As a Chicagoan, my standard for a good burger is quite high. This is a solid go to as far as price and product are concerned. Get extra house sauce to dunk those fries. 
5830 1 Today i saw them making my chicken kebab wrap without wearing gloves so am not gonna go there anymore ... 
5831 4 Kristie and her team are awesome. She is one of the only people I trust with my pets. She has a true passion for what she does and she loves animals. They are also very reasonably priced. 
5832 4 Friendly staff ! They always get my orders right. The manager is friendly. The wifi is good. They also have almond milk now, which is good ! 
5833 4 Went here for lunch and got the Hawthorne burger and an order of fries. This is one of the best burgers I have ever had. It was amazing. The fries were decent but the burger was definitely better. Next time I would skip the fries and get two different burgers. 
5834 0 No matter what we try the food is terrible. Miss Geo's Too bad Riverwalk took this spot two. Now there are 2 of these terrible restaurants! 
5835 4 Wow! The chimichurri is perfection. They put it over the chicken and fried yucca and I ate it all. The sangria is righteous as well. Next time I'm here I'll be back! 
5836 4 Went here last year for a candlelight dinner with the GF. This place is amazing. food was delicious and the atmosphere was super romantic. live piano player to set the mood right. will definitely be returning here again some day. Love it. 
5837 4 Everything is good. Be adventurous and be rewarded. The salt and pepper pig leg is amazing. 
5838 3 Horrible experience from last visit in January. Came back because of my friends. Huge improvement to the service & food. Must be new staff because I don't recognize any of them. I'll upload the food porn. It's a huge difference from my old ones. 
5839 4 This place has phenomenally good coffee. The baristas are down to earth and really know their menu. Hope they open a location in south Austin. 
5840 4 Hands down the best Philly cheese steaks in town! I literally have probably had a cheesesteak from anywhere you can think of.. This is by far the BEST!! Best quality in meat, portion, ingredients, bread, pricing, customer service, literally everything about this place is great! 
5841 3 I love starbucks and this is great location. The staff are so welcoming and nice. they have a lot of places to sit which is good because some times it can be hard to find a table. i higly recommend this starbucks. 
5842 4 This place always hits the spot. Great variety of soup, salad, baked goods, and pasta. Food is always excellent and healthy. They always email coupons so it's never too expensive. 
5843 4 Great place, but I must warn that this is very interesting. I usually like a hole in the wall breafast joint and this was very very different. Food was amazing, but very different. You must try for yourself to experience it. Waffles and carmel latte was amazing! 
5844 3 Great food, convenient location. Public parking located nearby, what else to ask for? 
5845 4 Nice place and fresh pizza, good dippings, I do order the whole pizza with my friends and only cost $12, it is good prices and good taste, thank you so much 
5846 3 Swung by Zen for a quick weekday lunch. For $15 I got soup, salad and 3 maki rolls. Food was fresh, service was prompt, will be back. 
5847 3 Perfect place to get some good snacks for those long late nights at Piedmont I always sneak out to go get me the Newport Turkey with Honey Mustard with Grapes and chips plus they have good good coffee.. 
5848 4 So good. I just got hip to Granny's and this is now my low key taco spot. Hipsters and tourists, please give them your business, but don't make me wait an hour for a burrito or I'll kill you all. 
5849 3 Great Breakfast, Pasta is like your mother made, nice people, good service.. 
5850 2 Donuts were very tasty, BUT bathrooms were NASTY toilet paper and trash everywhere There wasn't even soap or paper towels!! The tables were just as gross. And (homeless)druggies were coming in and out getting drinks whenever they felt like it!! So be cautious. Oh. And NO AC! Line was miserable 
5851 3 If you want daytime gyros in downtown Boston, this is probably your best bet. Zo doesn't do anything unusual, just a traditional gyro made fast and with rock solid quality. 
5852 3 Went there for breakfast! Very busy but great food! Definitely will go back again! Had the number three and was very satisfied. 
5853 3 Really liked this place. The food was tasty, the service was great, and the place was inviting. The tea-smoked spare ribs were a winner as was the celery and edamame slaw. Would definitely go back. 
5854 4 i have to visit every time i come to ATL!! love love love 
5855 4 Excellent Restore!! I hesitate to post a great review only because I want so many of their pieces for myself;) Clean and air-conditioned, with a HUGE variety of quality used furniture for extremely fair prices. The store is well organized and obviously well managed. Two thumbs up!! 
5856 3 Left a bad reservation then started walking down Washington st rain suddenly came down so we dove into this place and left with a smile and a promise to return bar a+ waitress a+ easy menu to navigate and delicious definitely recommend 
5857 3 Service was phenomenal and knowledgeable. The food and wine selection were top notch! The biggest selling point was the ambiance. The was cozy, warm and inviting. Perfect on a rainy evening. 
5858 0 The 500 block rooms..smell like mold...sheets are old some of the hallways smell like urine 
5859 3 This place was sooooooo yummy! They have specialty pizza's or you can make your own. The service was great. Very friendly staff. Place was kept clean and staff made sure of it. Self parking only. 
5860 3 I've had really good experiences at this place, with drycleaning and with alterations too. The people are really nice and try to help you out. They don't speak much English, but that usually works out fine. Prices are about normal for this area. 
5861 2 Decent regional chain (ok..only 3 locations but I expect they will expand). I've only been to, and probably would only frequent, the Newton location. Honestly, I think Legal has absolutely nothing on this place. I also like the bar which is chill and works pretty well for an after-work cocktail. 
5862 4 Went in March 2010, what a great day. The shows were really good. My 2 kids loved watching the "Believe" show in the Shamu stadium. A very fun filled enjoyable day!!! Well worth a visit.. 
5863 4 Great stylist made my baby look so much better! She knows how to groom shelties and was the cheapest in town! 
5864 4 We celebrated our daughter's 21st birthday last night and the staff, the food and the service was amazing! They made sure her special day was amazing. We can't thank you enough! The manager on duty (I'm terrible with names) was top notch. 
5865 0 Everything in this place is overpriced! They will charge you to print a label-even if you have a QR on your iPhone- or close a box with a piece of tape! I couldn't believe it. Never again/ 
5866 0 We want to see Ivanka Trump's line. Why deprive customers of what they love. 
5867 4 The Express Service @ Howdy Honda is the best!!! What a great experience! Thank you Joey and Jessica!! 
5868 4 They have amazing customer service. My friend had forgotten to ask for no bacon and the manager (I didn't grab his name but he is blonde) made him a new one and even offered to make it a double stack. Those little things really go a long way. 
5869 2 these cupcakes are OK. it's good for a sweet fix. the service is excellent...everyone is really friendly. good for a gift. 
5870 3 Have ordered this late night dozens of times. Always consistently OK. However, when you need a late night craving fix..this is the place 
5871 4 This is one of my favorite Italian places around. The best lasagna anywhere. Great ambiance too 
5872 4 It's great!! Solid prices and fresh ingredients! Can't go wrong mixing and matching different sauces and toppings and coming up with something new every time visiting. Friendly staff and great location, couldn't recommend it enough! 
5873 4 The best Mexican food, for real. The beef tacos are amazing and you cannot beat the price; a quick lunch if you need to get back to work. Love this place! 
5874 2 The women at the speaker on may 22 around 323pm Sunday was very rude and snappy. Her customer service skills are horrible and she didn't want to be at work. If I felt these negative vibes so have other folks! I'll never come to this s&s again. #ever #getto #alllivesmatter 
5875 4 This place is fantastic. I eat breakfast here all the time. Everything is fresh and tasty! And it's cheap and fast. If you like small diners with great food, check this place out. 
5876 2 Great place for drinks after work. Can get crowded. Ok for a not too expensive sit down lunch. Food is nothing special. I wish they had more beer specials that werent simply Miller High Life or the beer tower of domestic swill. 
5877 2 Great sub shop. Clean, friendly staff, and quite filling. 
5878 1 The octopus and corn came with barely any octopus, the waitress was nice but the service was slow, the white rice was surprisingly below par (didn't know you could do that wrong), and the fried rice tastes like crotch. Very cramped, will not be returning. 
5879 1 Completely unremarkable experience.. The menu was extensive, but it was very difficult finding anything interesting to eat. I tried a tuna salad sandwich, and it was boring. Our waitress was annoying and kept trying to upsell additional appetizers, which is absurd given the portion size..Definitely won't go back. 
5880 4 Great hot dog and fries. I was out for a quick snack and ended up at T-N-T Grillin! I will definitely be back to try the cheeseburger. Good job Tony!!!! 
5881 3 If you're craving Pho soup, this is your place. I've got them on speed dial and come at least twice a month. Love their friendly attitude. Chai (one of the owners) is the sweetest man, too! Make sure you get their bubble tea: Taro is delish! 
5882 4 Always a good time. Great place to hear fantastic music and throw back a few cold ones. 
5883 4 Cecila at Clogmaster saved my back and legs , during my 3 pregnancy's Cant live without them. All my kids have clogs to. They love them. And they get to choose their colors 
5884 3 I stayed here for two nights while in Columbus for work. Pros: -clean room -free wifi with Hyatt Gold -convenient valet for $23/night or parking garage across street for $12/night -noon checkout Cons: -new gym running equipment -gym towels not clean -small pool 
5885 4 A favorite since my childhood - the pizza bagels are phenomenal!!! I also love the everything bagel with chive cream cheese. Support local business. They are open til noon to the weekend. Love love love! 
5886 3 We've been several times at this small but very friendly German restaurant. Food, specially their unique and own creation - the dill soup - is extremely good. You will be served by Otto & Anita's daughter, as Otto & Anita never leave the kitchen were they do their magic. 
5887 4 Always pleased with the quality of the food. We enjoy the menu because there is always something for everyone -- whether vegetarian, mean eater, gluten-free. The ambiance is lively and friendly. Very good service. 
5888 3 The long wait of twenty minutes was definitely worth it. This is the best ramen place I have ever been to. 
5889 4 This is a great place to take a buddy or the family. Good beer and much better food than the restaurant nearby. Huge space also so it never feels crowded 
5890 4 Paul Bunyan salad with grass fed steak & homemade avocado ranch ... Outstanding! Great outdoor space. 
5891 4 A really great place to eat in the area. A hidden gem among the sea of chain restaurants in the area. Great food, well portioned, and great service. 
5892 4 Simple & delicious ramen. I love that you can customize everything. The spicy miso ramen with thin noodles is my favourite! 
5893 3 Love their burgers! Also they have amazing desserts and their ice tea is delicious. My favoritespot when I need a gourmet burger. Expect to pay up but it is worth it 
5894 3 Excellent food, spotty service. Nice decor, cool commercial complex. 
5895 3 Excellent Happy Hour. Friendly service, great prices and good food & drink selection. Parking can be a pain, but if you go for happy hour and park at the bank next to UBC, after hours then it's usually no problem. 
5896 3 Music live and cocktails this rocks the food for a small place will pleasantly surprise you I also like that the owner has a hands on attitude 
5897 0 One of the employees inside claimed that I gave him a fake 1 dollar bill , who even makes fake 1 dollar bills ?? 
5898 4 This has become one of my favorite places to eat in Lake Mary. Great food and great service! 
5899 4 This place is awesome. In addition to being in a really cool warehouse space, the staff is super friendly. And, most importantly, the beers are great (and very budget-friendly for craft beer). 
5900 4 Best sushi. Owner is the sweetest. I come here once a week. So good to us. # 1 sushi spot in town. 
5901 3 Had delivery and food was very fresh and wonderfully tasting. Tempura cheesecake was priced lower than other places but could taste granules of sugar! Entree was vegetable tempura and fried brown rice. That was good though, very. 
5902 3 The service is always top notch here; Lindsey was our server and she was great. Definitely start with the Antipasto platter, the carrots are amazing! Dinners are good, portions are plentiful. 
5903 4 Very happy with the service received here. Chris and the rest of the team in the shop helped me get a tricky Chrysler alignment issue resolved. Very happy with the courtesy and professionalism shown by all. 
5904 3 Descent breakfast tacos. Had the bacon and egg, and spinach and egg. Large portions. Great corn tortillas. Self-serve salsas weren't labeled. One I grabbed was too hot, and one was too mild. 
5905 4 Officially Closed. There goes another great locally owned food business in PDX. Many great years of food here. Will definitely miss the Mandarin Chicken Wings. 
5906 3 Fellini's has excellent pizza! We got a couple of pies to go and they were great. The salad was average. Not too much special there, but the pizzas were super. You can count on Fellini's for high quality pie. 
5907 4 Seriously great NW cuisine. I have come here twice and haven't been dissapointed. Make a reservation, make a date. Get dolled up and order as much as you can afford, which isn't much but try your best. Glad this place is sticking around. 
5908 1 Service good. Nice atmosphere. Portions big. Fresh vegetables, but overall food is meh. Almost no flavor. Would not return. Need to add flavor into the food. 
5909 0 Southwest needs to hire more people that have charisma and love customer service. Delays are expected especially during holidays. But there isn't an excuse for horrible service from desk agents and ticket takers. (SWA orlando intl airport)! 
5910 2 Thom Ka soup was way too rally and the salad rolls were all lettuce falling apart. I would not go here again 
5911 4 Fantastic. Authentic. Delicious. This place is great. Saba bento was excellent. Friendly service and relaxed atmosphere. Looking forward to my next lunch here. 
5912 0 horrifying sushi. how can this kind of place be in business? the sushi rolls looked like a 4 year made them. rice was undercooked.. don't go. 
5913 4 Late night snack with miso chowder, miso soup and sushi to share. Absolutely heaven and the presentation was fabulous. 
5914 3 Great authentic food and great value. Been coming here for many years and quality of food and service remains excellent! 
5915 4 Love Pure Barre Kits! They offer such great one on one attention from the instructors. Clean, modern and welcoming space! Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a great toning class. 
5916 3 This is a great place to go for happy hour, a drink or snack. It is usually not too crowded. The service is good. The food and drinks are above average. Their guacamole is delicious and they offer a few great versions of spicy cocktails. 
5917 4 Delicious grilled chicken with onions, rice and beans. Friendly service and accommodating to kids with brining an extra plate to share a side order of rice and beans 
5918 4 Absolutely love pekoe! Unique menu, and super delicious. Wide selection of teas, both hot and cold. Fun atmosphere, nice people, and a good, local selection of food. I recommend the boba & smoothie bowls. My absolute favorite it their pumpkin chai in the fall- to die for!! 
5919 4 Ordered Wings for Super Bowl 2017. Pats won! And the wings were delicious and on time. Best day ever! 
5920 4 The magarita pizza is the best I have ever had, I'm not kidding.. Ambience is perfect and the service was wonderful. Will definitely be going back soon! 
5921 4 Stopped by for a quick family dinner and they seemed very on top of things. Some guy in the back seemed very invested in getting orders out quickly. Our food came out quickly, was accurate and tasted good. Overall a very good experience. 
5922 4 Food was hot, fresh, and delicious. Great soul food. Staff showed great hospitality. Its a small place but it fits better that way and has a good feel to it. This restaurant is a true gem of the south. 
5923 0 Order through UberEATS. They sent the wrong order and called to say they were redelivering it. 2 1/2 hours later I was still waiting. Despite the manager insisting they were coming, they have not. 
5924 2 - Our server was very warm and attentive. - Appy hour only avaliable if seated in the bar area, not sure how this is justified. - Main courses very plain in terms of ingredients and flavor. Ended up needing a lot of salt and pepper. 
5925 3 Just what I needed before my flight!! This is the place to stop in before your flight excellent wine selection! 
5926 4 It's awkward when the best coffee & barista's in Portland happen to be smack dab in Beaverton. Friendly, Awesome, & Consistently amazing. It is well worth the drive thru the tunnel for their take on how coffee should be made. 
5927 0 01/13/2018 came in at 6am the male cashier was extremely rude and rolled his eyes at my very simple order. I don't even want to drink my coffee now. You're supposed to come here to start your day, not cool. 
5928 4 The vibe, service, food, and beverages here are A1! The employees looked neat and clean and the hospitality was IMPECCABLE. My food was served fresh, in a timely manner and I literally have NO complaints. 
5929 2 Decent BBQ, Decent iced tea. Decent service. All around the good neighborhood BBQ place. The green beans are a must have. The ribs are always a good go to. If you're in the neighborhood and in the mood for BBQ. Pay them a visit. You won't regret it. 
5930 4 If you miss Izakayas from Japan- this the place! Beyond just the sushi bar, but a lot of great Japanese tapas and Tokyo Ramen. Amazing Happy Hour means everyone eats! 
5931 4 We were going through Portland and picked this place to eat. Food was delicious and Great Happy Hour! We the corn, chorizo burger and chicken tacos, all great. We also ordered an IPA and it was all perfect. Definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in Portland. 
5932 0 The food is atrocious for the price!! What a pity that both dosa factorries in newbury street and cambridge sucks!!! Rude staff.. and they wont even follow up on online orders!!! outrageous to say the least!! 
5933 4 The baristas are friendly and knowledgable. Couldn't ask for a better place to spend the morning. 
5934 2 Great Food... A little expensive... Try The PFX, it is a great drink. All the food we ordered was of high quality and tasted great! Just gasphed a little bit when we got the bill! 
5935 1 They were out of rotisserie chicken when I tried the place, so maybe this review is a little unfair, but I tried the chicken kabobs and was unimpressed. The sides were really lackluster. It wasn't bad, but even late at night, there are better options. 
5936 4 Really great comfort food near the theatre district. Kobe sliders and prosciutto Mac and cheese are to die for. Decent beers on tap. A bit of a bar feel but acceptable for a family. Be sure to call for reservations. 
5937 3 I've been for lunch twice now and can sum it up in three simple words: fast, cheap, good. The end. 
5938 4 The food is very fresh and the Avgolemono soup is my all time favorite lunch. It's super small in here, no tables just outside in the summertime. Long lines but it moves fast. 
5939 3 Love Thai Son! The food is always hot and fresh. The staff are always friendly. This is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants. If you're in the area I highly recommend that you stop in for a steaming hot bowl of Pho. 
5940 4 This is probably the best food I have had in austin. If you like Mediterranean food this would be a great place to try at a low cost. 
5941 4 I've been eating here for over 2 years. The food and service are always good. I highly recommend!! If you go during lunch.. go early it gets busy. 
5942 4 5 stars isn't enough! Shaun is quick, professional, reasonably priced and easy to communicate with. I wish every item on my to do list was as easy to cross off as he made "get broken window fixed"! 
5943 3 Great food Cheap pricing Large portions We've been happy with everything we have tried here, my favourites include the guacamole and anything made with the pastor (marinated pork) 
5944 4 Best theater ever. Great seats great service. You gonna spend some money but it's worth it if your a movie buff. Got to go 
5945 4 AWESOME service and nail work, the atmosphere was great as well. I honestly couldn't say one negative thing about this place. Definitely check it out! 
5946 4 Very professional and friendly business. I did an FFL transfer and they notified me quickly when it arrived. I will definitely be going to them for my future purchases. 
5947 3 Let the good times roll! I don't really care for the drags but the atomsphere is good.... Sunday night is the best night to go! It's extra tight!!! 
5948 2 I didn't have a very good experience here. The service was fine, entrees were good, but the see food, especially the bigger cherry storms, very fishy. I came here because of a friend's recommendation, extremely disappointed. 
5949 4 I dropped by their new location, and absolutely loved the showroom. They have a great selection of scooters to ride around this area. The owners are very friendly and knowledgable. 
5950 4 Excellent bobas. Best I've ever had! Get the milk tea with boba and pudding. They soak the boba in honey so it's sweet and has a very good texture. (Not as dense as other boba I've had) The staff was friendly and helpful on what we should try. 
5951 3 Went back this Memorial Day weekend and it was just as good as ever. Excellent customer service and I just love those King Crab Legs. Their new version is a Caesar salad is amazing!! 
5952 4 Dave showed up exactly on time and cleaned our blocked drain in about 15 mins. He helped us out on extremely short notice. Super nice person and very reasonable price considering the rush and excellent service. He even cleaned the gross sink sludge afterwards! 
5953 3 This is place is easily one of my favorite spots. Its quality without pretension. The guy who holds down the fort is always courteous and friendly and just- it's refreshing. I only wish I still lived in the neighborhood so I could go more often! 
5954 3 Cool concept. Food is really good too. I love buying the pita pocket and just stuffing it to the max. Not a vegetarian at all but if you are I think this spot is for you. 
5955 3 I've been going here for a very long time. The food is always delicious. I get the Migas scramble with chorizo every time. Awesome brunch and vegetarian, vegan, gluten free options as well. 
5956 4 Cute little French restaurant. Bought a crepe and was blown away at the size! If you don't have a big appetite be prepared to split one. :) 
5957 3 Ordered an omelette with grits and biscuits. The omelette was standard and the biscuits were outstanding. However, I wasn't a fan of the grits (not because they're bad, they're just not for me). Next time I'm in Atlanta, I'll be sure to visit again for a huge basket of biscuits! 
5958 4 So friendly and food is so fresh and good ! My boyfriend and I came to Florida on vacation and we were looking for Mexican food and I came across this place on yelp. Definitely recommend. 
5959 4 Just had a wonderful dinner. I had the Cajun Steelhead and my husband had the Razor Clams. Both were delicious. The service was excellent. Highly recommend this establishment. 
5960 3 Came in for a quick snack and was not disappointed! I ordered the X-Everything burger to share with someone and two Brazilian sodas. Everything was very tasty and I plan on going back to try their coffee and pastries! 
5961 4 OMG! So darn good! The people were very friendly and helpful. I even got samples of the candied jalapeño (oh my a sweet bite to it) and the cranberry habenero jelly (not to hot, but flavorful). We tried 4 different sandwiches and all were wonderfu!l 
5962 0 I have been to multiple red robins and this one by far had the worse Service. all the waiters/ waitresses just hovered by the bar and talked while ignoring the customers. And to top it of my food was cold!!!!!!! Stop talkin and do your job!! 
5963 4 So many great taco joints in Austin & Yummi just made my list. The spicy pork was awesome and the lemongrass chicken was excellent. Can't wait to take every friend who visits from out of town! 
5964 4 This is the heart and soul of Stoughton. Not just good classic breakfast but I had the best stuffed pepper ever here. Great conversations at the counter. This is how life should be. 
5965 4 Went here once and was impressed by Nelda. She is awesome. I got a really stylish cut and I did not wait at all. I will be recommending this salon to all my friends. It is conveniently located next to Walmart and other stores that I like. 
5966 4 Sausage and cedar sand witch was great. Fast drive through and everything was nice and hot. This was my first time at this location but I'll be back many more times. 
5967 4 I'm a huge fan. Dinesty Dumpling House is pretty comparable to the famed Din Tai Fung in my opinion. The xiao long bao's soup is a little more flavorful here and the menu offers much more variety, all of which are good. 
5968 3 Loved this hotel. The bed and pillows were a dream. Lots of amenities. They have a Starbucks on site, nice convenience store inside. The food for the conference was ok, couldn't tell if it was being made by hotel restaurant but it was just ok. Nice variety of stuff though. 
5969 3 Very nice ambiance in th dining area and also in the big bar area. Definitely a place to bring clients or your spouse. I am a fan of their flat bread entrees and they also make a decent pot of coffee. 
5970 1 Walked in and all the employees seem like they're tired. Not greeted by anyone when going into any department. They're all focusing on tasks and not helping people who look confused. 
5971 4 Flawless experience with Car2Go. Drove car in, we were directed to the designated parking area for Car2go, and were immediately picked up by the shuttle (at our vehicle) at no charge. 
5972 3 I have been getting my nails done here for over a year now. They are very nice and very good product for the price. I would recommend. 
5973 4 Excellent service, accommodating and friendly staff, and the views are amazing. The room itself was clean and comfortable, and the shower was fantastic. The hotel is conveniently located next to many wonderful restaurants and bars, and is easily accessible. I would definitely stay here again. 
5974 0 I would give this store zero stars if it were possible. The worst customer service I have experienced. My girlfriend and I were treated as if we were dirt on the bottom of the staff's shoes. These sales assistants need to be taught some basic manners. 
5975 1 Fast food. It is good. Don't het me wrong. And very unique. But, as fast as it comes out, it isn't fresh. It is just sand-bagged. They also treat their employees like fast food workers, as well. I am in the industry and can see it. 
5976 4 This place is brand spanking new and just opened a few months ago. Good addition to the mid Main street strip. Lots of cute pastries. Nothing that is diet compatible with me, however, picked up 12 pieces for a party. Customer service was awesome and friendly. 
5977 4 Eric is the friendliest and most competent person I know. Everything is transparent and they always follow through. I've sent at least 4 friends and he's always taken care of everyone. One time I showed up late in a rush and he got my screen repaired in 5 mins. 
5978 4 Came here for the lunch Buffett. The food is always good here and it was not too packed for lunch time. Great selection and the food was nice and hot. The cream puff is my favorite part but overall I love this place. 
5979 1 The burgers were disappointing! I personally don't think the burger were worth the money. The place seems like a great concept, but definitely fell short of all the hype that I have read about. 
5980 4 Drinks was excellent. Friendly staff. Generous drinks. Lots if TVS and games. Ice cold glasses served. 
5981 0 Expensive! For a restaurant that has view of gas station... Not much flavor and not your typical turkish place. 
5982 0 Service, pricing and food terrible! Double ordered a side, paid double for food (spring rolls) but couldn't get second sauce or fortune cookie. Contacted corporate - also useless. Go someplace else or go hungry would be better choices. 
5983 4 J & M Diner is hands down the best diner I have ever eaten at. The food is delicious, I highly suggest the buffalo chicken omelet. All of the employees are very friendly and helpful. Definitely worth a stop in if you are in the area! 
5984 4 The Best! Ever. Or anywhere. Been eating there since 1985 or so.... Wonderful Tex-mex. Eat there and send your mouth to Nirvana. 
5985 2 Very big portions. You'll get a HUGE bowl of ramen so I'd suggest sharing with a friend. I didn't like the broth very much though I only tried on of their four types of broth. The miso broth I had was flavourless. 
5986 4 I love this place. Great TVs and music and ambiance. We end up sitting there for hours and even got to listen to live music later in the evening. Might be my new favorite bar (next to Ollies). Fun for families and a night out ;) 
5987 4 Some of the best whiskey I've had. Loved the barrel aged. Kinda glad I don't live near here. It would be dangerous :). Friendly knowledgeable staff. The cocktail sampler was really nice. 
5988 2 Good location, but just ok food. For Midtowm, I have high hopes, but not my favorite. Nice, but..... 
5989 3 Great hospital with doctors and nurses that are caring and compassionate. My only issue is with cost of parking for family members who spend hours and hours there, can add up pretty quickly. But wouldn't trust anyone else with healthcare 
5990 3 I have been eating here off and on for years. The staff has always been friendly and the food is what you would typically find in a Boston sub shop. The pizza is a great deal and the steak and cheese sub is also very good. 
5991 4 Great spot! The decor is fantastic and elegant and the food is fantastic! My friend recommended this spot and what a great place 
5992 4 Awesome neighborhood bar. Quiet, cozy and great food menu. Friendly and attentive wait staff. 
5993 4 So happy to have this place in our neighborhood! Everyone is talking about the delicious tacos & corn tortillas! 
5994 3 I like Helser's. I like the Louisiana hot link. And the Scotch eggs, and the Dutch baby's! Mimosa's are bonus! 
5995 1 Over rated. The original flavors were ok. Super sweet and overly doughy. Even the "regular" flavors were just ok. Won't waste the time or the effort to search these out. 
5996 4 Have eaten here twice and love the food, the service and the modern ambiance. The pork and Monkfish were wonderful. 
5997 4 service was great. great hookah taste. i travel alot and none of the places ive been into had a better taste! 
5998 0 Terrible. Sit for an hour, then when your shuttle does come ride around for 2 hours to get to hotel ten minutes away. Straight junk, avoid. 
5999 3 Yummy breakfast sandwich. I took them up on the offer of free tea or soda if mentioning Yelp and asked if I could have coffee instead. They were kind enough to do so. 
6000 0 Worst service I've ever received. Bartender was outside for 20 minutes smoking and then when returned said it was time to close. If you had customers, wouldn't you serve them and at least have the curtesy to say something? 
6001 2 Awkwardly small and can get crowded. Food was good, but didn't blow us away. Don't have much bad to say, but there's better Italian places out there. The service, for whole small it was, wasn't great. 
6002 4 Yum Yum guys.....you are the best! Keep making those awesome cupcakes and see you at the next food truck event! You have to try these...... 
6003 4 My favorite brazilian BBQ spot, consistently good, great selection and awesome salad bar. Great for small groups or for larger parties. The cheese bread is amazing but the meat is definitely the star here. Highly recommend this over other Brazilian BBQ spots. 
6004 3 had sum soop wit some lamms innit n' it wuz gewd. 
6005 4 Wow, nothing on the menu is bad. Ceviche tapas and Arros Cacadora paella are my favorites, but everything was awesome! 
6006 3 Great place for watching a game, especially with the shortage of good sports bars in Portland. One complaint would be that they play the audio for the commercials, which is crazy obnoxious. Please fix this! Thanks for an otherwise good football night 
6007 3 Solid spot. The T&T burrito was delicious, but be prepared for a lot of cheese. Good chips and salsa too 
6008 3 Atmospheres florals did a great job with our wedding. It was above and beyond what I imagined really. They remembered every detail that I even forgot on the day of. Loved it!!! 
6009 4 Amazing! We've been wanting to go here for years. I ordered the Orange Chicken, it was the best Orange Chicken I've ever had! 
6010 4 I don't know what to say. To me, I feel so positive in TartBerry. I think it's such a positive place to be. My mother recommended this place to me, and I love it since. Thanks, TartBerry :) 
6011 4 The salads are amazing but you must have the pork chop...one of the best ever! Our first visit and we will definitely be back. Ask for Harrison at the bar as he makes a great citrus mojito and the local beers are defined with trying. 
6012 4 I went here for lunch for the first time a few days ago and had the two item combo lunch plate (yakitori and Hirekatsu). Deeeeelish!!! Sad to learn that this location is closing in two weeks. :( 
6013 2 A very good so-so restaurant. Not the worst Ramen I've ever had but definitely don't want to spend time eating it again. I don't want to be negative about this so I'd say this restaurant is just so so. Still better than I can cook it though. 
6014 4 The food is really really good. The customer service here is great. They can handle large crowds which is good. I think they provided the best customer service I've ever experienced. They are a little pricey but it is worth it. Did I mention that the food is really good! 
6015 0 this place was not good at all. i had a tamal that was so dry i could not eat it. i ordered chips and salsa and i am pretty sure it was Pace salsa from the jar. very disappointed i had high hopes. 
6016 4 This may sound silly but I love LOVEPOP! Great customer service via email, super sweet staff at their kiosks and have you watched their live Facebook videos? Hilarious! Thanks for always putting a smile on my face, Lovepop 
6017 4 I am not from Oregon but I saw this place online and decided to try it. They are really nice and the shed is super cute! We sat outside and it was lovely. Oh and they have the best Mac n cheese that I have ever tasted! 
6018 1 Eh? This bar always smells funny to me. It gets packed during most evenings-- lots of locals and college kids and tourists. One of the few places where you can get a 16 oz beer for $1.50! 
6019 4 great place to walk around and relax and also take great pics and awesome place to take ur kiddos and explore 
6020 4 There were surprisingly more things to do here than I expected. The big hat was a great meeting place for the family when we got separated. They had some pretty awesome character meetings, too. Fun all around! 
6021 4 Yo this fried chicken so dank. It gives immense life - can't go a single day without its precious juices and crunchy hot skin. It's a necessity, and I thirst for it every second. Until next time. 
6022 4 Great yoga studio!! Friendly environment and I love both the hatha and Bikram classes! I think it is beginner friendly because different options are always given for the poses! All of the instructors are approachable and helpful! 
6023 4 My massage was amazing! I work 7 days a week and could feel a lot of tension building in my neck. After my massage I felt much more relaxed 
6024 1 This place reminds me of somewhere my grandparents would enjoy, although on game nights it can get pretty crowded in the bar area. The food is mediocre, the menu is plentiful, but it lacks flavor and originality. It's your typical quincy bar/restaurant. Nothing special about it. 
6025 4 Love this place , Always find a book , dvd , video game or CD ....For a good price ...Fun to look and find something unexpected .... 5 MEOOOOWS ! 
6026 4 Best Japanese restaurant I have ever visited in the greater Vancouver area! Very authentic food. Highly recommend. You should try everything, literally. 
6027 3 Food was awesome and affordable. I have never been to a place that has such nice staff everyone we met just went above and beyond. Family friendly atmosphere. Would go to again! 
6028 4 Hard to find good interior Mexican food around here. I had the pescado yucatano. So delicious. Everyone else enjoyed their tex mex. Reasonable prices, too! 
6029 1 The atmosphere was good but the service was terrible. IF the service matched the good food, wine and atmosphere, there could be some potential. Roll the dice.... 
6030 4 Pb banana pancakes were AMAZING. Wide breakfast selection and many seasonal options as well. 
6031 3 Seaworld is fantastic! Definitely a place to go if you want to get wet. It has the perfect combination between shows and rides, which provides a day full of fun. The food is really good, and the park is great for all ages. 
6032 0 I have to give them a star? Worst service I've ever had. The evening manager was rude and ghetto. I work near here and vowed never to go back. I go to the Groveport location down the road and have no problems. 
6033 4 Excellent view, excellent decorations, very large restaurant, very great for large groups. The food was delicious and a good pricing. Drinks are wonderful. Can't wait to come back. I had of the raspberry lime handcrafted soda, and the chicken, Bree and fig sandwich. 
6034 4 Simple, straightforward, delicious. All the things I want in a ramen shop. Centrally located. Great service. Turnaround times are fast. All ramens are great. The seaweed one is the best. Love this Marutama Ramen :) 
6035 1 Ordered lunch for four people. Not very impressed with the chicken quality very dry sweet-and-sour chicken and almond chicken. Very grisly king pao chicken. 
6036 0 HOW does a cockroach fall onto my plate??????? Your food is too good to be a victim of a health violation. 
6037 3 Good falafel and shawarma's. Definitely among the top in Boston. Take-out is tempting, but the shawarma usually gets soggy and makes a mess on your (at least) my clothes. 
6038 3 Great food and service. Beef Milanese and Duck Breast were outstanding. Baked Brie appetizer needed to bake a bit longer. Reasonably priced for what you get 
6039 3 Great pizza, especially at 1am after a few shots and beers!! Neat environment inside, although campus isn't my favorite spot, if I'm in the area and craving pizza I'll def stop in!!! 
6040 0 Stay away from these crooks. Spend the extra $10 and get your iPad fixed at a legitimate place. 
6041 3 It is a nice environment and good food but it is very crowded and needs a long waiting time. But over all good place if you can find a seat 
6042 3 We went just for the $2.85 breakfast special. Pros... Great price for breakfast Coffee was good Cute coffee mugs Service was good Cons... Bacon tasted funny Ambiance was very plain Would we go back? Yes 
6043 3 Vasso was wonderful. She spent a long time on my facial (much longer than a regular spa) and thoroughly cleaned my skin and offered suggestions (and samples!) of products. I would definitely recommend her to others for facial services. 
6044 3 Grandma and I shared the green chicken curry and pad Thai for lunch. Both dishes had great flavour. Hard to find a decent pad Thai, but was impressed with it here. Busy place for lunch, all tables were full. 
6045 0 I went to the pizza patron 3 today on Ross av for lunch, an when I picked up the slices was just limp it wasn't tasty it was a mess ,I was on lunch I didn't have time to take it back I was so disappointed Ms.Lewis in Dallas 
6046 4 Excellent experience for a first timer to Salem. Clam chowder was perfect and the seafood bake is very flavorful. Bartender was very friendly and gave good recommendations. Don't let the lower review (when posted) turn you away. I didn't even look before coming in! 
6047 3 Aside from language barriers, this place was amazing. They had one waitress that spoke English well, and she had to help our existing waitress... GREAT food. 
6048 4 My first time today. The class was awesome. The instructor is also very professional and thoughtful. I also bought some cute Pilates socks, so comfortable. I will go back and keep working out here. 
6049 2 Got a pretty good haircut here. The atmosphere of the barbershop is pretty cool, in a great location, with a very cute dog hanging out. They need a bit more seating for people waiting to get a haircut. I would go back. 
6050 0 Bumper magnets showed up extremely grainy and difficult to read. We reached out to customer service and they responded asking for photos of the dissatisfactory product. It's been over a week and we still haven't heard back. Would love to hear back from this company and get this fixed. 
6051 4 I loved it here, the food was fantastic. And it was very romantic. Would recommend this for a date or an anniversary. 
6052 3 Nice atmosphere, decent service and very good food. A little pricey but not unexpected. A great place to bring someone special. 
6053 0 Pizza is always cold and delivery takes to long. People could be a bit more friendly but Im never eating that trash again so it does not matter to me. 
6054 0 Thick fatty slices of overcooked roast beef....and overpriced. What happened to the legendary Kelly's? Go to Harrisons. 
6055 4 Have been going to Mr. Chan's for years. Always good, fresh and fast. Easy online ordering at http://www.mrchans.net 
6056 4 Come here to work on your bike for super cheap, to buy a used bike, or to meet cool bikey people and do bikey things with them. Mechanics will guide you through the process of fixing your steed if you don't have much experience. LOVE. 
6057 0 Great Service! But where's the fish?! Our rolls lacked fish. At least they didn't skip on the avocado, but I didn't come for California Rolls, won't be back. 
6058 3 Visiting here exceeded expectations. Good food, good service, nice size restaurant along with an all star band. The band can really play and had two good singers on stage with them. played lots of motown and blues classics. glad we visited this blues club. 
6059 4 This place has plenty of good reviews about the food so I'll just repeat what's been said; that the beef noodle soup and rolls are amazing. More impressive is the service which is attentive and prompt! 
6060 4 Love this place: delish. Go with friends so you can split lots of dishes. Chicken and waffles are Aaaaammmmazzing! 
6061 4 So awesome here. The staff is amazing and the best part!!!! FREE BREAKFAST!!! Come on! Hyatt house Portland Downtown your winning for sure! Good job guys. Room are clean and spacious. Its literally right by the trimet stop so tahts a big plus! 
6062 4 Best deal on beans in town! The Breakfast Blend is sweet like French toast but with a bold flavor that can wake the dead for that much needed Monday morning jolt. Nothing compares to you, Affogato (AKA Iforgotto) 
6063 4 Hands down, the best group acupuncture clinic in the Boston area. Serene, healing space. Dalit & Mira are wonderful! 
6064 1 Interesting food. Tastes quite enjoyable. Good service. But I have never been served a scallop that was sliced into two. This was a hot spot, but a Thursday night and empty. I can see why. 
6065 3 Finally, a real museum in Salem (i.e., one with no wax figurines)! Had a great time wandering around the galleries. There is a lot here, especially for the nautically-minded. Great specialty exhibits as well. The Chinese house is incredible. 
6066 3 i love grilled veggies with torta and green chilly sauce.veggies r fully grilled n everythng fresh. 
6067 1 Not impressed. The food was a bit cold and underwhelming for the steep price. And is not kid friendly. 
6068 4 Had the salmon gyro and it was delicious. Very fair prices for what you get (a generous serving). 
6069 4 I've been there for a facial and let me tell you : i had the best experience ever! Great people, the owner is so nice and friendly ! I'll definetely go back again !!! 
6070 3 Tried Flip Burger with a few co-workers for lunch. I had the Falafel, with a lettuce wrap - AMAZING. Service was great too - would definitely return. 
6071 3 That's right: "Yay! I'm a fan". Cheap, good breakfast, good atmosphere, surly service... just what a diner should be. Ahhhh. Yeah, I just sighed a breath of relief, becuase I FINALLY found you, Breakfast Club. I will never let you go. 
6072 4 I would definitely recommend Rocky to most of my friends ... fast and officiant and got me back more then I expected!!! 
6073 4 Very friendly, reliable, and professional. Its the middle of the heat wave and they came and worked on our unit the day after I called. Unfortunetly the unit isbetter off being replaced than fixed. But he was knowlegable and honest. I highly recommend this company. 
6074 4 I heard they were the best in the neighbourhood by my daughter who lives nearby so we went to check them out today. I'll up the rumor by stating they were the best fish n chips in town! 
6075 3 I am back. For a while the Plesant was off their game. They must have realized they were in a game closer to make it back get back to the play offs. Goo job. Pizza was really good.hi 
6076 3 Love the food and atmosphere. Parking and the wait can be a nightmare. Little pricey overall - but with a line out the door, the cost of the meal is not keeping anyone away. 
6077 3 I am a fan, but I never order the pizza. People in my group always do and it's very good, but for me the wedge salad and fish tacos ROCK! Always fresh and tasty, they keep me coming back and the price it right! 
6078 4 Came into Earl's for drinks. Great service, fun/creative drinks all in a very nice setting. Would certainly return to this location. 
6079 4 I've been living here for 3 months and my experience has been nothing but positive. The new management is awesome. I love my updated apartment. Can't beat the location. Also, my husband and I won a $500 visa card from a raffle the apartment held. Nothing to complain about.... 
6080 4 Awesome! The staff are super friendly and knowledgable. The tastings are happening all the time! Check our Facebook and Twitter to find out about tastings. So cool to meet the people who actually brew the beer at a tasting and talk to them about the process, I learned a lot! 
6081 1 I didn't get what I wanted and was overcharged. I asked for Kim kardashian hair and came out looking like a poodle. Now my hair is just damaged and too curly, I end up straightening it before I go out anyway. 
6082 4 Today was my first time visiting Kim's Nails, but certainly won't be my last. I went in with a specific nail art idea in mind and she pulled it off beautifully. Thank you, Kim and staff! 
6083 1 Ive only been here 2 x. and I dont find myself coming back for a 3rd time. Its crowded and loud..and the service was very blah. If the food was good, I'd have something to rave about.. but alas. Nothing but cheap margiritas that would get your ass quickly drunk. 
6084 2 Trendy place for hipsters. Service for food was delayed. It's not friendly for little kids. Cups didn't have lids and straws were breaking apart fast for kids. My duck melt was good. My wife's eggs were delicious with nicely seasoned potatoes. 
6085 4 Probably the best Mexican food I've ever had. Recommend the taco salad!!! Very delicious! 
6086 4 I love this place! It's very affordable, great food selection for a fair price, beer and wine and a family atmosphere. I prefer to come here any day, any time then go to another movie theater. 
6087 4 Absolutely amazing! I have lived in Richmond my whole life and I just found this gem. High quality sushi, beautifully crafted and absolutely delicious!!! Definitely a recommend! 
6088 4 This is hands down the best lash spot in central Florida !! The girls are so so sweet and great at what they do! I get so many compliments on my lashes and asking if they are real !! Definitely recommend this place to all 
6089 4 So happy I found this place, best croissant in Atlanta gets it 5 stars alone. Great macarons too! 
6090 4 I love that this Kroger is right by my work. I can literally walk in during a break, grab the items I need, and I'm out within 5 minutes. I also love that they have a Kosher food selection. 
6091 2 They get an extra star for the management reaching out. That shows that they care about their clientele and that speaks volumes. 
6092 1 We ordered pizza to go and then decided we might want to sit. Dude at the counter said that was fine but then we were kicked out by some other guy who said we had to go! Service there isn't too good, to say the least. 
6093 1 The only thing this place has going for it is it's location and football Sunday. The owner and his buddies are constantly hovering around the bar, I generally ask for a table elsewhere to watch a game rather than be around/listen to them. Only food worth paying for is breakfast 
6094 3 Very friendly, took a while but they said it was unusual - several emergencies happened at once. Took the time to properly test everything and explain results. 
6095 2 I called the manager to report my experience and he was very receptive. He asked me to come in and corrected the issue for me. I appreciated his efforts. My order this time was right. While I'm pleased with management's response I'm still skeptical of the drive thru. 
6096 2 Stick with the deserts. Eggs were spongy and breakfast items were just ok. No major complaints and the place was clean. Not like I remember from Europe. A near miss. 
6097 4 Loved it! Nice little gem from the 80s. Experience it if you have the chance, it will close on December 6! 
6098 3 Kind of a dive but great service, fresh food made in front of you, and the steak tips are to die for. Burgers and BLT's are great, too! Basic menu that covers all the bases...Just don't expect anything too exciting in your tossed salad... 
6099 3 They are on Groupon so I had to try it. Sushi was better than I expected, but didn't like the dressing on the salad. 
6100 4 Great Potatoes. Everything we had was great, including the service. Its a nice bistro type restaurant in Portland's suburbs. I would definitely return! 
6101 4 THE BEST VANILLA LATTE in all of Portland. It's so good that I grew a mustache to display the froth. 
6102 4 She's great. She talks to you like she's been your friend for years... which is exactly what you need when someone's going to be exploring all around in there... you know what I'm talking about. 
6103 4 Dynamic spot!! The food was fantastic and I definitely got my fill. The drinks were awesome and our waitress was on point. Great choice for our late night after arriving in town. 
6104 4 Great place to go and get your haircut. Very friendly and relaxed. These guys are total pros. Trust me spend the extra 10 bucks to get a real haircut and you will not be disappointed. 
6105 4 Nice spot exactly as advertised with strong PDX ambience. Helpful staff! Coffee shop with actual juicing juice bar & food. Very vegan friendly but they also have dairy milk for espresso drinks. 
6106 4 The best food cart in Sellwood! I love it!! Get the buttermilk chicken!!! I appreciate fresh food with no preservatives! No frozen stuff. Awesome home made BBQ! 
6107 3 My husband and I shared a strawberry milkshake here. It was yummy. Love that it's made with coconut ice cream. 
6108 3 I really only get one thing here. The S1 Bahn Mi and It's fantastic. I've had the Pho as well and it's quite good. 
6109 4 I love this Pollo Tropical. Every time I have been there the food has been amazing and the staff has been very friendly. Good people. 
6110 2 It's convention-y, that's all. The banquet food is meh to drab. But the parking is free, it's connected to a mall, and their remodel is looking fab. 
6111 3 This place was fun. Menu read like a greatest hits. Sandwiches from all sorts of places. Enjoyed some chicken wings and a Mexican meatball sub. Seating was a pain though 
6112 2 Ordered from here last night it was last min and me and my gf didn't feel like leaving , so we placed a delivery order I must say it was very quick about 12 min to be exact , the food was average for Chinese, and will order again 
6113 3 I have not visited this place personally beacuse, it's always seem full to capacity, however I have tries their cupcakes and chocolate fudge cake and was delicious. the manager is a person thatI know and is a very nice guy ;courteous and polite. 
6114 4 Great (dog friendly) patio, nice bartenders. A really easy place to just go and enjoy a night with friends. 
6115 3 My favorite coffee in Atlanta. The staff could be a bit more cheery but for the most part all of the folks who work there are kind and knowledgable about their products. Love the Moreland locations rustic vibe 
6116 3 Great hotel, convenient location, clean. Only thing I would suggest is proving coffee pots in the room without the guest going down to pick one up. Breakfast was a little lean too. 
6117 4 Amazing experience and great fresh food. Samosa is one of the best Ive had in the lower mainland and you cant go wrong with either veggie or meat options. Coffee here is also really good. 
6118 0 Not a fan, sorry. The Mexican cafe with Tienda across the street and east a few blocks, is a much better nosh for the price, and always tables open, including a couple outside. 
6119 4 I've been coming to service my car at Westcoast for years. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and most importantly, honest. I've recommended many family and friends to Vimal and crew for years. 
6120 4 Rhonda was excellent! On time and super flexible to make sure everyone had a great time! 
6121 3 Great food and prices. We ordered the fajitas and pollo ala Mexicana. Both of our dishes we delicious. The woman who waited on us was very sweet and the food came quickly! We will definitely be back! 
6122 4 Biggest bang for your buck in Austin. Yes, it's a little ways out, but the views and open views are 100% worth it. I look forward to renewing my lease. 
6123 0 One of the girls on my softball team was turned away from the bathroom. Apparently the gallon of water, the squirt of soap and the square of TP was deemed too expensive in support of youth sports. I'll be taking my business elsewhere. 
6124 4 Normally I never write reviews but the buffalo chicken grilled cheese is so good I had to come and give 5 stars! Service is always good and everyone is really friendly plus a great selection of drinks. I definitely recommend checking this place out. 
6125 4 Great place to eat. It's cheaper than most restaurants on Newbury and the bubble tea is so good! Love the coconut flavored one and I always order the vermicelli or the Thai dishes. I have the luxury of coming in to eat during my lunch hours which is great. 
6126 4 First time customer. I'm from the Chicago area visiting my daughter. I was treated like a regular. Carmine processed my blueprint order quickly and correctly 
6127 3 Great place, delicious food, pleasant ambience...and the best part....great service. Definitely coming back. 
6128 4 Great pizza -- crust is light, airy, and slightly crispy on the very bottom. The ricotta cheesecake is also great -- rich, soft, and dense without any graininess. Pleasantly exceeded my expectations. 
6129 3 12/26/07: Three pasta dishes (carbonara ziti, clams in spicy marinara sauce and matriciana ziti) - great place for a quick lunch - this place was one minute away from my old digs and still serves up great meals. Atmosphere is blah but food is great. Enjoy! 
6130 4 Lovely servers, delicious food, the Yelp consensus is 100% accurate. LOVED the red lentil dish, and be sure to take the server's recommendation and get the kitfo almost-rare. Delightful. 
6131 4 The food and service is always great. There is a little bit of a wait time but it's totally worth it. 
6132 4 These guys are the best. While I always try to leave them a reasonable turnaround time, once again they have helped me out in a pinch. And my client was completely thrilled with the quality of the printing.... I can't say enough good things. 
6133 4 A great addition to downtown! Service is consistently on point and friendly. Food comes out fresh and in a timely manner. Great atmosphere with their two huge "garage doors" that open up to offer a beautiful view of the Columbus skyline. Extensive beer list and great happy hour! 
6134 3 Excellent meal, service was fantastic. There is no excuse for anyone ever leaving here hungry. Large servings. 
6135 4 Best beer in Columbus, Ohio! Food is great too! Owner is always here and involved. Colin is the best bartender. Always a good time. 
6136 4 Great service and amazing food! I used the order food function on my yelp app and I was able to put in my entire order and pay for it all through my phone. I picked up my food 15 minutes later! Loved everything about my experience. 
6137 4 Great service and excellent food. In town for work and I want to come back tomorrow. Had the pretzel bites, arancini and cherry bread pudding. Everything was excellent. Do yourself a favor and come here. 
6138 2 Great customer service. Hal (the owner) is a nice guy and I have found and bought so cool stuff from there! 
6139 0 worst foodhorrible tasting and really bad cheap quailty tih spalce should be closed 
6140 3 Very friendly and professional staff. The dental hygienist that cleaned my teeth(twice so far in one year) was Cambria and she kept giving me useful information on how to maintain my teeth while cleaning them. I love her! 
6141 4 Eat here. this place was awesome. it is unique and has foods from different latin countries and everything was extremely good from what our group ordered. 
6142 0 Overpriced junk and one of the rudest managers I've ever encountered. Don't waste your time or money! 
6143 4 The view is amazing and the DJ that played that night was incredible. The beer was "meh", but that's probably because on me. I ordered their stout and it was wayyyy too thick. 
6144 4 For great variety of flavor come to this hip Mexican taqueria. I don't think I've ever run into such consistently friendly servers and they put an effort provide all sorts of beef pork fish and vegetarian tacos. The beef cheeks are especially delicious! 
6145 4 Great group of people manning the Store - friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and efficient. Look forward to going there for any need they can accommodate. 
6146 4 OMG，so good~~~~I like crispy chicken somuch,better than las vegas !and i like grass jelly with tofu pudding 
6147 4 Lentil soup!!!!! I didn't like lentil soup until I was taken to Willow Tree. I love this place!! Great atmosphere, food, beer, and schnapps!!! 
6148 4 Great selection of products + energizing smoothie / acai bowl (wait might be long at times) + friendly service Too good to be a few steps away from work 
6149 3 We went here before the hockey game and will definitely return. Their flights of beer give you the opportunity to imbibe and sample their bomb sour beer offerings! Must try the Prime Meridian and the Sweet Heat, infused with hot peppers, yowza! Lots of seating and ultra cool, friendly staff! 
6150 4 It is a great place to hang at night. Their take out window makes them even more attractive. I had Carnivore and Spicy Mexicana and I love them both! They were both in medium size and I had three pieces for each. Thin crust and freshly baked, very delicious! 
6151 4 First time trying Ethiopian food and I can happily say I loved it! My fav was red lentils and injera bread. When someone checks on your table hows everything? (who's not your waiter)..now that's good customer service! 
6152 4 Absolutely amazing. Gnocchi bolognese, steak, bread pudding- the list goes on. I have gone for dinner and held a number of private events here. Service is outstanding, and the food is the best. One of the main things I miss about Boston! 
6153 3 They deliver to my workplace which is awesome! Some dishes are great. Some are meh. I love the mongolian beef or chicken, the house fried rice and their egg rolls are delicious! 
6154 2 The price is right. The location is good with the lions gate just a couple blocks away. Some of the rooms are musty and aging while others are much cleaner. 
6155 4 Omg!!!!! I have never had a better breakfast! Cinnamon rolls that melt in your mouth, the ABC scramble was so delicate and flavorful. What can I say? GO THERE NOW!!! You won't be sorry! 
6156 4 Dive bar, perhaps, but SUCH great fun!!! Whoo hoo! GREAT live music!!! I'll be back for the #MotoGP Saturday night. :-) 
6157 4 A great park. Hiking up the view trail and down to the creek. Nice scenery especially with everything so green. :) Swimming in the cool water made it perfect on this hot day. My dogs are still sleeping. Disclaimer, when there are so many cars you can't park, keep driving. 
6158 3 The best part of this restaurant is they have free crab ragoon, spring rolls and soups for free during the lunch time:) 
6159 4 Great food every time you come from soup to pasta and any kind of sandwiches. They also have great catering Been coming here many years 
6160 2 It's a chain. None of it's fresh, but it's good enough if you don't know any better, and you won't get sick. 
6161 3 This is our go-to sushi spot in Atlanta. The ingredients are fresh and they have a variety of roll options! The price is also very reasonable. Knocking off one star because the hibachi and bento box items are pretty bad. I would recommend sticking with sushi. 
6162 4 Make sure you're hungry! Meat, meat and more meat! Whenever I have family or friends come in from out of town, I always recommend this place. Not only is the meat perfectly cooked, and great quality...the salad bar will keep any vegetarian happy! 
6163 3 Great breakfast this morning. Loved the waffle and canadian breakfast. You have to add the duck fat fries. 
6164 2 This food is pretty good. I wish they had more options/variety on the menu. Other than a variety issue, its a nice place to eat for lunch and to get full off of. 
6165 4 Recommend! Very fun. Great customer service. Very cheap, we payed $25 for three of us! 3 can fit in one canoe. 
6166 3 Make reservations! The only place to be on a Sunday morning. Every thing was delicious besides the tough sea bass. The dumpling cart was my favorite. Service was great(and I am picky being in the service industry)! 
6167 4 Excellent food and service remind me at being a grandma if he brings back many wonderful memories 
6168 2 Food was average. Prices were average for the food options, but it lacked in quantity. Long wait and order came out wrong and had to be sent back. I would only return if I was with someone who really really wanted to go. 
6169 4 We're the couple from Gladstone and we were NOT let down one single bit!!! Amazing taste in EVERY bite and made with love!!! honestly two of the nicest guys making the dankest burgers!!! We will be back! 
6170 1 $4.72 for a SMALL chai?! Seriously!? It was alright, but too much milk not enough spice. Might as well go to Starsucks for that price and quality. And the seats on the benches are about half the normal size. Probably not going again. 
6171 4 Great sports pizza bar. It is loud and rocking with lots of TVs. Pizza is the star -- other food is fine, but the pizza is GREAT. Half price Tuesday is great. Go to there and let your hair down. ;) 
6172 3 First time here. Fantastic. I had the carne asada. Worth the price. Can't wait until they get there alcohol license. A good margarita to go along with the food will be fantastic. Brookhaven/Atlanta needed a restaurant to fill the void of serving great and creative Mexican food 
6173 2 I found this restaurant to have really small portions and expensive food for mediocre taste. The rolls barely had any fillings. The waitress was very feiendly but dissapointing food. One of the dishes, a chopped scallop roll barely had any fillings that the rice was rolled in 
6174 0 Had takeout last night, chicken fingers weren't cooked and gross. Crab Rangoon's tasted like they were made last week. Why can't you get good Chinese food in South Boston!! 
6175 4 Amazing experience and my nails turned out awesome. Came in with a picture from Pinterest and it looks exactly like it. Jessie was great and saved my nails after the salon I went to before messed them up. I'll be coming again for sure 
6176 3 Don't be glum, chum! You're in a car wash! The Palms is fun and there are a variety of washes from do-it-yourself to fully automatic. And really the whirly thing out front is just mesmerizing to watch! 
6177 4 Good prices, big store, clean restrooms. This is where we went after Suncoast tried to rip us off. 
6178 2 I got confused on the order form and ended up with cheese only pizza. Not that good, but the caesar salad was awesome. 
6179 3 Nice ambiance and probably the coolest spot in Union Square for a specialty coffee drink. However it is always closed when I want to go (8pm to 10pm) 
6180 4 Wow, Dr. Leahy is awesome. I went all through my pregnancy, and as a result I had zero back pain. I'll continue to go post-part. They are great about cancelled appointments, understanding life gets in the way, and quick to find another time. 
6181 3 The arepas are ON POINT. Cocktails were weak and my entree was boring (beef, plantains, and white rice), and generally speaking this place is overpriced, but omg I would return in a heartbeat for those arepas. 
6182 4 Thank you for the excellent service. I had heels on my boots come loose and they fixed them up and repaired them back to new. I've taken shoes and boots there for years and they do great work ! Great small business ! Give them a try. 
6183 4 Fresh ingredients, cultural dress, and great service made this a repeat destination. Thanks! 
6184 4 A great place to get a haircut! It is a nice, clean salon. Be sure to ask for Julie! 
6185 2 Everyone I work loves this place, but I can't see what's so special. The teriyaki is always just on the wrong side of burnt. It's nothing terribly special to me. Just another teriyaki place. That said, it's very reasonably priced and quick. 
6186 3 Food was amazing.. fresh and tasty. Service was good. Downfall would be they don't like deviating from their menu unless you want to pay... $$$. No making your own omelette. 
6187 4 Probably should have rated 1 star because the music SUCKED. However, my beers were cold, the bartender got my order right, and the wings were one hunnit. Also, sup, Kristy? Slide in my yelp DMs. 
6188 3 A great place to walk around and absorb the historical significance. You can also visit the 3 meeting houses around the green. Very cool! 
6189 4 My family loves this place. Has a vast selection of food and drinks that are good to the taste buds. Kid friendly with a very large childrens menu. Would recommend this to anyone. 
6190 4 Great food and service! Again. 4 out of the last 5 weeks great every time.. tuesday and Wednesday get right in. Always looking to make sure that you have a great time! 
6191 3 This is one of few nightlife spots in Sandy Springs. It's a nice trendy atmosphere inside the restaurant bar with nice outdoor seating as well. Turns club like on the weekends and they offer hookah which is a plus. No cover unless it's a special occasion like Halloween. 
6192 3 Was here for a Christmas party...food and drinks were excellent...the desserts we had definitely need some work...great location...service was very good 
6193 2 What the fuck, man? No sample cups?! Otherwise, it's a pretty standard yogurt place, standard flavors and toppings, but selection is pretty minimal. The yogurt was also kind of "drippy"/melted coming out of the machine. 
6194 2 Hello, I am going to check out the place this week. My male friend is getting man's haircut by Mario. the price is 20 bucks. Update: My friend liked how Mario did his haircut but I thought that the style did not suit well his face shape. 
6195 3 Nice local theater! We saw Star Wars Solo opening weekend. They don't have stadium seating, but prices are reasonable. You can also buy dinner there and eat during the movie. Great family place! 
6196 0 Terrible unless you want to order something and eat in pitch darkness, try and then give up, and only hear butt jokes. 
6197 4 Excellent service by Dr. Patel - highly recommended. Fast, efficient service, coupled with a great personality sets you at ease! Wish they had electronic forms online you could fill out prior to arriving for your appointment, only small gripe. Worth the paper hassle for great service though! 
6198 0 Horrible layout in the bar area with no space. Sat at a table in the bar for 15 minutes without being acknowledged before leaving to go somewhere that could take time out of their busy schedule to serve us 
6199 3 A nice Tibetan store that has a wide selection of women's styles located between Porter and Harvard. Beautiful wares at standard boutique prices. Also a nice selection of jewelry. 
6200 3 Food was very good. Miso soup was amazing. Best smiso around, and that's saying a lot coming from me. Sushi was good also. Prices were great. Will visit again. :$ 
6201 4 The absolute best place I have ever had my nails done. Very happy with my nails. They were very nice and helpful when helping me to decide what to do. Very clean, I will definately be going back and I highly reccommend this establishment to anyone!!! 
6202 4 Typhoon is delicious. The sushi is wonderful and the food is always fresh and well cooked. We go here for both lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed. We have never received bad service. 
6203 3 Great service from James. Came during happy hour but couldn't enjoy the specials unless at the bar. Hence not giving 5 stars. But the stuffed shells, chicken parm and spaghetti with meat sauce were all hits. Definitely recommend 
6204 4 My go to boba spot in Austin. There are a ton of options but I always stick to my regular order: Oolong Milk Tea, 30% sweet, regular ice, with boba. Brb--going to run out and get some boba. 
6205 3 i love this restunt in the mornings i get a CINIMON ROLL FRENCHTOAST of a bellgim waffle for lunch i always get a burger this place always makes the BEST MALLTES i love it 
6206 1 Ugh, so disappointed! Falafel like undercooked dumplings. This place is a distant stepbrother from the original location. So if you want faster, low quality wannabe Mediterranean this is your place. Felt very Western. 
6207 4 After a small hiccup, Becky Gaines personally contacted my husband and I and requested that we come in for a dinner at Fleming's. The food, service and management are nothing short of exceptional. What a delightful experience. 
6208 4 Just had their buffalo wings for take out. Delicious. Not to bready and great quality chicken 
6209 4 I brought my car in after the front bumper was misaligned and within 5 minutes my car was fixed by Chad at no charge! The staff was polite and professional, and service was quick. I recommend this place! 
6210 2 Service was great, but food was a bit over-priced and I didn't really think it was worth it in the end. Glad I went this once but I don't anticipate returning. 
6211 0 Meh Service is just awful, server spilled our drinks on the table not even sorry gyoza is cold on the inside Ramen broth is cold Never coming back 
6212 3 Staff was very friendly and courteous. Room was spacious and well maintained. We stayed in room 11 for a Valentine's overnight. The jacuzzi tub in the bathroom was great. Breakfast the next morning was delicious with a nice variety of choices. Would recommend it for anyone busting Boulder. 
6213 1 I ordered there version of stuffed hash browns when I went, the sour cream tasted like it had nail polish in it, I couldn't finish my food because of it. 
6214 0 Honestly saying this place moves at a glacial pace is an understatement. Terrible service and generally slowww even when using the kiosks. Not to mention the numbers duplicate so you could be number 75 and so could someone else waiting on their food. What the hell. Just terrible. 
6215 4 Absolutely love this place. I have been here twice and it surely won't be my last. From the bier, buffet, evironment and the cream puffs. I don't know what I love the most! 
6216 0 What the beck happened? This use to be the go-to spot for killer Chinese. My experience this weekend was beyond disgusting. Every dish was loaded with so much grease. There was oil every where. I suspect they changed the cook. I would avoid all cost until the reviews improved 
6217 3 I'm updating my earlier bad review. Things have improved tremendously since my last review! The food has seemed to have been elevated, the pizza has greatly improved too. The staff is nice and friendly. I still don't think the having kids is going to go over well. Good job! 
6218 1 nice atmosphere with the comic figurines. tasty food but small portions for the price. I wont be going back because of that. #realfoodforrealpeople 
6219 4 What a cool place! Service was quick and food was tasty. Definitely try the chowder. I really enjoyed the hot lobster roll. 
6220 4 The ingredients are very fresh. Service is excellent. Even though we have to wait a bit, but it was totally worth it. 
6221 4 Weekend in Vancouver Wa. The best part was the meals in Tommy O's. Great Hawaiian theme breakfast with friendly service. Dinner from the happy hour and sushi menus was so delicious. I recommend that anyone who goes to Vancouver WA eats there. 
6222 4 Jimmy is the best bartender!! He is so funny and personable! Me and my friends always have a great time at wahlburgers! The food is also a plus! 
6223 4 Best bar in town. Hot dog menu is amazing--really gives the Irish feel. Menu pricing is out of this world. $3 beers, $5 hot dogs, and $10 burgers. Doesn't get much better in downtown Boston. 
6224 3 Delicious food!!!! Authentic ( I guess considering I've never been to Cuba) But this place gives out generous portions so it is worth the money. Some might say it is expensive. The service can be worked on a bit- other than that good food. 
6225 0 Please don't go here. I got eyelash extensions from here and my own lashes got ripped out because of it. My lashes will never be the same. When I would get my nails done they would constantly try to upsell me and then I would leave with streaky nails. 
6226 2 First time here. We ordered online to pickup. Our order wasn't ready and had to wait around 15minutes. Everything was fresh looking and the taste was good. The cauliflower salad was mostly onions but the flavor was good. My falafel was good. Gyro was small but also good! 
6227 4 Very helpful, nice and informative staff. We asked about having a private event and the manager spent 20min chatting with us. Goat Cheese appetizer was AMAZING, we ended up ordering 2! Happy Hour Specials were great! 
6228 2 The food overall wasn't too bad however some of the chips were uncooked, the salsa and the chicken enchilada were a little bland, I was definitely expecting fuller flavors. I could taste the beans more than the chicken. 
6229 4 Holy hell. Best place I've ever been. I don't have words yet to define my love for this spot. More after I eat. 
6230 3 The food here is quite tasty (no less than Shanghai River), and there's a good variety. Service is ok - the waiter helped us a lot with ordering our food, but they don't really change plates for you unless you ask for it. 
6231 3 The food was decent. Feels like home made food nothing amazing or exceptional. Quality is all right Would go back for a decent breakfast experience 
6232 3 Can't go wrong with cheap beer and a vintage photo booth. 
6233 4 Fast and good food. Large sandwiches made to order by a friendly staff. Share an order of fries. Great location, but limited parking west of the shop. I recommend the gyro to eat there or take home, fresh off the spit 
6234 4 We have stayed at this property multiple times and have always had an amazing experience! 
6235 4 So good! They have great customer service and awesome vibe will definitely continue to come here. 
6236 3 I have to say that this place is good. The fish was a tad bit dry on my taco, but nonetheless, tasty. And to be completely honest, I'm bloody tired of Boulder being so pretensiously expensive, so having a six buck lunch was mighty fine by me. 
6237 4 Great pho and especially recommend the egg rolls. One of the good point is it takes 5 mins to get everything ready. 
6238 1 Decided to do the "happy hour" and what a disappointment. Be prepared to wait and then wait. Service is slow, slow and slow. The food was ok; not worth the painful wait. 
6239 4 The nachos are always good and the after work margarita hits the spot. BRUNCH THOUGH IS INCREDIBLE! Do not miss it! 
6240 4 I love this place as it reminds me the taste of chinese food in India. I would definitely recommend their mixed schezuan fried rice, BLAZING MUMBAI PRAWNS, CHICKEN MALAI KEBABS, LAMB CHOPS (very tasty), TANDOORI CHICKEN TIKKA, almost everything from seafood, poultry, lamb. 
6241 0 Food is amazing - hostess has to be one of the rudest people I have ever encountered- service at tables is minimal at best. 
6242 4 Punch cards, spice, and more flavor than you could possibly expect! This cart is THE spot on the hill to hit up...get your stamps! 
6243 4 What a hidden Gem we've found here. Great fresh food, amazing baklava, amazing falafels and all served up by the most beautiful lady in New Westminster. Check this place out 
6244 3 Living in Atlanta for the past two months, I am glad there is some sort of convenient transportation. It is easy, dependable and safe. There is also helpful staff around if you need them! 
6245 4 This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. I refuse to go anywhere else. I love their house quesadillas! 
6246 0 Warning: do not use this company. They cancelled out on us (over 150 tents) one week before the event with no excuse. They are disorganized, unprofessional and horrible to work with. 
6247 2 Good burger and location.....however, not a fan of the loud "cut me"/heavy metal music. The music was just too much, had to leave. 
6248 3 The food here is definitely more authentic and tastes better than any Chinatown food in the Boston area. The place is pretty cramped though, so it's not good for large parties. 
6249 4 This is my spot. Best barbershop in Quincy by far...and the spa is nice too 
6250 4 The soft serve was incredibly rich and much thicker than I expected. I ordered the strawberry and black pepper ice cream to try something new, and it was unexpectedly delicious. The cone was very thin, and quite crispy. 
6251 4 Extremely good service and we loved the food. Had some great chicken and ravioli. Was very cool view and seating with extremely fast and efficient service. Great job overall. 
6252 1 The people who take your order are rude. As soon as they take the order, they hang up and do not answer any clarifying questions. Definitely left me frustrated even before I got the food. 
6253 3 They served us real fast, food was good especially the rice and beans... I would recommend this place to everyone.... Get you some papaya juice. BOMB 
6254 4 This place has some of the best ramen I've tried around the Austin area. The broth is so delicious and the pork is amazing--it's one of my husband and my favorite quick spots to eat. 
6255 4 Love love love. The burgers are great, crinkle fries and sweet potato fries are my favorite. The shakes are sooo delicious! 
6256 4 This place is legit! So good. Their blackened fish tacos are to die for. Totally recommend this place. 
6257 3 Very clean and inviting shop. Employees are always friendly and helpful-I've never had to wait for a bed, so it's a quick 15 minute rejuvenating "time out" after a long work day! 
6258 4 Quick, friendly service! They had a nail out of our tire and patched up in about 10 minutes. Couldn't have been easier. Also, it was only $12.99 for the repair. 
6259 3 Would give this location 5 stars but the guy who makes the frappuccinos was super slow, which is very annoying when you have to start work in 20 minutes and he takes 35 to make the drink orders. 
6260 3 Been here 4x now, and quality has gotten progressively downhill. Probably will give it another shot but still solid sushi when made right 
6261 4 Great place to eat Keto / Ketogenic / for those in ketosis. Tons of protein options covered in oil. ... For those who are not eating a keto-style diet, the food is likely way too oily for good health. 
6262 4 Outstanding!!!! The service and food at J&M is just incredible. Come with a big appetite because you definitely get a significant amount of food. 
6263 4 You have to get the Ube horchata!! Adding cold brew to it is also super amazing! The owner is super friendly and it made my day meeting him! Don't miss this when you're in Austin!! 
6264 3 Great atmosphere!! And server Alex was very professional and efficient!! Very pleasant meal.. way too much food!! Share 
6265 4 J&M is back, and still great! Bigger space, more parking, the omelettes are somehow even better than before, and friendly helpful staff all around. Great work bringing the awesome back! 
6266 2 Basically, food is good and pretty cheap. If you are not Asian or they don't know you, you'll get really slow service and shitty looks. 
6267 4 Delicious! This is a great American food bar. They seem to specialize in burgers but no one in my party ended up with a burger. The chicken sandwich is amazing with a side of Cesar salad. And HIGHLY suggest the Brisket Fries as an appetizer. We will be back soon! 
6268 3 Very Friendly bartender busy Saturday here bread and butter was with chives orgeno garlic very good Ordered Beet salad with salmon excellent 
6269 0 Food always great! Service sucks.... After waiting 15 min to have a server come to table, it was another 20 before we got drinks..... When confronted was given such attitude..... Not customer service focused.... I was told I was being rude for questioning if there was new management. 
6270 3 i always stop by early am. workers are always friendly, look a little old and ghetto, but that is to be expected at a winco. i love their fresh maple bars in the morning!!!! will deff keep coming back before work! 
6271 4 We live around the corner from them and order all the time. They are consistently great. Their Crab Rangoon is hands down the best in Quincy. Lo Mein awesome, Pad Thai, awesome, spring rolls awesome. This is our go to place. They are fast an friendly and consistent. Love. 
6272 4 Organic food at fantastic prices. The owner is awesome and the staff really kind. I love shopping here..feels like I'm really supporting a family run business. I enjoy the variety and freshness and the outdoor feel of the place. Great neighborhood to just walk around in the sunshine too! 
6273 4 Super friendly staff, quick service and my blizzard was loaded with heath bar goodness! 
6274 3 Good food! We had the lobster roll, fried chicken sandwich and cheeseburger sliders and all were really good and really reasonably priced. The ambiance was a little divey, but we were pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. 
6275 2 I am going to temporarily suspend my 5 star review until can confirm that my experience today was just a disturbance in the force. 
6276 2 Excellent food, attentive waiters. Low score because hostess and cashier plain ol' rude. Need lesson in politeness. 
6277 3 It was a Very tasty and authentic meal. Food was made speedy. We ordered the Churassco & Lomo Saltado. We liked their selection of natural juices, mango, guava, sour-sop & passion fruit. The Alfajor dessert however was not the best. Will be returning for breakfast. Thank you 
6278 3 We had the pancetta burger and added caramelized onions. It was supposed to come on a brioche bun, but they ran out, so used a different bun, but it was fantastic!! The fries were really good too nice and crispy. Delicious!! 
6279 4 Gorgeous hotel. Must make your way to the old lobby of the hotel at 11am and 5pm to watch the March of the Ducks! 
6280 4 The food here is consistently delish. I've eaten here for years. We really enjoy the flavor of the gyro meat. The chicken kabobs are super tasty and the fries are the best! Very authentic tasting cuisine. 
6281 4 It's pretty. Nature is taking over the manmade clearings.it was pretty quiet as well. It's a nice hideout from the bustle of the city. It also smelled sooo fragrant. The flowers were so lovely. I could've just laid there and basked in the floral scents forever. 
6282 4 We got a Groupon for $70 worth of food. The food was so good. I would come here again. Good quality for the price. The service was also really good. Our waiter was helpful and suggesting of different items on the menu. 
6283 4 Good yogurt and toppings, very nice people working there. Decorated lovely including a fireplace. Comfortable seating. 
6284 3 awesome place... been here like 3 or 4 times now... Fun atmosphere, friendly barstaff and crowd, cheap drinks, decent music, depends on when you go, but I like the place... Allston Villagers, GO HERE... don't waste your money at lame places like The Kells or Tonic... 
6285 3 Tuesday at 3pm fast, friendly. Good burger. Kinda pricy but has a celeb name so it's expected I guess. 
6286 1 Fine but overrated. However, in a pinch they take all credit cards. The best place in the neighborhood doesn't. Mike 
6287 3 One of the oldest BBQ in Austin area. Love the beef ribs and sausage. I didn't like their briskets, but everything else is great. Make sure you order their macaroni and cheese. It's yummy. 
6288 4 huge portions of delicious food for $8-10. wonton soup and sliced pork & rice plate is amazing 
6289 4 Sad that I just found this place! I've been passing them for 3 years coming home from work down Monroe. But now that I know about them it's one of my new favorite to-go places. Prices are fair and the food is awesome! 
6290 4 Always a great spot to meet and have a delish lunch. Lots of locals and people after long bike rides hanging out. Wood fired pizzas are incredible. Also the fruit iced teas really good. Quaint space and friendly staff Deserts are also super yummy! 
6291 4 Such a great experience- from order taken, to the chef personally greeting the table and educating us on the brand and product. Food was top notch unique flavors, unique ingredients... I will be frequenting this place!!! 
6292 4 Great food and generous proportions! It serves both authentic Chinese food and Americanized Chinese food shop there's something for everyone. Try the 3 cup chicken (san bei ji). 
6293 4 Great place, good food and fantastic service! Would recommend to anyone if you're up for pizza. Also, they managed to flip the pizza and made a new one for us, and because we had to wait 5 minutes extra they didn't charge for it! 
6294 0 10 minutes before the store closed I tried to try on clothes and the attendant was so rude and barked at me that there closed which the store was not! They just lost out on a sale!!! Oh well I'll just go to another Pink store where I'm treated better. 
6295 4 3 years later... Ordered the same thing. And nothing CHANGED. Soup and Pineapple Fried Rice is very good and spicy 
6296 4 Omg thank you Yelp for leading me to this hidden gem. It's in a tiny shopping center and I'm usually the only non-Spanish speaker there. Which is a good sign. I'm in taco heaven! I always get the al pastor tacos and The flan is also great. 
6297 4 The Dirty South is the best meatloaf sandwich in the history of the world. Oh, and they gave great bartenders, wines, beers, and cocktails too. 
6298 3 This place only does one thing.. And it does it very well, sandwiches are not huge, but they are good! I come here infrequently. 
6299 4 Two solid meals here. Quick and friendly staff - good if you have a family of people with different tastes. 
6300 3 Excellent monster Dosas. Super flavorful and so many varieties. I could easily eat here once a week, or more. The wait staff is sweet and attentive and I never fail to have a good experience here. 
6301 4 Amazing burger, fries, and unsweetened ice tea on tap. 
6302 4 I have several food sensitivities. The staff were super helpful & knowledgeable about ingredients. You can't go wrong with a great cup of intelligentsia coffee at this place. Great space, nice ambiance, good music. I'll be back for sure! 
6303 3 Pleasantly surprised with this place. Girlfriend got ramen which wasn't that good and I got a bowl. I would recommend a bowl. Especially with the sauce options you get to add. It was delicious. Plus, fortune cookies really wet the whistle. 
6304 2 Very nice and friendly. Food was good, generous portion on the combo plate. Very reasonably priced. Service was kind of slow, even though only two tables were occupied including us. The place seemed very clean and was quite quiet and comfortable. 
6305 4 A plus service, great experience..... Thank you Dener the bartener and Febiana and Daniel...................................................... 
6306 1 chips and onion dip had no flavor and the wings were 'eh' too. headed over to bleacher bar where we had a much better experience 
6307 4 I take my son to this barbershop when in that Area. They give great cuts and It's family friendly. I like it. Just go the barbers that's been there and not the new barbers. 
6308 4 Such a cool place. Upon entering I was greeted immediately. Service was organized and quick, I ended up getting a chicken sandwich with popcorn crunch on it and a lemonade. A great lunch spot that is sure to surprise with its unique sandwich options. 
6309 1 Just went to the Taste of Tigard event and though my passport included a sample from Le Cookie Monkey all they had was a banner at their booth - I've wanted to try their products and was looking forward to it. Pretty disappointing folks. 
6310 3 The food is very good the service was very friendly. I had an egg white omelette with vegan sausage and caramelized onions and cheese and it was just delightful. I wouldn't say it's the healthiest option out there but it's definitely tasty! 
6311 4 I have been there for breakfast and brunch. Great food. Love the frozen peach Bellini. 
6312 4 Friendly staff, welcoming atmosphere, delicious donuts and tasty cortado!! Great place for an after meal café and treats! 
6313 3 I had a fantastic tasting, seasoned burger that I haven't had in a long time. Very good. 
6314 1 This used to be my go to spot grt food cheap drinks! But now the prices are catching up to the neighborhood! Very disappointing I probably won't be going back!!! 
6315 4 Always a great place for dinner and drinks! Standouts include the Ribeye, Pork Belly and Fish Tacos! Guacamole and Street Corn(off the cob) rounded out the meal! 
6316 4 Great service. They make their bread, jam, and ketchup on sight. Plus, their hash browns are out of this world! 
6317 4 Deeeelish! Good Oolong milk tea is not easy to find. I'm a fan! I also like the vibe here which lends itself to hanging out and even studying. I recommend the Winter Melon Green milk tea too! You can't go wrong with actual milk teas with a real tea base. 
6318 0 I have my own insurance but This Place charge me extra insurance and didn't tell me when I picked up my car , don't come here again ! The agent will cheat on u , very bad 
6319 4 This place is just great! Worth the money! The stylist are very sweet and know what they are doing! 
6320 2 Our waitress was really nice. But the sushi honestly wasn't that amazing. They also messed up my order terribly. They also messed up the table next to us terribly. They tried to make up for it with free dessert. Nice inside though. Quaint. 
6321 0 Over priced and over rated, just like VooDoo. If you're trendy and have more dollars than sense, this is your kind of place. 
6322 4 Excellent food! We've come here twice in our short 3 day visit. Food is amazing as well as service!! Highly recommended if you're visiting the Boston area 
6323 4 Absolutely delicious I had veggie spring rolls and veggie noodle stir fry. The service was great and the food was awesome, I highly recommend this place. 
6324 4 The food is great! One of my fav brunch spots in town. The service is always awesome, and the environment is welcoming. A great place to meet up with friends or have a nice date night! 
6325 0 If I could leave a negative star I would, worst place a person could ever go! They are extremely irresponsible, they lost my blood test results and said they were not responsible for that. 
6326 3 Pulled right up on boat! Got great food and great service. The smell, obviously, was a fishy but that was ok. The summer time is great, not sure how the winter is. I will have to check it out 
6327 0 Bummer. They're closed and I never got to try them. I got a notice from my Amazon yesterday that they had refunded the cost of my coupon for Hank's because it's now out of business. Eater Austin has stated that they closed at the end of December. 
6328 4 Some of the best tacos you can find in the east side. The location is small and may make you think twice but i recommend taking the trip. you will not be disappointed. 
6329 2 The food here is pretty basic. I had the shrimp and lobster sauce and all it did was diminish my hunger. The taste didn't woo me and I probably won't be back. 
6330 3 Came here for dessert because the line was too long (about a 1.5 to 2 hour wait) for actual dinner. We ordered sangria and flan, cheesecake, and dulce de leche crepes (everything tasted awesome) and the service was great too despite how crowded it was. 
6331 2 Food is not as neatly presented as compared to the Richmond location, but taste is still good. 
6332 1 Ordered from Saus today. The fries were cold and tasteless and the chicken and waffles weren't that great either! Tasted better! 
6333 0 Terrible service, girl behind counter doesn't know how to make any kind of sundae and way over priced 2 scoop sundae 5.50. Save your money and get ice cream from gas station for 2.79 and get twice as much. Smh, Baskin Robbers 
6334 4 Great vegan options. I love love love the chana saag (so smooth so tasty) and the mushroom samosa. Also had a delicious chicken curry. 
6335 4 Very good massage if you're not looking for something fancy. They apply pressure and it feels great! Also great price. $30 for an hour foot massage. Easy to schedule too. 
6336 2 Pros: - Great services and friendly - Great layout in a narrow space - Noodles was tender. Cons: - Soup was blend. - Pork was not tasty. Notes: - The waiting time after you took the order is around 20-30mins for two Raman. Not a place for fast food. 
6337 4 Best.Doughnuts.Ever. All of them are so different and wacky that they make you want to get them all! Great and helpful staff as well. 
6338 4 Went there for the last Jedi. Too crowded! Suggest to buy ticket online, so you will safe a long line for the ticket. 
6339 3 Good food, good service. My wife and I ordered the Mixed Grill for two. The Shish Kebab was excellent, everything else was good but a bit too fatty/greasy for us. The glass of wine we got was excellent. The Lavas bread and Ezme appetizers were also very good. 
6340 2 I tried the Boulder Cut prime rib. It was very tender and soft and a pretty big cut. I thought it was pretty good but a big bland so had to add salt. We also ordered crab cakes and shrimp wrapped with bacon for appetizers. Overall a good meal. 
6341 1 Our table was ready, and the hostess wanted to seat us. However, the manager refused to seat us, because someone sat down in our section less than 5 minutes prior. 2 stars only because the server said it was a dumb rule and took us to the seat. 
6342 4 Creamy, yes! Smooth, yes! Rich, without being ridiculously bad for you, yes! Lots of creative and delicious flavors, yes! Yogurtland, one of the best yogurt places in Austin, YES! YES! YES! 
6343 4 Their Bao Bao is divine. Their egg drop soup is also very close to the Chinese original taste. Reasonably priced items! Friendly hostess! Highly recommended! 
6344 3 Good food with a nice view. Happy hour every day 3-7 with $5 stout margaritas which is nice. Not a very versatile kitchen staff though cause they dont offer quesadillas or enchiladas but their tacos were tasty 
6345 4 These guys are great! Very competitive prices and fast service that's done correctly the first time. There is even an awesome dog that hangs out in the waiting area that will play fetch while you wait! 
6346 4 Some of the best Thai food I've ever had. Weird location for such a nice place. Ambiance is very nice as is the wait staff. Green and red curry were spectacular. Get the sticky rice with coconut ice cream for dessert. 
6347 4 Our favorite Thai place in north Austin! Food tastes just like it did in Thailand and they have a huge selection for a reasonable price. It would take quite sometime to try every item. Very friendly and gracious service. 
6348 2 I've been visiting this place since I was a child. The sandwiches can sometimes be hit or miss (not fresh lettuce, soggy tomatoes and hard bread) but overall, they are good. The owner can be a bit rude at times but the lady is sweet. 
6349 3 I like this place. Good pricing, very good California Rolls and their rice bowls are great. I like the Oyako Don with the egg. Great for take out as well 
6350 3 Consistent and best Mexican/Southwest restaurant in the area. Good wolf on greens is filling and worth trying. Casual atmosphere and kid friendly. Returned the other night and nothing has changed. Good value but it can get loud 
6351 3 Food was good. Paratha was excellent. But not much impressed with vegetable biriyani. 
6352 4 They didn't laugh at any of my jokes! But 5 stars for being open during the hurricane. 
6353 4 Amazing! Love! Can't wait to go back. I had the Mother Earth Bowl and it was the best lunch I have had in a long time. So much flavor and vegetarian. Don't walk, run there! 
6354 4 Loves this food! The customer service was great and the food was so so delicious. It far exceeds what you would expect from a. Food court. Tasted just as good as any other Indian food place I have been to. Well done! 
6355 3 This chipotle always works fast! Everything is made in moment and the team members are very polite! 
6356 3 A great way to learn about the Harvard from both a historical and current perspective. 
6357 1 Service is fair. Can be harsh at times. Kitchen was clean. Food is good. 
6358 4 The Prime Time burger is as good as it gets. A little pricey, but well worth it. 
6359 3 it is a good choice when traveling in a different noisy City. after a day walking chinese food is perfect for us. 
6360 4 Amazing family operated addition to the Newton dining scene. I tried most of the menu and loved it all. 
6361 3 We tried this for the first time last night after hearing about it from multiple fans. Really good, super thin, homemade pizza. They cut it with scissors which is really cool. We'll definitely go back. 
6362 0 Ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and got very disappointed :(. Didn't seem and didn't taste home made at all. Maybe the rest of the dishes are good but unfortunately not pizza! 
6363 4 The burgers and milkshakes were the best I've had in Atlanta. Period. Rivals Farm Burger for the best in my mind, but I still cannot decide which is better. 
6364 4 In Southern California, we are used to 5 star Mexican out of dive strip malls. We usually discount Mexican outside the LA area codes but this place is golden. The best mole I ever had. A perfect foil for the slightly sweet pork. 
6365 1 Call in to schedule a same day appointment. left message for nurse, no call back. Called 5 days later, spoke to nurse, replied " we don't recall have a message from you". Sounds like not my problem it is your problem. Looking to move to a different primary care. 
6366 1 So so buffet. I've had better chinese buffets but for $5.99 - $6.99 per person, you can't really ask for top quality. The food was kind of greasy. The sushi was nothing special, and the dessert was also very normal. The green tea ice cream was really good. 
6367 0 Over $16 for two sh*tty small plain cheese burgers & stale a$$ fries??? F*CK Smashburger! NEVER again! WAY overpriced for what you get! #AVOID 
6368 4 I recently got my business cards printed with Inkgenuity Printing and the quality of the cards were higher than what I expected. Jerry was very professional and great to deal with. His service was top notch and I would highly recommend Inkgenuity to anyone who needs any printing done. 
6369 4 Great brunch. Inventive drinks... A pickly pear margarita. Strawberry basil something or other. Dog friendly good food and fun 
6370 4 The service was quick, friendly and efficient. I needed a watch battery and was in and out in 5 minutes. 
6371 4 Dr. Connall and his staff are wonderful. They are highly communicative, compassionate, committed to their field, and professional. I was extremely satisfied with the work I received. I will always recommend him to anyone looking for any kind of cosmetic surgery. My experience was entirely positive. 
6372 4 Fantastic, I've ate here twice this week, had fried chicken, Mac and cheese and turnip greens one day and ox tails, fried green tomatoes, collards and uptown tea (sweet tea and lemonade) today and it was all fantastic 
6373 3 Pros: good food, ambiance, huge selection of beers and specialty drinks, pleasant wait staff, and a decent selection for vegetarians Cons: situated in a horribly designed parking lot. getting in and out is not fun. food's probably unhealthy. 
6374 3 Very reasonably priced. Modest/non-pretentious clientelle. Quality is on par with other pho restaurants. Location is a bit sketchy. Go during the day to avoid street scum. 
6375 3 Went for dinner over the weekend the atmosphere was great! The food was good and the wait staff was friendly and on top of things. 
6376 4 GREAT customer service. I had my vacuum serviced and it works good as new. Very happy. 
6377 4 We try to go here whenever we go to the cinema. Friendly staff and clean facilities. The expansion is nice. 
6378 4 The food and the atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect for a date night or just a casual hangout! The servers are awesome, super nice! :) 
6379 4 Finally an Indian dinner buffet at dinnertime! Excellent choice of food selection. I'm so thrilled Chana masala is included and even veggie samosas. The Tandori chicken is well seasoned. My friends and I will definitely return! 
6380 4 First time split prime rib and added shrimp and still ended up taking home doggie bag, make sure you ask for bread salad better than the average side salad, friendly staff 
6381 4 Probably one of the best Chinese restaurants you'll find on this side of Orlando. I've quickly become a regular, and have no complaints. Delicious! And the staff is very kind :) 
6382 4 Amazing!! Of course it is expensive, so only go for special occasions. The filet steak was the best I have ever had... And the crab cakes!! 
6383 3 Spicy Hawaiian Pizza - Delicious new taste, friendly stuff, good experience. Spicy Hawaiian Pizza - Delicious new taste, friendly stuff, good experience 
6384 1 This place has been taken over by bros. It's a real meh or miss. The Security is also a real buzz kill, you're telling me people can smoke their cancer sticks in the smoke area but not vapes? 
6385 2 Food was ok, maybe a little bit pricey, not bad though. Service was good. This place was a little boring and I don't think I'll be back. 
6386 4 Best pizza ive had in massachusetts so far. Have been touring for a few weeks. Warm, welcoming interior and staff, comfortable older fashioned styling. ...but PLEASE ditch all the screens, Santarpios! TV should not be forced on anybody. 
6387 4 I love a good rum and coke and some of the best chicken wings EVER!!! Fun atmosphere with a huge patio, dog park, and arcade. 
6388 4 They have $1 PBRs after 9pm. Does the food really matter at that point? The fact that it's good is just icing on the cake. I think everyone's covered the food already. Service is attentive and friendly. 
6389 2 Medina feels cozy and has good service. I'd say it's a good place to take your mom, but my mom isn't the type of lady who appreciates hour-long line ups and paying a premium for mediocrity. What's with the hype? 
6390 4 Wait, that was two miles? I didn't even feel the burn! The loveliest view during the first days of sun after the rainy season, with glimpses over the river to Vancouver and St. Helens. 
6391 4 We came in here just walking by looking for something different. We were a little skeptical because of the size but was blown away! The food was amazing and the drinks were delicious!! I would definitely be coming back. 
6392 4 The best Vietnamese place around, the stir fried noodles, and vegetables, are heavenly. It's nice quiet and great for relaxing with friends the staff is kind and explained some of the more unique items definitely worth a stop. 
6393 0 This place sucks.....super attitude from server staff...but food or service can't back it up!!! 
6394 2 Disappointed. Nothing spectacular. The guy at the register was very nice though. Went on a thursday at 11am. No line at all. Make sure to bring cash!!! 
6395 3 Great coffee, yummy passion fruit cream puff! 
6396 2 Diamond Tailors is ok, but not spectacular. Good tailoring, but expensive and long wait times. 
6397 2 Pros : Sea bass was amazing Nice selection of wines to choose from. Cons : Inattentive service, poorly mixed cocktails, disappointing poke and sashimi Overall: Too expensive for an average experience 
6398 4 Good prices, get u done in a reasonable time, take appts or walk ins, great products, awesome work on nails. 
6399 0 Are you kidding me ??? this drive-through looks like it's an abandoned old town ...you pull up there's no menu you get to the window and you're sitting there for 10 minutes to wait for a personal pan pizza ....now I have to go walk inside unbelievable 
6400 3 Dropped my I phone and the screen shattered! Took it into iTech on Burnett and had it back withing an hour. Saved me from having to buy a new phone! My daughter was able to find a 3GS case there for under $10.00. This place worked for me. 
6401 4 Top cuts, means top service, top clean, top people. Thank you guys all of you and specially you Khaled 
6402 2 Asked for spicy, got a totally bland Tikka Masala Paneer..... 
6403 3 Convenient location. Not the best part of town but not shady. They are friendly and you can't beat the prices. I've taken many a pet and rescued stray to them and have never had any problems. 
6404 4 I have been seeing Piper at European Wax Center for 4 years - she does an EXCELLENT eyebrow wax and I highly recommend her! You may also refer a friend for a credit to your account a a free wax for them! 
6405 4 This is awesome ice cream. You should stop whatever you're currently doing (E.g. quit reading this Yelp review) and go immediately to Earnest Ice Cream and try it for yourself. Try the salted caramel. It's fantastic. 
6406 4 Courteous, ease of making reservations, convenient shuttle and AWESOME staff 
6407 4 The staff was great. Very patient with my 3 young kids figuring out their orders. I liked the atmosphere, as well as the ice cream. The smell of the fresh waffle cones really made it feel authentic. 
6408 3 Great drinks! The food wasn't anything out of this world, tots where really good. Would highly recommend the adult milkshakes above all. 
6409 2 I tried the plain bagels and the marble ones. Right out of the oven, the plains were tasty, but the marbles were eh. The next day, they were both eh. My boyfriend commented that they tasted like Lenders. I'm still in search of the perfect bagel... 
6410 4 Cindy and Steve are amazing. I will never go anywhere else. My friend brought me here a few times and I was blown away every time. They are so professional and polite. Their facility is gorgeous and immaculate. I have never had such a fantastic experience. 
6411 4 Excellent Chinese, great for late night Garlic shrimp, chicken corn soup and Mongolian beef- awesome flavor 
6412 3 I often come here when I'm craving some bubble tea, wish they had some pudding for their drinks though. 
6413 4 Excellent food. Delicious coffee. Awesome service. Found this placed based on a review and we were glad we did. You won't be disappointed. 
6414 4 Hidden away next to HEB but definitely worth a visit. Everything was bursting with flavor and had a homemade touch. 
6415 4 Papa John's will always beat the competition for me. I saw them making my pie at this location. I love the discounts that keep coming up weekly and you can't beat those never-frozen ingredients. 
6416 4 Amazing screen, sound, and seats. So steep you don't even see the people in front of you. Very good reasonable prices, and with our omsi pass we get 8 tickets includes. Besides cinetopia living room, it is the best around, just not the best titles and times. 
6417 4 Great staff and the food is delicious. It's a great spot for lunch our dinner. Garlic chicken is one of my favorite dishes. 
6418 1 The food was OK but I've definitely had better Dim Sum that was at a more reasonable price. This was the most expensive Dim Sum that we've experienced so far. Service was slow but staff was friendly and pretty funny. 
6419 3 I really like this place. The food is reasonably priced and tastes good. Order the bottomless pancakes or French toast for the best deal. They also offer quite a few healthy, vegetarian items as well. 
6420 4 Exactly what you would expect in Diner fare. Try the homemade corned beef hash!!! Or later on the meatloaf!!!! Friendly staff. Great food. Priced right 
6421 4 It's definitely the best pastry shop in Vancouver. I finally found the real cakes that are authentic from France. 
6422 1 The food is very bland tasting. Had oxtail and it had no seasoning. Ask for a fruit punch and they looked at me like I had 2 heads...What Jamaican restaurant doesn't have fruit punch. 
6423 4 The filet was amazing! Best steak I've ever had, beats California Grille in my opinion. Our servers name was Donald. He was great! Couldn't have asked for a better server or dinner in Disney ! 
6424 3 Fast service this morning! Lots of parking and easy access to the freeway. This location has a drive through, but go inside for faster service. Tea and cheers to all! 
6425 4 Steve, the owner, was at my house to deal with a yellowjacket problem within three hours of my initial call. He was professional, knowledgeable and reasonably priced. 
6426 4 5 stars yes!!!! The place is very nice and beautiful. The room is clean, the bed is comfortable.. The receptionists are gentle, helpful, friendly... The hotel is close of Capilano, Lynn Canyon and easy to take a ferry to go to downtown.. I really recommend this hotel. 
6427 0 I'm sure all of the dishes couldn't be bad. My friend's Vickie's chicken was good; it was the worst veal piccata I've ever had. I deleted my original review, lowering my rating from 2 stars to 1 star for use of fake reviews. http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2011/09/23/cornell-researchers-work-spot-fake-reviews Nuff said. 
6428 4 My favorite bar in Atlanta...probably because I can walk there (and stumble home). Just a great place to chill with some friends (esp. before and after shows @ the Drunken Unicorn) or get some late night food. 
6429 3 Good with repairs. This is the second phone I have had repaired here and the service and price is great. They get backed up in work sometimes and take a while longer, but typically have the repairs done that day. 
6430 3 I loved it! Need to try the pho. I had B6 I believe. Their meat has great flavor. The noodles were cold but it honestly worked. It was wonderful. My friend got an amazing steak and rice entree. So much flavor and yummy sauce. Egg rolls were bomb too. 
6431 4 Alway a great meal here! I often take out of town visitors. It is a small venue but warm and friendly ! 
6432 1 Slow. Waited 30+ minutes. Must still be working out the kinks. Hope the food is worth it. 
6433 2 I was overcharged for my pasta, then refunded the wrong (lesser amount), and I was not offered a free treat for my trouble. It wasn't a big deal or a big amount, but if you're going to put it on the receipt then you should DO IT. Just saying... 
6434 4 They were very skilled, helpful and understanding when we had to do the unenviable task of putting our cat down. I really appreciated the way they handled all the phases - it made a very difficult day easier. Excellent service. 
6435 3 Great little spot in Richmond. Open late, great tea and dessert and wonderful ambiance and decor. Exactly what I was looking for. 
6436 4 OMG is all I can say! The Laffa wrap with chicken shawarma is delicious! The toppings amazing - just bring your appetite because it's huge! Highly recommend! 
6437 4 Huge portions. Chen is running his business into the ground with portions like that. The Angus is fully peppered. I highly recommend the fried angus. 
6438 1 The beef shawarma was pretty dry. Felt like eating rubber. Flavors were decent. Cook needs to take grilling leasons. 
6439 2 this place is authentic Mexican burrito portland style world being snotty obnoxious portland. love these people. they remember who you are and ate super helpful when you don't know what you want. 
6440 3 Nice park with tennis courts and a skate park. I used it for bike trail access, which was handy. Two parking lots, easy access to the river trails. The neighborhood is a little busy, but once you're in the park it's fine. 
6441 4 I can't believe there were no reviews for this place?! How could people forget about Brigham's?! Raspberry Lime Rickey. Go get it. They have REALLY REALLY good shakes (coffee, or strawberry, or vanilla!) and cone ice cream... dude, so good. Everybody has to go at least once. 
6442 4 All I am going to say is they had me at short ribs and risotto. Amazing food, service, and presentation!! I've been here twice, once just two people, and the other was a group of 9 and everything was just as amazing as the first time. Highly recommend! 
6443 4 Best chicken tenders in town. I ordered the 1 pound chicken tenders with sweet Thai chili sauce, it was awesome. The tender were so juicy but crispy at the same time. The staff were nice and friendly. Definitely will go back to this place again. 
6444 1 Thai Lunch Haiku #1 I ordered Pad Thai, But this tastes like spaghetti! Why use tomatoes?! Thai Lunch Haiku #2 I paid thirteen bucks. Mediocre food-court food. Such disappointment. 
6445 4 Amazing BBQ. Beef ribs and brisket and potato salad are my favorites. Get there early as they run out of meat sometimes at night. Good food. 
6446 3 Lobster nachos were great! And the service was good, not too crowded but the music was really loud. I had to almost scream at my friend while we were talking. Lol 
6447 4 5 stars! Best bike repair ever! Nice non intimidating atmosphere, dropped off my bike at 11 done by 1:30 and for a better price then most others I've been to. No complaints here what so ever I will be back many times in the future but today I ride!! 
6448 4 We thought we'd try something in the neighborhood and the grilled cheese with roasted tomato soup was excellent. The grilled cheese was an adult grilled cheese with Gouda and Swiss on Parmesan crusted bread. Massive flavor in my mouth. Don't let the exterior fool you! Worth a visit 
6449 3 Cheap and cheerful hearty fresh Mexican fare via counter service by always friendly young staff. Miss the one that used to be in my 'hood (W 4th at Burrard). It was replaced by a pot dispensary. A better business model would be to have both. ;-) 
6450 1 Not a good place to see a movie. I actually had to tell someone to start the movie after it was already 20 minutes late starting to begin with. 
6451 4 Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Austin. My favorite dish is the egg noodle soup ordered dry. The combination of the buttery noodles with the fresh basil and sprouts is absolutely delicious. The banh mi are solid. The spring rolls are fantastic. Everything is very consistent. I love Pho Van. 
6452 0 the worst food i've ever eaten. how do they stay in business???? probably because they are in west roxbury, and people here don't know good restaurants........ greasy food that all looks/tastes the same. the egg rolls are filled with soft mush, horrible!!!! don't waste your time/money....... 
6453 4 Five star rating is due to going well above and beyond service wise. The food is good for the price and the overall atmosphere is actually really nice. Happy hour is also pretty phenomenal with really good deals. 
6454 4 They took me in totally last minute and fixed my serious case of unibrow. The gentleman at the counter was very sweet and helpful. Tran shaped my brows and did a fabulous job! If I lived in Austin I would go there for my brows. 
6455 2 Order out and get it delivered, the food and the bar are awful. Staff is nice, rooms are ok. Relatively close to the airport. Nothing nearby to walk to. 
6456 4 I love the high level of training for the most part. Friendly staff, awsome coaches, variety of classes, convenience, great training partners, etc... I love this gym! 
6457 4 Just bought the Yuzu Lemon and mango and they are so delicious. She even packed them with little ice packs so they didn't melt on the hot day. I'll be back again!!! 
6458 3 Fantastic service! It's a tad on the expensive side... especially if you're just popping in for lunch... but the food is truly excellent. 
6459 4 This is my favorite sandwich shop- never disappointed. Teriyaki chicken all the way! The Bexley store is my favorite in Columbus. 
6460 1 I ordered Primetime which cost around $13 with the hope to eat something great. The burger was very small and the meat did not have any special taste. I think it is fine but Not Worth the money that you pay 
6461 4 Very authentic chichen bites, really good. The pork rice is huge, definitely enough for a big meal. Pork belly bun is interesting, not like any other pork belly buns I had before, sweet and tasty, but personally speaking, it is a little big too fat for me. 
6462 4 Coffee, staff, ambiance - they got it all right. I went there on two different days, both times it was busy but nevertheless great. Even their regular coffee is good. I'm a strict coffee critic, so 5 stars means really good. 
6463 4 The nitro cold brew is excellent & the staff are always extremely friendly. Great coffee & pastry shop! 
6464 3 This coffee shop isn't as chic and dim lit as the coffee shops I'm used to in Nashville but they have a great product and a friendly staff...and friendly staffs are hard to come by. 
6465 4 Excelente!!! Pedí que no sea picante, y me enviaron la orden tal como la pedí. La atención impecable. Las fajitas es un plato para compartir, el flan es exquisito. Muchas gracias por la atención 
6466 4 This place is so bomb! I had been regularly getting their food when they had the food cart on 19th and Quimby and I'm so happy they finally opened up a restaurant. The chef is amazing and provides top quality, affordable, consistently good food. Keep up the good work! Cheers. 
6467 4 They offer delicious food at a reasonable price. My husband orders either the Pepper Steak or Dynasty Special Beef with fried rice while I always get the Cashew Chicken with steamed rice. Yum! The dinner portions are so large you can have the rest for lunch the next day. 
6468 2 Nothing really wrong with the pizza. It just wasn't my thing. Generic dough that was slightly undercooked, sauce was too sweet and overwhelming, and cheese was similar to something you might find in a hospital cafeteria. Breaded chicken was good though. 
6469 4 I've been going to see dr Titelbaum for 3 years - so three appointments. Dr t is the only optometrist I've ever been satisfied with. And he is really nice and easy to talk to. Would definitely recommend. 
6470 0 If u want to try falooda don't even Waste your money here ...total waste of money on falooda I would rather buy a gallon of milk and put some rooh afza 
6471 4 At NW 12th and Hoyt. Best Burrito in town. Made by Amy. 
6472 3 Glad I joined. I like having the ability to go to any location. There are 5 locations I switch between depending on the day and classes. 
6473 0 WORST SERVICE EVER!!! The Manager seems like she doesn't know what she was doing, bunch of employees who's still in training, the lady at the front register wasn't approachable, like I swear WAITING FOR 30 minutes for 2 sandwich!!! NOT COMING BACK AT THIS STORE! 
6474 4 Wonderful staff, I was greeted with smiles and welcoming hellos. Ordered the salmon toast and it was to die for. Will definitely be returning. 
6475 0 Terrible business, prices are not always visible if you ask 2 differents persons in the store, you'll get different prices. I 'm in favor to support local businesses but not when they care very little about their customers. 
6476 4 This place is AMAZING!! Best gyros I've ever had and their hummus and pita can't be beat! This is a definite favorite of ours. Once you've tried their gyro, you'll never be able to enjoy one anywhere else! 
6477 4 What a wonderful experience! Vivian helped us pick out the most yummy treat - rocky road sundae with vanilla chocolate swirl. Highly recommend! The most friendly service! 
6478 4 Absolutely trustworthy, affordable, and quick. I have scholiosis and chronic migraines, they know their stuff! 
6479 4 Dr. Harden is the best. I've been going to multiple different chiropractic clinics and Dr. Harden really knows what he's doing. He's attentive and passionate about his work. 
6480 4 Great for a foodie night out, great for groups, great bar area and the food is always good! 
6481 4 Great restaurant for an awesome meal!! Lots of vegetarian options as well as fish and meats. The burrata is top notch - my fav! It has a nice vibe and great service. Definitely check it out! 
6482 4 Grace was wonderful. I paid for the 90min foot and tipped her $20 as she was well worth it. These ladies are great. Be sure to leave a message as they are workinv and will call you back. 
6483 4 I love Munson Farms!! It is a fantastic family owned farm. Highly recommend. 
6484 3 Nice Place,great Food,Awesome Prices,Good Satff. Love it 
6485 4 Sincerely the best pizza I've had on this coast. I was nervous to say this right away so I've made a point to try every other local pizza place and honestly none of them come close. The cheese/sauce ratio and quality is perfection. 
6486 3 Excellent! Clean and friendly. I thought the sushi was really good but I wish their kitchen didn't close so early. 
6487 4 I adore all the employees that work here. Strangely, their manager seems to be the most off-putting. The Scottish breakfast tea is the best!!! 
6488 3 Some of the best Americanos/ french press coffee in Austin. Great, friendly staff. I like it when they leave the front doors open on sunny days. Really uncomfortable chairs, though, so don't plan on a long study session. 
6489 2 Kung Fu Milk tea is ok. Grapefruit green tea didn't really have grapefruit flavor. I checked in to get free topping but was still charged for regular price, so I didn't really get the free topping. Service took a while to get our drinks. 
6490 4 Robin took amazing care of us. Very friendly and personable. I highly recommend coming here. Thank you 
6491 4 My server and service were great. Food was hot and fast. Sever even told us about the specials that occur during the week 
6492 1 Didn't live up to the hype. I was looking forward to this place after reading the reviews but the sandwiches were bland. 
6493 3 Very tasty.big Kebap. Next time I'll try the beef and lamb but e chicken is really good! 
6494 0 Breakfast was so bad my family and I had to go to Dunkin Donuts, wouldn't recommend this hotel 
6495 2 Good appetizers and tastey brick oven pizzas. Definately more of a date place than a girls night out location. Dim lighting and closed quarters cater more to romance than loud gossiping. 
6496 4 Love the food here. This place is truly a hidden little gem in Atlanta. I always come here with friends when I travel to Atlanta and it never disappoints. 
6497 4 John did a diagnostics on my F-150 and invited me to watch during the process. Since it turned out to be a simple issue, he showed me how to address it myself. This shop is seemingly honest and I won't hesitate give them my business. 
6498 4 We decided to tackle a whole kitchen renovation when we went on vacation over the holidays. While this was a stressful endeavor, Inman Park Marble provided top notch service at a really fair price and delivered gorgeous results. I couldn't be more happy with my beautiful quartz countertops! 
6499 4 I ate until I hurt, then I kept eating. I will be back today for lunch. 
6500 4 This place is great. Great European beers on tap and chill vibes. A go-to spot in my hood. 
6501 3 Pasta Vino has been my neighborhood favorite for years. The food, atmosphere, and service are hard to beat for the price and convenience. In addition to the great Italian food, the outdoor seating makes it one of the most popular dinner spots during the summer in Atlanta. 
6502 4 Excellent service. I run my business through this shipping center. Never any problems, always friendly. 
6503 3 We love the food and atmosphere. I would really appreciate it if you could try to adopt more gluten free options. For example using tapioca or coconut flour for the thin breading on some of the specials or regular entrees. 
6504 3 Great location off the highway. Easy to leave and get back on 71. This has been here a lot of years. I have been here many times. Great drink and restroom stop. 1 dollar drinks. Next to Shell gas. Reasonably clean. 
6505 4 Nick from Chimcare was very nice and professional. They did a good job with our chimney and showed up on time. I would recommend their services and use them again. 
6506 4 This place was very delicious and fresh! My husband and I both got quesadilla's and they were amazing! Especially the steak one!The mango Fresca was delicious as well!! I would strongly recommend this to anyone in town! 
6507 4 great food, great service, nice atmosphere, entetaining pianist 
6508 0 Chicken/shrimp Fajitas were a dissapointment (I kid you not they served 3 pieces of grilled chicken and 4 tiny shrimp...) slow service, overpriced. Go to Chili's across the street if in the area. 
6509 0 worst service ever. Inattentive bored staff hang out together instead of serving customers. 
6510 4 Love this location! They have some of the kindest staff and their burgers are absolutely delicious. One of the best burger spots in Vancouver. 
6511 4 Love this place - favorite nail salon in Austin!! The atmosphere is awesome and the staff are all great. Have never had a bad experience here or anything negative to say. 
6512 4 I love this place. Never crowded (come usually on Saturdays) but don't let that fool you. The sushi is always fresh and the rolls are good. I like salmon torched maki. They also do a roll with no rice - it is wrapped in cucumber that is very good. 
6513 3 Great for Sunday brunch! The migas are pretty delicious, but there are a variety of tasty options. Staff is always friendly. 
6514 4 Many good things on the menu. Always have a great meal here. Classy environment and a great place to have a business dinner or romantic night on the town. 
6515 4 Wonderful oysters!! Great drinks. Service was good. Nice view on the water. Be prepared to pay a little more, but it's fresh seafood so it's to be expected! We sat upstairs and had a nice breeze and view! 
6516 4 OMG. A doughnut...topped with fried chicken, topped with a potato pancake, smothered with creamed corn and sprinkled with candied jalapeños. What?! Amazing. Too full from lunch to partake in the sweet doughnut options, so we took the pudding to go and were not disappointed. Even more decadence. So delish! 
6517 3 I had the BANHMIFUFU and my girlfriend had the Burnside. Both were amazing! We almost didn't let each other taste our sandwiches. Looking forward to going back again! 
6518 4 This is the first place I went when I moved to Austin a year ago and I never went anywhere else! I love their customer service and fixes never take too long! They will drive you to and from home or work which is nice. Recommended! 
6519 4 Fantastic chicken salad sandwich. Soft, warm bread and creamy sauce. Tasty pickle on the side. 
6520 4 Awesome burger bar with a cozy neighborhood feel. Great draft list and very friendly staff. Food is very reasonably priced. Wings are hot and burgers are greasy - what more could you want? 
6521 4 My family and I were driving by and decided to give this place a try. It's a cute little burger joint and look owned restaurant With the mom and the daughter taking orders. the food was great and tasted like home cooling. 
6522 3 Fun place, good beer, food is usually pretty decent, although a bit bland at times. "Ego and the Oracle" performances are not to be missed. 
6523 4 Love this place. Super cute coffee shop in a quiet neighborhood. Nice staff and fast service. I particularly like the chai latte. 
6524 3 It was Friday night at 8 pm. The place was not filled up. The survive was a bit slow but ok. The food was surprisingly good. It is Americanized chinese cuisine, a bit like PFChang. 
6525 4 The Regents team is incredible. Although I couldn't proceed in living there, I can vouch that their staff is INCREDIBLY kind, dedicated and concerned about your experience. They probably have the most attentive leasing team that I've ever seen. 
6526 3 Chorizo burger and Butcher's Cut burgers are good. You have to get the Nutella and Burnt Marshmallow shake. A must have! I plan on going back for sure! 
6527 0 Caliga often ties up dogs while gardening and yells at them like misbehaved children. She does not appear to rigorously exercise the dogs and generally has several dogs in tow. 
6528 4 This place is great!!! Went out for a birthday and we had fun. Great views of the rock cliffs as you paddle out to the island. Also a rope swing if you want to go for a dip. Great rates! 
6529 4 If your looking for the best pork barbacoa burrito/salad in the world, this is it! This place is huge in the Utah/Nevada/Colorado/California markets and worth the risk of trying it out! Get the pork!!! So so good!! 
6530 4 Excellent Thai cusine. Super friendly staff. Delicious food. The best apptizer, soup , and salad bar. I say come bring your family and enjoy. 
6531 2 Stinky place! Not clean. Dosas are ok. Bad service. They are served with chutney and sambhar which is not good on taste here, we ordered idli which was hard not fresh at all. We won't be returning to this place. 
6532 3 They have delicious sweet wine. Doesn't taste alcoholic at all so it's very easy to walk through a bottle. Not too expensive either! I don't drink too much and the staff is a little judge-y if you get drunk off of a wine tasting. 
6533 4 Awesome and tasty place to eat!!! Welcoming staff with such a peachy energy:) 
6534 4 I think I ate the best calzone I ever had in my life hands down! I ordered the wing dings with my order and it was so much food it lasted me a couple days. Greasy? Yes. Artery clogging? Perhaps. But soo worth it. 
6535 4 I love this place when I'm craving pasta. I love that you can completely customize your meal and add all kinds of extras. They are also super fast and have great customer service from what I've experienced so far. 
6536 4 These donuts are so incredibly soft! Wish I came when they were fresh and warm but I still loved both the donuts we tried. cinnamon and sugar was nice and simple. Chocolate ganache and almonds was delicious, the ganache was perfect and not too sweet. 
6537 4 I'm so happy to have found this wonderful store! The selection of fabrics, notions, supplies, etc, for any sewing project was great. However, the very best part was the staff. They were helpful, knowledgeable, friendly, professional but down to earth, simply amazing! 
6538 0 I agree with Tom's review. We all wish Luigi's would come back, but it's not. My hubs and I were hoping this was at least comparable; it's not. It's awful. Don't go here. 
6539 4 Best burgers in town, so worth the wait!! I recommend this place to every tourist that comes through my workplace downtown. 
6540 4 Longing for some Filipino foods, visited this place and oh yeah, was not disappointed. Ordered, paid, ate and loved it!!! :D 
6541 4 I just checked out about an hour ago and thought all should know that not only was the hotel great but the manager on duty Sunday morning was awsome as he went out if his way to visit and make sure our stay had been enjoyable. 
6542 4 Great food and great atmosphere. Stacy was our server and was very attentive and pleasant. Sat by the fire place. Lots of different fish tacos on menu for your liking. Visiting from California 
6543 0 Worst customer service ever at the airport! Promised 30 minutes or less, but sent us to the wrong place and didn't tell us we had to sign in. 66 minutes later and I'm finally on a shuttle--right after I complained. What a coincidence! 
6544 4 Nice music, excellent service, reasonable prices. The staff is super friendly and food is delicious and fairly priced. Potstickers and Mac and cheese were amazing. The bacon jam burger is my favorite. I love this place. You should go! 
6545 0 im from sourthern california. this is NOT boba (the tapioca)!!! its waaaay overcooked, and the tea tastes...bland/lack of taste/whatever :/ no bueno! :( i dont get why it has such high rating... 
6546 4 This Pep Boys has shown me great service each time I've come by. Carmen is extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the products. 
6547 3 This is an excellent Mexican restaurant. The food is amazing. The service is very fast and friendly. Very accommodating server. The place has nice decorations. Probably one of the best places in Lynnfield Market Place. I will be back. 
6548 3 Enjoyed the happy hour menu with a girlfriend. The service was great, food was fresh and flavorful. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes bursts of flavor with a little kick (but the bacon wrapped jalapenos have a hulk of a kick). We will definitely be going back! 
6549 3 Burrito grande is way better than Chipotle, if not as large. Quality over quantity. The tacos are excellent. Get the three plate with one of each: steak, chicken, carnitas. Mexican food of this quality and taste is rare this far north. Go. Today. 
6550 4 Super fast and friendly service! I was in and out in less than 30 mins and they educated me on future care steps for my vehicle. Curtis rocks!! 
6551 2 Food is good, I recommend you split your meal it is massive, coffee is hot, and the staff is friendly. This is the kind of place my Dad would have loved. Nothing worth driving across town for but I wouldn't turn my nose up at this place. 
6552 4 Alexis helped me! Great late night service. I'm right down the road and wanted a late night pizza hut call Dana she was very helpful over the phone. Definitely recommended. A+! 
6553 3 A good alternative to all the New York style wannabe's. Would agree with other reviewers, quality ingredients and great crust. 
6554 4 If you want some real authentic Mexican food come here!!! We had an awesome time and the food was absolutely amazing. I highly recommend 
6555 2 For a cheap and quick snack, T&T has a cafeteria inside their store. With most Asian cuisines available on the menu, it's great if you're in a hurry and just looking for a cheap snack. 
6556 2 Overhyped. The staff is great and friendly. Voodoo offers something different than what you see in your typical doghnut shop, however the actual doughnuts don't blow my mind or anything. Texture and dough is just ok. Definitely a fun experience, but will be looking elsewhere for my go-to doughnut stop! 
6557 4 Very cute California retro-y vibes and good food. Large patio allows one to maneuver a stroller without taking down a bunch of tables like dominos. Everyone is very nice and helpful. 
6558 4 Get the Dim Sum. Very solid dish, and the sushi is very good for Columbus as well. The service can be a little slow, but that's because they are so busy because this is a good Asian spot in Columbus! 
6559 3 I love this place. My faves are the green apple with kale and a bit of greek yogurt I also like the peanut butter and chocolate love smoothie. That one is also my fave : D One of my fave places. I suggest free wifi though. 
6560 4 Excellent food, courteous and very helpful staff! Food is hot, served timely. Willing to engage and correct any issues. First time but not my last. P.S. Garlic paradise is a must try! 
6561 4 Big fan! Classic little italian restaurant in the heart of Watertown. Never too crowded, good ambiance and atmosphere, and beautiful patio out back for when it is warm! I go here at least 2 times a year and am never disappointed. Definitely worth checking out! 
6562 3 First time here. 18 inch pizzas for 9.99 on Monday and Tuesday's. Also tried the Italian trio. Everything was great! 
6563 4 Great bar off the main drag! Love sitting and relaxing with friends. Amazing indoor outdoor space. They offer limited food and an amazing beer selection. Definitely, cannot go wrong here with happy hour or late night! 
6564 4 My wife and I have become regulars at this delightful family owned brunch gem. Keep your breakfast orders simple and you will never be disappointed. (Note: stay away from the corn beefed hash. It comes in a can) They don't take reservations so get there early and avoid the line. 
6565 4 Absolutely always love coming here. Tab can rack up fast but always love my movie experiences here anyway. The Moscow mules are incredible. I've had the goat cheese salad a few times and wow!!!! The fresh baked cookies will never disappoint you. Looking forward to returning :) 
6566 2 Great spot to grab a beer, and a steak on Wednesday nights 
6567 4 Best Chinese food around here! Tastes very fresh and not greasy! I had it delivered which did take about an hour and a half... But the food was hot when I got it so I'm assuming they are just busy tonight! Overall 5 stars for sure! Absolutely delicious!!!! 
6568 3 Mediocre food. Occasionally a great bartender, but on those off nights its awful service. Depending on what you order it could be delicious or awful. I love the veggies and noodles, but refuse to order meat here. All in All, A great place for drinks if Holly is your bartender. 
6569 4 This place is incredible if your looking for microbrews from around the Northwest. Arlene, the owner, is super knowledgeable and worth the trip just to learn about beers from her. 
6570 4 If you need to get tinting done. This is the places to go. I got all my vehicles done there. The staff is professional. I would recommend this shop to anyone. 
6571 3 Very hearty breakfasts, and always quick and friendly service. I eagerly await the return of the bear claw french toast -- it might have exceeded my recommended caloric intake for an entire day, but holy cow was it good. 
6572 3 A good selection of sushi, not many other options. Sushi prepared within sight and very good. Very clean, looks very appealing and has a nice atmosphere. Staff is attentive. Conveniently located next to he Boylston station and Emerson dorms. 
6573 4 Good food, good ambient, and very unique design. I liked it and will go back for sure. Too bad it's not open on Sundays. 
6574 4 Great service, Great food, Great drinks, Great atmosphere, and such great friends opps forgot to takes pics of the food and drinks. The southern and grilled fish tacos are a winner along with the sangrita. I can't believe how long I've passed by this place and never tried the restaurant. 
6575 4 Great neighborhood bar. Yummy food and the staff are very friendly. Lots of TVs for watching the sports sport sports. Love LW! 
6576 0 This place sucks. It's gross cheap fast food that is over priced for sure! Idk why but as a kid I remember this place being better than it is now. The quality isn't there anymore and we won't be back here ever. 
6577 3 I'm no BBQ expert, but I have enjoyed the ribs and perhaps its noteworthy that they Buffalo Chicken Fingers are very good. Nice big pieces of chicken in a hotter than average sauce. Good service and self serve drink station. Use the Gemini Parkway exit to get here quicker. 
6578 1 I would rate this hotel a 7.... Between a motel 6 and a Super 8. Staff struggled to answer simple questions. No hot water. 
6579 4 A great burger served by super staff. I ordered the Tavern burger medium well and it came out perfect. The waitress was personable and professional "Yao" made me feel welcome and important. They were super busy yet unruffled by the number of patrons who came in for lunch... 
6580 3 There are so many great spots to visit near by. We loved he old town rustic vibe of the spot and were able to grab a seat as well! 
6581 4 It was all delicious! The roof top terrace was great. Service was awesome. And the food. Tried several dishes in the limited rooftop menu and it was amazing! 
6582 4 I'm very happy with the end result. They do a great job within a reasonable time frame (you can sit there while they work) and at a reasonable price. Side note: The place is a little tricky to find (not visible from the main street). 
6583 3 Quaint atmosphere, very good food. A good place to take the family. 
6584 3 Best chow mien & orange chicken this side of portland just beware some entrées have more onions than meat great little place inside rose city food park. 
6585 3 Hotel is nice but small. Smaller rooms and gym than most other Kimptons I have visited. Staff was welcoming and location is good. Able to walk to the North End or the Garden with ease. 
6586 2 Pretty typical New American fare. Nothing mind blowing, but decent. A bit over priced for what you are getting. You can definitely find better restaurants in town with more innovative food choices at the same price point or cheaper. Staff and servers were very professional. 
6587 4 This is a Chinese restaurant and it is authentic when comparing with other restaurants. The dry pot was tasty and the soymilk was worth trying. 
6588 3 Great neighborhood dive bar with 16 rotating taps. Has liquor and food too. In the evening you can even get sushi. Love the beer selection and being able to get a tasting tray. Southern style food that is pretty good. 
6589 2 Sat in the window- very pretty and a lovely place to be. Food was reasonable. Not good, not bad. There are probably better Italian restaurants around. Service was so so. All round, I would probably go back, not not necessarily the first place I would on my return to Boston. 
6590 4 Downtown-level experience out in the stix. Professional mgmt and staff. Ive had $500 of meals so far and only one bun on a vennison burger was a bit stale. All the appetizers are fresh. Hot. Not outta a box. 
6591 3 Chicken and Waffles. Good value. Fried chicken very good! One of to beat we have had. Parking early on a Sunday morning was no problem. Good coffee. We will be back! 
6592 0 I am not going to comment on the food as there are a bunch of cheats. Bill was $251.xx, I added tip to make it $290. They charged me $306 themselves making the tip more than 20%. Had to call up the bank to dispute the additional $16. 
6593 0 service was very slow we waited 20 minutes for two beers ended up paying and leaving after one drink then went to Ricks Cafe Walked in and it was busy still got a drink right away. love this place it is going to be our new hang out 
6594 3 Delicious and fresh sushi. The tofu appetizer is so good and served in a warm broth. Must try their dragon eye maki 
6595 4 Quaint warm atmosphere, great service and very fine food! It is our favorite restaurant. 
6596 4 Had a fabulous dinner there and always enjoy brunch. I have never had a bad meal there and love their attention to flavor and detail. 
6597 3 Warm, friendly place for a quick or sit down breakfast. Egg steamers are great and coffee is sooooo good. Will def. go back to try banana bread or crabapple pie. 
6598 1 Great food but the cashiers are very condescending! I have encountered several ladies who treat us very unprofessionally. Overall it is a friendly place but I hope training be provided to its personnel. 
6599 4 I drive across town to bring my ferrets to Dr. Ramsell. The office is clean and the staff is friendly and genuine. I also think the prices are quite reasonable. This is one vet where I don't feel I'm being lied to get more money and I really appreciate that. 
6600 0 Bar tender had an attitude from hell. Sheesh I guess it ruined her day that I asked about drink specials and too see a menu smh..... definitely not returning sheesh feel the unwelcome smh byeeee 
6601 4 I had an organic strawberry milkshake that was ridiculously delicious. It didn't take too long to come out either. Cost was $6. 
6602 3 I don't live here, but every time I have gone to visit friends -- it is exceptional. Clean, well mannered personnel. You can't really complain... if you can afford the rent. 
6603 0 I called to move forward with purchasing my leased vehicle. I have since then left a voicemail with a finance employee and have yet to receive a return phone call. 
6604 4 Great service at this location! Came in tonight and placed a take out order at the bar. Bar tender and then manager were very helpful! Food is also very tasty. 
6605 4 The office staff is extremely friendly and they take their time getting to know what you need. Dr. Kjar is so sweet and really helped me relieve some neck stiffness. I received a great massage before the adjustment and felt great the entire day. I highly recommend this office. 
6606 3 Very good and the menu is basic literally the only decision you make is the size! (And you can also have them leave out something). The sauce is yummy and makes the whole bowl. 
6607 4 We are super excited to find this gem near our neighborhood. Excellent food and service. We split the whole fried fish and it was exceptional. Our kids were pleased with the chicken lo mein. 
6608 3 Classy place to stay at! Esp to those who have a history with this place ;) 
6609 2 Ok selection, awesome bakery and decent hot bar. Can be very low on their inventory sometimes and they don't have all the goodies that the WF on Ponce has. The parking lot can be tricky and people have road rage while entering & exiting. 
6610 1 Took my kids here for dinner on a Saturday. For 4 people our bill was about 170 before tip. I got one drink and so did my husband. Our dinner entrees we're about $25 each and one appetizer. I didn't think the food was any difference from Apple bees. 
6611 4 Wonderful Greek spot! Definitely worth the try. We'll be back. The hummus and street corn was delicious!! Lots of veggies and good options all around. 10/10 recommend. Staff was friendly and made the whole experience that much better. 
6612 4 I loveeeeee NYPD pizza. The meat lovers is really good but I would recommend getting ham instead of pepperoni. 
6613 2 Absolutely Loved Seaworld. Never managed to get on any of the rides - son too little - but that's okay as we really enjoyed all the shows. The Killer Whales were breathtaking. It was worth it just for that! 
6614 4 This is our go to place for proper hummus. The gyros are great and the pizzas are delicious. I recommend everything on the menu. The staff is friendly and the environment is comfortable and pretty. It's a nice cozy dinner spot to get your Mediterranean fixes satisfied. 
6615 1 The place is ok. But nothing special. The lady could not speak any English and I couldn't understand a word she said. Pretty frustrating. Not coming back. 
6616 3 Always stocks the stuff we need - in the store on a daily basis. Friendly checkers. 
6617 0 For $7 to get in the door including adults than more money to ride some of the few things they have skip it and go to Leeds farm. 
6618 4 Great lunch place, the enchiladas rancheras was delicious, the tortilla was crisp and not mushy with the enchilada sauce, guacamole was fresh with flavors of cilantro and lime. I had their pineapple water, a great compliment to the meal. Highly recommended if you like quick and delicious authentic Mexican 
6619 4 Yes yes yes. These folks know their tea and coffee. And boy is it delicious. Very helpful and informed if you're uncertain or wish to try something new. 
6620 4 Seriously, the best bubble tea in Vancouver! Fresh fruits and great specials all the time! Thumbs up UP! 
6621 4 I love this store. Christmas is everywhere. I love bringing home an ornament when i visit disney and this is where i go to get it. They deliver so you dont have to take it home in your bag ! 
6622 2 Good portion size, not too pricey. The smoothies are a great way to finish off a meal. The cuban is a solid choice and the chicken soup is great. The tres leches dessert was very good! 
6623 4 Love the outdoor patio with lawn games! Great local food with their home grown veggies from the garden! 
6624 3 Three words: blueberry rhubarb pie. It was epic. I figured it could have been a mistake, so I went back for more. This time I had a Peg Leg (ginger ale, rum, lime, etc.) and chocolate cream pie. That was epic, too. Highly recommended. 
6625 2 I've only had the sushi here for quick lunch orders and I've been pleasantly surprised with their sushi. My favorite is the Philly roll made with smoked salmon, cucumbers, mayo and I think avocado. Really good, and very refreshing. Definitely a must try. 
6626 4 Had a large group for a gender reveal party. They were very accommodating! Food was wonderful as always!! 
6627 4 Great customer service and the complimentary drink doesn't hurt! Sonia was awesome and did an amazing job. Will definitely be visiting her sooon!! Excellent experience 
6628 4 Fantastic coffee! You can tell they take their coffee and tea seriously. So excited to have a real cafe a few blocks away! 
6629 1 I dont get it. Always packed. Never had a meal there better than 'meh'. Nice deck, though. 
6630 4 Always great haircuts. A lot of barbershops have opened and closed in town and none were ever any good. Supercuts and those other chains give very bad haircuts in comparison. If you're looking for a clean cut look, this is the place to go. 
6631 3 The Green Chile Pork is not very good, or at least it is not as good as it sounds, but I have really enjoyed everything else I have tried. Torchy's is going to make me fat(ter) someday. 
6632 4 Owner and family greet you by name. That's a nice touch that you don't get at many places these days. Always friendly, great quality and service. They do minor alterations also. Quick in/out every time. They even waited late for me one night! 
6633 3 I haven't been in some time and I thought to give it another try and it was worth it. Menu needs help and the decor but the food,chips and salsa and yes the margaritas were outstanding. I will be back 
6634 4 Awesome doctor. I've been seeing her for years. Personable, caring and thorough. I've sent a couple of friends to you and all have been very happy. 
6635 3 Awesome food, quick service, polite, very clean had the chicken enchiladas excellent. Tomato basil to die for. 
6636 2 It's breakfast. Service wasn't great but it beats making breakfast at home when you want to get out. 
6637 2 best kobideh kebob ive ever had.. but other than that rest of the food is mediocre.. get coupon off of restaurant.com if you'd like to try it.. does have live Spanish music performers 2x a month which is pretty cool.. 
6638 4 This mall is cool simply because no one really goes there,very nice,quiet and it has thee essential stores and the food court I'd cool,movie theater on the top floor is awesome....on Tuesdays movies are $7.00 
6639 3 Not bad for a pub.The donnelly group fixed this place up well and continued to let it fit well into gastown. I went to this place with a friend and we had a lot of budweiser.The bartenders were cool as well as the doormen.I would recommend this place for sure 
6640 3 I went on a Wednesday morning just for a trim and thought the ladies were nice and friendly. The wait wasn't long at all, and the shop was very clean! Good prices, too! Your receipt even comes with a two dollar off coupon for your next visit! 
6641 3 Too preppy for some. I say they have classic patterns that doesn't die fast. The clothes are plain and clean looking (I guess the "in thing" nowadays are dirty and filthy smelling clothes. The price is moderate and merchandise is calmer than your regular school/street brand. 
6642 3 Amazing selection of wines along with tons of menu options. Excellent ambience for a date night with great music and wonderful plates to choose from. They have healthy options as well as pasta, pizza and more! We did the cheese fondue and it was amazing. 
6643 4 I've been coming to angel for over a year and I wouldn't go anywhere else. Their work is very high quality and they're the friendliest spa in town. I highly recommend them!! 
6644 4 I loved it there, big open atmosphere, great tables, good selection of games and minis and the cashier was very nice. I plan to return often even though it's a little further away. 
6645 4 It's too good. The shrimp is very juice and sweet. The clams are big and fresh. The way of eating it all is unusual, buts it's fun. Definitely good place to have a bros night out or family occasion. 
6646 4 We love Engine House! Best wings in Salem by far. We got delivery from them every time. Always fast and always hot. Great menu items. I recommend anything Buffalo. Their sauce is superb. 
6647 4 I have been dining here for 10 years and this place is the best sushi in Austin. Try chirishis fire or the hottie Susan. Can't wait to come back! 
6648 4 Caliber Collision did a fantastic job on the auto body work. I couldn't have been more pleased! 
6649 3 Wom Kim's peach pudding bread. Don't skip this dessert. It's a little piece of heaven. 
6650 4 For quality pink and white acrylics, make an appointment with Ken. He does amazing work and is meticulous about every detail. Additionally, the salon is very clean and they welcome you with a beverage upon entering. 
6651 4 The best salt and pepper shrimp I have ever had in my life ! Me and my family loved this place do much :) 
6652 2 Four stars for the area they are new and are kind of slow and unorganized but the cuban empanada was great the guava and cheese pastrys were terrible however. 
6653 4 The slider is so juicy its like cotton candy........................ SO GOOD this food is great try it and rate it 
6654 4 Outstanding congee and superb customer service (which is sometimes rare in Chinese restaurants). Will revisit n recommend it to friends. The stir fried carrot cake with xo sauce is pretty good. 
6655 4 Melissa Caci and her team are always readily available to everyone whether it is the borrower, the agent, the attorney or anyone's assistance. This goes to show that they will do whatever they can within their power to get the loan closed and moving along expeditiously. 
6656 3 Awesome place, had a great Johnny Cash cover band trio on a weeknight that I dropped by. Good draft selection in Irish setting. 
6657 4 Great nail spa, very friendly clean and great talented people! Did mani and pedi and it looks perfect! Highly recommend it and will go back net time I'm in town! 
6658 3 I took my iPhone 3G to iTech Electronics to fix my shattered screen. It was done quickly and looks like new again. 
6659 4 I have been coming here for the almost 3 years and have never had a bad experience! I see Ilana and think she is awesome! and I have never had a problem with any of the receptionist or anyone else. I LOVE everything about this place!!! 
6660 2 Nothing at all wrong with this place. The server is a salty woman with an attitude and a great sense of humor. Pretty darn good pizza; crust is nice and thin and crispy. I love their Gyros! Sunday football is a great excuse to show up. 
6661 4 Almond horns should be illegal. Love this place. 
6662 3 Such a cute store!! Lots of stationary items and cute plushies as well :) I haven't bought anything from this store though, as it is a little pricey, but I will definitely come back again to buy something later! Great store for gifts and it is very clean 
6663 2 A very average restaurant whose only merit is that it has a nice view by the wharf. There is nothing special about the food here. 
6664 2 Over-prices drinks, limited parking, they keep the humidor locked and the cigars have no prices. As we were leaving a few Atlanta rappers came in. 
6665 3 Love there smoothes and crepes, the crepes are a little tuff to cut, but still good, also love there iced coffee too 
6666 4 This is one of three locations! I absolutely love their coffee and their staff is always friendly. Parking can be difficult during peak hours though! 
6667 3 Very good boba and thai food. The crispy chicken was excellence. I got the Chiang Mai noodles which was fantastic. Get it with the crispy chicken. 
6668 4 Great experience. We had a private room for an event. All the food was great but the land and Sirloin for the best. The lobster bisque was amazing. Overall good time making food but yes expensive 
6669 4 So, the service was excellent, and when we had a parked car. When the concierge mistakenly told us that we pay upon exit, and we got fined for it, Jeff from the front desk actually took the ticket and said they will deal with it for us :D 
6670 4 The food, the atmosphere and the staff was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. 100% authentic Mexican food. My family and friends would come back. 
6671 4 Pizza Hut is great! You get huge pizzas for your money, and the service is very quick and friendly. The breadsticks as a starter are delicious, and you get huge drinks. We were seated very quickly, and our food was delivered so quickly. A great meal. 
6672 4 Top notch office. Last minute medical issue appointment - fit me in the next day. Friendly service. 
6673 4 Cute and cozy little cafe. Staff are super friendly and cute. Matcha mochi is a must try. And they open late which a huge plus! 
6674 3 Phenomenal desserts. Sausage buffet is very good although the wait can be long. Their German potato salad is second only to my mothers. The cream puffs are legendary, huge and amazing 
6675 3 Berry Berry berry me Every lick chock-full of berry seeds Subtly sweet on fine white dusting Oh please please berry me 
6676 2 Good quick pho place. House special beef pho #7 was quite flavourful. The salad roll is solid. Bun Bo Hue was decent, broth not too spicy. Parking in the area is a bit tough if the back parking lot is full. 
6677 4 Awesome! Best burger in town. Flip and Yeah "Whatever" don't even compare; and please don't even bring Five Guys into the conversation. Grass Fed Beef! Hello people? 
6678 3 Karaoke Friday and Saturday. Free pool on Sunday. Taco Tuesday's. Typical dive bar. The bartender's are nice. 
6679 0 Awful service.. slow!.. couldn't get refills like asked.. feel we were ignored! Won't go back to this location.. Garlic butter fries were dry 
6680 4 We've been to a few shared kitchens and this one --hands down--is the best. Manon (the owner) has a great, positive personality which is reflected in the kitchen. Highly recommended! 
6681 4 This place is amazing. Homemade everything. Ravioli and pesto we're probably the best I've ever had. This place is definitely worthy of a stop if you're near Zilker. 
6682 4 Had there chips and guacamole and it was so good! Will be back to try something else soon! 
6683 4 The service from Steven was excellent!!! The food was spectular! We will definitely be back to try different things on the menu and some more sushi! 
6684 4 Great experienced therapists. No Massage Envy trainees here. Sage gave a 90 minute therapeutic massage that would rock your socks off. 
6685 3 This is our go to spot for Italian. Meals are consistently prepared, service is always quick and friendly. I'd give five stars if the wine list was a little more extensive. Make reservations just to be safe. 
6686 4 One of the best places for cookware I have ever been to for sure. Has everything you could imagine! 
6687 3 The turkey burgers are great and the krispy cream milkshake is to die for. 
6688 4 The cachapa was outstanding. I ordered with the pork. Couldn't get it in my mouth fast enough. If I had any room left I would have ordered another. 
6689 3 Always enjoy Thai Orchid! The food is great, service is timely and prices are reasonable. Sometimes there can be a wait for a table which if you live in the 'cove is not something your use to doing :) 
6690 3 I had a Boston bowl, decent portion, didn't exceed $10. I can see it getting old really fast since there's not that many food options. However, it's a laid back atmosphere and not bad if you're in the mood for Mac and cheese, crispy chicken, and red roasted potatoes. 
6691 1 1.25 for specialty tacos 1.00 for regular tacos who can honestly beat that kinda price Pro: Good tacos with a balance of spice and flavour and known for there tortas for a good reason Con: Leaves you with an upset stomach 
6692 3 Free beer with an app, you can't beat that. Napolitano pizza was a nice thin crust. We got the Margherita. Kids Alfredo pasta was alright. Beer was nice and cold. Very good service. 
6693 2 It's okay. Could be seasoned more or at less have seasoning that has Flavor to it. I wouldn't return. The service is excellent! But the food is not that good. 
6694 3 Better than expected food...loved the ginormous pretzel with really good mustard! Waitress...Tiffany...was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the beer selection. Also nice because the place is huge, so we had no wait time even on a Friday night! 
6695 3 Love this place. Fun backyard area. Their veggie tacos are delish! 
6696 4 Loved our first experience at Fresh Baked! Quick and friendly service and got some great bubble hash from a very nice gentleman from Georgia. Will be back again soon! 
6697 3 Great service. Mo was awesome with recommendations and gave real feedback. Prices were decent and there was a large selection of designer frames. Would totally recommend this place. 
6698 3 Been here twice. Both times had amazing (5 star) food. The first time around I had some delicious sushi and the second time I had the stir-fry oxtopus that was out of this world! Service been average both times. Will totally be back for some more of the yummy food! 
6699 2 Love the bread and oil. Food is okay - but $12 for an ahi tuna salad, when every other salad is $10 or less? Doesn't make sense. Good service when were there. 
6700 2 Typical sports bar with lots of TVs, beer choices, and tons of unhealthy junk food. They're good at what they do, and my beer was never empty. 
6701 4 Can't go wrong with this place. Taylor is an excellent barber, always satisfied with the results. Walk-ins only, I suggest going during the day rather than around 5pm to avoid waiting. 
6702 4 I love this place. They have some of the best bagels. So fresh and fluffy. The cream cheese spread options are great. I love love love the salmon spread. I have literally just eaten it plain because it's so good. Always really clean and the staff is friendly 
6703 4 Amazing homemade corn tortillas and fantastic salsa. I asked the owner Flavia for her recommendation and tried the carnitas tacos. So flavorful and tender. Delicious!! 
6704 4 I will say the wings and their homemade buffalo sauce rival any wing chain out there. Wings were great and the sauce was awesome! 
6705 4 Eat here! I had a Moscow mule (delicious) and chicken and dumplings (amazing). The bartender/waiter was very nice, checked on us regularly, and was genuinely humble as we have him multiple compliments. We will be back with friends next time!! 
6706 3 The Blue Ribbon Grill has been in Tucker for nearly 30 years. I usually come here for lunch and get the meat loaf that is the best meat loaf I have aten outside my home. Great staff, reasonable prices too 
6707 1 Plus side: quick service, big portions, chunks of veggies. Minus side: very little taste, "spicy" dishes very very mild, oiliness. I really want to like this little place, but just can't enjoy the food. It all tastes bland. 
6708 4 Wow! Glen did it again. He has mastered Asian eats. Particularly Vietnamese. I was pleasantly surprised to see one of my favorite chefs in Austin creating wonderous mouth waterworks. I will be coming here for lunch often. Thank you again Glen! 
6709 1 Didn't really feel the NBA themed decor is a good fit. Came here late night for their iced dessert. Price point is high at $13 for one shaved ice. Taste was good but not amazing. Overall value for money rating is low for me. 
6710 3 2 floors, one chill, one not. Good variety of music and drinks. No cover on Fridays makes it even better. Always have a good time when I go. The bathroom does get a little wet... just be prepared! 
6711 3 Food is delicious, fresh and fairly priced. Service is mostly mediocre to good. Ambiance is cool and the water view is refreshing on a hot summer day. Location is wicked convenient if you work in the Financial District so the crowd is a mixture of casual tourists and finance professionals. 
6712 4 Great food in a great place.they have the best food i have ever had.awesome cheesy fries. 
6713 3 A fantastic find, the food and ambiance are charming and tasteful and complemented by a large selection of teas and coffees. The shokshokeh/shakshuka - fried tomatoes and eggs over rice - was delicious and I am sure the other food items will be, too. Great place to study or brunch! 
6714 2 Ordered crawfish & cajun shrimp and the the food was not bad nor great, it would have been a little better if it wasn't salty. The service is also average. It is a hole in the wall with average food. 
6715 3 Fast service, food served at the right temperature, order filled accurately. That's all a fast food restaurant needs to be successful. This one hit all three for the most part. My wife's fresco taco had some strands of cheese in it, but otherwise a perfect visit. 
6716 1 Their staff at the Portland airport was rude to me. Overall have had decent experiences with Alaska, though. 
6717 1 They have a lot of options to choose from. The inside is nice and roomy. The food is not that good nor does the food seem fresh. I wouldn't come back. 
6718 4 I love this place. The have really good food, great service, and amazing specials. If you ever get the chance, try the fig German pancake. It was one of the best things that I have ever eaten! 
6719 3 Im sooooooooooooo excited to get these adorable rompers in that I just ordered. What a find!! I will do a follow up once I get them in and check them out.. Too excited not to post! 
6720 4 This place is so yummy and the owner and staff are all amazing! We've had birthday parties here and always enjoyed every meal! There's belly dancers and hooks and a great ambiance. So cute! 
6721 1 Food took an hour and a half. They were out of pineapple. Pizza was cold. No real explanation offered, except traffic, you know. Food was awful, even for Pizza Hut. Skip it, order somewhere else. 
6722 4 If you go here, ask for Scott V. He sized my husband's watch yesterday and was by far the best service experience we have encountered in our numerous trips to Ben Bridge. I will continue coming to Scott in the future, he is a gem. 
6723 4 Used to get CnR Guys at the truck during lunch when I worked near Copley, now I try to go to the Medford location when I'm working close to the Boston area. Simple, great tasting food. 
6724 3 Wonderfully, fresh cuisine. Crisp flavors. Friendly, efficient staff. Will certainly be back. 
6725 1 The wings were soggy, as repeated in countless previous reviews. They did however fix my order quickly. I got the Thai chili 8 piece... The wings are a good size but not steroid injected! 
6726 4 I just moved from California,tried a few places but nothing was like Gastro Mania.Great food! The best mediterranian food in town! Alex is great, everything is on point! Porchetta is my favourite...if you go there, definitely try it!! 
6727 4 went last night and had the fried chicken special and the pork schnitzel. my wife and I enjoyed our meals very much. 
6728 0 AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!! They call you once every 2 weeks trying to get you to come in for some service. Their billing department is atrocious. They send you bills months later with absolutely no explanation on them. Avoid this place like the plague. 
6729 3 Old school bowling + cheap drinks in small pastic cups = fun This place looks straight out of the 1970's and has a lot of charm, they even have an arcade room which hardly exist anywhere anymore. 
6730 3 After my less than fantastic visit the first time, the other couple time's that I've been here have been relatively painless. The counter staff is a lot nicer than the check in desk staff. Virtually no wait in lines, moves really fast even when busy. Always a lot of staff. 
6731 3 Wonderful pastry with delicious fillings! A lot of new flavour combos too... Nummy! This is like the pies my auntie used to make with cooked fruit fillings! U can take a trip down memory lane with some of these delightfully old-fashioned fillings... We'll be back! 
6732 4 My favorite restaurant in Atlanta. EVERYTHING IS GOOD. AWAZE SAUCE The Tibs are the best... Fish, Rice, and Potatoes. Side of Greens, Pita Bread or Injera. You can't lose. Eating out on the Patio enhances the whole experience. 
6733 4 I have been visiting this location since opening day and never had a complaint. They have quick friendly service and the food is always the correct temperature and delicious. Maybe that's why there is always a line here no matter what time of the day you come. 
6734 4 Incredibly tasty food, amazing service, great environment, and a super entertaining (and beautiful and talented)belly dancer = perfect dining experience. Highly recommend it! 
6735 4 Friendly, knowledgable staff, reasonable prices and a great selection of track/fixie components. 
6736 2 I went here for a party on a Tuesday night. The food was good. Drinks were ok. Atmosphere was very nice. But the customer service is lack luster at best. They should consider switching up the management because the employees are pretty terrible. 
6737 4 This charming bakery conveniently location on Rt 40 in West Jefferson has THE best sugar cookies. Not only are they beautifully packaged they are so yummy! I buy extras to give as gifts. They cakes are amazing too. 
6738 4 This place is awesome! They don't take reservations but they do allow you to call ahead and get on a list the day you visit. The lobster bisque is to die for! The tuna sashimi is super yummy! The mussels come in three varieties and they are great! 
6739 4 I always get a lovely food here, this is like one of my favorite restaurants. Food is great and so as service. A tip for slice lovers, get ur any meat by asking your server to spice it up and adding shiro to it. 
6740 0 Just went to get my acrylic nails off. She used a fake nail to pry (rip) them off. When she slipped and cut my finger I walked out. I will be going to Bling nails from now on. 
6741 3 Glad to see it hasn't changed since I last lived in the area. It's halfway between a good Americanized place and an Americanized good Taiwanese place. It's more authentic than the detractors say, so shut up. If they have the "Chinese sausage" special, get it. Cash only. Love Central Square. 
6742 4 Francisco and Canceco are amazing sushi chefs! The sushi was so fresh just out of this world! 
6743 3 I'll rate this place 4 stars. Been a few times but, never really been overly impressed by anything here. 
6744 3 Knowledgeable and very helpful staff. Good prices. Uninventive name. Nondescript storefront. 
6745 3 Whenever we have guests or family flying in or out of PDX, we ALWAYS find a way to have lunch or dinner at Stanford's and have never been disappointed. Food, service and ambiance all come together to provide a wonderful dining experience (as opposed to "just eating")!!! 
6746 4 Jordan was our wedding coordinator. He is incredible! The wedding was beautiful. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect experience. It was truly magical! 
6747 4 Love this place. I've ordered out and dined in and haven't been disappointed yet. The sushi is delicious and the tempura cheesecake is a killer. 
6748 3 I took my brother and his niece here for lunch. The staff was great. Food was excellent. The ever changing view of the harbor worth the trip. Raw Oysters, fried clams, chowder flights, special Italian sandwich all perfect. We will return for late afternoon cocktails. Give them a try. 
6749 4 This is my second visit to Flip, the first at this location. The burgers remain great and the fries are amazing! It's not the healthiest I'm sure, but for a treat be nice to yourself and enjoy! 
6750 3 This place is great! It is a little British oriented import shop. My friend Jim just introduced me to a soda called 'Irn-Bru' that is available there. They have drinks, candies, gifts and some frozen food. 
6751 4 Incredible in all ways, right down to the house-brewed iced tea! Prices are a little steep if you're not used to high-quality ingredients in your Chinese food, but, the flavors and presentation justify it. Highly recommend the Nasi Goreng! Still dreamin about it! 
6752 0 This is not a Barnes & Noble!! Tiny!! It is a GA Tech bookstore w/ a very small B&N attached. Terrible. 
6753 1 MEH! Over-hyped and over-reviewed. My BLAND meal wasn't worth the effort. 
6754 1 I had dinner here during their grand opening, so perhaps things have changed since then. The food tasted like it came from the grocery store, and they did not serve alcohol, or beer and wine, so it's not good for a date night. 
6755 3 Great decor, awesome vibe and amazing service. Sushi is terrible though... The rest of the menu is great though - opt for one of their bbq items and get sushi at a real sushi bar. 
6756 4 Great food, waitresses were sweet. Fast and efficient service yet still friendly. Food was awesome! My boyfriend learned to love sushi! 
6757 4 Great customer service. Screwed up our table, free round of drinks. Good food. Chicken tacos are amazing. Corn off the cob is tasty. Good desserts. Nice bar. Cheap drinks 
6758 4 The beer was outstanding and their ribs literally fall off the bone. I ended up using a fork for a lot of it. Highly recommend this place 
6759 0 Worst service ever.... Last minute cancellation multiple times!! And now they are trying to charge me $150 for cancelling a service they aren't providing. 
6760 4 I came for the music. I was so far from disappointed. The performer was a fabulous singer as well as an entertainer. The fish and chips were good and the service great as well. 
6761 4 This place has awesome food. Great for vegetarians. I've had the falafel, veg kebbe, hummus, babaghanoush. Everything is yummy. Their salads are fresh and relish. Get the house salad dressing! The staff are very nice and friendly. I highly recommend this place! 
6762 4 So so delicious. We got the breakfast tacos and the migas and both were very flavorful, even without the salsas! Waited less than 10 minutes for our food. I would definitely recommend this spot to any one looking for breakfast tacos in the area! 
6763 2 Tons of beer, decent wings compared to Buffalo standards, plenty of tv's, decent food otherwise. One question...why $6.00 for a pint of Guiness?? 
6764 0 The last time I ordered the pad thai I felt gross afterword. I think I am done with this place. I would rather eat the stale crackers in my pantry. 
6765 4 Delicious. I'm not a big fan of this type of food, but this place may have just changed my mind. They are friendly, accommodating to special requests, and the prices can't be beaten. Go and support this local business! Get the udon and the dumplings! 
6766 0 We had multiple bad experiences with this vet. They truly don't care about what is best for you or your pet 
6767 3 Great pizza and appetizers... Nice full bar and lots of TV's. I've also ordered online, their site is kinda weird but it works. 
6768 1 Was so hoping for Indian food, was very disappointed. Drinks are half ice, no wonder they offer free refills. 
6769 3 Great food, great margaritas. Good for family outings or out with friends. Loud atmosphere. Great location! 
6770 2 Sat at the bar. Tamala not exactly good at multitasking. Tends to have too many distractions. 
6771 4 Fabulous people and wonderful service. They created the flowers for a wedding this weekend and they were beautiful! 
6772 3 Love the Bogey!! Muirfield landmark!! Volleyball leagues, food, drinks, great patio and great banquet room. Menu is better than most bars and also have good live music 
6773 0 Worst service ever. the restaurant owners will yell at their customers. their food is incredibly mediocre. used to come here out of convinencw, but after getting yelled at by The owner will never come back 
6774 4 My favorite place for dinner in Malden. The food is really delicious (highlights: buffalo chicken grilled cheese, fish tacos, burgers of course) and obviously beer selection is great. The staff and owners are really personable and make you feel welcome. Great destination for a casual weeknight dinner. 
6775 2 Awesome set up to watch the game. More than enough tvs. I didnt like the food too much, but good to go watch the game if you cant get in the park. 
6776 3 Best Irish pub south of Boston. While there make sure you order the steak tips or shepherds pie. You will not be disappointed. 
6777 1 Just sat at the bar at Bonchon for 10 minutes with employees checking out the first aid kit...no service...chicken is awesome but is clear why the place is empty. 
6778 4 Recommended to this shop because of my friend Kaci, and simply ordered online, went in, and picked up. Quick and clean with no wait or hassle! 
6779 4 Awesome Indian weekday buffet! Only 9 bucks and discount if you are a UT student! Had so much great curry and naan it was hard to move lol. Chicken is tender and juicy. Soup is impressive, as well as the naan. Ambience modern and comfy. Overall great experience! 
6780 4 Consistently great job. If you get the deluxe pedi and mani, you get a neck and shoulder massage. Cannot beat this place for nails. 
6781 3 Definitely worth a visit. They have a large selection of items in their shop. We took the tour on the oversized 4x4. Josh, the driver / tour guide kept things interesting. Would recommended doing this if you want a change of pace from the hustle and bustle of Disney. 
6782 3 Good little semi-private course. Looks like they're pouring some money into the irrigation drainage issues that have plagued the back side for awhile. Front side has no problem with drainage. Nothing too difficult about the course but it can be a challenge if you're not a straight hitter. 
6783 3 Pizza is pretty good, Roast beef is nice - nice medium rare. Fries are great and so are the wings. Steak and chees is great. Primo's is a solid place for your typical sub shop/ pizza shop fair. Highly recommended. 
6784 4 Delicious pizza! Inexpensive too! Just moved to the area and already got this twice! Definitely going to be coming back here. The cheese is the best though, nothing beats it! 
6785 4 Great pizza at a reasonable price. Try the Sicilian with extras sauce on the thin crust. Awesome! 
6786 3 Saus is our new spot. We love their fries and waffles!! Definitely a place to try and worth driving. The girls were also very friendly. Love the atmosphere :). Thanks for great food and excellent service. Will be back again. I've already told our family and friends. 
6787 3 So good that our son chose TB to cater his wedding. If I lived in Austin I'd require an intervention to keep me away. Sides are very good. The brisket and beef ribs are indescribably good. Not to be missed. 
6788 4 Here checking it out for the first time. We are always in the area so looking to get a very well aged steak. 
6789 4 The best breakfast tacos everrrrr!!! 
6790 4 BHOP is convenient, yummy, and the customer service is more than 5 stars. It is my favorite greek salad, and the business owners are very kind! 
6791 3 The atmosphere is really fun! I like the chairs and booths. Recently priced food. I got the steak ranchers! Love the red sauce! 
6792 3 Good service. Friendly staff. Tasty menu. Moderately priced. I had a solid experience! #FirstVisit 
6793 3 Loved the Sun-dried tomato rub with BBQ sauce on the wings. Total dive bar with great wings and a great craft beer selection. 
6794 4 honestly, i love this place. the service could be better, but the ambiance is great, especially for a date, and especially a dinner date in the winter. their pizzas are great, their martinis are great... in the summer, the outdoor seating is great.. go go! 
6795 4 It is my favorite place to work and have lunch simultaneously, but if u want to get the best service for lunch u should go there around 11. 11-2 is the most crazy time of the day and u may not be able to find a place to sit. 
6796 3 At first, I was sketchy about the pho in Texas, because there aren't many Vietnamese who live in Texas. I was totally wrong and there are many great Vietnamese restaurants in Austin. This is probably the best one in town. Although the wait is a bit crazy, worth it. 
6797 4 My new go to place for Mexican. So close to home and such good food. I'm addicted to their enchiladas. 
6798 2 Service was ok. Mixed drinks lacked alcohol. The food as good but I thought there should have been slightly more food with each meal. I'd try a different hibachi before coming back to this one... 
6799 4 Beautiful atmosphere but bad service. No one ever came to take our order... So we helped ourselves. It ended up being a good buffet but the atmosphere made everything we found to eat taste better and we soon forgot that there was no service. Very delicious. 
6800 3 I love this place and come here all the time. The chicken is amazing, but I wish they had more delicious and healthy sides to go with the chicken. 
6801 4 After a 11 month hiatus due to an stupid car accident it's so nice to be able to crawl back to boot camp. Even working a slower and less intense level I am still getting amazing results. I also love the new trainer Molly and the expanding schedule! 
6802 4 This is where I go when I need a sweet and filling lunch. I've been there a number of times and focused my sights on the Signature Sandwich + Lilikoi Ice Tea. Brilliant combo and the sugar rush gets me through the day! 
6803 3 Pizza was really good, the environment was really dope! Good music and good people! Would even be a great place to take the kids out to! 
6804 4 Love this place....family friendly- nice people ...and fun. Snack bar full bar and game room. 
6805 2 Pretty good semi-fast food. It brings me back to my childhood. We ordered Kobe burger dinner and curry pork. 
6806 3 It's Shopper's. It's kind of understaffed, but it has all the Shopper's-y stuff you need, except bus tickets. 
6807 2 Not bad, but nothing exceptional. I'm going to try other Indian places before I think about going back here. The lunch buffet had a lot of good options and the naan bread is never ending. I enjoyed it. 
6808 4 Great Mole I usually save my mole order for Manuel's but this place is fantastic. Great flavor with a little heat. 
6809 4 Best food on the Hilltop. We order here several times a month and everything is hot and tasty. Pizza, burgers, fries, chix wings chix dinner,etc. LOVE this place! I have had better lasagna, but it was still tasty. 
6810 4 This place is fantastic! Great, simple but delicious and honest food - reasonably priced. Awesome sauces, cold Costa Rican beer, nice people working there and quick service. Going back again today! 
6811 4 Awesome food nice mix of music very good atmosphere I do recommend a visit at least once oppaaaaaaa 
6812 0 Worst experience Food came in late and was cold when it came. Least responsive staff. Ordered sauce for fries and waiter disappeared. Not coming to this location here 
6813 4 A great cozy interesting shop with terrific gifts for everyone!!! Men especially!! Finally a place to find cool stuff for Dudes Really nice folks own and run it! Don't miss their second spot at Legacy Place in Dedham!!!! Happy holidays 
6814 3 The food came quick and was super tasty I do wish our waiter was around more He kept disappearing and I had to wait over 10 mins for a refill I appreciate the chips and salsa and bean dip as appetizers Super delicious. Overall very good place ! 
6815 4 I always love stoping by this place, you won't be disappointed with the food or the service!!! I always get the M&M one its so worth it!!! Definitely recommend!! 
6816 4 Teri was our server. 7-28-15, 6:30pm. She was awesome, give her a raise. Great personality, prompt and professional service. Good burgers too. 
6817 3 Tapas are food but entrees are kinda greasy. Highly recommended foraged mushroom and grilled outopus. They make really good sauce. 
6818 4 Great meal! Highly recommend the sangria. The polenta from the tapas menu was amazing. Very cute location in North Boulder. 
6819 3 My go to for cakes! The cakes are light and fluffy. Not dry and the frosting isn't overly sweet. Very reasonably priced as well. 
6820 4 Haven't actually been to the clinic but in regards to experience I had with the answering system, my call with the receptionist (Wilma) was extremely efficient. I was on hold for less than 2 minutes. No BS conversation. Very informative. Felt taken care of. 
6821 0 Probably the worst meatball sub I ever had. Meatballs seemed like they were previously frozen, very dense, very spicy, and inedible. Had to throw away. Haven't had their pizza in several months, but recall thinking it was average at best. 
6822 3 Lamb is great the salad bar is excellent but you can fill your self just on the salad bar. 
6823 4 Best Mexican food in Atlanta and great service! Love the fresh, thin chips and hot salsa! I have been coming here regularly since they opened and everything is consistently good 
6824 2 accept AMEX 
6825 4 Had the Godfather pizza on whole wheat. It was amazing, lots of toppings, and the crust is the perfect thickness and not too doughy. May be a little more expensive than Dominos but soooo much better. Also got it delivered and took about 45 minutes like they told me. 
6826 2 Still love coming here, one of the nicer Asian restos in DT, even a touch of higher end modern decor. But still think their Richmond locations are better. Ordered the ma po tofu, still good but a tad light on the flavour. Good service. Thumbs down on credit card minimum. 
6827 4 Delicious! Absolutely the best atmosphere and even better food. We live in South Carolina and will come back to Atlanta just to visit. 
6828 4 One of my favorite restaurants in the Pac-Northwest. Located inside a house. Awesome menus. Great home cooking feel. Lovely wine pairings. I love the duck! 
6829 4 Great cheap and cheerful lunch spot. I love being able to load veggies of my choice. Good range of choices. Nice staff too. 
6830 3 The view is fantastic. Food is ok. But the service and ambiance are what it is all about here. Where else can you do cardio and then relax for lunch right after? 
6831 2 The sandwiches here are pretty good. However, since I now live in Boston, and have tried Sam Degrassa's, I can only give this place 3 stars. It's definitely a place to go if you are in Southie, and I would recommend, but it's not amazing, like Sam Degrassa's. 
6832 3 This is a hidden gem! It's not the most conveniently located close to the Y, but so cute and clean when you get in. The rolls are fun to watch prepped on the live TV. I highly recommend the "Lake Austin". It's delectable! 
6833 4 Awesome! Great Lobster Rolls. Kirby the owner is passionate about his food and a super nice guy. Recommended! 
6834 0 Saturday before noon counters were clean and only one flavor donut left. The maple bacon. Grabbed from the tray under the counter. Nothing special and over priced. A swarm of people walked in after me and walked right back out or bought coffee. Disappointment 
6835 4 Sorry to say I actually have no experience as a patron of BSF...this review is for the RABBITS IN THE WINDOW only. Cute. Very cute. Five stars. 
6836 4 Tiramasu... Tiramasu... Tiramasu... You want to buy Dave B. lots of Tiramasu.... Boulangerie is a very welcome addition to the neighbourhood. Sorry Sweet Success, you just weren't sweet enough. 
6837 3 What a great find. We were headed to True Food. Traffic was so bad and we couldn't find parking so decided to stop by Crate-n- Barrel. We checked the menu and decided to give it a try. Best decision ever. I can't wait to return 
6838 4 The maple bacon was our favorite. Unique atmosphere and definitely better than Voodoo doughnuts! 
6839 1 Picturesque but not my style. Food is good but I think it is a little over-priced if you consider how they serve it and the location. A good place if you like an informal atmosphere to eat typical New England food. 
6840 4 Great food with good service. One time is never enough to try all the dishes. I have been to KOI almost twice a week. Good environment as well. Strongly recommend. Very convenient to park as well. 
6841 4 Went out to Solaro for a tasting and had a great time. Really intelligent staff and great atmosphere! Definitely worth checking out. Planning on going back again. 
6842 4 Treated my little pup perfectly. Excellent service both in person and on the phone. I'll be back with Bruschi!! 
6843 4 Amazing wood fired oven pizza with great roasted veggie sides. Modern atmosphere, bright and open dining area. Fast service due to intense heat of oven. We enjoyed the mushroom, smoked cheese + truffle oil pizza with a side of roasted carrots. Vegetarian options. Great service. 
6844 3 Kids review: I liked they ketchup. It was good! It feels you up. Pickles were good. The burgers are delicious...and the fries are good. Kids are brutally honest. Hope this helps...I did sneak a bite while they weren't looking. They were good! 
6845 4 I'm usually very particular and I think Tara's work is fantastic. I've been coming to Tara for over a year now and she always far exceeds my expectations. I would recommend her work to any of my friends or family. 
6846 3 The Dim Sum is really good. Make sure to arrive early to beat the crowds. One more thing, the hot oil looks scary but is quite tasteful. 
6847 3 Great place to grab a coffee and a book and relax. 
6848 4 Absolutely amazing! 1st Tapas experience was blown away by amazing food and an amazing waitress! 
6849 3 Pineapple fried rice was so good! My kids really liked it. Red dragon roll was also great. But steak and chicken combination was so so. 
6850 1 The tea is good, but the operation is so slow. The wait time is unbelievable. It's like they can do only 1 drink per 5 minutes. So disappointed. 
6851 3 Smashing decor, great jams, and they serve Pimm's! Any place that can make me a Pimm's drink, the perfect summer beverage, is A-OK in my book. 
6852 4 I am very impressed with my stylist Kendra, she seemed very knowledgeable about natural hair. She did a quick consultation with me and then a hair test. I will definitely return 
6853 3 Newish Crepe place that opened up. They serve more than crepes, however, just came for a basic sugar crepe which was actually really good and decent. There is some seating inside, however, I had it to go to continue on with my walk. Good prices and customer service. 
6854 3 Nice atmosphere, beautiful view of the marina and their caramel cake is a must try. So delicious! 
6855 4 I loved going here! Everyone was so sweet and the service was great! One of the best pedicures I've had in a while! I will definitely be visiting them again. You should make an appointment to get the best service. :) 
6856 4 Love this place. Super friendly and knowledgeable proprietors and an amazing, well priced selection of unique wines that you won't find anywhere else. Totally worth stopping by if you're in the neighborhood, or making it a destination for the free tastings on Friday. 
6857 2 Small shop near The Law Courts and Sheraton Wall Centre, clean, neat with good service and free WiFi. Food was normal standard. My son had Tiger Prawn Udon - Shrimp, broccoli, udon in broth without onions, garlic, or soy sauce as we specified. Tasty enough to return again. 
6858 4 Best gyro in Boston bar none!!! Their spinach pie and lamb chili are the best I have ever had! The service is unmatched anywhere and quick. 
6859 4 Had to get Mexican on my trip to Texas and Corazon did not disappoint. The Chicken Enchiladas Suizas is probably the best I've ever had. Very delicious chicken with a complex blend of flavors (cillantro, yes!). Their tequila (margaritas!!) menu is pretty nice too! 
6860 2 Very good restaurant, but I felt like it was a bit pricey. I don't mind paying for a good meal but with all the options in the area, I don't think I'll be going back. 
6861 0 Order was filed up, no silverware or napkins into our room,this was supposed to be room service. They then made promises to make up for the lousy service, which they did not keep. Never again. Decent food, lousy service. 
6862 4 The BEST food cart in Portland. No contest. Fish tacos with the biggest helpings. Tastiest and freshest stuff you can imagine. And super awesome owner and employees. Feel like your best buds with them after ordering. Ahi tuni and rockfish are both delicious. Yay for the BEST! 
6863 4 Had the Mac and cheese, a mixed up burger w/bacon & siracha mayo, and the Italian fries.....OMGOODNESS!!!!! Everything was excellent!! So was the service!! The lady at the corner was super friendly, very helpful and knew her burgers! DEFINITELY coming back! 
6864 0 Customer service so bad. New staff very impolite very rude. The young lady and manager they didn't help anything. 
6865 0 This location is going downhill fast. Arrived about 6:30 tonight. We were the only customers inside. Lots of servers milling about, but none came to our table even after we sat there nearly 10 minutes. Finally walked out and ate elsewhere. 
6866 3 Certainly unexpected flavors. Everything fresh and seemed healthy. The filet mignon tibs where excellent. Not a fan of the spongy bread though not their flaw as my opposition is to the flavor of the bread, the sourness is not my cup of tea. 
6867 1 Two words...well five. :) Jackalope Casino El Camino Both have better burgers and you don't have to wait in a line full of tourists. This place is overrated. 
6868 3 This place is great, portions are HUGE, wait is kind of long especially lately and they flatten their bacon which I'm not a big fan of. 
6869 0 Worst Chinese food I've ever had. Never coming here again. The waitress is nice but the food isn't worth the cost and the food tastes stale. 
6870 4 The best sushi burrito in Portland. I've come here numerous times and have not been disappointed once. Everyone I've come across is also very nice. I've had the infamous Sushirrito in SF as well and this place is equally as good, if not better. 
6871 4 This tour was perfect! Our tour guide Jake was a current student, and he was very knowledgeable of the incredible history of Harvard. I would definitely recommend it. Hopefully if you're lucky he will guide your tour as well. #gonoles 
6872 3 Fun little sushi bar in downtown Vancouver. Nothing fancy but was decent food for the price. Somewhat eclectic menu with a variety of rolls and some small plates. The fried octopus balls were fun. Gyoza were good too. Fish was pretty fresh. 
6873 4 My fav Japanese tapa place in Boston! We always get the omusoba and some skewers (chicken tail and chicken skin are my go-tos) and they never disappoint 
6874 2 Nice pub grub and the pizzas are good Its not the culinary experience that will leave you longing for more though. Pub grub at tis best. 
6875 4 Amazing breads and pastries! I have never left here without a tasty goodie! The food is quality and the price is very reasonable. There are always a number of staff ready to help you! Try the cranberry walnut rolls- must have! 
6876 4 I am so satisfied after working with Gwen and Chip! I hired them the week of our wedding, and it was worth every penny. The house looked FABULOUS! They took a seemingly simple stressor off of my plate before our big weekend, and totally eased our minds. 
6877 4 an amazing day out for everyone, Highly recommended. 
6878 4 Amazing. Lavender latte - such a treat. Love this place for lunch or brunch! 
6879 4 What an adorable little spot! Stumbled on this place on a quite afternoon - extensive bottle selection, subtle botanical feel and a flatscreen for games. This place is a hidden gem amongst all the new waterfront construction, will definitely be back! 
6880 2 2 people has boiled lobster which they enjoyed very much. Other person had fish and chips, Very disappointing, Received 3 small pieces of fish with littler flavor and a bunch of fries. Way over priced for the porton that was received. Go for the lobster forget the other food 
6881 4 Great food, fast service, awesome location, and friendly staff. This is one of my go to spots for lunch downtown. The fried ravioli is my favorite item. Plus they have Japanese candy and snacks! The Neighborhood Eatery is a welcome fixture to the downtown Orlando lunch and dinner options. 
6882 3 Had a great time with friends. Three of us had their fresh sashimi special, Vancouver roll, BC roll, kushii oysters, and sake. Highly recommended. 
6883 4 Long lines but easily one of the best burgers in town! 
6884 0 Stopped in for a fruit smoothie. It ended up being a quarter of a very rotten banana and 3 small strawberries. Mix in a ton of ice and syrup and there you go. Nasty. Wouldn't recommend this place. 
6885 4 Big portioned southern cooking as its finest. I'm a vegetarian and there are always options for me. The peach cobbler is terrific as is the sweet tea. You can't go wrong 
6886 4 The donuts really live up to the hype. They're so soft, I wish I could just get some kind of Union Square Donuts loaf of bread. Come early in the day because they can run out of certain flavors. 
6887 4 This was an excellent place to eat! It's cheap and quick and authentic. We really enjoyed it after our last day at Disney! 
6888 3 Great food! Try the pork pastor. Server was amazing at explaining all the options. A little expensive but I would come here again. The tacos r gone in like 3 bites. But you get to try so many. The sauces r great too! 
6889 2 I've been eating here for years. Always been my favorite breakfast spot In town. The past couple times I've had to wait for over a half hour for my breakfast. It's not busy. The restaurant is half empty. I won't be coming back for a while. 
6890 4 Very good food and drinks, reasonably priced. If you're in Boston get on the train and come out to Cambridge. It's worth the effort. Glad we came (a bartender at another restaurant told us about it) and would come again. 
6891 4 This place is great. All their spirits are amazing. The gin is well balanced. Their aquavits are delicious. The vodka is so pure And smoothly. I recommend visiting his relatively new Portland local. 
6892 4 We had our carpets cleaned and Derrick did an AWESOME job! I will never use anybody else. On time! Great customer service! In and out with no mess! Love them!!! 
6893 4 Amazing service and great food. If you're feeling Mexican food I wouldn't go anywhere else in Beaverton. I love surf and turf burritos so she made me one even though it wasn't on the menu. Also don't miss out, get the plantains for dessert! 
6894 4 Pizza was great - Chicago deep dish style deserves comparison to Gino's. Good service good. 
6895 3 Bring water and a hat as change hot. Has nice clean restroom. Dusty so wear closed toed shoes. Fair pricing for u pick. Hot cooked food available. 
6896 4 Haru is my favorite sushi place in the area for delivery. They are consistently quick and the food is always delicious. My favorites are the Dice-K Roll and Kiss of Fire Roll (hot!). 
6897 4 AMAZING!! Went to Il Localino for an early Father's Day dinner and had a fabulous time. The food, service, and atmosphere were Amazing! We will definitely go there again! Great food, great place! 
6898 3 great seafood! crazy busy during halloween time, make sure to make a reservation in advance! 
6899 4 Granted, it's fast food, but I like it and I especially like the staff. One such staff member, I believe her name is Megan, is always enthusiastic and working hard to ensure you get your order. Keep up the good work! 
6900 4 I've ordered delivery multiple times from them and it's always been excellent pastas and quick delivery. 
6901 3 Very authentic Mexican. Some of the best I've had in PDX! The restaurant is clean and the folks there are very friendly. The only negative was the blaring Mexican TV program! 
6902 3 brought our boat trailer in to get inspected--it was missing a light bulb so we had to go to Advance Auto and ended up with a full light assembly--Lambs mechanics put it on (about 25 min of tinkering), approved the trailer, and charged us the $14.95 for the inspection--that's it! 
6903 4 We stooped in for lunch on a typical work day. Good service, great food with some tradition Chinese dishes along with the typical American-Chinese foods. Loved the BBQ and Dumplings. Lunch portions were good sized. Definitely will return. 
6904 3 If you work in the area, then you know that this is the place to go for Mexican food. I personally enjoy getting the taco plate or a burrito. The prices are decent, and you can get lunch for around $5, which is a key price point for me. 
6905 4 I love this place. Everything is fresh and tastes just like home. We order pick up every Saturday morning for breakfast. It's legit. The family that works there is so sweet and friendly. I would highly recommend it for breakfast and lunch. 
6906 3 Very good service! They took great care of me at the sushi bar! The sushi chef even gave me free handroll to try! Chirashi bowl was very good as well!! 
6907 4 If you're looking for a Dentist, Dr. Nussbaum and his team are awesome! Always super friendly, lots of smiles, they get you in and out quickly but still do a thorough job. I highly recommend giving them a try. 
6908 0 I really wish I could actually give a negative star rating for this particular location, we had our holiday party here and the service and staff was mediocre AT BEST! NOT for large gatherings ! 
6909 4 Lovely family owned business.i had a 2 eggs breakfast which was delicious. The best part, they were very careful about my dairy allergy. I will definitely be back. 
6910 4 Love this place! Awesomeness me drinks, live the bean dip and Salas's that come with their Tortilla chips! So good!!! Fajitas are amazing, I don't think I have had anything I haven't liked there. Is def a little pricy though 
6911 2 Not the greatest but it worked. Hopefully they finish their pool soon. Restaraunts and stores close by. I'd stay here again for the price only! 
6912 4 Are they playing soccer on more than two screens? Yes Do you want an entire fish cooked to perfection in your taco? Yes Only fault is the lighting, its romantically weird for lunch alone. 
6913 4 Kiki at Mod Salon is amazing - total perfectionist, lovely, kind and talented! I love my cut and color - she's the real deal highly recommended oh and she gave my 6 year old daughter a perfect cut too 
6914 3 The Spicy Chicken Rigatoni was just that and very tasty. Thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The atmosphere was different and interesting and the Grandview area has a college atmosphere and radiates fun. 
6915 3 Pretty good sushi. Small seating area in the restaurant but you can sit in Roscoes if they are full. Beer menu is from Roscoes which makes it nice because they have a big selection. Definitely good enough to make me come back since the location is convenient. 
6916 1 Great coffee however badly let down by the super slow service as constant errors with orders - I think my last 5 or 6 visits my coffee order has been wrong! 
6917 4 Honestly the best street tacos I've had here since moving from LA. Salsa counter was a great touch. If you gave this place a bad review you belong at La Mariposa or Three Margaritas. 
6918 3 Everything on the menu seemed interesting, so it made choosing a bit tricky. Everything chosen was delicious! The lobster bruschetta is off the charts, the double decker and the spicy tuna on the rocks are all must try's. Great cocktails too! I will definitely be back here! 
6919 0 Super frustrated with this store. Been trying to call them for two days and no one picks up the phone. Tried operator extension and different departments and no luck. I guess they don't want my business or anyone else's.??? 
6920 4 The best stylist at Leeba is Charbel!!! He is really great at what he does. Cuts are incredible, expert colorist and a nice guy. Go to Leeba if only to see Charbel he is the best in Boston. 
6921 4 Recently moved to the area and have been tired of the same places over and over so we found this place and tried it a couple of weeks ago and it did not disappoint. Pizza and fettuccine were our favorites so far! And it's a plus that they deliver!!!! 
6922 4 Very friendly and honest staff. Well organized with a better selection than almost every other Barnes & Noble in the area. A+ selection of vinyl records that anyone can easily find something to fit their personal tastes. My new first Barnes & Noble stop. 
6923 0 Disgusting service, horrible food, not Vegetarian friendly at all. They have no clue of the ingredients they are using, whether a dish has fish sauce or not etc. The owner is very rude and unaccommodating. Do not visit this place. 
6924 2 Friendly shuttle driver, gave good tip on where to gas before returning car. However, they only had one agent for check-in. After a long flight having to wait 40 minutes is frustrating. 
6925 1 Incapable or unwilling to analyze basic tests, Dr. Marroquin has a nervous and furtive manner that doesn't invite confidence. The clinic is a madhouse of activity and inter office communication is lacking. Not recommended. 
6926 4 Had the Tacos and they where great! A little disappointed in the smoked jalapeños. They give you 2 for a side but they are cut in half so didn't seem like a side more like a tease. 
6927 3 Maple bacon donut, brown butter hazelnut crunch donut=heaven. Huge donuts, friendly staff. It all makes me happy. 
6928 0 Service was great! The food is straight trash water, the turkey patty tasted undercooked and was chewy. Sautéed mushrooms looked straight out of a can garlic french fries were pathetic and greasy no good never coming back 
6929 4 Excellent buffet that is well worth the price! The salad bar is updated regularly and the soup choices were vast. There's pasta, pizza and a potato bar! Not to mention soft serve ice cream! The staff was friendly and eager to help. 
6930 0 Bland food, not coming back. Taste like what I ate in college in my dorm room. Head to San Francisco or Jean & Lee Kitchen in Newton. 
6931 4 My wife and I get takeout here at least twice a month. So delicious, all dishes have so much flavour. You must have the "prawn d'piaza". One of the best (probably the best) Indian dishes I've ever had and I LOVE Indian. Fast service on takeout too. Love this place! 
6932 2 Too over priced. Small pizza that was 4 pieces was 13 dollars it was too muck did not even fill me up. Food was good tough. 
6933 4 I went here for brunch yesterday with two friends and the service was amazing and the food was excellent!!! Highly recommend this place! We ordered various items on the brunch menu and also cocktails the server recommended and everything was awesome!!!! Great place! I will be back! 
6934 4 I have ordered directly, or purchased at Hope Farmers Market: 2 King Cakes, Caramels, Nougat, Ribbon Cookies, and various other treats. The flavors, textures, and quality are always second to none. But most important, everything they have is just GOOD! 
6935 4 Love this place! Really nice inside with an insane beer list and yummy food! Great stop. Lots of tvs too for sports people. Oh and pool tables/darts. Go try some new beers. 
6936 3 Madewell is like J.Crew's funky little sister. Fun accessories (scarves, bags, etc.) amazing boots, and fantastic denim. Prices are a little high, but you know the quality is good, and denim is priced less than other high-end brands. 
6937 3 I have always been a Third Base fan, but ever since Buffalo opened, I much prefer to come here. It's bigger with more TV's and a better selection of food and drinks! Yes, it's a little pricier than Pluckers or Third Base, but it's worth it to me. 
6938 2 Not the worst Thai food I've I've tried, but definitely not the best. If you are in Kenmore, and are craving Thai, go for it. But if you're up for a walk, Chili Duck on Boylston is pretty good. 
6939 4 This is one of the best restaurants in all of the Disney parks. The Malaysian Seafood Curry was excellent along with the Chicken & Waffle special they had. Fantastic service and not that long of a wait. 
6940 3 Solid lunch option in NW Austin. Menu has man offerings of fresh salads,soups, flat breads, and pastas. Soup was great Arugula/beet salad was tasty. 
6941 4 Awesome burgers & fries! We had the Hawthrone, pulled pork and the Philly cheese steak sandwiches! everything was fresh and delicious! Service was really good too! I would totally come back!! 
6942 3 Poké was excellent though quite small. chopped salad delicious as was the calamari that we mixed into the chopped salad! Atmosphere is a bit hipper with community high top tables as well as low tops along the windows. Located in the building housing the Hilton! 
6943 4 Man oh man just great service to match the great food. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken is brined and marinated in buttermilk for 48!!!! Sexy sexy chicken lmao. Please see my boy Micheal he was absolutely amazing I visited the Orlando location 
6944 3 I LOVED the sushi here! They have some original creations that are delicious. And the selection is huge. You will feel overwhelmed but so happy and full at the end. Plus, it's not too pricey, especially for sushi. 
6945 3 Fresh Delicious Reasonably priced Well sized portions What else can you say that has not been said? Great place to sit down and grub on some tasty sushi. 
6946 2 Went for a few oysters and couple of drinks. Oysters are at a premium of $3+ each. Higher than downtown Boston. Menu prices very expensive and wonder if worth the cost. Presentation of some dishes being prepared looked quite nice. Friendly oyster bar staff. 
6947 3 OMG! I love this place....by b/f and I decided to check it out one evening and we both absolutely enjoyed their sushi! If you love calamari, GET IT! Their big and plentiful!! 
6948 4 The green front has great prices and awesome bud! Clean and organized. Very friendly and knowledgable staff! I won't go anywhere else! A++ 
6949 4 Renee (Cornelia) was amazing. She showed up early, started work immediately and even stayed a little after our scheduled cleaning to tidy up a bit more. She worked hard, efficiently, and was great with our dog. The house looked and smelled great!! Thank you thank you! 
6950 4 The strongest coffee Ive ever had anywhere in the whole wide World. Holy shit this coffee place is a hidden jem. There is no competition between the coffee shops on PSU. 
6951 3 Great service. The wait staff is always kind and funny. The patio is a great place to sit. I'm a HUGE fan of their margaritas because they're good, large, and well made. And my wife LOVES the chips and salsa. 
6952 4 Staff was super nice and sweat. Drinks were delicious and the place had cute bubble tea designs on the walls. Loved it! 
6953 4 We went there for restaurant week and had an amazing experience. The service was among the best I've ever experienced and the food was also incredible. They were able to accommodate many allergies and food preferences at my table without any problems. 
6954 4 This place was great! The food was amazing and the baklava was the best I've ever had. It was not the most fancy place inside but if you care about great food I would go there. No clue as to why it is not a 5 start overall. 
6955 3 Cute back patio. Tried the truffle fries and it did not disappoint. Went there for some wine and chill atmosphere. 
6956 3 Good food, and nice atmosphere. Chicken tempura was tasty, and the Orange Blossom roll was great. 
6957 3 It is a very nice place. The cookies are wonderful. The staff was so nice and helpful. I just enjoy going here. I will go back again. 
6958 4 The food is consistently good. Generous portions, fresh, and healthy. Where else can you get wild caught salmon at a fast casual restaurant. But the real treasure here is the most excellent customer service by Alex, who operates the front counter! He's engaging, funny and makes us want to return. 
6959 4 Amazing service. Amazing food. My only regret is that I didn't get an entree. We got the tasting menu and it was fabulous but, not enough food and the time between courses was too long. I will be back to try brunch and maybe dinner. 
6960 0 Poor overall, Use to be good. Think I will go to the places up the street. Much better quality and service. Can only blame management, cooks and bartenders. 
6961 3 Bar Taco was really good!! My server I want to say Jermey was AWESOME!! He's definitely a great start to the team. I enjoyed everything that was played in front of me from my tacos, guac, soup, and drink!! I definitely have establish bar taco as regular place I'll visit. 
6962 4 My local go to for a nice variety of pizza and pasta. The pizza is traditional and does not have that fast food feeling. Many great options, even some for vegans! I usually get the Mediterranean pasta or the veggie Stromboli with no cheese. 
6963 4 Chilis has stepped up their game. Great deals, bigger plates, friendly service! And you can pay at the table which is a plus!!! 
6964 4 Great staff, super friendly, and knowledgable about the food. I got the Italian in a wrap, absolutely wonderful. Loved this place and will be coming back. 
6965 3 I must say this place has GREAT FOOD!!! It was definitely a long waiting line but it was well worth it. Looking forward to returning real soon... 
6966 3 Great chips and salsa, and really good margaritas! I had a quesadilla that was decent and the overall atmosphere was cool. 
6967 2 Unfortunately have to downgrade a bit - last visit was pretty disappointing. The macaron had great flavor but was incredibly dry and chewy. The cupcakes were rather disappointing as well (and also dry). 
6968 1 get prepared - he likes to talk. you could be there for up to two hours, most of the time just sitting around waiting for him. he's good for back and leg injuries, but if it's something specific like your foot or your hand, look for another physiotherapist.... 
6969 0 The only thing I recommend would be the shrimp. The crabcakes were small and slimey. Not a lot of flavor. My girlfriend got fried oysters and she loves them, but she couldn't even eat 2. We were decieved by the yelp rating. Not a classy place. 
6970 4 I REALLY hope this location doesn't hurt them. The food here is unbelievable. We came in on a Saturday with no wait. Great service, delicious food, and reasonably priced. You don't see that often in the Atlanta market. I will be coming back over and over!! 
6971 0 I have had their weekdays buffet earlier and it was good. However had a disappointing experience over weekend.. got a boneless chicken biryani and it was definitely stale and not freshly made. the chicken was tasteless and too hard to chew instead of being tender and juicy. 
6972 0 Showed up at 8:55 PM on a Friday. When I tried to open the door it was locked. The two employees looked up to see me but then quickly put their heads back down as if they didn't see me standing there. 
6973 3 I like the environment and ambiance here. Waiter was very helpful. I ordered a drink I didn't like he immediately recommended another one to replace it. Overall it is a good spot to spend a romantic or formal evening with friends. 
6974 3 Dogs. Ping Pong. Hula Hoops. Beer. Booze. House with a big back yard. View of downtown skyline. Yeah, that works. 
6975 3 Lunch is inexpensive and the options come with roll and soup. I always have left overs. 
6976 3 Had Roast Banana & Dark Chocolate($5.00), it was good! My friend had Roast Banana & Bourbon, and bourbon taste light and don't taste/smell much alcohol. We loved the combinations. They make a shake in a Mason Jar, it is thick and delicious also cute :) 
6977 3 Pretty nice place for brunch! The food was good, nothing great. The line can get pretty long tho. It's best to get there early on the weekend. 
6978 4 Love this place! The cream of garlic soup is really good and everything is done with so much Austrian flair, even the way the bacon is cooked. The potato salad too was really good. Highly recommend 
6979 3 Nothing too spectacular, just a local pub on Charles St in Beacon Hill with good brews, good music, and darts. When I was in town this place became my hangout spot for evening fun. 
6980 3 Beautiful and expensive; old look but classy. Try the character buffet, they even do a little show for the audience. 
6981 1 This place is nooooo bueno. I live down the street and am sad to say I can't go back! How can food be super salty and bland at the same time?? 
6982 4 Was looking for a Benjamin Moore paint dealer in the Stoneham area and ended up at Spartan Hardware. Great selection of paint and color chips. Staff was friendly and the store has it's own parking lot right in front of the store. I'll be back. 
6983 3 Service was great (thank you Hody & Flynn!) and the food was okay. Five star service, four star food. Garlic noodles were surprisingly very good! The shrimp and clams were okay... 
6984 4 Five stars simply by the playlist. Non-stop Depeche Mode. Will be back to try this place out soon. 
6985 4 My new favorite spot in South End. Seriously good espresso. Counter Culture Coffee served by Espresso Royale and Thinking Cup alumni. There's a nice and quiet window-filled room in the back so it's a good place to do some work or read a book. 
6986 1 Beautiful setting. Lovely vibe. Amazingly average food. Crazily overpriced. Heady aspirations without soulful execution. 
6987 4 GF pizza. We shared a BBQ chicken with green and red onions. It was delicious. John liked the crust and I liked the BBQ sauce and chicken. Loved that I could get a GT's Kombucha tea for $2.40. 
6988 1 ABIA Airport, 14 people in line, 1 person taking orders, iPads turned around & not in use. Very Slow process but not like anybody has to be anywhere at a certain time. 
6989 1 More of a cantina than restaurant. Place is so loud u need to yell your order to the waitresses. Most patrons are drunk yelling with the mariachi not enough space for people eating let alone two bands playing. The food is very cheap and okay. 
6990 4 Best burritos around town! Excellent customer service... try to eat here whenever I am in town. 
6991 4 AMAZING food and fun brunch cocktails. Atmosphere is very quaint and cute as well. Highly recommend! 
6992 4 I have been coming here since it opened and the pizza is always amazing. It's pretty much my favorite in Austin and I love the chill south Congress vibe. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!! 
6993 4 Went there tonight with a big group of friends. The food and service was impeccable! Would highly highly recommend 
6994 4 I love this place. Me and my mom in law come here before her treatments and really like their food. Soups - usually two kinds Panini's yum Sandwiches Tapioca pudding!! Very reasonably priced too. 
6995 3 I feel like Barista puts Stumptown to shame. I am not much of a coffee drinker but ever since my first visit here it's all I crave. Well done Barista...well done 
6996 2 Servers were attentive. Food was mediocre overall. Gnocchi is really good. Duck was chewy and tasteless. Lobster buns are overrated. Oh the donuts were terrible. They were way too sour. 
6997 4 Good food, good service, nice upscale atmosphere! Portions can be a bit small for the price, but it is worth it! 
6998 4 My monthly dinner group ate here. We always get a number of dishes to share, and every one wowed us. All were creative and flavorful. A hearty pasta dish with sausage was especially good. We loved the desserts too and wish we had left room for more. 
6999 4 I walked away from this tour genuinely surprised at how much I learned. Bobby offers a refreshing take on our founding fathers, defining moments in our nation's history and Boston's landmarks all while hitting up some of Boston's finest pubs. 
7000 2 I'd love to give this place a higher rating but I've been 4-5 times and the staff is clueless. I've waited for service, numerous times passed by our eventual server without acknowledgement. They need a new management team!! 
7001 1 They really need to shut this place down. With ACC Highland open it serves no useful function....except to show how rinky-dink the school 'used' to be. There is no custodial staff actively monitoring the building. So PLEASE remember to bring along your own toilet paper. You've been warned! 
7002 2 Came here on April 16th to fill gas (company truck) at a total of $95.20. Bathroom smelled. 
7003 4 I love the burgers I had (Greek and Magic Shroom) but the winner is definitely the Sea Salt Caramel shake and I don't like caramel! 
7004 4 Definitely worth the wait! My favorite burger in Austin. Their beet is always cold, staff is friendly and burgers and fries are delicious! Magic Shroom, Primetime, Ahi Tuna are my favorites! 
7005 4 This was an excellent meal with beautiful presentation, with very good service. Unexpected for a hotel restaurant. 
7006 4 Lovely peaceful atmosphere, delicious macaroons and a great assortment of teas. A perfect place to spend time on a rainy day. 
7007 4 So delicious. Maple bacon was outrageously good, hazelnut crumb and vanilla bean both fantastic, bourbon caramel least great. Yeah they're expensive, but they're worth it. I don't care about the cultural commentary of other reviewers, just shut up and enjoy the damn donut. *concise is nice* 
7008 4 Awesome sushi and even better service. I have a gluten allergy and they made special sushi rolls just for me. Delicious! So accommodating. 
7009 3 GREAT pizza... possibly the best in town. TERRIBLE service... possibly the worst in town. get the Smokin' Joe's crust. i'm pretty sure they're open 24 hours a day. 
7010 3 Excellent atmosphere, great sweets and coffee. My cup did not smell fresh and went back to get another one. One suggestion will be to keep the tea and coffee cups separate as the coffee cream smell lingers around and does not blend well with teas. 
7011 4 Pretty dang great! I believe it's the best fried chicken in town. I go here pretty often on my lunch break when I work at the Convention Center. 
7012 3 The waitress was extremely nice, the food was great, and hostess was friendly. We had the thin crust veggie pizza which was great. We also ordered a deep dish veggie pizza and mozzarella sticks. The food came out fast and hot. I will definitely come back. 
7013 3 Best wings in the city! Takes a long time for the wings once ordered but well worth the wait. 
7014 3 I had the Fish it was very good. Really liked this place. Our waiter was fun and offered a ton of suggestions. Large menu and a lot of TV's everywhere you look you can find a tv. Great location. 
7015 1 The cost to food quality ratio at this restaurant is poor. Shocking that it's so busy. Will not eat here again. 
7016 4 Had the sweet verde juice and it was amazing. My boyfriend ordered the tropical green smoothie but that one was not as good. Wheat grass shot is served with an orange slice. Prices and quantity are reasonable and you can't beat the freshness! 
7017 4 Fabulous coffee and excellent breakfast tacos. Great outdoor space for eating outside. Service is good. Sometimes there are lots of kids there on the weekend mornings but families have to get coffee as well, no? And the weather! Way to go Cherrywood! 
7018 4 The best mexican food around! Went for my birthday. They are so nice and accommodating 
7019 2 It was too loud to have a conversation in here. The service was slow. The food was delicious but expensive. 
7020 4 OH. MY. GOD. guaranteed the best doughnuts you will eat & they're vegan on top of it. they're not you're typical circle either. these are bigger than your hand, delicious, flaky, puffy, iced goodness. just try it. just do it. 
7021 4 New found gem... Great inerior design, spacious but home feel. Great drinks and service. They totally get the South Austin feel and in harmony with the texture of SoCo 
7022 2 This dollar General is ok for a quick buy if you are needing something quickly! Be sure it get ready to wait in lines because they are always long! 
7023 4 Good variety for vegetarian taco options! Cute and generally chill interior, I love that it is slightly out of the way of Krog Street market because that makes it feel more like an intimate neighborhood spot. Very friendly staff. I wish they were open on Sundays. 
7024 4 Great environment. Very romantic. A little stuffy but nice for a date night out. Amazing food. Pricey. 
7025 4 Best Chinese food I've ever had ! Food was fast and fresh! Absolutely love the teriyaki rice bowl ! Come guys ! You should try it ! 
7026 0 Had a godawful experience here where the sushi was warm, the waiter was an ass, and service sucked for no discernible reason- barely anyone in there. It was bad enough to warrant updating my initial review. That's pretty damn bad. Will not be going back. 
7027 3 Very impressed. Not 5 stars because I feel like the facilities need a little work. However, even though the place looks horrid from the outside, inside is great, packed and full of life. 
7028 1 Not so good and not so much fun. However it was open on Sunday morning which was nice. Cappuccino was the best part but the food and ambiance were the worst. Very boring and many other choices like Mothers or Morningstar. Kind of nerdy. 
7029 3 I don't really like Hotpot, but I can say this place is not bad at all, pretty crowded in the weekend. Plus, I'd recommend beef and salmon 
7030 4 Quite the selection of sweet options! Groovy in store design and fresh baked goods 24/7. 
7031 0 If you are ever looking for a fine establishment where you can find a 10-pack of generic trash bags for over $6, this is where it's at. 
7032 4 Large bowl of pho, yellow noodles for me and rare thin cut steak. Add tons of basil, 3 squirts of fresh lime and 1 squirt of sriracha sauce and i'm in heaven. Yummy Yummy! Can't beat the price, its as good as it gets. 
7033 4 I love Viva! If you want flawless eyebrows look no further Savannah is your girl! 
7034 4 Love the neighborhood bistro. When we come to za c ks...which is once a week. Alyxandra Pendley is our girl. She is the BEST! She takes care of us. 
7035 4 Cool and hip place if you are a gamer...you can even rent board games before you buy them!! Well worth driving into Sellwood for games...Its a must! 
7036 3 It's pricey for donuts, but totally satisfies the late night sweet craving and is definitely worth the experience. 
7037 4 Great food, reasonable price, variety of choices, great service, and comfortable space. 
7038 4 Diane was awesome.She cleaned my kitchen and both bathrooms and they looked a lot better than what they did before!! 
7039 2 Good location to downtown shopping area. It is a big hotel with two towers. Clean and updated room, though there was loud music from outside (not sure on whether there is nearby club) where you can hear the bass inside the room. 
7040 4 Whenever I am on this side of town I always stop by for their buffalo chicken quesadilla|because it is lyfe. I met the manager (Drew?) and he was polite and attentive to my friend and I while we were there. fully recommend 
7041 2 I've used these guys several times. Great service and never a problem. I'm sorry to see that there have been so many negative reviews. 
7042 4 I have been there more than once and wonder why it isn't packed. Great food and nice folks. Check it out! Garlic knots are fabulous. The salads and pasta are very fresh. Good house chianti also. Help it stay open with the new train coming! 
7043 4 I went to Austin for the first time in June and had the pleasure of finding the awesome kitchen at Javelina. The Javelina burger is fantastic, service was great, and they had some interesting drink recipes that we tried and enjoyed. Definitely worth the visit to Rainey St! 
7044 3 Went in yesterday to get new tires and had a great experience. The guy that helped me suggested a similiar tire that had a rebate, saved me 100 bucks! In and out in less than an hour. Great customer service and professionalism (did I spell that right?) 
7045 3 very beautiful and personal collection. unique to boston, gorgeous courtyard 
7046 4 We loved the friendly service and delicious food at Nook. It's a cozy environment. We sat at the bar and got some excellent advice from the bartender on what to do and see around Vancouver. Would definitely recommend 
7047 4 Went Valentine's and it was just perfect. Romantic. Food delicious and beautiful. Service awesome. We will be back. 
7048 2 So so .. food was okay. Service was okay. I wish it had more sazón. Restaurant ambiance was blah. 
7049 4 I'm so glad a friend brought me here! Their food is the BOMB! Finger licking good food. Great prices, awesome tasty foods, fast & friendly service. What else can I ask for?! They've won me over. 
7050 4 Dessert heaven !! Already came here twice this week since we live a couple of blocks away. Their fresh mango slush topped with more mangos is so good. One of the most popular seasonal flavours. 
7051 2 Mixed reviews when I've been here. Eggplant chips are great. Queen of Sandy Springs pizza and red sangria mediocre. Friendly staff but, when my outside tent blew my food over and moved my table in the wind, they acted as if nothing happened. 
7052 0 Why is the shrimp from Thailand? And not local...... :( That should change for such a nice restaurants 
7053 4 Came here tonight with friends, all of us from San Diego. We've been here for the last week, and this is easily the best meal we've had. Service was spot on. Not one thing went wrong. Go here for good food... Simple as that. 
7054 4 Everything was so good fresh. I can't tell you what I liked the best salad garlic shrimp The service was great! Oh don't forget the sangria. Oh yes the bread pudding ok it was the best! 
7055 3 The ingredients are very fresh, but the bread doesn't have a lot of texture. If I'm eating a bread without much texture I'd rather eat a panini-pressed sandwich than a grilled cheese. But it's still cool that you can make your own and experiment with the ingredients. 
7056 3 Good food (tried to mac and cheese, nachos, and wings during happy hour with a group of girls) and great patio space (although can get a bit loud). Moscow mule was pint size which was a bit disappointing.... maybe due to happy hour?! Fun spot, glad it reopened. 
7057 3 Everything was good and the service was excellent and friendly. The place is small and a little loud, but otherwise great. 
7058 4 Sat outside on their patio. Had a flight of wine with there bread basket. Yummy and reasonably priced! Would definitely go back for the good, everything looked great! 
7059 1 Nice rooms but for a big weekend (SEC championship and Falcons game) under staffed and and room service keeps extending the wait time for food. We just cancelled humus and chips because it take so long to cook. 
7060 4 Amazing food, service, and feel. Wasn't a big fan of brunch but that certainly changed after hitting up Catch 122. 
7061 2 Went there for the restaurant week as it was one the most recommended place to try. Food was good, not excellent, and service decent. I guess I was oversold on it. It's a good place, you can have an intimate moment with someone, but not the best restaurant in town. 
7062 4 Tried several desserts that were great. Must try the Greek honey biscuit. Dense, lightly spiced, warm, and melts in your mouth. Not too sweet, just perfect. Almost like a scone but warm and more of a cake like consistency. 
7063 3 restaurant is very, very small- only ONE bathroom. a good place for a date. gets loud but because it's so small, you're more inclined to lean over all the time. food varies- but overall good. mussels were to die for but salmon was not. 
7064 3 Absolutely LOVE BarTaco. There is this sauce they make with cilantro mixed in and let me tell you how amazing it is. I get their fish tacos every time. The staff is professional and clean and the atmosphere is great as well. Definitely recommend! 
7065 3 The banh mi are only $3 and a tasty little treat. The pho is pretty good and you can add a spring roll to a vermicelli bowl for only $1. I've always had friendly service and been really satisfied with the food. 
7066 4 I'm loving this place and its brunch menu. Today was my second time visit, and I have tried Dirty Breakfast, Chorizo Hash, The Catch 122, and Eggs Benedict. They were all CAD$13 and in good portion. I will definitely try out their happy hour and dinner menus! 
7067 4 Jodi is an extremely knowledgeable expert in the lending industry. She exercises great care and diligence throughout the process and is an excellent problem solver. I know when I refer her to my clients that they are working with the best! 
7068 2 I have eaten here several times ... very clean , goid easy parking , above average food , efficient wait staff ... nothin fancy or special ... good for a quick breakfast 
7069 1 Asking thousands over MSRP for a car that is temporarily in short supply is a pretty unacceptable behavior, IMO. Kind of like demand pricing with Uber - it makes sense in a mercenary kind of way, but its not the sort of thing that engenders long-term relationships. 
7070 4 Great little greasy spoon!! Huge portions, great prices, fast, and affordable. 
7071 4 I ordered the cucumber and hummus combination with an order of dolma. Simple but great combination. The cucumbers were lightly seasoned with black pepper and salt and their hummus is absolutely delicious. Dolma was also great! 
7072 4 If your staying in a hotel by the airport and in the mood for Thai that delivers this place is great! 
7073 0 Waited over two hours and never got pizza. Tried calling back and call would not go thru for over 30 minutes. Get pizza elsewhere. 
7074 4 My sweetheart and I really love this place. It's one of our regular spots. Great food, cool art, incredible staff. Tip: do the weekend brunch and order Caribbean French toast. You won't be disappointed. 
7075 1 Very disappointing. Everything is being made from frozen or dried things... Nothing is home made... 
7076 4 Excellent exhibits, great conservation messages, very worth the $30 entrance fee. Favorite exhibits: Jellyfish, Treasures of the BC Coast, Tropics. Much more than just fish here. Sloths, bats, frogs, and other cool terrestrial creatures. 
7077 4 These guys are great. Explained everything that was going on and gave me pricing options and rationale for the different scenarios I could pursue. Finding a trusted mechanic is nearly impossible and I'm happy to have one now. Can't recommend this place any higher. 
7078 4 New to Atlanta and tried this restaurant. Relaxed atmosphere, great service, super helpful with recommendations, and the food came really fast. The sushi rolls were delicious; would definitely come back! 
7079 3 Really great white sangria. Smoked salmon frittata and banana foster French toast are delicious. 
7080 3 Food is good and authentic. Just returned from Vienna, Austria and was missing the café experience. Easy to get to on transit. Like the hole-in-the-wall style of the shop. Would have given 5 stars but found the interior to be culturally jarring. 
7081 4 Great brunch place for weekends! Highly recommend beef pancake, steam soup dumplings, Chinese donuts. 
7082 4 We love Bee Cave Mandola's! Fantastic food and a great environment for families or even date night. The nightly specials as well as the happy hour specials are,our favorites! Also, the entire staff is always happy and helpful. We will continue to support this great business! 
7083 3 Defo great Pizza. This is right across from where I live but I've only been 2 or 3 times. Should go more. They number the pizzas I think 17 was good. Its always busy so be prepared to wait on weekend nights. 
7084 4 My husband and I were visiting during the Boston Marathon this year (he was running it) and were craving pizza. We stopped in to Nunzio's and everyone was friendly and welcoming. We ordered two pizza's which were reasonably priced and tasted great. I would recommend it. 
7085 3 Great Southern style food. The collard greens were awesome! 
7086 4 Always great. The pulled duck sandwich is unique and wonderful good service as well. 
7087 4 Both the food and the service are absolutely outstanding. They were able to cook seafood perfectly, which is almost impossible to find in Austin Texas. I recommend this place to anyone traveling to Austin. 
7088 4 Very yummy. Found this place on the way to Eugene from the airport. Great place to stop and enjoy the Thai culture. Their pad Thai is delicious! Highly recommend!! 
7089 2 Photo Texas was very considerate and refunded my money. 
7090 3 Great place for a quick meal! Decent sushi and they're very generous with their servings of other dishes. Restaurant tends to be a bit on the messy side but the food makes up for it. Love that they have a drive thru for pick up! 
7091 4 This our go to for Chinese food. Friendly quick service. The food is super fresh and always excellent. The Orange Chicken I had tonight was some of the best I've had. 
7092 3 Upscale, elegant atmosphere with excellent service. We did not have time for a full meal but enjoyed an excellent soup and salad. The decor included a really cool and extensive caricature collection. I will definitely go back. 
7093 4 Can't recommend Melissa enough...from my first time home buyer experience to helping us refinance when it made sense financially, she was great! 
7094 3 If you like dive bars, this is a good one to start at. Nothing on the walls, poor lighting, and a sketchy bathroom is all part of the charm of this nice little bar. 
7095 3 Went with my family. Good portions, fair deal. I did not feel the pizza was anything special. I would skip the spaghetti and lasagna. 
7096 4 There's no excuse not to come check it out. At most, it'll take ya 10 minutes to get to the top. I enjoy going early morning on week days. It's a short trail, good view, and not a pain to get in and out of. 
7097 3 Big portions, lots of seating, goods service. Black bear diner is a staple breakfast establishment in Beaverton. Good location. You won't be let down. 
7098 4 Excellent food...I mean EXCELLENT. The butternut squash soup was exceptional, the pork shank was terrific, and the chocolate dessert was fantastic...and they had Chartreuse...of which I availed myself a snifter. If you don't go here for a meal when you're in Columbus, you're missing out. 
7099 0 The lady serving the food at chipotle had a bad atti and made me repeat the Oder several times then she backs annoyed with me very unpleasant meal I asked for double meat it was a tiny bowl n I was hungry 
7100 4 Fast service, great drinks, best Mexican food this side of the border! 
7101 3 Pizza isn't bad. When you're in the livery business and want something to eat that's not from the roach coach or D-dognuts, this is a option. Not much parking near by. I usually will park at a nearby hotel and walk down the street. 
7102 4 This charming, local cafe-diner has high quality food, great service, good sized portions and local charm. It's not somewhere you go for ambiance, but for a quick, solid, high quality meal. It was perfect for our "foodie" family. 
7103 3 Great local hangout to watch RedSox game. TVs on all walls. Sports memorabilia all around. Smoking area outside. People and Bartender friendly! Enjoyed everyone's company. Will try the dining area next time. 
7104 4 This place got me addicted to painting and the history of architecture. It has taken over my coffee table and, in fact, my entire living room. 
7105 4 Fantastic sushi. If you like eel avocado makis have lunch at Shino express. For a buck you can have a miso soup. The makis are cheap but delicious. I love this place. Best sushi deal in Boston. 
7106 4 This place looks like a hole in the wall - but don't let it stop you. Pizza Bianca, garlic knots are delicious. They make their own salad dressing as well. Best pizza joint in Orlando!!!! 
7107 1 Overpriced, my drink tasted horrible like artificial mix, our food took a long time and the table that came in later got their food first but it was cold, my food was ok but the chicken was dry. Not worth it. 
7108 3 Baba ganoush was unbelievable! Good variety of beers on tap. Funky decor and a cool atmosphere. Good service. 
7109 3 Although this isn't the greatest pizza in the world, it's pretty damn good. It satisfies my craving for real new york pizza. theyre pretty quick, and do deliver. I'd recommend it. 
7110 4 Fastest Starbucks in town. Extremely nice baristas. They always have a smile on their face and are welcoming; even at 6:30 in the A.M. when I'm at my most grouchiest. 
7111 4 Most authentic Mexican in the downtown area. Their tacos are great, fast, and affordable. Their steak burrito is also great! Love this place 
7112 3 Service - awesome Food - terrific Prices - you get what you pay for Small place bit can accommodate a group or an intimate date. Loud enough to keep your conversation private but not so much that you can't hear yourself think. 
7113 4 Cool local place with a laid back atmosphere. Service was great and the burgers were really good. Great place to just chill and enjoy a casual dining experience. 
7114 4 Great lunch buffet. The naan is always fresh and delicious, the vegetable dishes are fantastic, and the mussels are fantastic. Definitely a stop if you're trying Austin's Indian food scene. Can't beat it. 
7115 4 It is so good.The crawfish is so finger-licking good. Also it is a fair price for the frozen crabs $7.Me and my family go every weekend.So this is why u should eat here 
7116 2 cheap stuff sometimes easier than hitting a grocery store 
7117 4 Excellent coffee and espresso drinks! Service is excellent, but don't be in a big hurry (the name says it all). You can have sparkling or still water while you are waiting and there are nice work spaces inside and a nice outdoor courtyard. 
7118 4 The food here is delicious and fast! Shrimp tacos are the best item on the menu. I've had the shrimp blackened, fried and grilled and either way they are superb! This locally, family owned restaurant is my favorite in Apopka. 
7119 2 I've used Mears over the last several days to arrange private car service to/from the airport and throughout Orlando. They've done a good job for us and the price is right. I also like their website, which is well designed and super simple to use. 
7120 3 Wife and I went on a Saturday evening. Had a pretty long wait. They offer roasted shelled peanuts while you wait. Steak was really good. Will be back. 
7121 4 Dougiestyle Sauce is delishhhh! Boneless wings and Dougie and Fat Tire Belgian ohhh yeahhh. Highly recommend for late night app/snack and brews! 
7122 4 Boston's Northend Best Restaurant .Food, Service, Wine list, Bread and atmosphere all outstanding I have been coming here with my family and friends over 20 years now and every visit is a true dining pleasure. 
7123 4 Best vegetarian pizza I've ever had! Friendly, fast service & the prices are good. Love this place!! 
7124 2 Prices were high and they didn't have what I needed. I had to go to the grocery store to find exactly what I needed. The help was amazing though, they know wheat they are taking about. 
7125 4 Best Indian buffet in Austin, period. I appreciate lots of vegetarian options too! 
7126 4 Great vibe, quick service, delicious food served hot. If line is too long to order, offer to sit at the bar. The bar staff is super friendly and food comes up fast. 
7127 3 Fish= Crispy and delicious; Tartar sauce= homemade and awesome; Fries= Not too many, but just enough; 'Coleslaw'= a bit of grated cabbage and carrots with no sauce? Weak. Love the staff, service is fast but be prepared to wait on busy weekends to be seated. 
7128 4 amazing service! we had a few hiccups from the kitchen but the waiter handled it with grace and poise. the food is to die for. if you ever get a chance to go ask for Alan to be your waiter. the food is spectacular but he makes the experience! 
7129 3 I thought the burger was good, I made my own and the ingredients seemed fresh. However, my husbands burger had barely any taste and wasn't cooked as requested. I also had a salted caramel milkshake which was very good! 
7130 4 Huge portions, very busy on a Saturday, immaculately clean bathroom. All in all, great experience! Our group was 8, with 2 kids. Kicked off well. :) 
7131 4 Rogue has been a part of my family since 2010 and the love affair just keeps getting better. The new store is awesome and they have a great selection of running apparel. But no one really "just" shops at Rogue...join us for a run sometime. It will change your life. 
7132 4 The brisket was amazing, and the cole slaw has no mayo. (That's a huge plus.) Best fried pickles I've ever had. I'd tell you about them, but I'm too busy driving to Larry J's House of Q to get more. 
7133 2 Great rides and the staff is outstanding! But the food is abysmal. Don't get the all day food pass. It's just not worth it. 
7134 3 They have average southern food but I love their drinks. They have unique drink pitchers that we tried and they were pretty good. Good place to just chill with friends 
7135 0 Almost walked out because we waited so long to receive our food. Friendly servers. Plastic cups. Asked twice for side of olives. Prices a bit too high. Decent menu. Not fresh cut lamb. Small portions. Not good for kids. They have the potential to get better. 
7136 1 Don't come here unless the place is empty. It took 18 minutes to make my pizza with 4 people ahead of me. I could have called Giovanni and picked up my pizza in that time. I still have to cook this thing. 
7137 3 I have rented cars from here and a truck and have never had a single problem. The wait is long at times bc there is light staff but all of the ladies have been really helpful. They have been upfront about everything all 4 times I have rented. 
7138 2 Outside looks like a strips club, but the inside looks great. Take a chance and see if this place is for you. The food was really good and TV everywhere. 
7139 2 been here for years; good pho at good prices, just not really a clean place in my humble opinion. Could be a lot better. Classic family-run without much regard to furniture and decor. Only pho in this stretch of fraser so easy $$$. 
7140 3 I just moved to Riverside and I thought I would check it out. It had a good vibe and the BBQ was really good. The portions were smaller than what I am use to getting, but I will still be back. 
7141 1 Thank you for the response Eric. We stopped in last week on November 4th. That night my boss had bistec de pollo empanizado with a Modelo. I had chuletas fritas with a shiner. 
7142 4 The way my friends described this oasis, I asked them if a unicorn might suddenly run out while rainbows appear. Really, they made it sound that beautiful and enchanting. It lived up to the hype. 
7143 4 What an awesome cool place!!!! Best grilled cheese ever. Had the crisp buffalo and my husband had the melt. It's whim delight and nostalgia on a plate... must come!!! 
7144 4 Chef Peter has created a wonderful twist on southern cuisine. What a great dining experience. Ummmm rhubarb slaw What a delicious twist to a classic. Can't wait to return next year when at our seminar! 
7145 3 Oblation is a lovely little card, print & gift shop that we always visit on our trips to Portland because they have unique locally made cards. I always buy my mom's B-Day card here. The staff is always helpful & really nice. 
7146 3 Consistently good diner. Has a little something for everyone. The staff is polite and efficient. The place is clean. They have great cinnamon rolls and very good pies. I usually go for breakfast and I'm always happy with the omelets. My family likes the pancakes. 
7147 2 The business never got back to me regarding the missing item from my order, so I am knocking off a star for lack of response. 
7148 3 The creamed quinoa is to die for. Creamy and soft but not overly cheesy or mushy. Just delicious! My favorite appetizer was the quail. Slightly sweet with a hint of spice. Fabulous bar and great outdoor seating. 
7149 4 Their chicken and waffles were delicious!! Some of the best I've ever had. Everyone was very friendly and the atmosphere is great! 
7150 4 Not bad at all. Liked the food and wine, and good design sense! 
7151 4 First time here. Very clean and the staff are great. This is my daughter's new dentist. 
7152 4 Their whisky hazelnut ice cream is to die for!!! So smooth and creamy with strong flavour of hazelnut and whisky - best dessert for right after your breakfast, lunch and dinner. Make sure you come during non-rush hours as this place can get busy fairly quickly. 
7153 4 Noodles are amazing value. Rest of the dishes are delicious, especially spicy beef. I ordered the Shanghai noodle soup. 6.95$ and huge portions. This is my third time coming, and I am still satisfied. 
7154 0 Worst customer service, avoid at all costs. Careless and rude staff. Never coming back! 
7155 4 Yes it's touristy and yes the lines are long. But it's worth it! I got the migas, fish, and al pastor. Would recommend all of them! Also get a watermelon fresca. You won't regret it. 
7156 4 Absolutely love the beef noodles here. It tastes exactly like what I had in China when I was a child. The broth is flavorful and the hand-pulled noodles are on point! I'm definitely coming back to Austin, just for this! 
7157 4 Good Yelp reviews got us here for the first time. Excellent wings, burgers and customer service will bring us back. 
7158 4 This is our weekly gathering to recap the weekend. Monday Margarita specials are always a good thing. Food is good, quick, great patio to sit outside right off Peachtree Street. You can park and walk to so much before and after dinner. 
7159 4 Cute atmosphere (love the train set around the ceiling track and all the paintings), great coffee, DELICIOUS muffins, and wonderful service. We were just staying in the area from out of town but highly recommend for visitors or locals! 
7160 4 Tofu skewers are awesome! The jazzy bowls are my favorite! Can't go wrong with a cookie for dessert. Been hooked since I first tried them in December. :) friendly service, too. 
7161 4 Excellent service! Excellent food! Have been on the east coast for a week and the warren tavern was by far my favorite meal! 
7162 0 I was promised delivery today. For reasons they can't explain. It's being delayed even though it's in stock. Poor customer service. Won't buy from them again 
7163 3 We love Zoe's. The pesto hummus is always awesome and orzo tabouleh is another favorite. We will be back! 
7164 4 This place is great! Friendly staff, fast service and super cute decor. Huge back patio and clean bathrooms. Would come back for sure! 
7165 4 We have been coming to this restaurant since moving to Austin 13 years ago. They consistently deliver great food with a great atmosphere. We have seen some of the same faces for years which says a lot about any restaurant. Great place. 
7166 0 One more place that doesn't brew decaf. They also can't do a pour-over. I know some will say, "Have an Americano or a Latte", but I don't like my coffee watered down. 
7167 4 I loved the tap room! Great idea to invite us in. The staff was friendly and the beer was great! I will be back! 
7168 3 Great place for sandwiches and soup! Their cookies are tasty too! Quick service and all the staff Are friendly. I eat here weekly because I work in the mall and it is the best place to eat in the food court. 
7169 4 Crazy delicious!!! Now I'll be craving lollipop chicken all weekend Go early because they sell out fast 
7170 3 One of the best Irish pubs around. The servers warm up after awhile and provide great service. The sampler is a great option. Bourbon selection is top notch. 
7171 2 Not as good as usual. Lychee martini was excellent. Spider roll not as good as usual. Waitress was outstanding! 
7172 2 Just an update, got a call from the manager a few hours later to let me know they're comping the meal. Not sure if it's my yelp review that made the difference, but regardless it's definitely appreciated. I think I'll try their lunch buffet next time... 
7173 0 Century Link provides the worst service in town...Plus their customer service is completely unfriendly and useless... 
7174 4 So damn good. I'm addicted! Seriously, I like to come here a couple times a week lately. Thank goodness they have a loyalty card so I can get the tenth meal free... I'm spending so much money there that it's nice to get something back! 
7175 0 i bought a car here in april 2013 its been giving me problems since!!!! i will not reccomend this place to anybody! spend your hard earning money eleswhere. worst car dealership in malden. never again!!! 
7176 4 The burgers are great every single time! The staff is nice and attentive. The service is always fast. For you first timers, the items are a la carte. Mac n cheese is great. Everything tastes fresh 
7177 4 My favorite. My favorite. MY FAVORITE! Any location. Always superb food and customer experience!! 
7178 3 So glad I found this place. We use to wait in live forever at La Sirentia, but this joint is much closer and tast just as good. The carna asada and pollo burritos are both very good. but the street tacos are my favorite. 
7179 4 AMAZING! Tried the chicken sliders and the bacon burger ones- both were delicious. Will be back for sure! 
7180 0 Really gross! Meat I am not sure which part of cow was it but full of fat! Will never try again any Vietnamese in Vancouver again!! 
7181 2 okay nice place to come grab some fast food, ppl begging for money this is not a mall what a stupid name, located by the peachtree marta station 
7182 4 Fantastic food and service. We got the Chicago burrito and the California burrito both were very good. 
7183 4 Dave Goldstein is absolutely fantastic and very thorough. He will show you the fastest ways to tackle problems and how to solve them from every angle. I would hifhly recommend him and this course to anyone! 
7184 4 Great neighborhood theater that gets first run movies for cheap. Don't expect new seats or hot food. Just a reasonably priced movie 
7185 2 It was fast, but the guy at the front desk was a little mean.. Not towards me, but just his personality I guess. No worries though! Food was good, but everything is when you're hungry. I would go back because it's walking distance. 
7186 3 the only place that sells linguica- and its delicious ! everyone that works there is really friendly and nice also 
7187 4 This is the best pizza place up north! Amazing food, huge topping selection and extremely friendly staff! Definitely recommend! 
7188 4 There is usually a line, but worth the wait! 2nd best breakfast in Portland (first if you ask my wife). 
7189 4 This place is great. The meat and the sushi were really fresh. The shabu shabu was reasonably priced and the wait staff was attentive. 
7190 3 Stopped for coffee and breakfast on the way out of Vancouver. Coffee was good. Has a breakfast wrap which was grilled in panini press. Pretty good. Could have had some peppers and onions. Add liz said it was a qute little shop. 
7191 2 I go to the Parish Cafe for the drinks and the sidewalk seating. While it's gimmick is the menu of sandwiches created by different Boston chefs, I don't know anybody who thinks of that when you say "Parish Cafe." But for foofy drinks and people watching, it's great. 
7192 4 We stopped in the city for one night at the end of our ski trip and had dinner here. We were so glad we came! We eat Thai food fairly regularly in New York and this was much better. Will definitely come back. Recommend the tasting menu and ginger cocktails. 
7193 0 If you like INSANELY loud music, waiting an hour to be seated, waiting another hour to get your sub-par bar food, and dealing with rude servers, than THIS IS JUST THE PLACE FOR YOU! Y'all. DON'T GO. 
7194 1 Reasonable North End fare. The menu is standard Italian (something picata, something marsala, sides of pasta) and the service reasonable, but nothing to be swept away by. The ambience is quiet and good for conversation, though decorations are slightly overdone- dark red lighting, hints of volcanoes. 
7195 3 I'm never sure of a mechanics pricing... but they are ALWAYS available for their customers. 
7196 0 Terrible sandwich. The bread was super stale, probably baked in the early 90's. The tofu must have been prepared weeks prior. Avoid this place at all cost. 
7197 4 One of the nice, bigger and less crowded godiva locations. They have soft serve and good selection here. 
7198 3 Super friendly staff and delicious food. Asada Burrito was big and flavorful. Kids had both hard and soft tacos and ate them all up. Tamale was good. Yummy fresh crunchy fries. Heard the burgers are great, we will try next time. 
7199 2 This restaurant is perfectly fine. We went for a quick bite in the early evening. Service was really, really slow (and it wasn't busy) but the food was pretty good, all things considered. Parking is a plus. 
7200 4 I have been dying to try these since I heard about them months ago. These bagels are seriously amazing. Almost exactly like you find in NY/NJ. Chewy on the outside, soft on the inside. Delish.... 
7201 3 A solid sushi joint for take away. Glad to finally have a good sushi place in the hood. Fish and chips hand roll is yum. Great sashimi. Damn good seaweed salad. Super sweet staff. Excellent. 
7202 4 LOVED the Cuban Sandwich! First time I have ever been and it felt like walking into a family home. They know everyone and it truly is a taste of cuba. Sooooo yummy! 
7203 3 LIKE THE NEW STORE WAY BETTER. Younger, cleaner, hipper, and more reasonably priced than the old Louis. And the attached restaurant is very good, very reasonably priced, and has a great view of Boston. 
7204 3 The usual BBT place for my buddies and I. Prices are reasonable and most of their drinks taste great! Busy most of the time and hard to find seating as it is a really small place. 
7205 3 We were really impressed with the quality of the food, the service, and the amount of food we got for our money. We didn't expect to be, but we were. They have a good number of vegetarian options, which isn't uncommon at sushi restaurants, but it was nice. 
7206 2 It was pretty pricey. I got the chicken fried rice was good, but I've had better for less money. the pad tai was dry, barely any sauce. 
7207 0 I don't understand the hype for this place. I ordered a latte, and it was lukewarm at best. I couldn't taste the espresso- it tasted like overpriced lukewarm milk. I ended up tossing it and going somewhere else :( 
7208 3 I like they have a large selection of different kinds of food here. Great place to hang out with friends. 
7209 4 This place is a great place! The food was delicious and the service was super chill, just as it should be when walking into a Hawaiian establishment. I give it five stars since the food tasted just like it should be and the people are nice and family feeling. 
7210 0 Sitting at the table as I writing this. It is Disney not known for there food but I'm just disgusted that they would charge the prices they do an not make an attempt to serve better food. It was frozen no taste garbage. 
7211 1 Today was the first time I've visited a shake shack and had a single cheeseburger and french fries. Burger very greasy and I didn't particularly care for the sauce. French fries were all right but not great. I feel the prices are a little expensive. 
7212 4 Went for a late lunch on a Tuesday afternoon.... No wait! Food and service were outstanding, Miss Amy was our host and was truly amazing! Helped with our beer selection by asking current beer of choice and hit it out of the park! Thanks again from Texas! Bill Gilliland 
7213 4 Great coffee, nice atmosphere and the service is amazing! Their delicious 12 different flavour macarons and cake - made in house and are heavenly! Will be my go to coffee shop. Great addition to the Austin Heights area. 
7214 4 Best breakfast in Portland! Specials are fun. Great benedicts, good biscuits and gravy. Love the Potatoes O'Brien, with onions and peppers. Veg/vegan friendly. Good Bloody Mary's. Wait isn't that long to get a table. 
7215 3 Attractive foot massage lounge that's open late & very affordable. 
7216 4 Love the Happy Hour at Fishbones! We had Oysters, Shrimp and Sushi. Food quality was excellent. I'll be back again when in Lake Mary!! 
7217 4 We tried their lunch buffet today. I went in expecting the normal walk up buffet and found everything is cooked to order. Everything we ate was hot and fresh. The ginger dressing is to die for. I found my new favorite Asian spot. 
7218 3 The sandwiches are tasty, I had the Dagwood and enjoyed it enough to go back. The wait time can be a factor so calling ahead and using the pick up window it's a good option. 
7219 4 This is one of my favorite places in Austin. Their turkish hospitality is as good as it gets. They are definitely some of the kindest people i've met in here in Austin. All of the food is delicious, but the beef iskender is my fave. 
7220 4 Wow. Some of the best burgers I've had in Oregon. The peanut butter pickle bacon burger is just pure heaven in your mouth. I'm a fan now. 
7221 1 Ugh the goat cheese and bacon omlet someone drove 35 miles for I'd do the opposite drive 35 miles not to have to eat it. Go to Annie's cafe for a much much better brunch. It's on congress and 3rd 
7222 4 Fantastic seafood and unique atmosphere! You can see your food being prepared and everything is incredibly fresh. The corn crab cakes are a favorite for a starter, but can't go wrong. Staff is great, make sure to make a reservation. Been here 3 times and never disappoints! 
7223 4 Someone at your table must order the chicken or steak burrito. It's the best burrito I've ever had. They nailed it! 
7224 4 Great food and mood! Very trendy, flavorful dishes. Wide selection of beer/cocktail options. Not your classic cafe, but extremely pleasant atmosphere. I would definitely go back, whether it's for lunch or dinner! 
7225 4 Some of the best burgers in town, and they're very efficient with taking orders and making sure you have a good place to sit. Often they have lines out the door during meal times, and for good reason! PS - Try the Ahi Tuna Burger... 
7226 4 We have been using Mark and his crew for years. They always do a great, thorough job. We have our house pressure washed, the gutters cleaned and the extensive deck stained as needed. 
7227 4 I always recommend Piercing Experience to anyone who asks where to get something pierced. The staff is always professional, friendly and helpful. I trust their quality jewelry so much I always drive the distance from Smyrna to purchase from them. 
7228 4 The perfect escape. Down those stairs and into JAZZ. Great spot for a first date or to rekindle an old flame. 
7229 4 They were polite! Fast! I called at 10:10 & the flowers were ready at 10:30. Definitely will be back. 
7230 2 Walked in and ordered a large pepperoni, banana pepper and extra cheese to go. Service was fast and friendly but the pizza itself didn't knock my socks off. 
7231 4 It's been a long time since I been here. I still remember the El Diablo burger. It was damn good! It was big enough that I only finished half of it. The fries and the Nutella Pretzel shake are also good. 
7232 4 Delicious, fresh ingredients, and fast service, everything you want in a pizza joint. 
7233 4 Excellent. The signature chicken wings are amazing. Wonderful breadth of menu. The cocktails are very thoughtfully prepared. Kid-friendly. Strongly recommend. 
7234 1 So loud! Nice staff. Mediocre food. Overpriced. Won't go back. So much better food in the Easton area. 
7235 4 Love their buffet!! The service is great, the food is incredible. Regular lunch and dinner are a bit pricey but good if you like red meat. If not, go for the buffet. The price for the buffet is reasonable and the selection is truly great. 
7236 3 It is one of the hidden gems in the mall 'cause it stands out from the other stores by creating a skaters dream within a dream. Lots of selection, good stuff and friendly staff. I come here to buy skateboarding stickers since it is local and close buy. 
7237 3 Delicious, hot pizza the way it is suppose to be! Thin and crispy crust. If you order by the slice you can get cheese, pepperoni and mushroom, and margarita. If you're hungry I would order more than one slice. 
7238 4 Great place! Excellent pizza and great subs. The guys that work their are friendly, typical Boston dudes. Plenty of seating for dine in, really fast delivery the times I have ordered delivery. 
7239 3 This is store has many varieties of candles, vegetables and lot's of family style foods. Every time I go there, it's always packed with people. 
7240 4 Go there all the time - its super cheap. The Tofu Yummi tacos are like nothing you've ever tried before. 
7241 4 Updating to 5 stars, as a cheap lamb dish here a few months back still sticks out as one of the best things I've eaten in 2014. So affordable and delicious, if you can overlook the just okay atmosphere. For the price and food quality, I can! 
7242 4 Great food joint in DUBLIN ....COZY ....GOOD FOOD ... 5 MEOOOWS 
7243 4 Always has the best customer service. Super friendly and knowledgeable. With a decent variety of juice at a multitude of price points. Which is why we keep coming back over the years. 
7244 3 Really tasty donuts. Haven't had voodoo yet so can't compare but these are a notch below Dough Donuts in Brooklyn if you're familiar with those. Still really good 
7245 4 Celeste and Heather were so wonderful. They did a great job keeping us on schedule, arriving on time, and also being patient with my 3 flower girls (no small feat). We are so grateful to them and would recommend to anyone. 
7246 4 Great selection. Prices are around the msrp. The owner and staff are very knowledgable. This is a true skate shop. They sell skateboard stuff only. 
7247 2 It's ok, I was happy with my lunch. Lunch menu was a little limited but it looks like it allows them to execute those dishes extremely well. 
7248 1 Ridiculously slow service. DO NOT GO during your morning commute to work!!!!! They'll make you late. 
7249 4 The office is very clean and the staff is so friendly! They ensured I was informed about the procedure and that I had the most comfortable experience possible. 
7250 4 By far hands down the best in town an totally authentic Carnitas and chili rillionos was the best we have ever had anywhere. 
7251 3 I've had both facial and massage here and they were excellent. I would recommend this facility. The tea lounge is great. Wish they had a whirlpool within this spa. 
7252 1 The only reason this gets 2 stars is that the line before ride is pretty immersive. The sheer boredom that the ride brings is immensely dissapointing. If you are looking for something exciting and thrilling look elsewhere. 
7253 3 Yummy! I mean, you can easily find a HK style cafe in Vancouver, but this is a good spot! Cheap, and comes with a drink of your choice. Fast service and friendly staff. Find street parking and it's kind of hard to find...so watch out! 
7254 2 great atmosphere, a little less the service! the tacos not bad 
7255 3 Good portions on the food. Nice outside atmosphere. 
7256 4 Best little spot for sushi, at awesome prices. Edamame and crab wanton were Delicious! Clean, fast and great quality ! 
7257 4 We used them for transportation to and from Logan. I emailed JB Livery for pricing and Nicole Kelley responded within minutes. She made the reservation process very easy. Both drivers were terrific and we had zero issues. Both cars were super clean. I will use them again. 
7258 1 I think that if you're like me and have lowered your fat intake over the years, you may not enjoy this place. I do enjoy a deep fried dinglebob every once in a while, but I left here feeling heavy and greasy. The sides were OK. 
7259 3 Great food and drinks. The service is good as well. Have had private functions and dine here regularly. 
7260 3 Got their best-selling blueberry and "OG" donuts. Pretty unique taste (was there lemon in the OG?), texture was fluffy, and the donut doesn't squish together after one bite. This place reminded me of Sidecar donuts in Santa Monica - high-end donuts with hipster flavors. 
7261 4 This trailer is just a block from my work and I find that I'm going multiple times a week now. I've had their tacos and their quesadillas.. both are so good! It's very affordable as well. 
7262 4 Ordered three things because I couldn't choose! All were delicious! Cozy, cute atmosphere and very good portions and pricing! I had the pho Tai, the pineapple fried rice and the honey chicken. Also try the abocado smoothie and coconut juice! You won't be disappointed!!! 
7263 1 Decent food; do not expect any type of good service or you will almost surely be disappointed. 
7264 4 Orangetheory is a great workout for me because of the diversity in the span of one hour. Also each class is different from the day before so you are not bored with the same thing over and over. All the coaches at Four Points are fantastic at motivation and instruction. 
7265 4 They are willing to work with you. Every since I've been banking with them i have built my credit greatly. Usually i go and they have me in and out. No problems. Friendly and helpful staff 
7266 4 Every day except Tuesday, you can choose from 2 excellent soups, I hope someday to try them all, but I can only make it on weekends. We come every week for soup. 
7267 4 everything here is great. but I especially love the chicken, food is made to order and just delicious. do yourself a favor if your in the area come by and enjoy some good ol southern food. 
7268 4 Definitely the best Chinese food on the North Shore. The food is always fresh, restaurant is always clean, and the delivery is always fast. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Never a wait for the dining room and they make great drinks too! 
7269 0 Do not use this service even if you buy a groupon deal. They no showed and never called me back to reschedule or follow up about why. Terrible way to do business. 
7270 4 I just Love this store. I was able to find so many beautiful pieces for our new home thanks to Marion Mandala " The Home Enhancer " we found the staff very helpful and attentive to our needs. I will be back :-) 
7271 4 If you're looking for authentic style Mexican food with beautiful decor and fantastic service, then look no further than this place. Absolutely perfect! 
7272 0 Food was inedible! Tasted expired and everything was either undercooked and mushy or over cooked. They really don't seem to care about guests because they refused to do anything to make it right. I spent $50 on a pile of crap. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! 
7273 4 Loved it - got a great haircut and a discount for checking in on Yelp! 
7274 3 Chicken lo Mein was fantastic with their special sauce. I've tried lo Mein in some other Chinese restaurants but the sauce available at this place and spices in lo Mein are very tasty. 
7275 4 A real gem in the Sunset community!! The chai is unbeatable in a city full of fake "chai tea" lattes. 
7276 3 Pretty darn good banh mi. Not your traditional banh mi, but what they offer is pretty good! 
7277 4 The lemongrass chicken and curry soup are both to die for. I love this place. The service is kind of slow and the lines are usually long around lunch time but the food is so worth it!!! 
7278 3 This place gets an extra star because it has shuffleboards and I love playing shuffleboard. The beer and food is not spectacular but they have a lot of competition. The game will keep me returning though. 
7279 0 4 people in the store staring at computers. Won't go back. Less attitude please and more customer service. Immediately got problem solved at Lamps Plus. 
7280 4 Drinks between classes, an overwhelming selection of sandwiches that rival each other. You can't get any better than this. Perfect outside patio when it is warm. 
7281 3 Sundays are extremely busy and the wait for two can sometime be longer than 15min. Food is good, service is good. Just a good local breakfast joint. 
7282 2 The Italian sub was nothing special. It tastes like something that can be easily made at home. Their vegetable selection is lacking (lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and a few pickled items). I also wish they had a whole grain bread option. I prefer Subway to this place. 
7283 4 Great coffee, tasty muffin, comfortable atmosphere, friendly staff and good politics (Antifa art display on my last visit) = solid 5 star review. 
7284 4 While I'm not a big fan of sweets I absolutely love this place!! The sundaes are super-super tasty..... Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth the price even if you only try it once. They are typically very busy since Downtown Disney typically is, but it's worth the wait. 
7285 2 I'm not from the area, and I've heard rave reviews about their pizza. It was average at best. My pizza had spinach, roasted red peppers, green olives and garlic. Maybe I'll try a little meat next time. While it was edible, there was nothing special about the pizza. 
7286 1 Not my cup of tea... Rice and peas were bland, veggies and Mac and cheese were too salty. But my bf enjoyed his meal of ribs and fish... 
7287 4 I had a cake made for my son's Eagle Scout Court of Honor. I sent several photos and narrowed down the design via email. Great communication. The cake was incredible and a big hit. Everyone said it was delicious. I would use again and recommend Annie in a heartbeat. 
7288 4 The epitome of excellence. Rooms are nice and spacious, all the accessories you would need are provided, and the overall decor of the place is very charming. 
7289 3 200 kinds of salt, every one of them with a different flavor. you are either the kind of person whom such a prospect bores or thrills to the marrow. as the latter, i heartily recommend. also, the chocolate selection is beautifully-curated and pretty fairly-priced. 
7290 3 Good food and cold beer with a great selection. Small place. Try the steak tips or fish and chips. Good music and fun. 
7291 4 Love their sushi and service! Whether you order takeout or sit in their sushi is always fresh and you will receive excellent service. 
7292 4 I'm the One Who Likes That Many Olives on Their Pizza. That is to say their veggie pizza is pretty phenomenal, as are all of their vegetarian options I'm sure. And when you find a great local pizza joint you don't let go. 
7293 3 Good happy hour, and good fish and pork tacos. They are a little pricey if you don't hit happy hour, but still, it's good food. Service has never been bad. I'll go maybe twice a year. 
7294 1 Absurdly over-rated. Overpriced with tiny, greasy, salty portions. Sloooooow service. 
7295 4 This is the best coffee shop in Atlanta. Come when Little Tart is open and enjoy an amazing coffee and an amazing pastry. 
7296 4 Another great Austin find. Yummy mexican food for breakfast or lunch. The food is fresh and delicious and staff are the nicest people ever. We had so much great food here. Loved the fajita nachos and everything we tried. 
7297 4 Amazing, authentic Cuban food. The prices are extremely reasonable. I felt like I was committing highway robbery. Great place in a beautiful town. 
7298 4 New in South End for 2-3 months now. Huge store with a bit of everything - hot foods, bakery, veggies, snacks, meats, fish, cheese, wine, spa for mani-pedis. Decent amount of parking (free). Everything is so fresh. 
7299 3 We went for my wife's birthday. Very good service. Food was delicious and well presented. Great views of the harbor and Boston skyline. Thanks for the champaign! 
7300 3 Great atmosphere! Nice environment and great services provided by the staffs. The food here is awesome! Loved it! 
7301 4 I was visiting Boston. And was looking for Ethiopian food. I took three entrees for to-go. It was delicious and plenty. 
7302 3 It's a litte different from the other powell's, it's smaller but I find my postcard and souvenirs here! 
7303 4 Great pizza and great service 4.00 tip megan the mngr has a great crew.. 5 stars and the whole crew had a smile. 
7304 4 Just ate there. Everything was delicious. Server was attentive, Pasta was great. Chicken chili, yum. Corn bread wow. Foccachia good. 
7305 4 Delicious food and perfect atmosphere. Food was fresh and the portions were very generous. A must try restaurant for those craving authentic Greek eats. 
7306 4 Jonathan did wonders to reduce my lower back pain about a year ago (this review is LONG overdue!). He applied the perfect amount of pressure to heal my aches without any pain. Another great thing about him is that he offered a teachers discount! I will definitely be going back! 
7307 4 Nicest people and delicious food. Decent beer selection. Good outdoor seating. I'll be going back for sure. 
7308 2 Yummy desserts! Different than any other shaved ice cream places. Rich, soft, and yummy! 
7309 0 First time here and I was really excited. The food was really tasty and my entire table was pleased with it. But we all ended up in the bathroom for the rest of the night. Thanks for the food poisoning. We won't be coming back. 
7310 4 One of the best steaks I've had in Boston. I also recently tried their Chicken Pesto pizza and it was top-notch. I highly recommend this place. 
7311 3 Tripleta was amazing! Chicken and everything else very flavorful. Great latin food! Even the red beans and rice were delicious. Great lunch away from the commercial chain restaurants nearby. 
7312 1 Dry wings, soggy fries, slow delivery. Won't be ordering again. 
7313 0 Customer service was horrrrrible. One girl got really nasty with us. It was boring not a lot to do. We ate there as well and they gave us a server that wasn't even there yet. It was awful. 
7314 3 Love their New England Clam Chowder. It is one of the best I've ever had. The crab cake was too salty for my taste. The service was very friendly and attentive, despite how busy they are. 
7315 3 Charming little bakery with tasty cookies, cream puffs and my daughters favorite, Baklava! They also have plenty of exotic herbs and spices. One thing to be aware of is there are exposed nuts, so those with peanut allergies might want to take caution. 
7316 4 The Yelpers didn't let me down on my visit to ORL. The shrimp and crab nachos and Atlantic salmon were phenomenal. I'd definitely recommend and come back. Ambience is the feel of an old school steakhouse... 
7317 3 Stayed here for one night. We booked a week here for some friends of ours and decided to come stay one night with them. Very nice large unit with everything you could want. Great pools and Jacuzzi. Would like to go back. 
7318 3 Its like soaring over California @ Disneyland. Well its nice to see similar attraction in Vancouver. The Canadian places featured is wonderful. I have to reduce one star due to the price. Otherwise its good. 
7319 4 Excellent food, excellent service, great ambience, creative dishes. I am a regular and Mikado never disappoints! 
7320 4 Quite possibly the only place better than Upper Crust. Atmosphere is chill and cozy; the pies and beer are yummy. Thin crust pizza offered in various permutations - all scrumptious. Parking can be scarce, which is the only detraction. Highly recommended. 
7321 4 Very welcoming staff. Feels like you are at your best friends house and you just had a slumber party and they are making you breakfast in the morning. It's small inside and definitely a locals portland diner. Good food, good prices, good people. 
7322 3 Finally a great local pizza joint! One can't be expected to go to Santarpio's every time one needs a slice. This place isn't perfect but it's hand tossed, home made sauce, and an awesome creation called the Calabrese. 
7323 4 The steak tips are to DIE for for! And the sangrias are refreshing! 
7324 2 This place is a lot like Angora Cafe right down the street. But there's better seating at Angora's. Food is pretty good, esp the frozen yogurt. 
7325 4 I got a flat tire this morning and needed it patched. The service was quick and easy. I can't speak for anything else but the tire patch. $14 bucks and about 15-20 mins later, it's all good to go. Everyone that I encountered was pleasant and professional. 
7326 2 Small iced, milk and sugar. What? Iced coffee - small... With milk and sugar. OK. And a chocolate chip muffin. Muffin, ok, what kind, blueberry? Chocolate chip. OK... Sorry hon, how do you take your coffee again? And they didn't offer to toast the muffin! 
7327 3 We returned to this place because of the quality of food and helpful service. Everything we ordered was delicious - ramen, sushi rolls, and yakitori. Will definitely go back again. 
7328 4 I cannot say enough about this hotel. We have a relaxing and enjoyable time every time we visit. The staff is very hospitable and wants to make your stay the best! The shuttle was awesome, and very easy to access. We didn't want to leave! 
7329 4 The crazy udon is amazing. I also recommend the mango curry. The vegetables in everything they serve taste and look fresh. Lots of flavor. 
7330 3 The people who complain about this place don't have a leg to stand on. If you're looking for authentic Asian food, this is not the place. If you want some decent sweet & greasy Chinese, then look no further. They have your crispy beefs, crispy chickens, and crispy shrimps covered. 
7331 4 I love coming here. The people really know what they are doing and can tailor their work to your needs. Is it the most "spa like" setting no, but once you close your eyes it really doesnt matter. I hope this place stays in East Atlanta. 
7332 3 Loved the stay here. And they offer shudle to universal Orlando. Plus free Breakfast from 7am-10am I believe I recommend this place 
7333 3 It is okay to try Chinese Foods, I recommend General Gao Chicken. It is little bit sweet and spicy. Besides, it costs around $6.00 for lunch. Reasonable price. 
7334 3 The sushi was delicious; the service was friendly and efficient. However, we were charged $1.50 for one tiny dish of gluten free soy sauce. I've eaten at dozens of sushi places and have never been charged for gf soy sauce. They didn't charge for the spicy mayo though. Go figure. 
7335 3 Nice local Colombian style burger joint. I tried their junior cheese burger and junior hotdog. I really liked their burger but wasn't fan of hotdog. Would def go there again and prob next time instead of dog , I'll try their kabobs. 
7336 4 Tried Desta today we were not disappointed! Great recommendations from new Atlanta friends! Will definitely be back! Love it! 
7337 4 Awesome little place! Prices are OK, but the service is super friendly. Great music venue and a lot of fun when bands are playing. 
7338 4 Staff was very helpful and kind. Got my dog taken care of. Made sure I knew all of my options and recommended another facility for treatment if we chose too. Outlined all cost and procedures needed. Very happy pleased with the service I got 
7339 2 Fine donuts but surely service and it took 15 minutes to get a new pot if coffee. I don't understand why a place which says they serve donuts and coffee only would ever run out of coffee. 
7340 4 Chungs is awesome. I go there at least once a week and have the buffet. Freshest Chinese food I've ever had. Staff and owner are awesome and nice every time we go in. 
7341 4 Love this place. Ordered their bread and cured meat board. Everything was so good. It's kinda pricey but worth it. But dont order their oysters. They're just tiny. I will go back for sure when I have chances and...more money lol 
7342 4 This is a little hidden gem, I frequent here at least once a week. The food portions are ginormous and the taste is amazing for a really good price! Wait staff is friendly manager is welcoming always. I really enjoy coming to Sr tequilas!! 
7343 4 I drive up from Cinci just for this! Great place to enjoy one of life's greatest pleasures. 
7344 4 My work banks with this branch... so I'm there on a daily basis and they have superb customer service They go above and beyond every single time I'm there. I highly recommend this branch. 
7345 4 My first time to Boston and this restaurant came highly recommended, it was very good from the atmosphere to the service and delicious fresh fish. The portions were generous, I would definitely return. 
7346 2 Super good sushi and all you can eat BUT horrible service. Other people after us got asked how they were doing. Waitress forgot to put my sons order in after we got our sushi 
7347 4 Yum! Love this place. Nice staff, excellent food, good variety & nice atmosphere. Good drink menu too. Will definitely continue dining here. Not necessarily best place for kids. More adult restaurant 
7348 3 Nice, spacious, ease of entry/exit to 2 major streets, Main & 41st, unlike the Main/16th. full size convenience store. Clean washrooms too. Royal Bank ATM & chinese Sing Tao newspaper ;) 
7349 0 Dosa was dry and brittle. Chai was just warm, not hot. Couldn't order Punjabi coffee because I guess they are short-handed during lunch buffet. 
7350 0 Terrible service..I didn't even get my nails done after waiting 45 min and them taking three walkins before me that came after me. .never again will I ever go back ! 
7351 3 Really nice place downtown. Almost commissary style restaurant, modest menu of well prepared food. Congenial staff, plenty of parking - recipe for a great place for lunch of a casual quality meal. 
7352 4 I love this place, I have to say Thana is the BEST! I followed her here from another salon. Everyone there super nice and friendly, clean too! 
7353 2 This place is good, although I admit I don't come here often due to another Mediterranean place in the very near vicinity that I consider much more authentic. The food is ok though, and it's quick and cheap. 
7354 4 This place shouldn't be this good at the prices they charge. It's hard to believe I just bought lunch for three for under $25 
7355 4 I always laugh my ass off here. It's also a great place to learn that your least favorite Supreme Court Justice died earlier that day. 
7356 4 I hate salads. Cold, slimey, and dressing- yuck. I'm extremely picky. I pick things out all the times. A Garden Monster salad? I eat the whole damn thing. Everything is delicious and mixed and balanced and sized just right. I'm addicted. So good! 
7357 4 Very hard working guys. Whether it's cold or night they are always there and courteous 
7358 2 The service was subpar but they had a great beer selection and the loaded tots were great. 
7359 2 Idk. Been there several times. Just not excited about it after going to firehouse. Last resort sun place for me although I will have to try a cheese steak and see was it super good. 
7360 4 This is one of our favorite breakfast spots in ATL. Awesome food, always perfect, service is great too. Very, very good... Recommendation: the over head light on the booths are very hot. It seems as an interrogation table; makes me sweat. Other than that everything else is awesome!!! 
7361 3 Love this place! It's close to school, so I come here as often as I can. Only issue is I HATE how they wrap their wraps! They always end up falling apart because of the paper they put on the outside. It's not enough to keep me away though! 
7362 3 I used to frequent this place in college, but it had been a long time since I'd been here. I was fortunate enough to have dinner here last week with some friends while visiting Austin, and wow, is it good. Hasn't changed a bit. Great neighborhood. Order some fries. 
7363 3 Tasty broth, not completely loving the noodles or toppings. Super good service and clean place 
7364 3 I've lived in this town for 4 days and I've already been here 3 times. I haven't tried the coffee yet, but the banana cream pie and the vegan apple pecan thing was amazing! Oh, and there's wifi, hooray! 
7365 4 I love this place, I eat here probably 3 times a week. Their sushi is amazing and they always give me great portions! 
7366 4 Excellent food. Made with a lot of love and attention. Juan is generous and friendly. The pulled pork and yucca had a great deal of subtle flavor. Not overpowered with seasoning or salt. Delicious food. Worth a visit. 
7367 2 Tables were dirty when I came in to sit down. Customer service was good the employees are nice.food was cooked well tho I saw the broccoli beef it looked like it was under the lmap for too long. 
7368 3 Visited on 1/31/12 in the 6-8 range of the evening. We shared mozzarella sticks that were the tastiest I've had in a really long time. We ordered a roast beef club to go and it was delectable! :) 
7369 4 Adorable diner-esque restaurant with a great menu. They have a few gluten-free options as well, which I appreciate. The pineapple upside-down pancakes are a very rich, decadent choice. Great cocktails as well. Overall, snooze is always a great breakfast/brunch choice! 
7370 3 Great staff who welcome you and a quick box office line which is much appreciated! Only wish their old fashioned was better. 
7371 0 The portion sizes are very small. The duck was burned, the lobster ravioli was mushy. The waiter was a jerk. The restaurant has the potential, it just needs a visit from Ramsey. 
7372 4 James is an excellent worker and very much appreciated by me. He arrives on time, works hard, is very efficiently and is very kind. He is courteous toward my needs! Thanks for sending James to my job! 
7373 2 Cash only. We arrived just before last call and there was already a long line. It was worth the wait to feed our donut craving! The donuts were pretty average tasting to say the least. The flavor combinations are fun, but nothing to brag about. Fun experience considering 
7374 0 Was not seated for 30 minutes when we had reservations. Food is underwhelming and overpriced. The female manager was not helpful and downright rude. Clearly not up to the standard of prato and luma. Don't waste your money here folks. 
7375 0 Your app totally sucks, card information is compromised, and there is no sense of urgency what so ever! Take uber as a last resort! 
7376 4 Simply amazing. Worth the trip from Orlando. I cane from Dallas and will definitely be back. Beer was great. The staff was great and the food was great. Pick anything and you won't be disappointed. 
7377 3 Service was excellent. I tried the Classic, the Llano Pablano, and the Truffle Aioli Fries. Burgers were pretty good but did not have enough seasoning. Fries were awesome. 
7378 2 Bad lighting. Cafe closes early. Some cool architecture. I think sometimes they have musical performances. That might be worth checking out. 
7379 4 I hosted a demo event for my NYC-based company in the big supply room. The entire process was seamless, from set up to clean up, and I didn't have to worry about a thing. The space is also wonderful and affordable. So glad we went with CENTRL! 
7380 2 My coworker brought some of these into work - the burger and cheeesesteak donuts are crazy-looking! Pretty tasty too. Also tried a bit of the jelly-cream filled one - really good. Beats Dunkin any day. 
7381 4 Easy 10/10 for El Primo. The food was outstanding. So delicious. We tried the migas tacos and a chicken torta. Our new go-to place for tacos. Genuinely nice people, great service, and delicious food. 
7382 3 The tofu soup is so delicious. this restaurant match a person who love strongly spicy. 
7383 4 This place is amazinggg. By far, the best frozen yogurt I've ever had. The cake batter flavor is the best! Staff is super energetic and welcoming. I will definitely be back! 
7384 1 just ok! the menu and the irish breakfast needs work! nice waitress , very friendly.bar wasnt full of drunks, very clean, quite, I may go back for a drink. 
7385 3 This is one of my favorite places to meet friends for drinks or a casual dinner. They have a few vegetarian options including mac 'n cheese and a portobella mushroom sandwich. Their drinks seem a bit watered down, but $8.29 for a tall vodka/tonic what else should I expect? 
7386 4 One of the best Americanos I've ever had. The staff is super nice and friendly - a feat when I come in right when they open at 6am after my workouts. Thanks for always being friendly! And for having delicious coffee :) 
7387 4 Nice place! Good selection of beers and comfortable atmosphere! I'm gluten-free and they had a really nice cider on tap! Wait staff is very attentive! People of all ages were hanging out, which is nice to see! 
7388 1 They cheated us on the chicken and didn't give our takeout order the rice and beans. We ordered 1 1/2 chickens and they came without the white meat. You can't run a restaurant with only teenagers. Good food but service stinks. 
7389 3 Created a build your own pizza for under $10. Many options to choose from such as crust, sauce, and toppings. Pizzas come in personal size and are ready in under 10 minutes. Location is right next to Fenway, great meal to fill you up before an event! 
7390 4 Listen, I once chose an apartment because it was within stumbling- nay, crawling distance of Dot's. Okay, that wasn't the only reason, but it was a good reason. Cheap and tasty food and drinks. I still miss their fries and spicy tofu sauce. 
7391 4 The Point has good pizza, wings and most importantly beers. I come weekly and the bartender, Rob, always delivers great service and conversation. A great joint with great employees. 
7392 4 Just a really great, welcoming vibe every time I come in here. Everyone is always super friendly and very helpful. I love love love this store!!!! 
7393 1 This location moves very slow on Saturday mornings. Also, the poor cashier's had to give a full monologue to every customer about some charity they were collecting money for, which just prolonged the wait. 
7394 4 Really great meal. Cocktails were great. All the plates were excellent. Puffy potatoes were probably the highlight. Bolognese was great as well, especially the homemade pasta. 
7395 3 Great for a little corner store. Quick hot fresh to-go food. Decent prices for what you get. Empanadas are delicious. Pastas are overpriced though. 
7396 4 Delicious find while visiting the island , the service was excellent and friendly The food was delicious and fresh , great options , I will definitely recommend this place to friends and will return when visiting Vancouver. 
7397 4 Good beer, good food, really cool patio, the green chile pork tacos are the SHIZNIT!!! 
7398 4 This place is top notch. The coffee is excellent, some of the best I've ever had. The food is excellent. It's cheap, clean, and the staff is super friendly! I walk in and they already know what I want and start my order. Check it out. 
7399 4 Despite location this place is wonderful. As EVERYONE has mentioned, the bread is a work of art! Great service, delicious food. 
7400 4 Drunk and uber to El Taquito.. saw it was up a hill so went here instead and was blown away! Good barbacoa tacos 
7401 2 The food was okay and the service was good. However, the portions were very small for the price of the dish. We were charged around $40 for just stew and had to pay extra for rice. Will not be going back. 
7402 4 The chocolate your was amazing! And our tour guide Chris was not only extremely insightful but "punnily" wonderful. From the historic beginnings, to the manufacturing, distribution and attributes of different chocolate this is definitely a great place to visit!! 
7403 3 I took clients to Eddie V's and had a really good dinner. I had never been to an Eddie V's and didn't know what to expect. We started with smoked salmon toast points. I had the Lemon Sole, which was awesome (large portion). 
7404 3 We'll go here for business lunches and I find the meals are filling and delicious. For a more casual experience, visit the attached bar that's right next door. 
7405 1 I went there for lunch with my son. Got the baked potato fries, unimpressive at best. I've gotten more better tasting fresher fries from McDonalds. Skimpy on the toppings too. Will not eat there again. 
7406 2 Really just an average shop for froyo and ice cream. The flavors were pretty standard and the place felt a bit like it needed a really good cleaning. The prices were reasonable and it is away from the bar crowd on 6th, we liked that. 
7407 2 I don't know the reason people love this place. They have good waffles and various syrups but, the dishes were disappointed. Their foods tastes very unique which people who haven't try here should know. If someone who loves to try new world, then I recommend here. 
7408 3 Great service, good food and generous portions. I'll be back I'm sure! 
7409 4 Chips and salsa are amazing. They have fish and shrimp tacos. The building is a old gas station across from Candler Park Market. 
7410 4 The vegan migas with avocado knocked my socks off. Truly the best taco I've ever had. And I've had thousands of tacos! I would love it they had a whole wheat tortilla option. 
7411 4 Best gourmet burger in town, without exception, Buns are great, fries are very special, everything is fresh and tasty and the menu is not overpriced. They have nailed it! There is a constant 30-minute line for a reason -- and it is worth every minute. 
7412 3 Got a groupon so wasnt sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised! Excellent service! Did exactly as I requested. Nice and friendly. Will call them again and pay full price, it's worth it. 
7413 4 Fun class, its byob and get to make a healthy amount of sushi to either eat there or bring home with you. Good date spot. 
7414 4 Got a manicure and massage here... And had a glass of a very nice white wine, which they offered, while relaxing. Very friendly, proffessional, and just plain good vibe here. 
7415 3 Good service. Very polite. Nice ambience. Had veg meatballs and pasta with fra diavolo, garlic bread, root beer float. Everything was good! 
7416 2 They have great pizza here, but the service is always super slow. Don't come here unless you have several hours to spend getting your meal. Mall 205 seems to be better managed in terms of service and management. I love this place. But it certainly needs some improvements. 
7417 3 Was looking for a decent late night spot to eat. I had a burger and fries, girlfriend had the Ruben, both were very good, service wasn't great but they only had one waitress. Definitely gonna try a rice bowl next time, all of which looked good. 
7418 0 Very slow service. Doesn't make much sense to order on Yelp for pickup and arrive, only to find that after 10 mins of waiting upon arrival, they just submitted the order. Poor customer experience. 
7419 4 Forget the Groupons.. This place offers a $10 wash that can't be beat! No coupon necessary. 
7420 3 The vibe here is awesome! The food was really good. Ordered the plantains and an arepa. Best plantains I think I ever had. Gave it a 4 because I left still hungry. 
7421 3 Greeted when we walked in the door. Food was really tasty. It's a good and unique change from all the standard places around! 
7422 3 Brought my family to eat here couple times. Great environment! I forgot the name of that dish I ordered but they make really good burgers and fish. Service efficiency can be improved though. 4 stars for the food and service and 5 stars for the environment and location. 
7423 2 Ordered chicken buckwheat. Oh no it's just not good for the price you paid. The chicken thigh is dry and bland. I'm going to give other stuff a try next time. 
7424 4 Great burgers, definitely worth price! Wonderful service, the servers are very attentive. Located at perimeter mall so a great place for lunch if you're planning on making a day of shopping. 
7425 2 Ordered the cuban sandwich special. It was delicious except the chicken was full of grit. Made it a mediocre experience 
7426 4 iFly was awesome!!!! We went during our Disney vacation and it was the best experience. I recommend this for those who are not ready for the real thing just yet.......the staff and instructors were awesome. We all would definitely go again and again 
7427 0 Actually 0 stars. I had the worst experience. Dirty community bugs,worms everywhere. Rude management team, maintenance, and neighbors. Dark apartment a lot extra fees that supposedly were included and don't even look the trash shut. Never rent those apartments. You pay twice the agreement. 
7428 4 I'm in Boston five times a week and I have to stop here at least once a week even if is just for the banh mi. Amazing food and customer service. 
7429 2 Yo I like the name. Reminded me of my favorite coffee shop back in Dallas, Crooked Tree. Definitely a different experience than a Starbucks (in a good way.) It has coffee and a cool name - win. 
7430 4 These guys are so kind and helpful. They went out of their way to teach me about my machine and tried many techniques without charging me anything. I would highl recommend anyone with a Mac try this place before paying lots anywhere else. 
7431 2 It's always COLD inside. Good burgers usually. Last time they undercooked the Bison. I guess they were nervous because "Ted" Turner was sitting right next to me on the Patio for lunch! 
7432 3 The husband and I just had lunch here a couple days ago. I had the chicken enchilada pizza and Brian had the Gobble Oink Moo sandwich with skin on fries. We loved it! The food is very tasty and the portions are huge. We will definitely be going back. 
7433 0 Rude Owner kicked us out a minute after closing telling us we do not pay his electricity so get out and fold at home. He was also yelling at the employee Extremely rude! 
7434 4 Great place, amazing customer service!!! People who run this place are the reason i come to this panera bread. If other PB around atlanta has this level of customer service it will be great for Panera. 
7435 4 Randomly selected this restaurant. The food was delicious! Service was even better! Prices were excellent. You get a lot of good food for a good price. **Happy hour prices for drinks (wine) and sushi is good Parking was free and easy on a Monday at 5pm 
7436 4 Bryonna and Sara were awesome !! We went for a company outing and they truly mde it a fun and exciting event for us ;) 
7437 4 By far the best Chinese food! I have ordered quite a few things and so farther has not been one dish that I have been disappointed with. 
7438 4 Great food. Fast seating for a party of 10. Great service. Highly recommended for your dining pleasure. 
7439 4 Our meal was excellent and our server Nicholas was outstanding. We had the flier Mignone and which was very good The drinks were very good 
7440 4 Best pizza and BLT in Boston. Happy to work in the area to frequent Emma's. Also the Chicken sandwich is a winner. I recently tried the Fling salad and between the dressing and the apples with I believe is goat cheese is really stellar. 
7441 4 Stopped by for a quick cocktail...it was dee-lish...then ended up grabbing some oysters... $2 Thursdays & $1 off glass pours. Bartender was great and gave a great dinner suggestion to Paadee. I would recommend and stop by again. 
7442 3 came here for breakfast, pretty good. quite a long wait though. i had the fried chicken waffles. it was good and portion size was decent. The only thing i didnt like about it was the cost. it was a little more than i had wanted to pay but worth it. 
7443 4 This is hands down the best German restaurant that I've ever eaten at. Great food, great drinks. Dad boot! 
7444 2 Do not order the wagyu ribeye. It's not tender or marbled as expected and is better elsewhere. Everything else - it's great! 
7445 4 First time here and very impressed. Great food for a great value. Greaters and waitress were very friendly. Highly recommend. 
7446 4 If you're going to eat a dead chicken that's been hacked to pieces, battered and fried in hot oil, it better be Gus's. 
7447 4 Delicious pizza!! The Gluten Free and regular pizza were both great. We loved the atmosphere and there was plenty of seating. 
7448 3 I'd never tried calamari before because it just looked gross. Tried it for the first time here and now I'm HOOKED. I've tried it at a few places since and they've all paled in comparison. I can't wait to go back!! 
7449 4 Margaret was great. On time and seemed to adapt to whatever situation she was presented with. I showed her around and then left. My wife got a nice treat when she came home. Thank you Margaret. 
7450 4 Great award winning beers, amazing food, gracious staff, fun atmosphere. Brewery perfection! 
7451 3 this is a really cool bar it has a club downstairs and a really cool lounge upstairs.. the drinks are really good and the ambient as well.. this is a really cool place to go when you feel like partying a little bit.. 
7452 4 Shangri La IS CURRENTLY CLOSED DUE TO A FIRE IN THE KITCHEN ON JULY 21, 2018. Noone was injured. This restaurant has, hands down, the BEST Chinese and Taiwanese food of any place I have ever eaten. 
7453 3 I just went there today with my mom and my daughter. We all enjoyed the food and service. We will definitely return again 
7454 4 Always a go to for lunch when I was interning just a couple blocks from this location. The fries are fresh and the chicken is always fresh. Also would recommend the honey Dijon. Great place :) 
7455 4 This place is awesome. Best lengua in Austin!! Cheap, fast, super friendly. Just don't let them seat you in a corner when they're busy of you'll never see your server after your food is dropped off. 
7456 4 Great local coffee shop with delicious options. I'm not a coffee drinker, but their hot chocolate and maple oatmeal scone are worth going for! The space is clean and bright, the employees are friendly, and the prices may be a bit high but it's expected for the area and product. 
7457 4 This is a great place, don't forget to try the tres leches. 
7458 2 Waitress was great. Food very pricey for the amount you receive. But food was good, what little you got. Salad was extra. Has been taken off my return list, sorry. 
7459 3 Have eaten here for years, always good...my favorite is carne asada :). Located in strip mall, we usually order for pick up and they are generous with portions. 
7460 3 Happened to come in here waiting for Playtime to open. Got a ton of veggies and canned goods. Decent place! A little dark, but friendly produce people! 
7461 4 Quiet little bar/restaurant over in east Austin. I only came for drinks, and the staff was super friendly and accommodating. They made recommendations based on our tastes and let us try a bunch of different beers. I'll definitely come back to try the food! 
7462 1 I think that if you want authentic Mexican food, you should go elsewhere. If you want Tex mex, you should also go elsewhere.. unfortunately it just wasn't good.. but they have good drinks. So I gave them a few stars. 
7463 3 We've been twice and the food has been excellent both times. My very selective about food, Gujarati husband approves of the offering here. Easily the best naan we've had in Portland. Well balanced flavors and perfectly cooked dishes. Really lovely ambience and staff too! 
7464 4 I love everything about Denmark. They've really taken the time to perfect every drink. The originality and made from scratch garnishes and mixes are insanely good! 
7465 3 We ate here twice during our time here. It was a very busy time because of all of the events going on, however, our servers were attentive and personable. Plenty of programming choices and the sweet potato fries were very good. 
7466 4 Everyone here is always so nice, especially Kayla at the front she was very attentive to me and my family. The grounds and restaurant is always clean. Food is always fresh, one of my favorite lunch spots. Just wish I could eat dairy ice cream... 
7467 4 Rise and Shine is delicious. Fast and friendly service. Inside and outside seating. Clean. 
7468 0 Had an appointment and they didn't even show up. When I called and left a message, they didn't even bother calling back. If this is what kind of business they run, i'm glad I didn't hire them. Totally unprofessional. 
7469 3 A pleasant surprise. I was very impressed with the set-up of the coffee shop. They had excellent customer service. The food items were very good as well. I highly recommend stopping in for a coffee and a snack if you're in the neighborhood. You will not be disappointed. 
7470 3 I think that the GSU gym is a great facility. Only issue is the whole rule on having a t-shirt/no shirts with no sleeves ir you can't workout in the gym. Where they do that at? 
7471 4 Awesome service with awesome peeps. Been going to them for years. My oral health is top priority. 
7472 4 You know I can't say a single bad thing about this place. Service was exceptional ( Damaris was very sincere ) the food was delicious and yes, authentic. Just go, enjoy it!! 
7473 3 Cupcakes are pretty darn good here! I'm not religious but this company is; I just ignored the "god bless you" during my phone call to them and the Bible quotes posted inside the shop. The staff is very nice and they have fun flavors. I would recommend these tasty bites. 
7474 3 Good place for Spanish food., while visiting Boston. The servers were friendly and the food came out quickly. 
7475 3 I only had a cup of coffee. But it was the best cup of drip coffee I've had in maybe months. Cafe Vita coffee from Seattle apparently. Oh, and free wifi! I did have a sip of someone else's espresso, which was very good also. 
7476 4 The best and freshest Chinese food I've eaten. Great drinks too. The service is fast and friendly. Fun patrons. 
7477 4 Great selection of gel polish, lasted over 2 weeks 
7478 4 I ordered two pizzas online at 5:48 pm. They arrived at my doorstep at 6:15 PM. They were hot and fresh. That's some incredible customer service. The driver was even friendly, smiled and thanked me for the tip! That's pretty rare these days. Great job Papa John's!!! 
7479 4 Amazing authentic fresh NY style pizza, friendly and fast service!! Will be my new "go to"! Thanks Mark!! 
7480 2 This is a South Boston gem. Known for great comfort food with a variety of steaks, seafood & appetizers. Prices are good & there is parking in the lot next to restaurant--hard to find in South Boston. Good food at good prices. 
7481 4 My goto hair salon. Relax fellas, they do amazing guy hair too. Amber is my girl. Come in, grab a nice cold beverage, and enjoy the experience. Want to try something new? Something adventurous? Standard trim and shampoo? They've got you covered. 
7482 4 Been to all the locations and the food is so good, a bit on the pricier side but its definitely worth it because you get filled up! Love their drunk chicken and xiao long baos. 
7483 4 Great place and atmosphere. Food was fantastic, service was excellent. Would highly recommend. 
7484 4 One of the best chowders yet! Super casual and quick for outside eating. Love the city view! Long picnic tables, so you will most likely share a table with other people. Kid-friendly with a great kid menu. 
7485 4 I love this idea, cute little shop offering fun cookie dough bites, cookie dough sandwiches and it's genius to have ice cream as well. What a tasty decadent combo. 
7486 4 This place is a gem! Cheap prices for great classic breakfast food! The French toast is tasty!! 
7487 2 Solid, is a very apt description of this place. Filling, well priced, the desert looks good, even though I never have room for it. 
7488 3 The breakfast tacos are good... they need to put the menu online. 
7489 3 The views are worth the flight up the stairs every time. Even if you come in the summer, it will be worth the sweaty trio you make up the steps. 
7490 3 I really enjoyed it. Lunch was Chicken Ginger Scallion and was too big to finish. It was all very fresh and tasy. I will return. Great place for a business lunch. 
7491 3 This is our favorite noodle house. Forget the ambiance - it's a dive. Service - yeahno. It's almost self serve. But the noodles. Oh the glorious noodles! The noodles with leeks and lamb. Seriously mouthwatering! Dumplings - yes more please! Dipping sauce. Nice and spicy. Delicious! 
7492 0 Wow. I haven't had such awful customer service in a hotel ever. Cancelled my reservation after a flight delay and will not reinstate my stay. Stranding me in Orlando on a business trip? What type of establishment would do that? Not on I'd ever use again! 
7493 4 Pretty cool place with good deals.. Doesn't look too exciting on the inside, but the food and prices make up for that! Plus they have an annual party for their customers where they serve free food and play music... If That's not love.. 
7494 4 This tacobell always has really fast drive thru services Thalia is always very nice when I'm on drive thru and Ms hazel is very nice when I go inside All in all I love this tacobell 
7495 3 Love it! Delivery is fast. The tikka masala is perfectly balanced, not too spicy but just right. The naan is really good. I've also enjoyed the pakoras and samosa. 
7496 4 Loved the ambiance of the coffee house. CAFE LATTE was perfectly made! They have two stories incase you want to enjoy some private time. 
7497 2 Basic Indy Coffee coffee chain. Drip is good. Baked Goods A-OK. Tip they have a few tables outside in the back of the cafe are relaxing and have a bit of a view. Good Bike Rack in front of the store to use. 
7498 4 Best pizza on the Space Coast. The sausage and pepper roll is another favorite of mine, as is Ryan's "small" salad. It's become my go-to spot for lunch in Cocoa Village. 
7499 4 Great! First time Ethiopian style for us. Returning with family/friends within next week or two. Priced right too! Service very good and helpful. 
7500 4 The meat lasagna is great. The staff was friendly. The ingredients always taste great. The best take and bake I have ever had. 
7501 4 The donuts are great and customer service is awesome! We ordered 5 donuts, but they threw in a few extras for us to try as well. The flavors really come through. It doesn't taste like just another overly sweet donut. I'd definitely go back if I'm in Portland again. 
7502 1 Cool effects but not worth the 1 hour wait. Also, its not a jarring ride. I don't understand all of the ride warnings. Lawyer s being too cautious 
7503 0 Poor floor plan leads to accidents, super slippery tile floor leads to accidents on rainy days, very basic customer service, loud, and the food's not that great at all, especially considering its price. Steer clear. 
7504 3 Lovely, as ordered- the escargot in particular was delicious. Good service, lovely mussels and frites. Very nice French country food, at a very reasonable price. 
7505 4 Great coffee ,fast friendly staff and prices are very responsible. Best place to begin your day ,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 
7506 3 My initial review was based on one delivery experience, so I decided to give this place another shot. I only order takeout now, but their sushi is GOOD. No complaints there. I still prefer my Chinese food elsewhere, but for the price, this is now my go-to sushi stop. 
7507 4 Shoulda got directv a long time ago instead of wasting my money paying more than 100$ a month with time warner! one thing i truly hated was that time warners remote was sooooo damn slow! none responsive. use my referral code and get $ off ur bill. referral # 041126760 
7508 3 Very delicious Malay food and nice interior. I recommend the roti canai, pineapple seafood rice and sayur lemak. Making my mouth water just writing that all down. 
7509 0 Do not go here for wedding makeup and hair you will get bumped to a different time and artist/stylist at any moment. It's about them $$ not you. 
7510 3 No complaints about Stinson's! The shop is clean and organized, and they serve breakfast in addition to their coffee. The price is fair and the coffee is good, so what more can you really ask for. 
7511 4 Friendly, fast, and good coffee. If I spent more time in Austin, I would visit this place more often. Thanks for the southern hospitality. 
7512 2 We served ourselves today by going to the counter every time we needed something, and they included tips in the bill for such poor service since we had a party of six. One of the lamb screwers we got was blue inside. otherwise it was good 
7513 4 One of my most favorite spots in Atlanta. You will NOT be disappointed. I love the spicy Kale wraps. So good! 
7514 4 We had a great experience they needed out table for another group so we were given a few rounds at the bar for our entire group. That was enjoyable end to a great meal reasonably priced worn wonderful service. Dogs I mention the calamari is to die for 
7515 0 How do you only cook one side of the steak and then serve it with the raw side down? No kidding I thought I was on candid camera. 
7516 3 They have great clam chowder. We went to the Halloween Tea and had a blast! Recommend this place for a cocktail & snack. 
7517 4 I love this place. Decent prices, great service, great food. The only slight thing I would prefer is if they had a little bit of a longer menu, a few more options. (ps - the salad nicoise is amazing; the tuna particularly in it is to die for). 
7518 4 My new Christmas gift shopping spot!!! For under $35 I can give an amazing gift that has the Austinartsy feel feel:)). I am also saving up for a few wall hangings!!! Check out the earrings, yard decor, and beautiful $15 cards that will get saved by your giftee:)) 
7519 1 It was JUST OKAY. Basically you're paying for the location and atmosphere. The food is equivalent to steak n' shake except smaller and pricier. The burgers are EXTREMELY GREASY, I probably wouldn't eat there again. 
7520 3 very reasonably priced artisan-family italian. cute place, too. 
7521 3 Excellent staff and service. The owner was constantly joking with patrons. Food was delicious, as good if not better than say Olive Garden 
7522 1 Went here for a gyro, not very much meat, WAY too much lettuce, and you could tell the tzatziki sauce was made with sour cream and not Greek yogurt. The best part about this place was the fries. Would not suggest if you want a good gyro. 
7523 1 Burger was okay but not the "world's greatest". Topping bar looked like it belonged in the Haunted Mansion. Sweet Potato fries were good. But the place definitely is not worth the price. Paid $24 for 2 lunches. 
7524 3 Got a groupon for $39 for a 80 massage. They give u cool robes and shoes to change into.. great customized services down to your mood music to tea vs. Water 
7525 4 The food here is nothing short of amazing. Incredibly delicious without a doubt!!! So worth it. 
7526 3 Waffle sundae is worth a visit. Chicken saté not so much. Nice selection of beer. 
7527 4 The original Rodeo Diner has added another diner to the family! Same family owners; same good cooking. If you're there when Theresa makes her Hawaiian cake, be sure to have a piece... It's delicious! 
7528 4 Tried this place as it won Best Breakfast on Merritt Island for the past two years. We were not disappointed! Older was excellent and biscuits were great. We'll definitely be back soon. 
7529 4 Have been going here since the day they opened! Bread still the best! Love this place, always have. 
7530 3 Great food, but wasn't full. A little pricey. Very helpful staff and friendly. The atmosphere was awesome! Tried their chef special - steak with salad which was pretty good. And ALL organic! 
7531 3 I had a 20% coupon and I'm glad I ran across it! Food and service was great. The veggie plate and fish was amazing! This was my first time here and I'm visiting from Chicago. I will be returning here when I return back to ATL 
7532 0 At this location I received a haircut from Talia, the haircut was so bad; I have decided to cut my own hair. Guys' check out on youtube, cutting your own hair. With a tip I use to give, I save over two hundred dollars a year. 
7533 4 My 2nd. times here. Love the foods and they have different menu every time. Staffs are friendly. Champage is cold. No place I rather be for lunch 
7534 4 "The Steak" is awesome! Can never go wrong with it. Fish and chips delish. Atmosphere and the sports on the tvs just compliment a great experience. 
7535 2 Pretty much what you'd expect for the price, although it is definitely not a resort so the extra fee is unreasonable. Nothing was horrible and nothing was great except for the location. I would stay there again if I got a great price like I did this past time. 
7536 1 The staff is very friendly. The steak and fish were great. However the ahi tuna was just sad, I didn't even take a second bite. They should just remove it from the menu. 
7537 3 They did a great job and took their time getting the style right. Good idea to make an apt. just in case there is a school dance nearby. 
7538 2 Closed on Sunday?? Argh. I bought my first mountain bike at Buck's in 1994 (I think) so it's of historical importance and all. 
7539 4 Must eat before you die! These are the kind of things that is worthy of putting in your mouth and producing large quantities of drool and of course you know what follows....Enough said. 
7540 4 The best place for a family lunch or late afternoon great time. We love this place and always come back. 
7541 4 Dr. Antonio Gargiulo in the Center for Reproductive Surgery is fantastic. Willing to spend time with you and great bedside manner. 
7542 3 Wow. Harsh reviews! I've been here twice and the crew working were great. Welcoming, smiling and attentive. What else could one ask for?! 
7543 4 Delicious coffee in Austin. I'm a coffeaholic and this place was great. Very hipster atmosphere which is great. I will definitely visit this place again when I'm back. 
7544 1 Came here for lunch. The food is okay and you get charge for the location that it is in. I got the chicken teriyaki box. The portions for lunch is good. 
7545 4 Friendly neighborhood bar. The drinks are good and the food is decent. I find it to be a great place to stop in for a pint. My go to bar. 
7546 4 Typical coffee shop though the coffee is superb. Nice assortment of chocolates for sale and all dark chocolate 70%. They use this same chocolate in their drinks. Service was stellar. Military discount provided. 
7547 1 Overpriced. Dumplings are ok, but their soups are pretty bland. Overall disappointed. 
7548 0 It took 20 minutes to get the attention of a server. Then we had to send back our drink order. Once we got our pizza it had hair in it. Zero stars! There is one star, otherwise I couldn't post this. 
7549 0 If you are coming for an oil check, plan to be here for the entire day. Pretty bad customer service and really long wait times 
7550 0 The chopped salad isn't chopped! And it was all lettuce. Place is pretentious for a tiny pizza too. Need to bring up their game! We had the lamb sausage pie. Otherwise tolerable. But I can't get over the salad. 
7551 4 Dr Smith and Cameron are amazing. My daughter had a very high fever. They came to my home quickly and their bedside manner was professional and so thorough. I will continue to use their services in the future. Plus, they take insurance. 
7552 4 This was a good experience for us! Mark (salesperson) helped us pick out a carpet (we are clueless) and it looks so nice. They got it done in one day. They also did a great job! 
7553 3 Always a good choice. Never regretted anything ordered. Staff very friendly. Try the Pad Thai, Pad See-yu, basil or pineapple fried rice, spring roll, Massaman Curry ... All our favorites 
7554 2 Too much of a frat-bar atmosphere for me. Went there to see a show and it was too noisy from the crowd. I give them props for having a large beer selection, but it's expensive for me. 
7555 4 I can't say enough about Jenny and her crew. The best food in Austin? Not quite. The best value? Without a question. Highly recommend. 
7556 4 Favorite pizza in town. Good prices, convenient location. The jalapeño ranch is a game changer. If you haven't tried the sandwiches, they may be even better than the pizza. The salads are super robust and amazing as well. 
7557 3 Love everything about bodega! This is a great place to come at the end of a night and have one last beer before heading home. They are just cool guys who know beer and want to share their knowledge! 
7558 4 Found a ring that I lost 10 years ago in an old purse. Michigan Jewelers made it look like new (I really should have taken a "before" picture). The guys at Michigan Jewelers could write a book about good old fashioned customer service and they are AWESOME!!!! 
7559 4 I've been to a few of the Mahoney's Garden Centers and this one is my favorite. The staff is incredibly helpful, the selection is good and it's in a nice location. Linda and Abby at the front register are terrific! 
7560 2 Food was OK. Specials were interesting. Staff was great. Price was a little high for what was received. 
7561 3 Sunday pizza delivery at Lake Forest Community pool. Delivery showed up under 30 min. Thin pizzas, hot hogies, and knots were great. 
7562 4 I simply love this place. I lunch here frequently. So far everything ive tried has been yummy and fresh. The staff are very warm and always with a smile! Try the chicken salad, you wont be dissatisfied 
7563 3 Genie's was great. I went with 4 people on a Sunday and it was crowded but it didn't take too long to seat us. Pretty solid brunch choice as far as SE goes. 
7564 1 Chicken and beef teriyaki combo. Veggies were mushy, chicken and beef were ok-- at least they tasted different from each other. Ended up feeding most of my veggies to the ducks. Iced green tea was mostly flavorless. 
7565 4 Best delivery service that I've had in a long time! They delivered within 30 min and the food was hot and fresh. They whole order was correct, nothing missing (which is rare for delivery restaurants). The portions were big enough to eat for my lunch and dinner :) 
7566 2 A bit overrated, nice german food buffet, how much sausage can you really eat? Creampuffs bigger than your head, really it's either sausage or a creampuff, both is too much. 
7567 4 Definitely go! Extremely low prices and good quality. I bought bananas at .29/lb and apples for .49/lb both were top quality and delicious. There is limited variety of food but its worth going to get whatever fresh and frozen fruits and veggies that they have. 
7568 3 Burrito tastes good, but please don't let the new person roll my burrito ! I paid for it so please have someone who has been through the training session to roll my burrito. Burritos taste amazing though. 
7569 4 Delicious donuts that know what they're doing and that is being delicious. Also, I feel it important to note that the guy helping me was like a hipster Zac Efron. 
7570 2 We were told the wait was 20 minutes... over an hour ago. There are a dozen other breakfast spots on this street, I wish I hadn't wasted my time waiting for this one. The food is fine, but in this neighborhood, not worth the wait. 
7571 3 It's Tokyo Joe's. Healthy "fast" food. Good tasting too. I guess that's all I have to say. It shouldn't be tough to convince someone to go try a fast food restaurant, should it? We hit this place when we need food quick and don't feel like cooking. 
7572 4 Fast, friendly and reasonable prices through my autobody shop. They've always had availability despite calling laat minute. 
7573 3 The place is quiet and will meet your expectations. The staff are excellent. The snacks were a miss for me, but that may be personal preference. 
7574 3 The AM drive-thru staff are such sweethearts, it's a pleasure to see them first thing in the morning. This particular dunks is my favorite 
7575 4 Why I like D & W: -good coffee -wide variety of beverages - nice, clean, well kept spot -house made chai latte, amazing! 
7576 3 Great date place. Wayy better than what used to be here before....that for sure. Fun food, great service, will definitely come back again. Some of the food quality could be a tab better though. Also really appreciate the valet parking here not being a rip off!! 
7577 1 One meal was enough here. The food was ok but very salty, even for chinese. The service was good, if not overly helpful. The best part is they have homemade noodles that are pretty good. But steer clear of the moo shi...get it some place else. 
7578 1 Shanes is NOT a great BBQ joint. The pulled pork taste as if it has been frozen and lacks flavor. The service at this location is poor compared to other locations I've been to. 
7579 4 Fast and prompt service. Sometimes when I'm an idiot and forget to get my show clothes cleaned they will bend over backwards to help out. They clean everything from rigs to comforters to even my agents back drop. Great customer service! 
7580 0 服务态度很差，早茶也就那样吧。Just so so，food is not very good as a Chinese. The service is very bad. Won't come again 
7581 3 Great food, a little pricey for me but I'm cheap!:). I was looking for good empanada and these hot rhe spot!! 
7582 0 Do NOT waste your time with this facade of a company and don't read any positive reviews. Move on. 
7583 2 Generic ice cream. Cute set up, lots of flavors and a decent price. Just nothing spectactular 
7584 4 I've been seeing these doctors for a few years now. Don & Jilma are very caring professional and thorough when performing exams. They insure you understand every procedure they perform. I highly recommend them for your eye care needs. Both are also veterans of our armed forces. 
7585 4 This place has awesome chicken and sides. Good customer service and it was busy mt food still came out on time. 
7586 3 Lobster ravioli is fantastic, the bartender, Craig is top notch. Atmosphere and cleanliness is five stars, of the two times eating here, three of our four items were very good and one.....not so much. Thus four stars. 
7587 4 You have to love this place. I have been coming for years. The neighborhood falls apart yet this place stays and stays busy at lunch. Staff super friendly. Always make you feel welcome. 
7588 4 Prompt, fast, cheap, and good. What more could you ask for? 
7589 4 Best donuts in Portland. I like voodoo for the novelty and the whole Portland experience but blue star donuts is for the foodie. Maple bacon donut is classic, however my favorite was the salted caramel donut. Delicious! 
7590 4 I love this place. I've been coming here for the past 5 years. The best pizza and subs in the area. I just wish I lived closer to D&A... The staff is always very friendly and super fast. I highly recommend the D&A House of Pizza! 
7591 4 Brought my girlfriends new car here because there was a recall of some kind. The service was quick, confident and with an amazing level of follow through. Who walks away from a car servicing appointment with a wow feeling inside? Somehow, we did! Way to go, guys! 
7592 1 Nice atmosphere but long wait for food and bathroom is one toilet per sex. Bathroom not clean, yuk 
7593 4 Just completed my CHL training with Velocity Works. This is a first class operation for experienced or novice shooters. 
7594 4 Worttttth every penny of the hype. 
7595 4 My favorite Thai restaurant in NE Portland! Great food - easy takeout or dine in. Really friendly owners/staff. Can't beat the prices. Oh, and, the food is authentic Thai! I love it! 
7596 1 Was disappointed at the blueberry Napoleon, the puff pastry was so soggy and chewy that you couldn't cut through it. It was a mess to eat. The matcha red bean cake was average. 
7597 2 The store has a lot of great things and is in a great location. Don't come to the printing dept if you are in a hurry but they will get it done for you. Know exactly what you want or this could take even longer. 
7598 3 I'm from rom Houston Tx, so I'm picky with my Mexican food. First test is the great salsa and chips. Chips were crispy not stale. Clean restaurant and friendly staff. Horchata was on point! Fast service. Will definitely come again. 
7599 3 yum. in the high $ range. good service. been there 3x. hint: if there's a line, see about sitting at the bar. 
7600 0 Poor and rude service. This is not a place to spend your good money only to have poor service. 
7601 4 Jocelyn was phenomenal!! I hadn't felt that good in years after my massage. My shoulders and neck were so tight, after i left Revive they were not. I would highly recommen Revive and Jocelyn. Thank you and i look forward to my next appointment. 
7602 3 Great little spot. Walked in off the street without a reservation and we were seated immediately. The menu is always changing depending on the season. I'd love to go back. 
7603 3 Great Indo-chinese food. Often come here when we're in this area shopping. On our mist recent visit, waiter Manny made some great food recommendations. 
7604 4 Absolutely delicious and affordable! Had the Pho Nam and it was enough for two meals and was only $7!!! 
7605 4 George was s wonderful waiter. He was attentive and entertaining. He made our experience extra special. The food here is fresh and delicious. Love it!! Will be back next time we are in Orlando. 
7606 3 The Vegas roll is fire!!!! I seem to always be pulled here when I'm in the area. The are always nice and seems to be helpful. The prices aren't that bad for the order size, always grab some sticky mayo to go too! 
7607 3 Everything you could possibly want in a dive diner for a hangover breakfast. Eggs benedict, steak, pork chops, coffee, hash browns, and coffee. 
7608 4 Had Steelhead for Portland dining month. It was the best fish I have had during this dining month. Oba always delivers. One restaurant we recommend and always enjoy. 
7609 3 Great tacos (fried green tomato), great service, bottomless mimosas, and reservations at 12:30 on Sunday. Perfection. I'll be back 
7610 3 Papis is really good for lunch or dinner if you are in the mood for drinks and sandwiches. I would strongly recommend you steer clear of the margaritas (they are syrupy, sour, and too sweet). However, the mojito is very good. 
7611 0 Very, very poorly run and equally disappointing produce. There were numerous problems with getting my delivery and when I would get it, I'd have to throw out part of it because it was rotten and moldy. 
7612 4 The flavors are amazing. I love it. I wish I could get it in NJ. I'm going to see if my local grocery store can get them. 
7613 4 Hidden Gem! Fantastic find. I had the Pastrami Burger! My friend had the Chicago Dog. OMG! Outstanding! Kicks Ass and Balls! 
7614 1 Owner seems nice but very disorganized. Lost my paperwork, never called me with updates, had to keep calling him myself even after the car was finished. Work they did was ok, but it took them way too long. I wouldn't go back there. 
7615 4 I've been to this salon for haircut and spa for a couple times, and I was really happy about my experiences! Great service and the staffs are friendly. Will definitely go back. 
7616 0 Food cost $53 to feed our family of 7. Employee made very rude comments to my Mother with head manager right there. Salad was nasty and food cold. Used to love Wendy's but this one is awful. Won't go back. 
7617 3 My friends and I love ths t place. It s small and no fancy but who cares, we come for the food and it s amazing. Be ready to use your fingers to eat 
7618 3 The margherita was absolutely delicious. Full of flavor and toppings. The garlicky flavor was a wonderful touch. The pepperoni was mediocre in comparison. Not too different from your other pizza joints. I love how the pizza slices are rebaked before they are served to guarantee the taste. 
7619 3 The Belgium waffle really tasted like french toast in waffle form. The grapefruit mimosa divine. 
7620 3 Great sports bar with awesome beer selection and choice wings! Wait staff also quite friendly. 
7621 4 Really amazing staff and place. Everything you could want in a game store and/or place to game. 
7622 1 The restaurant is loud. The food is complex but lacks depth. I don't recommend for the cost. 
7623 0 I don't care what your beer selection is, if you only have one toilet in the place I won't spend my happy hour here, cause when a girls gotta go a girls gotta go. PERIOD! 
7624 4 Love love this place!! Haven't been in a long time...grew up here and Peabody is a Great place, so many good memories. And the food is better than ever!! Place is comfortably packed on a Thursday night. Everyone fat and happy 
7625 4 Tons of tvs, excellent wings. Perfect place to watch a game. 
7626 4 Same owners as Tavola and the food showed it. Pizza was perfect. Get there early. Awesome service as well. 
7627 3 Great Bar specials- 25 cent wings and 2.99 pizzas were very good...Bartender was very attentive and friendly, I would definitely recommend this place for a good affordable lunch. 
7628 4 Incredibly fresh, modern feel. Large photos, lots of natural light and epic lights. Food is fantastic. Love their chips and guac. 
7629 4 Decent food at the French Quarter. Had breakfast many morning during our stay. I loved the free refills for drinks which we used when ever we were around. 
7630 3 A little dive spot near Quincy Market. The Shepards Pie and Irish Spring Rolls were awesome. My boyfriend had the Irish Steak Tips with Irish sausage and bacon. He loved it. 
7631 4 Atmosphere is more sketchy then salt and straw but much better ice cream. The vanilla was my favorite 
7632 4 Good and lovely place. I order the red curry and Thai silk mile tea. The red curry test just fablous & the milk tea is also taste really well. By the way the staff is super friendly and nice. 
7633 4 When you're in Portland and need to find that vegan thing you can't find anywhere else, Food Fight should be your first stop. Also, they have vegan soft serve, which means I would be in terrible shape if I lived closer. 
7634 3 Blue Ginger is my go to neighborhood Asian fusion place. I can and often do eat here a few times each week. The sushi is always fresh, the service is friendly and helpful, the entrees are interesting and the fried rice is the best I've ever had. 
7635 4 A liquor store with a rewards program is ok in my book. In addition to that, Superior has a huge selection of wine, beer, and liquor. They have everything you could possibly need. The staff is friendly and helpful too (if you need help). 
7636 2 It's alright! I wasn't impressed. I think this place is highly overrated and overpriced. I had a catfish sandwich that was more bread than anything. The little tiny piece of fish that was hidden inside the roll was so small I could barely taste it. 
7637 4 Love this place! Me and my husband cannot get enough, their tortilla soup is soo delicious as well as the sour cream enchiladas!!! Wait staff at this location is soo nice! Especially chris! We love him as our waiter 
7638 3 Good, simple Greek fare. Good prices. Ample portions. Friendly staff. Big, fat gyro sandwiches. The dolmas are probably canned, though. All in all, pretty good. 
7639 3 I must say, this is the better of the 3 CVS in the area. Courteous, helpful and friendly best describe them 
7640 3 I really liked this place and would love to go back again.....Great burger in Atlanta. I love local and organic. 
7641 0 I was shocked at how terrible their customer service was. The woman I talked to was very condescending and even told me to go somewhere else when I was just hoping to have a vehicle inspection before driving across country. I am definitely taking my business somewhere else. 
7642 0 This place sucks. I had to go all the way home because they decided that shorts wernt "appropriate" for the club. Duck 5hat. I just wanted to wear shorts because its to hot to wear pants. Wtf 
7643 4 Awesome food Price was great Staff was super friendly and helpful! Got the special of the day and the porchetta sandwich with salad and soups and everything was wonderful and full of flavour! Great selection of unique beverages as well 
7644 0 The worst ever. I appreciate local stories, urban legends, a little tasting.. I am not looking for professionals like Guy Fieri with lots of food of 3D quality. Just help me like you. But NO. They are a complete waste of time, money and worst ever, mood. 
7645 4 I had to update after receiving one call from the restaurant this morning, and another email from the manager, asking us how the service and food went. Talk about dedication about giving great service! 5 stars for you, Coast Restaurant! 
7646 4 Great food and great service! Lots of cool twists on grilled cheese, all served with delicious tomato soup. Everything we ordered was delicious!! Good choices for kids too. Can't wait to go back to try some of the other grilled cheese flavors!!! 
7647 4 Thank you so much!! Jillian was so helpful with everything, the Financial situation following the funeral was no easy task but thanks to the selflessness and kindness of Cota funeral we were able to somehow make this work financially!! Cannot express how thankful I am.. 
7648 3 Awesome place to visit on a lazy day! The UBC campus is like a small town and the Beaty is worth a visit 
7649 4 Been doing business with Mike over 5 years. They are reasonably priced and very responsive. I highly recommend them. Thanks, Mike! 
7650 0 Incredibly horrible and disrespectful service from the floor manager and one of the female servers. 
7651 4 I go to dependable cleaners for my dry cleaning and they never fail. They are quick Prompt. And always do an excellent job. Never a lost article and never a hard time. Love it!! 
7652 4 I loved the decor and the food was affordable! My new go-to on Manor. :) 
7653 4 Wow this place is amazing. both my favorite carts are in the same pod big egg and prickly ash both amazing. 
7654 4 Delicious! Great food in prime location. The flavors are authentic with a little adaptation to accommodate all! 
7655 4 Can't beat the views of the waterfront! Great wine and food. We love this place on nice Portland days! 
7656 3 how can I get my hands on a bottle of that sauce????? I considered assault & robbery today, it was that good. simple, fresh & only $5. duh, winning! the line was not long when I went.... 
7657 4 Most history tours are cheesy to me. This tour was not at all. Between the actors, hologram and talking portraits I was never bored. Bill, our guide, was excellent. Huzzah! 
7658 2 Food was just okay for me, meat was dry and not very good. Very nice people though. Wouldn't go back to eat but would stop by to say hello. 
7659 0 Wow what happened to the seats? They are extremely uncomfortable and definitely not worth coming back! 
7660 4 Love the grilled chicken and onions, black beans and yellow rice! Their shredded pork is really good. The good here is so flavorful! 
7661 0 NO go some where else any where else there is a jack in the box not to far. unless you want your diet to be lard fat and corn 
7662 2 It's Chili's! You should know what to expect. ...get your two for ones and chocolate volcano. 
7663 4 Service King and especially Rick at the location took great care of me and my car. They kept me informed along the way via text, email and phone calls. My car looks brand new again. 
7664 3 Little hole in the walll place with just a few tables. The watress was nice. The owner was walking around talking to everyone. Excellent food. Had the mushroom swiss burger and fries. That and iced, total with tip was $13. I would definitely recommend coming here. 
7665 4 Super cool! And beyond friendly! Food is awesome and so is the service! Went to other mellow mushroom and it sucked! If your looking for the true hip mellow mushroom experience it's worth the trip to come here no matter where your staying! 
7666 3 It's so refreshing seeing something that's so unique and tasty at the same time! You make your own pizza, chose a style and all the toppings you can thing of. Even if you're vegan, you can eat here. Enjoy the goodness of a fresh, hand crafted pizza. 
7667 4 Amazing Peruvian restaurant with great service and food. Plenty of choices from vegetarian to streak. Highly recommend! 
7668 3 Very satisfying lunch take-out. Easily the best fast Thai in the area. Plus, the old Thai woman who runs the show here is adorable. 
7669 2 Lamberts has a great deli but if you purchase the produce make sure to use it within three days. Same quality as the stuff at Quincy Market. The outdoor seasonal plants tend to be more expensive than most places. Pumpkins and Christmas trees are way overpriced. 
7670 4 Game On was such a fantastic venue to host a Summer Associate Event! We played ping pong and had delicious food! The service was fantastic. Will definitely be returning! 
7671 4 Such an amazing place! Everyone is so nice and my nails have never looked better! I highly recommend going! 
7672 4 Having tried nearly every pho place in Portland, this is the one we keep coming back to every other week. I've had most of the soups and several of the bun dishes. All of it great, fresh, and enough for 2 meals. Best in town! 
7673 3 Great meal. Tilapia with onions, tomatoes and garlic was great as was the veggie combo. Only flaw was the clearly bottled Italian dressing on the iceberg lettuce salad. Service was nice and atmosphere quaint. 
7674 4 great tacos, we end up here all the time- favorites include- Baja shrimp taco, green chile pork, trailer park, fried avocado. not my favorite for egg classics, but cant beat the specialty tacos or queso- kiddo loves the bean a cheese- 
7675 0 Terrible place. Would never go back there. They told us in line it was $20 and then after waiting in line for over 30 mins and then change the price to $25 once we get to the front. They were extremely rude, terrible customer service. I will not be back. 
7676 4 Amazing!! You must try the OMG French toast.... life changing. My husband is vegan and was able to enjoy a great meal. My toddlers were in pancake heaven. Great service. Slight wait time 20 minutes but totally worth it. 
7677 4 This theater has great food, delicious cocktails, clean seats, and super knowledgeable employees who were patiently helpful during transactions and indulged me In talking about the movie I saw afterward. A great way to watch movies! 
7678 4 Their migas tacos... best in Austin!!! My bf and I come here every chance we get. The tortas are huge and the quesadillas are enormous and stuffed with meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and sour cream. So yum!!!! 
7679 4 One of my favorite "special event" restaurants! Whether it's a birthday or any other celebration - there's always an excuse to visit! Endless "meat candy" as I call it. You can't beat the house sirloin. A definite must-visit! 
7680 0 The worst pizza I've ever had. The dough was thin and undercooked and there was alot of cheese and it was so greasy 
7681 4 I go here every time I'm in Boston! Try the lychee boba milk tea with extra lychee jelly :-) 
7682 4 Great Japanese Restaurant.....So Fresh and Eye Catching Display.....this place is 10+......Best Sushi & Sashimi in Central Texas or maybe best in Texas. 
7683 4 Their chimmichurri sauce was so good. Their empanadas was amazing. I would love to go back to try a churrasco steak with their sauce. I regret not ordering it and not going with a bigger appetite. 
7684 4 My favorite bubble tea in Austin! The boba really touches my heart. 
7685 1 If you are looking for a traditional Irish pub this is not it. If you don't smoke, this is not a place for you. If you want a local hangout off the bitten path, this is for you. 
7686 0 The chicken biryani was OK but the chicken tikka masala was horrible i won't come back again 
7687 2 Salad = Excellent Bread Sticks = Excellent Seafood Portofino = so so... 
7688 3 Very good service even when they are busy. Just a heads up to anyone needing to use American Express they do not except this form of payment, all others are fine though. Will visit them again soon. 
7689 1 While the staff was incredibly nice and friendly, just as we got our food our server told us about a giant fruit fly problem the restaurant had had the previous night. Maybe not the best thing to tell your customers. 
7690 3 I am blessed to live in the South End where there are soooo many great restaurants right out side my door. Thank goodness because I hate to cook. This place is one of my family's favorites. Good food, cocktails, beers, and service. 
7691 4 Excellent sushi. Really really fresh fish combined with a super small and cutesy space makes for an excellent experience! 
7692 4 Perfect hot day active play time. Took my 3 grandsons here this morning. Awesome! Lots of action in air conditioned comfort. Love it! 
7693 3 Reasonable prices for great coffee? Comfy leather chairs and outdoor seating? Friendly baristas? Fast and free wifi? That's a quadruple check, this place is wonderful and the fact that it's located in downtown Decatur is extra credit. 
7694 4 The service is friendly and the food is delish! the horchata iss very good and the flan! I ordered burritos and tacos and they were absolutely amazing! If you like spice they definerly deliver! 
7695 0 They don't put prices on their beers. That's just sleazy. And their selection is mediocre. Service is lazy and indifferent. These slugs will absolutely never get my business. What a bunch of louses. 
7696 2 This place delicious donuts and really good prices, I am a severe sweet lover and donut lover so this shop hit the spot :-) 
7697 3 Impeccable view of the Atlanta skyline. I suggest you go at night to see all the lights. Fun 15 minute ride 
7698 4 This is a favorite place to bring friends and relatives or to just go ourselves. The food is delicious and the staff is always top notch. 
7699 4 The ONLY UPS store that's open on Sundays in the Cambridge area. Great customer service from the owner himself. Allowed me to borrow a trolley to wheel my box over to the store from Harvard Square. 
7700 4 This is by far my favorite place to get a haircut and beard trim in Atlanta. The shop has a cool feel and Rolando and Leigh are awesome people and always very nice. I especially like the hot towels!!! 
7701 4 I love this place. Delicious food, large servings, tons of awesome veggie options, and super cheap (especially for lunch). What's not to love?! 
7702 4 Dr. Cynthia Vaughn is an outstanding person & a great chiropractor. I've been going to her for many years and recommend this practice to anyone in need of chiropractic treatment. 
7703 4 Gretchen did this bouquet for my friend's swearing-in ceremony(to become a US citizen). I just loved it and so did she! 
7704 1 Sauce was a bit thin and the pasta was undercooked. The service was great. They recooked the undercooked dish with no problems 
7705 4 Had the best time at Sampling Lab! Free samples are wonderful, but the staff was the best part. Had me laughing up a storm! I'm excited to make a Manhattan with my market maraschino cherry's! I would be back daily if I lived close by. Thanks for the smiles. 
7706 4 The line was long but the food was fast and high quality's the Impossible vegan burger was great and the fries were nice and crispy. I definite recommend and will be going again. 
7707 3 Great food! Great service! Waiter was attentive. We were a larger group for my friends birthday. I'd come back. Recommend checking it out. Restaurant is small though. Not a whole lot of seating. Make resos! 
7708 3 Great ambiance, great drinks, great patio. Drinks are a bit pricey but they are innovative and worth the price! Food is pretty good as well. Fried Oysters and the Peppered Ribeye is delicious! 
7709 1 I've frequented the US Cafe in Smyrna many times, and it's always been really good. This one was just not nearly as good. I probably won't be returning, even though I've moved nearby. :( 
7710 4 I may never fit into these jeans again. What a fantastic meal! The breading on the fish was perfectly crispy and the chips were delicious too. I'll definitely be back. 
7711 3 My sister, boyfriend, and I love Indian food and Masala Art is a great find. We just had a fantastic dinner. This place has the best garlic naan and veggie samosas! 
7712 3 I've been to Anh's Kitchen twice now and have been pleased both times. The clay pot combination was delicious. My second visit I got the pork banh mi and the fish sauce chicken wings. A little pricey compared to Pho King a few blocks away but worth a visit. 
7713 3 Very happy with our meal. Kid friendly, clean, good portions, fast and friendly service and yummy food! 
7714 4 This place is great. I did a walk in today for my eyebrows and it was only$6. The last did an excellent job. Not too thin or painful like everywhere else I went. 
7715 2 I am not a big fan. I think the food is too rich. I do enjoy the soup salad and breadsticks though. 
7716 4 Beef brisket rice and put a bit of hot sauce holy cow its amazing. Other than mui gardens curry beef brisket cant think of another place that is better. Not the most fancy place but its open late and very affordable. 
7717 4 I've been seeing Hahn for over a year now and she is fantastic. For once I actually feel like my hair isn't out of control! 
7718 4 Place is amazing ~ it's less than 10bucks but u get food thats worth 18. I'd definitely come here more frequently... This place is a gem 
7719 1 Customer service needs to be friendlier! Tomas from food didn't even say excuse me to my mom and almost pushed her. So not nice. I love that the restrooms are so clean and everywhere is clean. People need to smile more. 
7720 4 If you haven't had their Hi-Hat plate with pork, then you're missing out on a movement. I took a bite and forgot who I was for a minute. Yes, I think it's that delicious and I'll be back again next weekend. 
7721 4 Make sure to reserve. We loved every dish. We ordered the asado plate,duck, mushroom, summer vegi ceviche. The taste is so balanced. Good service. 
7722 4 AMAZING! $1/pound laundry and if you need last minute touch ups or alternations - Mai and her Mom take care of it fast and always does a great job. I love you Mai! 
7723 4 Loved this Resturant will be back next visit to Atlanta in June. Food was great, staff was attentive to needs only bummer was venue is quite later in the evening. This place was wonderful but very quite on Saturday considering they have entertainment 
7724 4 My go-to for Thai food in the Smyrna/Vinings area. Fresh ingredients, traditional and fusion-type dishes and rice, all quite tasty with decent sized portions. Decent atmosphere for dining in, very relaxing and comfortable seating. 
7725 2 I've been in contact with the company since my initial review and we were able to come to an agreement. I appreciate how willing they were to fix the issue. 
7726 4 I love their house chopped salad with slaw and pulled pork. It is amazing! Had it four times this year and I crave it until the nex time. Great upstairs space for casual lunch/dinner. 
7727 1 Look to the left. Suckered me in for the last time. Boy has this place gone down hill. You've brought be a cold dish - one that should be hot - once too many times, guys. Sorry - life's too short. 
7728 1 The general tso's chicken was not great, it was very fatty like not quality meat. The rice was good and the crab wontons were good. 
7729 4 Delicious. Best Reuben in town. This is one of my favorite places on the Drag and in Austin. It is such a chill and friendly atmosphere with good food, good drinks, love music... Very Austin. 
7730 4 Food, food, food Wine, wine, wine Drink, drink, drink Desert, desert, desert Yum, yum, yum If you're told to wait more than 10 min, go somewhere else because theres so many places. 
7731 3 It's such a shame that this place is so hard to get to unless you're heading east on 4th in a car, cause they make a mean Americano. Sometimes I go out of the way just to get it, but I don't always have the extra time. 
7732 4 I absolutely loved the salmon on a plank. The best one I ever had. It was moist. And I couldn't stop eating it. The ambiance is wonderful. Loved playing the foosball table. The staff there is extremely friendly. I can't wait to go back since we are annual pass holders 
7733 4 Matthew does it again. He comes highly recommended. He never disappoints. I choose only to go if he is working. 
7734 4 Wahlburgers is a very cool hamburger place for the whole family. It has an extensive menu including delicious salads. The food is excellent and their drinks are awesome! 
7735 3 Excellent chicken Parmesan, fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and herb roared chicken dinners. We we searching up and down International Drive and this restaurant had plenty of seats. Great service and atmosphere in a smaller eating area. We Will definitely eat here again. 
7736 0 Terrible service! They sent us a free pizza coupon but then refused to honor it. On top of that was met by extreme unprofessionalism by a woman working on the phones. Will never use this establishment after the the way I was spoken to on the phone, 
7737 2 It's a 3 star steak house. It's between a Longhorn/Outback and a higher end such as Ruth's Chris/Rathbun. Price point is appropriate for the rating. Excellent service. 
7738 0 I'm happy to announce that they paid for the towing of my daughter's car and gave her a $50 gift card for her troubles. 
7739 2 Entrees are excellent. Innovative and delicious. I do not recommend dessert. They have been hit and miss with their storing methods. They do have one of the best brunches around. Lunch is always fast. 
7740 4 I've used Frankenstein for a variety of computer issues, and they have always fixed the problem when they said they would have it fixed for the price they quoted me. Everything from broken computers to helping me with password problems.] Highly recommended. 
7741 4 Just had a wonderful lunch. Highly recommend the deviled eggs, fried chicken sandwich, and grilled cheese (smoked brisket) sandwich. The service was excellent. We couldn't have been happier. We will be back! 
7742 3 We've purchased patio furniture and our in ground pool from scioto valley. Really pleased with service and quality of everything bought here. 
7743 4 Best ox tail I have ever had! Ended up getting a to-go of the same thing after! Meat was tender and cooked well. The sauce used was perfect (not too sweet, salty, or hot). 
7744 3 For sushi delivered quickly yet effectively, it is awesomely outrageous. Recommended to you all. 
7745 4 Great atmosphere, awesome equipment. The instructors are very knowledgable and very encouraging. Best of all they promote veganism! Beyond Fit is where it's at. 
7746 4 Excellent! Fast, Friendly service and they gave me a sick vehicle upgrade. Drop-off is obscenely quick. Zero hassles using a debit card at the counter as well- just show your round trip flight. 
7747 3 Rockin ruthanne, queso, the straight plate. Hands down best in austin. Kid/family friendly. Covered patio. Too good 
7748 1 Used to come here all the time. No longer a fan. Got food poising after I ate a burger. Wouldn't want to or recommend for anyone to come here. Plus all the menu is just burgers. 
7749 1 Food was below average. Our waitress was rude and annoyed by her job. The ugly burgundy carpet was dirty and sticky. Food was overpriced for a below average restaurant in Revere! The manager was nice. 
7750 3 I think the description of "experience" is very appropriate for this attraction. Usually there is a really short wait for the experience so this one is great to do as a filler rider. Takes about 15 minutes all together but worth going on once. 
7751 3 Good, cheap option for a quick meal before heading for the theater. I usually get a steak taco and rice which fills me up. 
7752 3 I would give them 5 stars, except that it is a mile from my house and does not deliver to me. Everything else is what you would expect from a jimmy johns, great subs fast... 
7753 3 Good, authentic Taiwanese beef noodles. $10.75 per bowl. Costs an extra $1 for wide noodles. 
7754 0 They're upping the rake again. $7 max plus 2$. So bad for the poker community. The management doesn't give a shit about the players. It's pretty obvious, they're trying to kill poker. 
7755 4 Tried their regular and gluten free pizza. Loved them both. Best gluten free my husbands ever had! 
7756 4 Just wonderful! From the location to the atmosphere to the food. A fun place to grab lunch or dinner. Really like their kraut-brat ball appetizer. Cabbage rolls, yum! The hofbrau schnitzel was delicious too. Can't wait to go back! 
7757 4 I love this studio! There are so many different classes, instructors and times to choose from! The heated classes are also very good, yet not too warm like some other studios around town. 
7758 3 Barking crab it is a lively bar on the water. Great drinks including the crabby margarita. The Rhode Island calamari is great. 
7759 4 Service was phenomenal...I recommend the trout and the corn soufflé. The view to The OK Cafe is my only knock on the place. I love great service so that trumps the bad view for me. 
7760 4 Best burger I've ever had. The texture and flavor was perfect. I had The Bender. Can't wait to go back and try the others. Fries were great too! 
7761 4 Amazing sushi!! We went on Valentine's Day with our 6 month old son and they were so accommodating. Free champagne for couple too!! Highly recommend this restaurant can't wait to go back!! 
7762 4 I've never called restaurant back to compliment them on their food before but I told the person on the phone that the food was "insanely good". Very fast and for the amount of food you get, it's absolutely worth the money. 
7763 3 This was actually a really funny and informative experience. A bit pricy maybe but worth the hour spent in the tour. 
7764 3 They are consistently good. Excellent noodles and dumplings - which can see them preparing in house. I think their Peking Duck is consistently one of the best I've ever had; and is offered at a very reasonable price. 
7765 4 Great place and great customer service burgers are are always juicy not much more I can ask for...great job guys 
7766 4 Great prime rib, not cheap but worth the money. I always try to stop in at least once when I'm in town. 
7767 4 A weekly eat. Absolutely one of our favorite places. Good portions with good prices. Make sure you try the coconut chicken soup! 
7768 4 Great food, the best meat in town. The service was great. Drinks were delicious. Overall a great experience. If I had to be picky, it was a little loud at dinner, it was hard to hear each other. 
7769 3 This location is really nice. A very cute boutique with very unique items. The store is running a very good sale at this moment so got myself some cool stuff for a very affordable price. I highly recommend you stop by, you will find something cute to wear for sure. 
7770 3 Very good. Beautiful view: ask for at table by the window when you book. Impeccable service. The lamb was amazing. The Opera desert is worth a detour!! 
7771 3 They are picking up their speed on making shakes...nice to see...catching up to Davie St location ...nice store...great location 
7772 4 Fantastic little deli type place. Really similar to Panera but the staff is extremely kind and helpful. Lots of food for a great price. 
7773 4 Pulled pork sliders and sweet potato fries! Yum! 
7774 3 Extremely knowledgeable waitress, huge portions & great food. The pineapple cider was amazing. Would definitely recommend visiting for drinks, food & friendly atmosphere. 
7775 4 Had a great time! very novice paddlers and received great instruction and support from the staff. Lovely area to paddle too!!! Will definitely be back! Thank you! 
7776 3 Had broccoli cheddar soup and turkey flatbread, we ordered for 3 people, wait time at the window after I paid was about 6 mins,. Food was good though 
7777 4 Wonderful place for a light meal in the Village! Great pizza, sandwiches and salads. Delicious coffee and they have homemade ice cream! We go here often for our business meeting! Quaint and Cozy. Indoor our outdoor seating. 
7778 1 The food is mediocre. I don't understand how they have such great ratings. Their steak with special sauce was bland, super chewy(couldn't eat some pieces), and really lacked flavor. The flan was good and their tres leches cake was alright. The waitresses were kind of rude. Wouldn't return here. 
7779 4 Pretty good little breakfast spot. Fairly fast and reasonably priced! Wide had the French toast. Challah bread was tasty. My omlette was delicious. Definitely worth the visit. 
7780 0 Extremely rude staff at the shipping and mailing department. After too many sour interactions, I'm not going back there anymore. I will say the older man who works there is very kind, but will drive farther for consistently better service! 
7781 4 Food is delicious! Service is good. Usually a bit less crowded than the competition. My new go to place in Chinatown. 
7782 4 Came to grab some beers with my friends. Very friendly host and waitress. Large beer selection and the food looks pretty good. I was pretty suprised to see the low yelp rating after the experience. 
7783 4 Incredible lunch today. Spur of moment decision and we loved it. Will be back. Lamb Gyro and Salad. Very clean and elegant place. Relaxing. 
7784 4 Best pharmacy in the Portland Metro area. Staff is knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly. Highly recommend these guys. 
7785 4 While riding the am track across the states this was our number one pizza joint. Guy made us a fresh pepperoni and we ate it on the curb. 3 years later we are still wanging on about it. 
7786 1 Nice place but not so much on the food I had beef fired rice ... got fired rice and some small pieces of beef more like rice fired rice dont waste you money Go to twin lion up 183 @ breaker ln much better 
7787 4 Supreme Skillet is amazing!! Very good and large portion. Great service!! 
7788 3 Visited Mudra for the first time this past weekend and was really happy. I received a deep tissue massage from David and will definitely ask for him again. 
7789 1 Although the food always tastes good, the price keeps going up while the portion size keeps going down. I bought the grilled honey chicken salad for $12.99 It came with 3oz. Of chicken.. It used to be worth the money.. Not so much now-a-days. 
7790 4 We moved here from Tucson, AZ. The staff Tiffany and Jess were so knowledgable and comforting with both of my sensitive pups. I will continue to visit them! 
7791 4 Delicious pizza, tons specialty pizza as well as "make your own". One of my favorites is the Funky Q Chicken. It has chicken, bbq, bacon, onions, mozz and cheddar cheese. 
7792 3 The coffee is great. The breakfast tacos are very good and reasonable priced. The staff is great. The coffee shop has a cool vibe. Good music and nice layout of place. Close to work. Overall, good experience. 
7793 3 Though the service is hit or miss, the Super Bowl is always a healthy food hit. The margaritas are also pretty good. And the back patio is great in the summer and fall. Definitely give their hot sauces a hit to add some serious zing. 
7794 3 I have only had a Cubano here so far, but it was pretty damn good. The menu looks good, sandwiches, yucca frita, vaca frita, open 7 days a week - I will be back very soon. Glad to have them in the neighborhood. 
7795 4 Great food & service. Bianca pizza with fresh heirloom tomatoes and blueberry salad with Gorgonzola a must try. Can't wait to come back. 
7796 3 Great view of Buckhead ATL. Beautiful Spanish/Morroccan-themed decor. Music was wonderful. Service is okay, nothing noteworthy in that aspect. The crowd is okay, kind of all afraid to mingle. Otherwise good place to go with a group of friends just looking to share bites and drinks with each other. 
7797 1 Very average kung pao chicken, should have passed on the pork fried rice- didn't even finish it, Waitress asked how was everything, seeing uneaten PFR, said it didn't taste good, she kinda smiled an uncomfortable smile, still charged me for it. Won't be going back anytime soon 
7798 4 Friendly service, fantastic creamy latte, super tasty fruit smoothie (something like strawberry, banana, lime, blueberry), and my god the jalapeño waffle. Think able sharing the waffles though, they are gigantic. 
7799 2 After the long line, I expected good food (which I got) but it was cold and the atmosphere made us feel rushed. A bit pricey for me, but quality ingredients and unique menu items add to what makes this place popular. 
7800 4 Really great service, family owned and operated. We had the antipasto and a flatbread, and the best cannoli ever! Everything was excellent, definitely will be going back 
7801 4 Amazing Veggie Nachos! It was 7.99 and the plate was good size. They even had squash and peppers in it! I will be back! 
7802 4 Very cute store with all you stationary needs. Fun whimsical products as well as those obscure writing items. Writing will never be a lost art with places like this. The staff was super welcoming and friendly as well. 
7803 3 They promptly addressed my concern and were able to accomodate a revisit smartly. The later blow out was done really well and so I beleive they made up for the issues. 
7804 4 The best pancake specials I have seen a long time! Carmel apple, raspberry cheesecake and pumpkin cheesecake. Delicious! 
7805 4 Just love this place. Doesn't hurt it's a block from work. Always always smiling. Great food for a very reasonable cost. She has a great returning customer clientele. That says something!!! 
7806 3 Dominos has done an incredible job of reinventing themselves over the past few years. If you haven't tried them lately, you haven't tried them. 
7807 0 It took them 2 hours to deliver my food was cold and nasty I had to begged them to come up to my apartment door Never again 
7808 4 This is a great place to get a great lunch and is very fast and convenient for people who work downtown. Great food, fast service and very friendly staff. 
7809 4 Very quick and friendly service! Ordered lobster and shrimp very tasty and reasonably priced. 
7810 3 I've been getting delivery from here for a couple years. The food is excellent. Tasty Pizza & Subs. Friendly & efficient over the phone Great Mussels !! 
7811 3 Pretty good dumplings, simple because they only serve dumplings. And surprisingly no one Asian works there. 
7812 1 Mediocre food and slow service makes for a very overpriced and disappointing Disney dining experience. Would not recommend and will not come again. The bison Is worse than a poorly done tough and chewy sirloin, not at all as advertised. 
7813 4 Beautiful day for a walk and a little snack at Kenny Centre. Picked up a couple of sweets at Belle's Bread! Quick service, sweets aren't too heavy, Yummy! 
7814 4 Great kabob subs and the souvlaki is awesome. Also highly recommend the fresh haddock sandwhich w/cheese and tartar. 
7815 4 Was a cool little spot my nephew (who's 11) told us to try since it's his favorite place and we are from out of town. The spot was small and had a great atmosphere. The service was great and so was the good! I was really impressed. 
7816 2 Just ok, they usually play old and new movies, very clean, nice staff. Just no IMAX and no alcohol 
7817 3 I went to the happy hour here. It was yummy. Some of the highlights were the brussels sprouts and any sushi pieces we ordered. Seriously an average-looking sushi piece will taste absolutely amazing here. Go here! ...but stick to happy hour if you're watching your wallet. 
7818 4 I have been going to Ken's for many years. The food is wonderful, parking is another story. This is a small price to pay for food like Ken's though. 
7819 3 Delicious Mexican food. Huge but tasty burrito. Try the red salsa. Spicy but good flavor. Friendly staff. Delicious fresh guacamole & homemade tortillas. 
7820 4 Best nails so far!! I didn't even have to go home and fix them! Teu is amazing. Ask for her. It's pronounced like the number 2. 
7821 4 I stopped in a few days ago for the first time to take a quick look and ended up staying there for an hour. Everything was affordable and trendy with out trying to hard. I will definitely be back. 
7822 2 We've been back a few times since the time when I reviewed above. It was back up to my original expectations....decent service, decent sushi selection that was fresh enough :-) Glad, b/c it's one of the closes conveyor belt places near our house and my daughter LOVES sushi! 
7823 0 ghetto!! DIRTY!!!! The water is disgusting. Avoid this place. 
7824 4 The food here is AMAZING!! Heather is always serving up amazing dishes with a smile. Such sweet owners, and awesome staff. Will definitely be frequenting this establishment. 
7825 1 The food was average, drinks were overpriced but good, the servers came and went and disappeared, we sat at our table an hour and a half before our order was taken. It was horrible service for over priced, underwhelming food. 
7826 2 Amelia's is definitely a greasy spoon type of breakfast spot but the food is pretty decent and the prices are good. The service is pretty speedy too. It's quite the local spot and I enjoy it way more than going to one of the chain brekky places. 
7827 2 I highly recommend the Ahi Tuna burger. This hearty burger has a nice spicy taste from all of the wasabi, with the clean crisp taste of the cool slices of ginger. 
7828 0 Worst service I've ever experienced.They looked like I was bothering them or was asking for free food. The food was served cold 
7829 4 The food here was awesome and reasonably priced. I would definitely go back if I lived closer. 
7830 3 Who knew pasta and meatballs could be so good. Maggianos is a great restaurant for large groups. The family style is fantastic. Great selection of wines. For a downtown location, parking is easy. 
7831 3 After getting myself readjusted at my awesome chiropractor, I was pleased to discover that this place is in the same lot. Tried the ham sandwich with the gouda spread. Very tasty indeed. Perhaps after tomorrows appointment I will try something on the sweeter side. 
7832 4 This place is a total dive, but I love it! The bartenders are usually pretty generous with their pours and karaoke is always super entertaining. 
7833 4 Don't let the appearance fool you! They have great food at reasonable prices. The breads are freshly made daily and to die for. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is cool. 
7834 3 Low-priced drinks. Nice and dark. Downstairs consists of a long and narrow path. There's an open air area up stairs with some picnic tables before another dark and narrow area upstairs. We sat at the tables and there was no one around us. 
7835 3 Huge portions. Had wings, waffle fry nachos, fried pickles, white pizza, Philly cheese steak, fish and chips and lasagne (quite the variety) and everyone enjoyed their meal. We ordered way too much!! 
7836 0 Extremely rude, and appalling low in professionalism, run business like a mafia 
7837 4 The new location- wow! Same great food.... Even better atmosphere. U can't get brought of the waffles!!!! 
7838 4 Wonderful experience! A true taste of France. Staff is friendly, accommodating, and energetic. The ambiance is great and the food is superb!! 
7839 4 Nancy truly is the best I got a full set and got exactly what I wanted will continue to come here! 
7840 4 My favorite place for waffles! It's about $10 for a half order which is one waffle which is plenty! Reasonably priced and the service is amazing. I went on a Tuesday morning and there was no wait. This is my favorite location for waffle window. 
7841 3 This place was amazing. The food spectacular , and the price even better. Everything was on point and the service was great. Happy hour was a plus! 
7842 0 Don't do it. Don't. Do it. Two hours after ordering my pizza I call and I'm told, yeah we can't do that now. And then I'm hung up on. No lie. Don't even look at this place when you're thinking about ordering pizza. They don't deserve your consideration. 
7843 3 The reviews about the workers not speaking english is really funny to me. You know you're in Chinatown right?! 
7844 3 Second time we have ever had Thai food and it was amazing! Loved the vegetable tofu curry stew with rice and the chicken vegetable noodle dish. We are trying to find parking right now to eat there again! 
7845 4 So happy that there is a Chinese hand pulled noodle place in austin! The hand pulled noodle is amazing here, very authentic!! The noodle tastes as good as the ones i had in china and in NYC! the ambiance is great, and good service as well. 
7846 0 Went to this place last night for my birthday it was so crowded could barely move wanted to play pool but that place was so packed was not even going to wait so we left what a waste of time 
7847 4 This place was great! I loved the aesthetic on the interior, and the food was amazing also. Nice staff! 
7848 4 Great Moving Experience!! I hate moving and they made my move nice and easy, and they were not a bunch of crack heads like the last company I used before. Highly recommended!!!!!! 
7849 2 Drinks seemed a little overpriced, granted I didn't try their food but their description on the menu seemed appealing. Will go again just to try food next time and catch happy hour across the street. 
7850 4 This place has the most delicious Thai food. Actually, it's the best place to eat on the hill period, hands down. The owner is amazingly friendly and always remembers my name and order. I always recommend this place to people that are going to OHSU. 
7851 4 Our garage door had a snapped cable. We called and a technician came for same day service and completed within 30 min. It all works even better, even fixed our keyless entry. Great service with great Professionalism from tech Chris. Thanks Precision!! 
7852 4 Had a very nice meal on a busy Saturday night. We had made reservations and were seated promptly. Waitress was excellent. Food arrived fresh, hot and on time. 
7853 4 Possibly the best fried chicken I've ever tasted. Honey Mustard was incredible and gravy delicious. The concept is so well done from the decor, tables and the menu items. Another excellent creation from the makers of 4Rivers. 
7854 4 Very busy business but when I started eating I understood why... Had a summer sake (house sake with lemonade and strawberry purée) Wonton soup Ginger wings Everything was freshly made and still hot when it got to the table and very tasty! 
7855 4 Excellent Latin restaurant! We stopped in for lunch and had the Colombian burger and the Venezuelan Patacon. The service was great and the staff nice and professional, but the food itself sets this establishment apart. 5 stars! 
7856 3 Love it, love it, love it. It was fun. Our tour guide was hilarious and knowledgeable (i don't know a lot about beer). The cheapest attraction in Boston. Well worth the trip... 
7857 4 Pleasant experience while visiting The Parkview last week. Lots of wine options, including themed flights of wine! Staff was helpful and knowledgeable, prices reasonable! I look forward to returning every year for post holiday party hang with friends. 
7858 4 Great place and great food. Against all standards, this place gives you an unique experience to be at a place full of locals. Atmosphere cannot be match elsewhere! 
7859 4 Stopped in today for a few beers with a friend to catch up. Stacy was a complete delight. She was very sincere, genuine and made a personal connection. We will definitly make it a point to come back just for her again! 
7860 3 Really cool place! Go in and have a nice lunch with some wine and then take the chocolate tour. It's really informative and there is a little tasting at the end. Lasted about 55 min. Our tour guide Patty shared a lot of cool information in a very entertaining manner. 
7861 4 Recommended.. 1.) Some interesting combinations on the menu 2.) Good Service 3.) Not filled with twenty somethings whining that it is more expensive than a food truck. 
7862 4 Great Place!!!! I got the salmon burger w/ fries, onions rings and a strawberry milkshake. Impressed with the service and LOVED the food!!! 
7863 0 We have given them a lot of business, but will no longer. They damaged my husband's military uniform and were accusatory and non-apologetic in response. Terrible customer service - not the way to run a business! 
7864 3 It's great to walk in no appointment and get a pedi. Service was quality and fast! I'll be back again. I thought the price was reasonable as well. 
7865 4 Loved staying here! Everyone on the staff was totally upbeat and helpful (not always easy in the hospitality industry). And the beds were awesome... ultra comfortable and clean. The remodeling makes the place look like a million bucks... for a very affordable price. We'll go back. 
7866 4 Skip the cluster parking lot of the Home Depot on Ponce and come here instead. They have just about everything you could need, prices are good, everyone who works here is super friendly and helpful, and (for me) it is within walking distance! Can't beat it. 
7867 1 We paid $9 for a very small amount of chips and a trio of small sauces. We were charged $1 for each refill of chips. ~20 chips. 
7868 4 Delicious!!! Fast and friendly service too! I ordered the garlic chicken special over rice with sautéed zucchini. It also came with two pot stickers for $7.00. Cheap eats for good quality food. They do charge .50 cents for using your card though. Will come back again the food was amazing! 
7869 3 Tasty NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER, not too thick, but flavorful, briny broth, with a hint of bacon. CHIPS, so good and plentiful. Took home. LOBSTER ROLL, good. OYSTERS, loved! 
7870 4 Cozy and delicious! I have a gluten allergy, which the staff was able to easily accommodate. The restaurant has a gluten free menu (much of which is available on the buffet). Overall friendly staff and delicious food! 
7871 3 Solid fried chicken sandwich for a petty good lunch! I tried out the hot chick (*immature chuckle*) and found it perfect. Nice sized chicken, great hot sauce, amazing sweet potato fries. All in all, a great lunch if you're in the area! 
7872 0 Just called to get a price quote and talk about unfriendly. I'm sorry am I bothering you by asking questions? I told her no thank you I could tell by her unfriendly and put out attitude that I wanted nothing to do with them. 
7873 3 I rarely give 5 stars but this is dam close. Best brunch in Van and I am never disappointed here. Every dish I've had is great. Must have the belgian waffles and try ALL the dipping sauces. And the lavender mocha is tops. Bon Appetit 
7874 4 The best banana bread and chai tea latte of Cambridge. The crew is very friendly, and they have excellent service. 
7875 4 Great little hidden pub! The bartender gave me great directions here. Best home away from home for the weary traveler. 
7876 4 Love the vibe at School House. It's relaxed and I can actually hear and talk to the people I'm with. I especially like the happy hour specials, which are everyday and pretty varied. I can't remember the name of the drink with blackberries, but it was my favorite! 
7877 0 我今天带着一家人去吃饭，也是第一次去那边，因为是武汉人，别人推荐那边有不错的热干面和各种卤味，到了那边开始准备点单，结果也先付钱还有小费，想着如果一家人来吃就没有计较了，点了一份热干面，一份玉米肉粒饭和一份辣鸭脖，结果上菜的时候让我惊到了，玉米饭就是一层玉米糊肉放上面，跟什么一样，我跟我老婆看了一眼简直不能看，我想着竟然点了别浪费，最后确实事吃了几口实在太恶心了吃不下了，热干面呢不说难吃吧，反正作为一个武汉人是我长这么大吃过最难吃的了，鸭脖还是不错的，最后我们也没有胃口准备走人了，结果告知要自己收拾桌子，麻蛋的，我自己收拾那看你们小费干嘛？顺便说一下，连水也是要了才干的，我去，这个店发誓以后再也不会光顾，也不会推荐朋友去，没有服务就不要收小费写出来好吗？不正宗就留着忽悠忽悠老外，不评论了，花了30几刀吃了一肚子气！ 
7878 3 Gets crazy busy. Opens at 1130 and full by 1145. Service is quick. Informal setting, not a good choice for a meeting as very cramped and quick turnover. Nice that you can easily order extra noodles and broth. Noodles maybe not quite as good as Ramengers. 
7879 4 Very great staff, but they our stuff drinks beware, I never leave tipsy! Great food and relaxing ambiance but also dark inside at night But most importantly the Heath Ledger painting is so awesome! 
7880 4 Really good food and service. Fast even when busy. Can be a wait on the weekends, but worth it. Accomodates larger parties well. 
7881 3 Very nice and clean HEB! It was great. Oh and HUGE! 
7882 4 Everything at this place is great, it doesn't matter if you're getting breakfast or lunch! They have lots of gf options, including gf waffles! The servers are friendly and the space is shabby chic and clean! 
7883 0 Horrible customer service!! Had a $1000 disappear due to a system glitch on their end! Still waiting for it to be resolved 5 days later! AVOID AT ALL COST!! 
7884 1 I've had Emma's pizza a few times through work lunches and I have never enjoyed it for some reason. Maybe it's because the pies are thin and the toppings aren't your normal toppings. I dunno, I just prefer pizza that's more substantial and normal, for lack of a better word. 
7885 4 Love the desserts at this place. My favorites are the lemon tart, millefeuille and chocolate marquise. Busy place. Desserts are not cheap but worth it. Love these French desserts and keep wanting to come back. Staff are pretty nice and service is pretty fast. 
7886 1 Not very kid friendly, the manager was a little rude to kid. The girl with long pink hair does NOT know how to cut mens short hair. Just as warning. 
7887 4 I order take out from here on a regular basis. Best egg rolls & homemade duck sauce. 
7888 4 The soup dumplings were superb. We tried the pork and the kimchi and pork soup dumplings and they were so flavorful and delicious. Tried other dishes as well but we were not impressed. Definitely sticking to soup dumplings only. 
7889 3 Free beer. Need I say more!? Great gift shop and it is only a hop, skip and a jump from subway! 
7890 4 Great place. Food was. Great. Chicken and grits yummy, the hash brown casserole was yummy. All and all great brunch spot and very reasonable priced 
7891 4 Great place with convenient hours of operation. My favourite item on the menu is the beef stu with bread. The service is quick and the staff are friendly the moment you walk through the the doors. 
7892 2 They have take me in for eyebrow appt w no reservation, so that deserves a star. ...but it eyebrow threading supposed to be this painful!? And cash only tips... If it wasn't so conveniently located I prob wouldn't go back. 
7893 4 Today I presented for full service. Ms. Z, Asia, and Crystal, all were great. I am very please with the outcome. I highly recommend 3Girls..... 
7894 0 I ordered pick up for two nights ago and got sashimi dinner and it was awful. Of the 20 pieces, only 3 were remotely edible and it was unbearably fishy smelling. Anyone who eats sushi knows that it should NOT smell fishy I had to throw it away. 
7895 3 Was there 9 pm on Sat night. Unfortunately, bathrooms were not working and they were still waiting for plumber. Not good. On the plus side: Our server was Kelsey who was delightful and attentive. Thank you, Kelsey! Pizza and salad were good, too. 
7896 3 Food is great, but a little pricy for lunch. $12 for basic sandwich with fries, but it is good! Parking during lunch time is HORRIBLE. They have to be losing a huge amount of their lunch traffic because there is no where to park!!! 
7897 4 Went to this place on a visit to Austin. Great food, fun atmosphere. and awesome drinks. 
7898 4 Yummy, healthy, flavorful and nicely presented crepes, etc. Good prices. Excellent service!! A sweet way to spend a birthday. 
7899 4 Excellent food. We tried a ton of the dishes. My favorite was the soy strips with pineapple lettuce wraps, but everything was good. Warning: portions are huge! 
7900 4 So good! Everything I have tried has been wonderful..Love Titayas. This place is so good that there are always long lines, and we wait in them because the food really is that good.. YUM. 
7901 4 Pretty straightforward juices and smoothies. Real good tasting. The place has an awesome vibe to it. Tried "The Green" and was not disappointed. 
7902 3 Better than Stauf's. The barista made a near-perfectly executed latte (no latte-art, though) 3/3 times over the course of two days. Wish the atmosphere was better. OK, but not great. 
7903 4 Delicious falafel and friendly service - can't ask for much more in a great lunch spot. I always go for the falafel deluxe sandwich with hummus AND French fries (you can get both! For a few more cents) 
7904 4 I love going in there. Everytime I make the trip to find shoes. They know so much about the product and you can tell how much the associates care and want to talk about it. The shoes are amazing and so comfortable. Def worth the price on them 
7905 4 Instead of having 3 different machines for glass, cans and plastic, like most stores, you can use one machine for all 3. It is amazing how much faster it is. It is definitely worth the wait if there is a line. 
7906 3 The BLOODY MARY BAR is amazing!!!! This was my first time at this restaurant and my first Bloody Mary. I would have to say that it was delicious... yummy in my tummy. 
7907 3 Open 24 hours a day and they serve donuts, sandwiches and pizza! You don't even have to go anywhere else, they have you covered for all of your day's food needs. Only had the donuts the other day and they were pretty good. $6.50 for a half dozen. 
7908 4 I absolutely love Wolf's Ridge. The brunch is the best in Columbus! The staff is very friendly. I also enjoy the taproom. They have a much wider selection of beer in their taproom. It's a great place for pre or post dinner drinks 
7909 4 For the money it's a great place. Super clean and the transportation to the attractions are great. 
7910 4 I love this place. It's a haven to relax and restore. I feel welcomed every time I walk in the door. 
7911 1 The ambience was good Service was good I was hungry when I left .. I'm 6 foot 185 lbs package of Ramen with a small 4 oz max of chicken , very bland $ 12.99 
7912 4 Good-quality food, fast delivery, affordable prices. Pretty much everything I would look for in Chinese take-out. 
7913 4 AMAZING!!!! Absolutely a great atmosphere, mouth-watering food and friendly workers! 
7914 3 5 stars for customer service .waiter was very nice and welcoming. I ordered the picahna .very tender but bland. The fried yuca was delicious I may return again to try a different steak. 
7915 4 I have been using Frank and Laura for a few years now,very knowledgeable,friendly and I can honestly say I wouldn't use any one else. 
7916 4 Excellent!! I absolutely love this place and will be returning every chance I get! Park valet!!! Bellhop is absolutely outstanding!! Get greeted by their parrot ambassador in the lobby! so cool! upgrade to the nice brow room- definitely worth it!! Use the resort amenities!! Best service I've ever had! 
7917 4 Lunch today. Best burger in a long while. Tender, juicy, cooked just right. The bun was soft. The fries were thinner than I prefer, but the truffle oil more than made up for it. 
7918 2 This is a pretty typical cafe. The sandwiches and wraps are good but a little overpriced and the food items are the same. The chicken caesar salad wrap is my favorite here but everything else is pretty much par for the course. 
7919 3 The punk rock "Cheers." Loud music, good shows, karaoke on most Sundays, cheap beer, and a great jukebox. The place to go to when there is nothing else to do and you feel like going to a bar. Friendly staff and a No-frills approach make this bar great. 
7920 4 What a great addition to Austin. I especially love the gift items and stationary. 
7921 3 Coffee was great, but the hot tea was better! the blue hot tea pot made my day much happier! Love the atmosphere here 
7922 4 Pretty amazing breakfast. Everyone in the group loved their food. Ended up here by accident and so glad we did 
7923 4 I made it a goal to visit Schmidt's after seeing it on Man vs Food....it is everything i expected and more...I wish we had a place out here in California, I'd be a regular. 
7924 2 Great spot. While you pay a boat load for drinks, the pizza is the bomb dot com! Note - avoid the cheese bread as an appetizer. Alexandra was my waitress - excellent service. 
7925 2 Great service. Good selection of flavors. Walkable from many restaurants in the area or if you just want a treat. Good alternative to Salt and Straw if you cannot abide long lines. 
7926 4 Everyone that works here is very nice. I like everything I've tried the 6 times I've eaten here. The hot sauce and chips are great and try the green sauce but be careful it's hot but very good. Good food and good prices I know that I'll be back. 
7927 3 Nice mexican food in Waltham. They have good margaritas too. The food portions are enormous - you wont leave hungry. 
7928 1 Not my favorite place, I had to go because so many people told me it was the best place for hotdogs, not the case, I sometimes think I'm too critical, but I have had better hotdogs at Fenway Park. 
7929 2 Mediocre. Not good for one person to dine. Soy drink was mediocre also. This is more suitable for family dine out. 
7930 0 I honestly had really high expectation goin here because all my friends seems to love it. I was very disappointed, our Thai spicy noodle soup was very water down, I'm just used to a lot of marination to my food so this wasn't the place for me. 
7931 2 Not terrible but a little skimpy on the veggies. We got the 9 and 10. Decent flavor on the meat. 
7932 3 The risotto is delicious, a little pricey and if you are in a rush, this is not the right place for you. I put a 4 stars as the service is sometimes slow and some weekends you do not access to the pastries, all are gone in a hour. 
7933 4 We stayed in the 3 bedroom with pool table and it was AWESOME. It was a weekend getaway with my daughter a of her friends. WHAT FUN! 
7934 4 When they say roasted, they cannot begin to convey the unique and deliciousness of this coffee. The moon milk is also a very nice addition. Great addition to the 'hood. 
7935 4 I was recommended to this place by a coworker. I loved the service and food here. I got the Pollo Chicken with Plantains and Salad. The rice and chicken was amazing! Price was only $6.00!!! I will definitely back again!!! 
7936 3 Really - in an airport. I go in and out of ATL a lot and I'd never eaten here. Boy, was I wrong. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced. It is a great departure (pun intended) from the oh drum airport sustenance. Good stuff. I'll be back. 
7937 2 Good food staff was okay. The manager skipped my table and asked people on other tables. Maybe Deadphobic? 
7938 3 That's was an amazing cannoli! I bet it has a great Butcher. The exterior has an Old school charm to it! 
7939 0 Uncle Mickeys is so sub par. I live right down the street and the pizza was cold and my greek salad had no feta cheese and they gave me a tabelespoon on dressing and yellow iceberg lettuce 
7940 4 What a place :) thanks to great food (try paglia e fieno pasta and that bruschetta, yummy) and greatly attentive staff, this Dinner made my evening. Should paths cross again, I'll be here! 
7941 1 The atmosphere would make for a great date night. But the food wasn't all that great. Dry. Flavorless. I had the salmon sandwich with a mashed potato. Eh. We never got our drinks. Service was slow. 
7942 4 Love, love, love Desta. There's a reason this place stands out in an area that is saturated with Ethiopian food. Everything is fresh, delicious, and service has always been good. 
7943 3 Excellent breakfast. The potatoes are awesome... so is the bacon... and the eggs. That's what I had. Good OJ too. We sat at the bar and were told about Oregon for a while. That was the only downside. The upside of the bar was that we didn't have to wait. 
7944 4 Great place to have drinks in a comfy place right next to Boston Commons. We had some beers, a grapefruit mocktail, and a hummus platter. The platter was nice and fresh, drinks were good, and service was friendly. And the location couldn't have been better 
7945 4 Impeccable taste and the most professional attitude equals a great experience. A whole-hearted endorsement for this innovative landscape design company. 
7946 2 Biscuits and gravy is hard to find in MA. And served with a side of potato casserole? huh! I'm in heaven. Thanks for being right next to the airport. When I have a late flight, I'm sure to stop at Cracker Barrel for some biscuits and gravy. 
7947 4 wood, rustic, brick wall feel. Hipster spin on classic food. I had the Open Face Tuna-melt, is excellent. 
7948 0 Avoid, rude waitresses... could not be bothered to show me the menu, told me it was out of her way. Get some new staff Pelons. 
7949 4 Amazing Vietnamese food in North Austin! The dumplings and Pho are great. They are super kid friendly. 
7950 0 The security guards are absolutely brutal. Rude, and out to get people. Facility is good not great. Very small. 
7951 4 Weary from travel, I always head to Verde Cocina when I arrive in Portland to be fed the freshest, most savory Mexican food I've ever tasted. YUM. And so beautifully presented! 
7952 3 I like this place. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS PLACE IS THE TACO TRUCK. The 3 dollar tacos are DELICIOUS. MMMMMMMMMMMM 
7953 1 It tastes great!... But I got a plate to go and I've never been SO disappointed in the portion size for $12. What a joke! Each side item only gave me three bites. 
7954 3 I'm one of those weirdos who go to happy hour to eat!!! I really love their chicken street tacos....yum!d 
7955 4 Always superb donuts in a wide variety of interesting flavors. They might sell out of some if you're going in later in the day but you'll still find something delicious. 
7956 0 Food isn't that great. Seems like it was reheated. Definitely overpriced for what you get. I tried the ravioli and was disappointed 
7957 0 Worst experience at an einstein's. Always out of Cinnamon Sugar bagels and are very rude when asked to make more. (Manager explained once that it is easy to make them if they are out) Terrible customer service, dissapointing to see it. 
7958 0 Crappiest service ever. The lady on the phone was super disrespectful. They don't value customer service at all. They completely disregarded people's time. Overall, they should be shut down. Nobody should have to deal with this. 
7959 4 Well, if you didn't stop at waffle Window for a fast sand, sit down here for the spread, b-l-d: amazing! Great service as well 
7960 4 Been going here 15+ years and this place never disappoints. Willie's Plate all the way! 
7961 4 One of the best if not the best in town! Who says we don't have a foodie paradise in Orlando? No need to travel to New York or the like. Excellent. 
7962 4 Great food, great service! I wanted everything twice!! Make sure it's not a Tuesday bc Tuesday "all you can eat" menu is not good at all!! 
7963 4 This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants. I went there today for lunch (1-4-13) and found that it will be closed for renovations until about the first of March 2013. While I won't complain about some renovations...I will be counting the days until Titaya's reopens. 
7964 4 Love the service every time. Couches are comfy too:) happy hour enticing for Monday-Friday work week. Sweet potato roll YUMMY :):). Friends loved their c&s roll and New York roll. Overall great quaint place to stop in. Miso soup is vegetarian too and tasty! 
7965 4 Amazing! So yummy! Love! Can't wait for them to get wine in. I absolutely love the vegan cheeses and these people are soooooo nice! 
7966 4 I miss Boston because of this place. Harry Potter-ish decor. Very busy and popular seems to be a local and almost tourist attraction. I liked studying there and the pastries and coffee are of quality. Can't go wrong. 
7967 3 Went to Olive Garden with my co workers for lunch. Alex our waiter was so delightful and accommodating. He was on time with our dishes and served with a smile. Food was good too. 
7968 4 Amazing buffet with a great price. The place was very clean and all of the food was hot and fresh. The roast pork was moist and the fresh ceviche was delicious !! Will deffinately return. 
7969 4 Took my wife here for Valentine's day. The place was amazing, the food was excellent and the service was on point! We will be visiting again and if you haven't dined here yet, you should! 
7970 4 Great coffee, variety of pastries, good vibe and comfortable inside. Small parking lot, but it's walking distance from Gabriel Park. 
7971 0 Chinese restaurants are known for not being too clean, but this one is the king of them all. 
7972 4 It was so good! Great food and service. Get prepared to wait in line, but you can leave you number and they text you when your seat is about to be available. The food was very, very, very good! 
7973 4 Martha's is one of my favorite places to go when I come to Danvers. ALL of the food, coffee, and treats are the best around, and everyone is so friendly. Martha is the best baker in the area, and also the nicest. :) 
7974 3 Small little place very quaint. Unbelievably good sushi at an unbelievably good price. Great thing is I wrote the street from my house and saw absolutely be back here again. Highly recommended great service also 
7975 2 Beer is okay. Service is poor. Atmosphere is... odd. Sort of bar-like, sort of not. Lots of regulars. Prefer lots of other brewpubs in Boulder. Their beer is all organic, if you're into that. I'm not. 
7976 4 The absolute best Banh Mi in town! No seriously I went on a quest to find out what the best one in town is and it's here. Staff is very friendly, decor is whatever (but that's not why you come here), and the food is awesome. 
7977 4 Love this place! The food is amazing the staff is always so friendly! I've been to a of the locations however the Ocoee location is my favorite! Love that the owners are involved with their costumers and get out there and help the staff! 
7978 3 Great dinner at the bar - very friendly atmosphere, excellent music selection, no TV blaring, good bartender. Food was delicious, spicy, interesting. Definitely recommend. 
7979 3 Food was very good, all three of us had the filet! Service good, the waiter did not interrupt conversation and was very discreet. Excellent choices for wine. I would definitely return 
7980 4 The atmosphere is always positive and the selection is better than any other frozen yogurt place I've been to! If you're in the neighborhood and craving something cold, this is the place to go! 
7981 2 I ordered take out, service was timely with picking up and food was ready on time. The food was okay, pretty generic Thai food, but the main disappointment was that I ordered a chicken pad se ew and got home and saw there was no meat in my dish. 
7982 4 Went to Koy for the first time last night and had the steamed branzino, it was outstanding!! Also got the drunken noodles and they were good too The staff was friendly and it had a good atmosphere Definitely going back again!!! 
7983 4 Best service! Great Food. Love the Sunday Brunch. The servers are very attentive and treat you like you're the only person in the place we have made this a regular Sunday hang out 
7984 3 Great location, food is above average, service is almost always excellent! The only issue we ever have is wait times for a table during lunch and dinner service. Its a good local restaurant but to busy most days to just drop in for a quick meal. 
7985 4 Awesome atmosphere - check. Super great staff - check. Rockin' juke box selection - check. Support for the local community - priceless. A HUGE thank you to Lustre Pearl Bar for their support of the event held on behalf of SafePlace on 10/14/09. Y'all were amazing!!! =) 
7986 4 Delicious! Shishitto peppers, pork belly sliders and cinnamon/honey creme brule were fantistic. I highly recommend this place! 
7987 1 Olive Garden.....it's good on the wallet when you should be getting breadsticks and soup. I have an issue with this being my job's go-to retirement dinner spot. Therefore this may be a bit bias. Maybe. Too Carbotastic for my taste. 
7988 4 Just steps from my office. Great place to catch a really great hot chocolate and catch up on emails. Highly recommend! 
7989 4 Donate $1 to the Muscular Dystrophy Association here! Nothing makes a bigger impact than financial support! LETS DO THIS 
7990 4 My favorite Chinese noodle soup of all time! I always pick this place in Crystal mall. 
7991 4 I've been going here for four months now for eyebrow threading. I've gotten a lot of compliments on how great they look and always good customer service. Great place. Highly recommend. 
7992 4 I am very happy with workmanship I own a air-conditioning company these guys pulled me out of a pinch uniforms look sharp I will for sure use them again. Good quality materials extremely punctual and no job too big. 
7993 4 My wife and I have been ordering from this place for 20 years. Chicken tika masala. Saag panneer. Korma. 
7994 3 Stanford you hit the spot! The food here is amazing. We were promptly greeted upon our arrival. The wait staff was very punctual and informative. The atmosphere was very relaxing. 
7995 4 Awesome pizza - we have tried SO many pizza places in Salem and this is at the top of our list! Delicious! 
7996 4 Easy walk from ICA museum if you want a quick breakfast before going in. Great service.Strong coffee. Tasty English muffin breakfast sandwich. 
7997 1 Had the following with my friend Caroline: -Samosas -Saag paneer -Chicken makhani -Small bread basket -Rice -Sierra Nevada (me) -Harpoon IPA (her) Fairly standard food, with slow service. The Sierra tasted a bit off. 
7998 4 We LOVED EVERYTHING!! The chicken is cooked to perfection! Decoration and staff were great! I also liked how they had several board games to utilize while waiting for food. Definitely will return. 
7999 4 Another great meal with Family Friday night. First time my mom has been there and she said she has found her new spot! 
8000 4 Great low price to fix my iPhone 6s screen and LCD screen and they were fast and my phone looks brand new great place recommend it to everyone 
8001 3 Very friendly staff. They stayed open a little later and called for extra support staff on Thanksgiving to make sure that the patients were all seen before they closed 
8002 3 Best wings ever! Staff is o.k. Service is o.k. Lots of sports on the televisions which surround the entire place! And they show hockey! 
8003 3 Nice location, excellent menu choice and some good beer too! Wife and daughter had the mingas and really liked them. I had the classic breakfast and it was done just the way I like it. 
8004 4 Had my first massage today at Nonotts, and it was amazing! Have had a lot of back pain lately and they concentrated on those areas and did a fantastic job...feels so much better. Will definitely be back again soon! 
8005 3 Food is good. Great gyros and baklava. Restaurant could be a little cleaner. Broken down boxes by bathroom and the annoying fly. 
8006 4 Really enjoyed our meal here tonight! Fish and chips, Guinness Beef Stew and Macaroni and cheese were all delicious. Our server was attentive and kind. The kids were treated well. Overall a great experience and we will be back! 
8007 4 Went in and got the Coco.Bananas and it was delicious. Fast service and nice presentation. Definitely will be back! 
8008 4 This is the BEST Library I've ever been to! They've got just about every book in the whole World! There Children's area is Huge, the speakers and events are awesome, there are a number of different book clubs, beautiful open spaces, and you can even eat and drink here! Yay. 
8009 4 I have working with these guys for years and have been nothing less than thrilled with their work. All high quality components and workmanship, done quickly, conveniently and at a good and fair price. They've even done things for me that they don't normally do. Well done! 
8010 2 On my quest to re-live the amazing small town ooooey gooooooey pizza this place comes close, real close. Friendly neighbourhood place. Affordable (very), yummy, great helpful polite service. Beer is way cheaper than downtown. Interior has not been up dated, and DON'T!! Perfectly charming just the way it is! 
8011 4 Im not a fan of writing reviews, but damn that was a good burger. That dipped in the secret sauce bread is to die for, plus the service is exceptional! Must comeback!!! 
8012 4 Mom recommended the beef Patacon. I ordered it spicy. Pure and simple one of the best dishes I've ordered this year! 
8013 4 Best place on Granville street! Best Guinness I've had in Vancouver and the food is always great! Yorkies are aaaaamazing. Always a super fun time when there is live music as well! 
8014 4 Chicken cabob over Salad. Adding it to my weekly diet. Fantastic. First time yesterday. Well worth it for 7.75. 
8015 4 Great food for the price. Priced betterthan nearby neighbor Don Pedro. Had the viva Mexico burrito.....which haden excellent sauce. 
8016 4 Absolutely loved this museum. Highly recommended for all Boston visitors! 
8017 3 Bought a v-dub from here. Given that a majority of car salespeople are just terrible, this is as good as it gets. Staff: Polite, friendly, helpful, comedic, and not opposed to making a deal. We brought price print-outs from TrueCar, KBB, and Edmunds. We were happy with the negotiated price. 
8018 2 Saw Dropkick Murphy's here for the past two years on St Patty's Day. Good sized venue but lots of areas where you just can't see the stage at all. Bartenders were good with the beers but when asking for water they look the other way. 
8019 3 So far... every time I eat here, the food never fails me. Recently we had the cubano and WOW it is amazing. The people are very friendly too. They always have new art hanging from their walls so during the day time you can see them. 
8020 4 This is the best cut for men. My wife and I (and now are two kids) have been driving from Boston to North Reading for six years just to get our hair done at Salon 77. Leah and her team are simply awesome! 
8021 4 GREAT atmosphere and GREAT food. Definitely is a hit on my list, I visit this location frequently just haven't tried the brunch yet. 
8022 3 As a previous reviewer mentioned, this is mainly a place to come during the summer to enjoy the outdoor dining. The menu isn't particularly imaginative but the food is good and prices surprisingly reasonable given the location, especially if you go for one of the daily specials. 
8023 4 Great atmosphere. Every bit of food I had there was amazing. I will be going back. I had the green curry and also the mango sticky rice. 
8024 2 I have mixed feelings about this place. Half the time I'm miserable and half I have a pretty good time. Decent beer selection. Come here with friends because the patrons aren't always the most interesting. 
8025 4 Parking on the side. Plenty of space on the inside. Eye candy galore (BC babes). I drop by this place for an Americano every time I'm on my way down Chestnut Hill ave. I've gotta try their Honey Ricotta Toast (featured on the Improper Bostonian) sometime soon!!! 
8026 4 This place was awesome! We loved everything about it from the Decour to the gracious hosts and the delicious food. We will definitely be back! 
8027 3 Nice, reasonably priced breakfast fare in a nice, comfy environment. Friendly and attentive staff. They have decent GF options as well. Always a plus. I'd go back. 
8028 4 Donna has been doing my hair for close to 15 years now, and I was so excited when she opened her own salon. She's amazing with curly hair. People ask me all the time where I go to get my hair done because it has never looked better! 
8029 3 The remodel has made for a fancy-er Produce Row. The patio is really nice although a bit noisy. Nice draught selection. Love the Beer & Whiskey Pairings! We didn't get a chance to eat, next time! 
8030 4 This is my favorite Kobe to visit. The atmosphere is always pleasant. Neil and Norni were awesome. Norni created upside down volcano show. I enjoyed the food. Kristin welcome us with a great smile. I would definitely come back. 
8031 2 Good selection, but make sure you don't forget your reading glasses. Price on item scanned at $2.00 more. Emailed company, was offered the $2.00, if I come back in with everything. Just wanted them to check their system as it would cost me much more to return than $2.00. 
8032 4 I moved to UT and I cannot find a Thai restaurant as good as this place. My husband and I constantly talk about it. It is SO good with the best staff who are so friendly. 
8033 2 Like some of the other reviews I have seen, I agree that the service was lack luster. I enjoyed the food a lot though. It wasn't 100% perfect, but I will most likely give the place another try. Here's hoping to some new employees. 
8034 4 Absolutely delicious, go for drinks and brunch too! The food is high-quality (you'll pay for it) but they do it so right 
8035 4 Great personalized meal and wonderful sommelier who told us as much about the olive oil as the wines. Fresh and healthy and we'll worth it. 
8036 1 I wouldn't waste my money here, visited in January for brunch, poor service, mediocre food at best. 
8037 0 Given this place 3 chances and each time it gets worse. Service is horrendous because they are always understaffed during busy times, food is mediocre or will make you sick, and unless you are standing at the bar good luck getting a beer in less than 10 minutes 
8038 4 My sister and I went on this tour last week and really enjoyed it!!! Kyle was very animated and funny! 
8039 4 Amazing food and quality service!!!! My drink was never empty and the burritos are to die for. Highly recommend!! 
8040 4 Shanghai soup dumplings! Right in Newton. (not enough of a hook?) They we're fantastic. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. (They politely steered us away from the stinky tofu.) Other courses were delicious as well. Be prepared for the real deal. 
8041 1 If you have a lot of money and like $8 waffle powder from a box and microwaved eggs, then this is the place for you. 
8042 4 Just finished my meal at Cala Bar and Grill, a Caribbean/American fusion restaurant. The staff was friendly, restaurant is modern and clean, and the food was delicious. Live band on Friday...make reservations if you come after 8. Let's support our local establishments! We'll definitely be back! 
8043 0 It says it's open until 9pm today, but it was closed when we arrived at 5:50pm. Disappointed 
8044 3 Delicious roast beef! Typically order a garden salad with roast beef- delicious! Tons of roast beef on top! 
8045 4 Always bowl here with my friends. They also have jenga and ping pong which I love! the food is yum and sometimes they have a live band performing! Def a fun place to go! 
8046 4 Moon milk. Enough said. Besides roasting incredible coffee. Moon milk takes each drink to the next level. I buy their beans for making coffee at home. 
8047 4 The best wings i have had in the area. I remember one night in a snow storm, me and some friends were hungry and they were the only place open. That was the first night we went, and then we were hooked. 
8048 4 Cafe Abbondanza is amazing! Great Italian style pizza, clean, quick, quick deliveries, great salads and you can even order delicious Italian cuisine from their fine dining establishment attached: Abbondanza II. The prices are reasonable and it is a super friendly environment. 
8049 3 Yummy restaurant in animal kingdom. Chicken tikka masala was very delicious... Plenty of spicy sauce and tender chicken! Lo mein with chicken and shrimp was enough for two kids to share. Passion fruit lemonade was worth it for kids. 
8050 4 Kobes is a family favorite for us for over 15+ years. Kind staff and great food. Let's the forget the entertainment of the chefs cooking in front of us. The manager was great and tried to get us seated as soon as possible! 
8051 1 Good concept but not if food is served lukewarm as it was on my visit on a not so-busy Saturday afternoon. To restaurant's credit we were offered desserts on the house. Still, a big disappointment to be served food that tastes like it had been sitting out for 20-odd minutes. 
8052 4 Best experience at a cactus club so far!! Our server Jessica was great. Will definitely be coming back to this location. 
8053 0 If there is a fast food bakery, this is it! Unappetizing bakes goods. No tea. Plastic boxes and foam cups. If you are in the area just drive up 15 minutes to Alon's bakery to better pastries, cakes, and breads as well as much more pleasant atmosphere. 
8054 4 Fast and friendly service, with very reasonable prices. Even buffed up a brass plaque for free! Note that he is no longer at the location shown in the picture - look up the address which is at the Burnett Road Storage facility. 
8055 4 Best Mexican restaurant I've ate at. Low prices and a large variety of dishes. I highly recommend this restaurant. 
8056 4 I've been here twice when visiting Austin, and the wait in line is well worth it. I highly recommend the Buffalo Bill (bison) and Greek (lamb) burger! 
8057 4 I love this league, rollerderby is excellent heartpounding full throttle bad-assery. GO GET EM GIRLS!! 
8058 4 I am officially obsessed with Myers and Chang. Great music, amazing food, love the deserts from Flour Bakery. The service is laid back but very attentive and friendly. I have never had a bad experience here and have major cravings for it about once a week! 
8059 4 Awesome is the only word I can find Great salad bar Incredible meats Delicious desserts And all this with best service anywhere Could not recommend more highly 
8060 4 Started coming here after a friend highly recommended it and have been ever since! So accommodating and friendly. Nina and Tommy always do such a great job! Acrylics, gel, anything... Very clean salon and always leave happy w/ my nails! Definitely recommend. 
8061 0 This place is terrible my nails where shaped so ugly too when I said I wanted stiletto nails and way to expensive never again!!! I'm sorry Kim but you lost a customer. 
8062 4 Food is EXCELLENT! Full bar, pizza, salad, pastas and dessert is to die for! Comfortable atmosphere and exceptional service! 
8063 0 I recently learned that route 87 service to Arlington Center ends at 7:40 PM on weeknights and Saturdays, and that there's no service to Arlington at all on Sundays. I think that merits a two-star deduction. Not cool, MBTA, not cool! 
8064 4 Yummy. We had a phenomenal experience. Will definitely be back. We drove from NY, we travel around to different burger joints. Customer Service was great and I enjoyed my meal/milkshake. 
8065 4 Megan was amazing! We had a group of 11 rowdy people and she took great care of us! This place is great - amazing food and great beer selection! 
8066 4 We just bought an X5 and Shiraz helped us put together the perfect vehicle. There wasn't ever any hard pressure to buy. Shiraz listened to how we needed to use the vehicle and his recommendations were right on. This has been by far the best car buying experience. 
8067 2 It's ok if your looking for a cheap meal. Drinks are reasonably priced. Seafood Mac and cheese was horrible fresh seafood not used. Pizza was ok for Florida pizza 
8068 4 Awesome service. Came in to get a new tube and the guys hooked me up w/ some extra stuff I didn't know I needed for a very fair price. 100% satisfied! 
8069 0 Hotel is clean and nice enough. There is nothing free included - parking, breakfast, etc. There is a small bar down the street about a block that played loud music until late in the night. I would not recommend this place on the weekend. 
8070 0 horrible worst customer service. they deliveryed a damaged chair that cost over 8000 dollars. its the third day and they refuse to fix this problem. 
8071 4 Found this place while visiting Disney and tried because of Yelp reviews. It lives up to all the hype! Super friendly staff and amazing food. Everything is so flavorful! Definitely recommend! My favorites were the guava tequenos, churrasco and the fried yucca. 
8072 1 I loved the service. Bartender was nice drinks were yummy. I order Mac and cheese to go. As I sit here eating it kinda sucks flavor is good needs more sauce. I added bacon and it's almost raw I barely ate any cause I was scared of almost raw bacon! 
8073 3 Got a burger here to try it out. The food and service was good but I wasn't particularly impressed. Would still drive out if my way to go to Yeah Burger. 
8074 0 Came here recently and had mild wings and fries. The wings were so soggy they taste boiled and they also had no flavor. The fries were not crispy. I would not recommend 
8075 3 Excellent place on Sunday for a chill funday. If Tom is there, it's 5stars. Otherwise, it's a good pub to stop by when I'm downtown crossing area. 
8076 4 Walking into Bahama Breeze, employees who were already on their way out welcomed us in with a smile. All employees were friendly. Our food was yummy & the drink I had (Painkiller) was great. Marquise, our server was informative & attentive! 
8077 3 Phad Panang is very good. I order it Thai Hot. It is the spiciest /heat. My teenager also orders this dish-regular and is her favorite. Can't decide, this dish is a pleaser. 
8078 0 Never going there again. Ordered a dish with scallops and thought they tasted a bit off. Got food poisoning later that night from my food. I refuse to eat there again. 
8079 2 Service is really slow and the restaurant needs to be cleaner; seems understaffed. The food taste great though, no complaints here. 
8080 1 Food was good but they nickel and dined us about everything. $1 extra for cheese on top of the French onion soup, $1 for extra condiments, etc. and the waiter didn't tell us ahead of time. 
8081 4 I went there for dinner and loved it! My server was a lady named Yayoi, and she was great! Never had an empty glass. The food was great too! 
8082 4 My absolute favourite place to get clothing tailored. I've never been let down with the quality of work done by Lieu Doan! She's so pleasant to be around and makes her customers feel comfortable. 5 stars for this lovely lady and her great work! 
8083 3 Fantastic food but the line up is brutal. And why do you close at 3pm when folks are clearly still wanting to grab a bite! 
8084 4 Doug and his team did an excellent job. Doug clearly takes great pride in his work and it comes across. Additionally, his team delivered the work on time and at a competitive price. I would use him again in a heartbeat and have already recommended him to a friend. 
8085 3 I am a fan & very picky about massages. This is Austin's best kept secret, needed to share! 
8086 2 Not much on the room service menu. Nothing to eat in hotel or surrounding area late at night. Rooms are great though. 
8087 4 Amazing! The best fried chicken and collard greens I have had in a long time! Cool atmosphere, friendly staff..dessert wasnt my fav but omg that food! 
8088 4 Amazing food and amazing staff. It was our daughter's birthday and the lady manning the register made our lunch really nice by bringing us some baklava and a tea candle for her to blow out. Best greek food in Austin. 
8089 2 Great service and fun but was not as unique as I hoped ... think pf changs (sorry) Lemon custard dessert was pretty good but not best in show worthy Best of northeast? We tried five items or so and just didn't come away moved 
8090 3 Excellent! Great Pizza by the slice on Congress, prepare to wait a few minutes as this place can get pretty busy, but is worth the wait! 
8091 4 This is a well-spent hour and $10. Our tour leader Renzo, a freshman, was engaging, funny, full of interesting facts. 
8092 4 AMAZING brunch spot! You obviously have to try the waffles. I wish I had ordered more. The other dishes we tried were amazing as well. We will definitely be eating here the next time we visit Vancouver. This place it worth the line out the door for sure. 
8093 2 Lustre Pearl at 4:00 pm: amazing. Lustre Pearl at 10:00 pm: my own personal hell. 
8094 4 This place has the best bagels--right up there with Bagels you get in New York deli's. I had a bagel with lox--and it was incredibly delicious--super fresh--incredibly delicious! 
8095 4 Ask for Amy as a server. She was very friendly and attentive. Great sushi and they put their own twist on things. Delicious cocktails, they don't skimp on the alcohol. 
8096 3 I recently attended one of the workshops, and I found it therapeutic, empowering, and informative. It was a bit lengthy, but once we got started, the time flew by. I definitely recommend it. 
8097 4 All the hype in Portland about doughnuts is focused on voodoo, and this place is way better. It's not about gimmicks to sell outlandish food. They're about awesome tasting doughnuts. Skip voodoo and go with blue star. 
8098 1 Subs are not great quality. Meatballs are huge and would be better cut in half. Also, chicken parm sub is always so dry. I don't love bobs! 
8099 3 Overall, This Pizza place is very much "on the ball", whether pick-up or delivery. I really have only seen competence and good quality of food. The place is very clean and the Staff welcoming when you go in. I can only highly recommend them at this time. Enjoy! 
8100 4 This is one of my favorite dessert places in Portland. The waiters are always entertaining, the desserts are always delicious, especially the Raspberry Fool, it's my favorite! I love taking people here for the first time! 
8101 4 This was the best thing ever!! It's worth every. Single. Calorie. I just got the normal cinnamon donut. What they are known for. The staff was as sweet as the donuts. I will be back on my next cheat day!! 
8102 4 This place was fast and got my phone from blinking grey lines and having a constantly flashing screen to good as new in less than thirty minutes!! 
8103 4 Always good food. Friendly staff. Real deal! So far I've had, jerk ribs, oxtail, curry chicken, chicken soup, season rice, white rice, plantain, cabbage, lemon cake. All good delicious and authentic. Caribbean flavor. I would recommend to anyone. 
8104 4 La semana pasada fui a la taquería de Amelia. Comí un burrito vegetariano con la palta y el pimiento. La comida estaba sabrosa y fue preparada rápidamente. Voy a visitar de nuevo. 
8105 4 I think I found my new taco Tuesday spot when I'm in the North Market area. $2 tacos I recommend steak or barbacoa street taco and then grab a beer take a stroll around. 
8106 0 This was the worst Taco Bell I have ever experienced! I do not expect Taco Bell to be great food, it is fast food. The shells were stale, chips are stale, the chalupa shell had not been fried and was cold. It was not editable. 
8107 4 Free pickles. Big sandwich. Super fast. Great for lunch during the work week, I grab it about once a week. 
8108 3 This is a nice hotel in middle of Boston near Chinese town and theatre district. Large rooms, friendly service. We decided to take a skyview room and it was impressible. 
8109 4 Everything is great but I've not been able to order anything but the Three Amigos lately. It's awesome. I'm a big fan of their spicy taco and their vegan chorizo as well. 
8110 4 Lively place along the river. Food is outstanding. Great place to share tapas. Very flavorful. We had short ribs and smoked trout 
8111 4 Good food, fast service and friendly staff!! Pancakes fluffy and patty melt very tasty!!! Wendy is fabulous!!! 
8112 4 Our favorite spot in columbus, best drinks + cocktails!! The servers are always super amazing, kind, and talented - making each drink look like a masterpiece. A must go to spot in Columbus. 
8113 4 I grew up in Westerville and had plenty of hoagies over the years. Went in yesterday an ordered an Italian hoagie from Sue. Of course it was delicious but it felt good to support the small business owner as opposed to a corporate sub shop. 
8114 4 Best Ethiopian food in Atl!! Fish tibs are to die for!! Great service, lovely little place to keep going back to!! 
8115 3 Good portions. Cowboy burger was tasty. Bun was super fresh. I prefer a toasted bun. Came after the lunch rush and things were a bit messy 
8116 4 Josh might be one of the nicest people in Portland. He remembers everyone's name and is friendly without being fake. They have daily specials that are almost always great. I really like that they have a free side salad that comes with the food. 
8117 4 I had Dominique clean my home today and it was wonderful! However I do not like swifter's at all so next time I will have a bucket for her to use with my mop.she was very friendly and I was happy with the job she did. 
8118 3 It was really great since we were renting a house right outside the park and even though he closed at 5pm the man was very accommodating to us. The pricing could be more competitive. But we liked it and the park was great 
8119 3 what a great place for excellent quality pizza. Have eaten their once and taken out several times. crispy eggplant pizza and chicken parm sliders to die for. Worth the trip though I don't live in Boston. Highly recomend! 
8120 4 Great food and service was great. Loved the Brie appetizer. The crepes were amazing, as well as the chicken cordon bleu. My husband and I will definitely be back. 
8121 4 Thanks for the great ride Captain Thomas! It took 20 years but made more fun with three 4th graders and my husband. If you need more jokes they have a ton of them. 
8122 4 Best haircut I've found in Boston yet. Lots of guys waiting, but the line moved quickly. 
8123 3 love their nouns and lam, delicious! it's our weekend favorite place. 
8124 3 I've been using handy for home cleaning for awhile and their service is great: professional, efficient, independent, affordable. My house looks good when my cleaner leaves. I've had a few cleaners and their not all of the same quality but Mirquella, the one I have now, is terrific. 
8125 3 Great bar, good food happening atmosphere. The margaritas are great, specially the one with the midget corona. You have to have the tequila ice shots for desert. 
8126 1 Over priced Over rated. Nice place but you paying to stand in line and wait to sign up. Then it's hours away to play. 
8127 4 This place is inside the Cedar Hills Crossing Mall across from Cold Stone. The food was very good and authentic! We had the steak burrito, it had great flavor and will definitely keep us coming back. The owner was very nice and informative! I highly recommend this place. 
8128 4 Our go-to neighborhood restaurant. We love the food, the drinks and the atmosphere! We have had many different items the on menu and all were great. Great, comfortable casual but classy atmosphere. 
8129 4 Iconic and the #1 live jazz bar in Austin... and its free to come inside. And its underground. 
8130 4 Staff relaxed and friendly. They were helpful and educated me while not being over bearing. They understood my need to browse but were there to answer any questions I had. They offered options of extras available without giving me a hard sale. Overall very positive experience!! 
8131 2 Large bar/pool hall. Pool tables. Velvet. Drinks. Food. I ordered the monkfish medalions which were pretty good. A bit pricy though-- they were around $19.00. 
8132 4 Great place to see games! Awesome fan base. Overpriced food & beverages-but isn't that to be expected... Support our teams! So buy your tix and get onboard!!!!!! 
8133 4 I can't imagine ever going to another florist to send flowers to my queen. This is the place to go! Very professional staff and high quality flowers. I will be back! 
8134 4 Love this place! Order the Pumpkin Ravioli. Omg it's so amazing. Sometimes I order on my way by just for a snack! Haha. Service is great. Atmosphere pretty good for Medford standards. 
8135 4 Amazing Gelato. I got the honeysuckle fig with pistachio and amaretto cookie crumbles. They give samples to try and this one was my favorite. I recommend going here to get some amazing Gelato in ATL 
8136 4 Came here on a friends recommendation and was very satisfied with the Pho. I forgot to take photos for my review but I'll be back soon enough. I'm looking forward to trying the BBH. I'm not sure if Any other places in Vancouver serve it. 
8137 0 Hostess was rude and made the process of seating customers extremely inconvenient. Their menu could also use some modifications 
8138 3 Not much to say, we were upgraded and then service was quick and efficient. Could have used a little direction once in the garage but all in all, pretty good service. 
8139 0 Absolutely horrible! I waited 40 minutes for a frozen margarita which was melted by the time I received it. Then, I had to wait an additional 30 for my receipt. HORRIBLE SERVICE! 
8140 4 The quality of food was fabulouse. The flavors were rich and unique. I was not expecting this when I entered this resturant in the strip mall. When I walked in I thought oh this won't be good. To my suprise each course was dilicious and full of flavor. Very authentic. 
8141 0 I had really bad experiance today 3:30pm on 8/13/16. The server she has black hair &very bad attitude. She made it very unpleasant dinning experiance for me and my family. 
8142 3 Yum!! The restaurant was empty so I was a little nervous, but this was the best pho I've ever had! I had the tofu pho and it was so flavorful and DELICIOUS! My bf got the chicken and rice plate which was also really tasty. Will definitely be returning:) 
8143 4 The ramen here is way over my expectation. I could tell they made their broth from scratch, unlike mirakitei which I witness they pour the concentrate into pot. Ordered killer spicy and just basic shoyu. Both are super dilish! Def coming back 
8144 4 First time at Tuscan Kitchen and it was excellent! Mario was our server and he went above and beyond. He was very knowledgeable and attentive. The food was delicious. We will definitely be coming back. 
8145 4 My favorite spot to go to. Dark and very pub feel, but still a lot of room. Bands are always fun and you can't beat the happy hour 
8146 4 I love any bar with a dive feel and good food. The buffalo chicken and waffles was f*****g delicious, our server was a sweetheart and the prices were awesome. I will make it back for sure. 
8147 2 Went there for late lunch.. Server was nice. I had Chicken Fetticuini with Alfredo Sauce. It was good. Portion was enough but small for the price. Overall good experiece. 
8148 4 I only used their bathroom after ACL, but everything smelled delicious. 
8149 4 Forget Les Schwab, best prices and best service in the area. An entry level tire(4) at les Schwab for my f250 was $975. BF Goodrich TAs for $748. installed. Never again Les Schwab. In and out in 45 minutes. Place was packed. 
8150 3 Bahn Mi, Pho, Vermicelli. Not great service, but a great choice for Pho if you're in that neck of the woods. 
8151 0 First time using mears. I bought a round trip ticket that was 36$. Once we stood outside to wait for the ride the employees were rude and also very disorganized. It took us about an hour and a half to get to our hotel. I wouldn't use this service again. 
8152 4 Dreamy... simply dreamy. What an awesome find for lunch! It's close, fast, fresh ... but get there just a hair before noon. It's gets frenetic! lol (and rightfully so) 
8153 1 I order from this location about once a week. 60-70% if the time there is an issue of some kind with my order. Love Papa...crap location. 
8154 2 Generous with its toppings, but the crust was ok, in fact, a bit soft/sogginess...just average, good enough to order again, yet not so bad that one wouldn't return, if that makes sense. free parking in this strip mall by Blundell Centre. 
8155 4 We love the pizzas and the salads - all of them!! Fantastic flavor and the delivery is quick and cheerful drivers too! 
8156 4 I love the noodles. The portion is huge and is so filling. The place is so crowded make sure that you have reservation. 
8157 0 Coffee and sandwich place. I had a turkey sandwich, which was pretty good. Went to over a Latte after lunch at 2:52pm (they close at 3pm) and they told me no, because they already cleaned the machine :/ one star for poor customer service. 
8158 3 Ordered the beef and chicken yakisoba, added a fried egg for a buck. Smothered it in teriyaki sauce and sweet chili sauce. Delicious, next time I'll get half rice half yakisoba. Togo box please! Inner dining area and neighborhood is dinghy and ghetto, but fabulous food. 
8159 4 The best fried chicken in the world, hands down. Spicy, crispy crust with succulent, juicy chicken inside. Excellent collard greens and beans include jalapeños. Fried pickle spears are also great. Prices are incredibly cheap considering the tastiness and flavor of this food. I wish there were a location in Florida! 
8160 4 The Cataplana. That's all you need to know about this place. Order it and you'll understand. 
8161 4 Love all the explosive flavors in one little bowl. Got to have at least once a month ! Very friendly and super nutritious. Add their little spice to the bowl and you've got yourself a go to lunch. 
8162 4 New easy kiosk check out. Answered all my questions. Fast and easy return. Cheapest price I found. 
8163 4 Cheap Lunch. Full for Hours. Healthy. Vegan Options! 
8164 4 Best burger ever. Try the GF bun, you won't regret it. We take all of our out of town friends to hop doddy, just to show off Austin. Great food, fast service, giant beers, perfect location. 
8165 4 awesome cupcakes! my friend and I tasted a bunch, and they were all delicious. the fall flavors are amazing. definitely stop by, it's not far from the T 
8166 4 I come here every Tuesday after the gym. It never disappoints. I get the gyro over rice, which comes with a delicious salad. Hefty portions, too, so I have lunch for the next day. Service is really friendly & there's plenty of space to eat. 
8167 2 Decent pizza at a good price. Be warned the tomato sauce contains a little bit of spiciness. Will probably order from here again. 
8168 3 Great brunch spot. Had some kind of chorizo meatball sandwich that was one of the top ten sandwiches I've ever had. 
8169 4 Tim was wonderful. We all had a great time. He was very patient with our larger group. We were all first time riders and all of us were a little apprehensive. Tip: Make sure you understand how to stop well before riding. 
8170 0 I wanted to try this bakery because It was around the corner from my hotel. As soon as I walked in the smell was really bad I didn't want anything from this place...it sure didn't smell like a bakery. 
8171 4 This place is like a mini trip to Turkey with the attentive staff as your food travel guide. The food is absolutely delicious and there's so much culture and adventure that goes into your first trip. Enjoy! 
8172 3 $1 oysters on Sunday from 8pm onward! 
8173 3 Make sure you go there hungry so you can get your money's worth! Usually a friendly staff and good food. 
8174 4 Great steaks and large shrimp. Prices were fair. Service was on point. We were seated quickly and the restaurant was clean. Would go back. 
8175 4 Great chinese food. Best egg and spring rolls I have had since I left the UK over 10 years ago. Quick service delivered to me. So I would recommend them. Having my 3rd order in 2 weeks and I am certainly pleased with service, delivery and quality of food. 
8176 0 Does anyone know where the old owners of Frosted Nails went? I went there after the new management took over and did not love the vibe and quality of work. 
8177 1 Got the gyro dinner plate. You're paying mostly for skin and fat mixed up with rice. Really bad quality food and extremely bad quality meat even for a food court. Skip this place. 
8178 4 Amazing!!!! We were traveling through Vancouver from US, and were super happy to find this place!! The staff is very sweet, and nice, and the food is to die for!! Highly recommend!! Amazing!! Amazing!! Amazing!! 
8179 2 Great food i enjoyed my visit the food was well prepared.The problem that takes a toll on the restaurant is that it is too small and cramped.you are real close to strangers sitting next to you.other than that they have a variety of Ethiopian dishes you can choose from 
8180 3 Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. I had the wood plank salmon with veggies. Good portion, great flavor. Whole table was jealous of my plate. Anyways, the manager was really sweet to out birthday girl! Made me a fan. 
8181 4 I had a great experience here! I went here once and then they sent me a coupon for 3 dollars and immediately came back to use it! Great location and environment. I got bubble tea the first time and an Americano the second. Both were great! 
8182 4 Amazing ice cream with changing monthly flavors, love the coffee and espresso drinks too. 
8183 2 Great Vietnamese-Thai food here, I definitely recommend the vermicelli. Although I don't care for the new redecorations, it's all about the food there. 
8184 2 Pretty good, though the burgers were smaller than I thought they would be. The fries were just average, but the onion rings were great. 
8185 4 They patched and refinished our floors beautifully. They've come back twice as we've revealed more floor through remodeling. Affordable and perfect! 
8186 4 I get a gyro every Friday like clockwork. It's a great place. Great food. Samir (the owner) is prince. 
8187 3 Quick hot and fresh. Want some actual food but are in a hurry come get a rice bowl w beef and your out the door in minutes. Fast food but good !! 
8188 0 update: the day after eating there I was vomiting all day. it had to be their food because it's all I had to eat that day. I feel horrible I think it was the collard greens as they had a funky taste. 
8189 4 Great food and wonderful people. Every time I eat here I they have some new thing to try. I highly recommend the posole and the pineapple mango salsa. 
8190 4 La Mamma's has such good pizza. There menu is not simply limited to pizza though. They have a few items which might surprise you. For example, empanadas! Who doesn't like an empanada? It's pretty cheap too. And, they deliver. 
8191 4 AMAZING. Shabrika knows her stuff. My mani pedi was flawless. And it is an upscale spa without being snobbish. I will drive for this place, it is my new fave. 
8192 3 Muy muy rico, tanto los Friks como las patatas, espectaculares....y las salsas que las acompañan increíbles! Además tienen una gran selección de cervezas artesanales a tener muy en cuenta. Muy recomendable si estás en Boston =) 
8193 4 Great restaurant! Cheapish food! Great service! Quick! I had the lamb tibs, ater, and injera bread. All with a side of coffee! 
8194 3 This place is one of the best places to eat down park however the service can be a bit dismal at times. I have eaten at this location dozens of times and it's very good food. 
8195 2 Food was quick and delicious, fresh tasting fish. The set up decor looked great and there was a good amount of people at the restaurant. The hostessing and customer service could be better but overall it was a success coming to eat seafood from this restaurant. 
8196 2 Good if you are looking to save a few bucks and don't mind waiting a long time for services. 
8197 3 Few things about this place, it is very unique, few tables, very charming employees, outstanding sushi, overall fantastic experience. Amazing thank you!! 
8198 4 Jake is the best bartender! So friendly and funny! Makes coming to brewtopia such a blast! He truly deserves some recognition for how wonderful he is with customers and for the experience he gives. Thank you Jake!! 
8199 4 I'm a frozen yogurt snob; this is my go to shop. The flavors are awesome and the toppings are fresh. Never disappointed! 
8200 4 Love this place! Great coffee, nice staff and a really lovely sunny room to read and work in. I really like the music here too :) 
8201 4 Biggest and best beer flight! great burgers and other great food options. sit at the bar, watch the action, great service!! 
8202 3 Great tacos, wide selection, cheap prices. Breakfast burritos are good. Nice hot sauce. 
8203 4 I was able to get in last minute on friday and saturday last weekend! I was happy with my results each time and it only took about 30 min:) Victoria was great! 
8204 2 Slightly better than Cosi (which isn't saying much). But the service is nice and fast. Would recommend getting this if you're in a hurry and near South Station and need something edible and kinda healthy. Meh. 
8205 2 Been here for Dropkick Murphys every year and a Flogging Molly show. Definitely an improvement over Avalon. 
8206 3 Delicious food and beautiful atmosphere. I would highly recommend this restaurant for both it's food and service. 
8207 4 We LOVE this place. Their Mediterranean salad is amazing - fully loaded with chicken, artichokes, mozzarella, croutons, pasta, marinated peppers, olives and greens. Kids love the pizza and pasta dishes. Very friendly and helpful staff. Nice newly renovated bar seating. 
8208 0 Food is very average. They have very few options served for the buffet and not worth for 15$. Pani poori and bhatura are good. Interior decor is good except the Ganesha artwork near the Bar area. Definitely not a place for authentic Indian food ! 
8209 1 I am sad to say I was not impressed. I guess I am just a traditional sushi lover. The food was ok:( but their sauces were really good! 
8210 4 Food and service were excellent! Their steaks and all the side dishes were amazing! If you are not sure what to order, ask your waitress and you won't be disappointed. I loved their caipirinhas too. 
8211 4 The Disney Imagineers did an awesome job with the France Pavilion... Everything in this area is very beautiful...There are plenty of shops and places to eat in this area... If you haven't seen this area of Epcot it's worth checking out on your next visit. 
8212 3 Pack a picnic & a camera and you are set for an afternoon of simple R&R. 
8213 4 The Barking Crab is right on the water. Good luck getting a table, but it's well worth it. The food is great and there's a great outdoor deck atmosphere. Lobster Roll was excellent. Beer selection also terrific. I loved the Crabby Lager. 
8214 1 Service and food slow. Food was nothing to come back for. Beer... (shrugs shoulders) You have one time to make a first impression. 
8215 2 Nice rooms but pricey and distant from the night action, 
8216 3 Used to be my FAVORITE place. Loved the wheat pizzas with amazing toppings. Recently the last pizza I got was WAY below par. I was actually a bit embarrassed that I so strongly recommended it for friends. New management? Bad day? 
8217 4 Love this place! Food is fresh and tasty and fast! Just the right amount of spice as well. 
8218 4 This place has really good food! We stopped going to IHOP to come here. I like the variety they have, something for everyone! Good portion sizes and nice service. Been here twice and each time has been a good experience! 
8219 4 When I go to Titaya's, it's appetizer, main course, tea, AND dessert! What a spectacular experience....get the fried rice balls and seal your fate! This is my fav Thai place in Austin! Thanks for reopening! 
8220 1 The food was good same with service. This is the first "Mexican" restaurant that I've been to that ever ran out of HOT sauce. 
8221 3 Another Texas BBQ classic place Centrally located on Riverside Line at 2:30 pm on weekday illustrated popularity Had moist brisket and TASTY ribs. Sides were all good, nice beer selection Would return 
8222 4 Amazing taste and price! I got the Big Tex Yo-rrito on my first visit and haven't ordered anything different. 
8223 4 Fantastic food and beer selection. Ordered the maple bacon cheesburger and it was incredible! Wife had the same thing and shared the same opinion. Great place 
8224 4 Just stopped by here after church. Everything was great ! I recommend the spicy ramen. Service was excellent and prompt! 
8225 4 We've been back numerous times at this point and it has quickly become our favorite spot. The spring rolls are ridiculous. Would love to see a grilled pork banh mi added to the assortment. 
8226 4 Awesome! I'm excited about this addition to the restaurant scene. Excellent creekside patio I'm excited about sitting there outside of mosquito season! Great wait staff and really solid menu. Definitely worth adding to the sway, wink and Asti rotation. 
8227 4 Peking duck had crispy skin served with tender duck meat on moist " tortillas" Better get here before the owner retires 
8228 4 Such a nice place to see a comedy show it's a smaller place so it makes the show more personal we got to see Craig Robinson who is so funny puts on an amazing show and a great comedian 
8229 3 Quaint little spot near the waterfront. Many southern flavors-definitely a good place to try something out of your comfort zone. EMPANADAS. Did I say empanadas? Warning: the wings are tasty but greasy! 
8230 4 By far the best Pho I have ever had...ever! I have had Pho all around the states and nothing compares to the broth I had in the beef pho here. Everything was extremely fresh and top quality-especially the basil & mint. I can't wait to go back again and again. 
8231 3 This place is very good. Also, the Asian / Hawaiian market next door is mind blowing good!!! 
8232 4 What a view. Kennedy Space center right across the water. Food great. Service friendly. 
8233 1 Got to try finally after all these years. Haven't been to the one in Eastie since I was a kid. It tasted good but thought the size was kinda small. Price was decent but could get a larger size for same. Not completely disappointed though. 
8234 3 Got the blueberry cake donut, pbj donor, buttermilk old fashioned and a cinnamon sugar donut. The cake style ones are better. Overall delicious and great service! 
8235 0 An absolute dump! And a shakedown to boot. After booking online they demand another 100 bucks from you at check in. The room is clean but the carpets are dirty. 
8236 4 Always been my favourite to get my korean bbq so I don't have to cook it. Always good and fresh. Taste never changes. Always available 
8237 1 Gross. Would not recommend. Used to be better. Saturday night and food was cold, unflavorful. Honestly not a single dish was appetizing. Large selection though. 
8238 4 I've had nothing but pleasant experiences dining at Hakatamon. Not only is the cuisine here authentic, but they provide generous portions and great service. A must try is the Katsu Curry (I prefer the chicken), the dish is full of flavor and the reason I keep on returning. 
8239 4 So glad we discovered this place! Our favorite thing to get is the sampler (chorizo, chicharrones, beef, potatoes, etc.) with rice and an order of plantains - they have the best plantains I've ever tasted. And those sauces.... 
8240 4 Birthday dinner for my daughter. Excellent all around, both food and service. Had the paella myself; it was better than the one i ate in Spain. 
8241 2 Was super excited to check this place out and it was just ehhh. The prices were kinda high and the service was just ok. I ordered the chicken kababs and it wasn't bad just average.. off of my list. 
8242 4 My favorite place to stop in for a Drink, after seeing a Movie Next Door. My Son luv the FishNChips, it's Top Notch. Mr Jones 
8243 3 Perfect place to have winter noodle soup & hot dumplings...All vegetarian options are yummy.. 
8244 4 I miss the old set up but their food is really good and the service is fast. The chicken sandwiches and cheese fries are my favorite! 
8245 4 Just had 12 of these delivered as a gift to my office. I'm in heaven and now my coworkers love me because I shared! 
8246 4 Best bagels hands down. I'm obsessed with the jalapeno bagels with jalapeno cream cheese. Yes, please. 
8247 4 What's there to say that hasn't already, great food in a nice atmosphere paired with attentive service. 
8248 4 Best dentist in the North Shore let alone Saugus. I usually hate dentists but this place was efficient and painless without skimping on anything. I actually had a pleasurable experience at this dentist. Thank you!! 
8249 3 This is nice, tiny place for a cozy date, but I wouldn't recommend it for a group. Not only is it a small place, but that's just not the vibe. So get a cocktail, order some bacon-wrapped dates, split a big arepa, and get sexy. 
8250 4 This is the best German food I have had. The German restaurants I have been to in NY cannot compare to Willow tree. The good is amazing and my husband loves both the food and beer. AMAZING. 
8251 4 Sushi is always fresh and yummy. If you like tuna, I suggest the ahi poke. They have unique roles if you want to try something different. 
8252 2 The place is a typical college taco joint. There emphasis is on beer and alcohol than food. The place is extremely loud and serves mediocre tacos. I haven't tried any of there other foods so maybe those are better than their tacos. 
8253 4 These guys are great. Jonathan has a real feel for making adjustments and a great approach towards educating his patients. Highly recommended.... 
8254 0 I won't be riding this again until I have kids who may enjoy it... Definitely not worth waiting for... 
8255 2 Why why WHY must their parking be terminally stuck in SUCK? Alas, you can't order anything in Alon's and go wrong, but I'll only visit if: a) I'm already in the area b) parked elsewhere (legitimately) and c) someone else goads me into it. 
8256 4 The manager was able to fit us in without a reservation. The food was great and the patio was a great atmosphere. The server was amazing (Billy). I highly recommend this restaurant. 
8257 2 Affordable but taste wise much better options in portland. Even food trucks in Downtown are a much better option 
8258 1 The food wasn't good enough for a 2hr wait and poor service. I wouldn't recommend this place. 
8259 3 This is my go to place for comfort food. The congee is flavourful and the noodle dishes are consistently good. No real complaints about the food but the service is pretty typical of any Chinese restaurant. 
8260 4 Still my stop when I have time in ATL. Well worth heading to Concorse E. Hate the new wallpaper - woodland scene. But I just will people watch instead 
8261 4 Great place for lunch and dinner. Wine selection is very good. Food is awesome price is fair service is great atmosphere is casual but nice! 
8262 4 We have been twice now. Great service and food. Can't get enough of the grilled Caesar and the beef and blue pizza. Nice Chianti as well. It's always busy which makes it fun! 
8263 3 Good food, but too cramped. Service was very attentive and accomidating with the menu. 
8264 4 So many people underestimate this place ! They have the BEST late night menu. Drinks are never more than 4 dollars. And they have pub pizzas that are 2-3 dollars and they are amazing ! I promise you guys you're missing out ! 
8265 3 the boneless wings here are very tasty, crispy and have a lot of sauce on them just like I like. 
8266 4 Jerry sold me just the right tires at a reasonable price and had them installed just the way I wanted: stems in all the same spots and balanced from inside. The ride in my full-custom King Ranch is the best yet. And the store is very customer friendly. 
8267 4 Best Ramen I've ever had! I got the spicy umami. The broth had so much good flavor, and the ground pork, too... Thick noodles...just the right amount of spice...perfect. The atmosphere was lively and fun, too. Def. a solid spot to check out on Rock Rose. 
8268 3 Dark. Cozy. $1.50 PBR pints during happy hour. Huge portions of guac/salsa/chips if you order that (and I recommend doing so). And, of course, you can pet the wallpaper when you begin to slump against the walls after all those cheap drinks. 
8269 4 Had the salt ramen. Excellent value, great portions, and looked fantastic! But mostly awesome in taste. Served in a nice China bowl which gave it the feel of a nice restaurant and not a fast food styrofoam bowl. Check it out. It will become a regarding stop. 
8270 4 Jeremy and Eric were amazing! We had a huge bachelorette group they were thorough and attentive to all of our questions and request. Best server and service we have ever had. Lastly they were sexy! 
8271 3 Absolutely some of the best live music in the Boston area, for zero dollars, and some remarkably hard-to-find beer on tap (you may never have had a Guinness like this outside of Ireland). 
8272 0 Thanks for responding as the new owner, but I don't have my fur babies anymore Wish you success Had to pick a star to post Nothing to do with business 
8273 3 This place is consistently thorough! They take the time to do the job right. My car - inside and out- always looks great without spending a lot! 
8274 3 I love this place. Their subs are really tasty. You can't compare Subway or Quiznos. The quality is so much better at the deli. 
8275 3 I always love coming to Hyde Park Bar & Grill when visiting Austin. The service is always great and I love their chicken fried steak and awesome fries! Give them a try! 
8276 4 Fresh in house smoked meats and fresh foods. Good selection of craft beers and a great outdoor patio. Also lots of tv with the tennis channel. What more can you ask for. Great experience tonight. 
8277 3 Another restaurant we visited while in Massachusetts. I had the lobster roll and lobster bisque was excellent! My husband had the burger and he loved it. Service was excellent. I recommend this spot. 
8278 4 This place is great! Everything was delicious, home-made dumplings are world-class. It feels like your aunt is making the family recipe dumplings behind the counter :) Must try!! 
8279 4 The service is good. Fast. I got my car inspection done in 20 min. It costs 29.5 bucks. 
8280 1 Mediocre food with no interest. It seems the only reason this place is one is inertia. Bad decoration, huge menu without clear focus and uninspired food make poor use of a very nice space. 
8281 3 Best Ramen noodles in Boston! Big Portions and great taste. (Ok, SF ppl you have much better ramen over there...I mean AMAZING, but this is all we got). Prefer this over Mei Tei Noodle in Newbury. Big fan of the Soy Sauce Noodle or the Miso. Also like the ravioli 
8282 3 I visited here twice during a trip to Concord and Boston in 2015. Pizza was delicious, and we catered it for a small party with some friends near the end of the trip. Over a weeks period our group went here twice, and it was appetizing both times. 
8283 4 I saw their first show 'Reasons to be Pretty' on the Hertz Stage and loved the new, young quality of theater they are bringing to Atlanta. Can't wait to see their upcoming season. 
8284 0 The service and food are both unacceptable. I have been there 3 times, none of them is satisfying. Last time, I ordered yam fries. The fries seems from yesterday, and they also served my BBQ burger with cold beef inside it, which made me so upset. 
8285 4 beer.....great atmosphere........whimsical food.....exceptionally average great meetup spot to get away from the wife and kids if you know what im saying so many tvs very friendly wait staff left my number in a receipt and got several texts back strong rec from the team 
8286 0 i was is love with chick fil a but the company is tricking with the menu size. Next time open your sandwich and see that the piece of chicken is 3/4 less than a year. Drink size is smaller and the portions. Is business only. Pay more for less. 
8287 4 First time here and the food is amazing. The staff is possibly the most impressive I've ever experienced, in terms of going above and beyond to make sure everything is exactly how you want it. Best customer service I've seen in Boston in maybe..... Ever! 
8288 3 This place is for License holder only... The price is fair. They store various beauty supplies. Only one thing I have to complain about is hard to find the price tag on the shelf or on the supply. I would appreciate if they have price tag on individual supplies.... 
8289 4 Five stars just for how nice the hostess was when I asked to see a menu. Didn't actually eat there. (Who will flag me first???) But from the friendliness I know the food will be lovely. Love nice people! 
8290 4 Beautiful place to visit and take wonderful pictures.. make sure to walk the trail because there are more beautiful sites as you go. 
8291 1 Very expensive and machinery is not top notch for the cost. 
8292 1 Service is slow, tables are sticky, and the condiments at the table needed cleaned off. ( dried on the caps and down the sides of the bottle) I just felt gross being in here. Potato salads were very good, but other than that, good luck. Yuck. 
8293 4 Macchiato on point, served with a sliver of wafel. Interior is open and perfect for taking a breather to people watch. Plenty of seating options as there is a second floor. Will definitely come back if ever I'm in the area. 
8294 4 The food and service here are top notch. They have a good selection of vegetarian items, and the tzatziki is fresh and delicious. Try the beignets! 
8295 0 I was very disappointed with everything here tonight. My party of 3 all received the wrong order. I was served the most slim turkey burger that Boston restaurants have ever seen. Service was very slow, unattentitive, and lacked luster. No positives at all with my experience whatsoever. 
8296 4 Flew in from New Orleans and got lucky! Pizza was great and service excellent. Shout out to Kevin (our waiter)....he rocked! If ever back in Columbus we will definitely return! 
8297 4 Finally! the coffee place the community sorely needed. Great coffee, great snacks and great service. Highly recommended, let's help these guys stay here for many years to come! 
8298 4 Amazing place for the family! It does get crowded so stop there early! They have everything you could possibly want there! Great food trailers and atmosphere. 
8299 4 Bought some gorgeous cookies here for Valentine's Day, as well as a pink champagne cake. They both tasted amazing and a decent price :) 
8300 2 This was a great donut shop, but I actually preferred the plain donuts over the fancy decorated ones. It had an outrageous line (though it had just opened) and it did not move fast. 
8301 3 Our server Nic was great. Loved the oysters we ordered. A lot of variety on the menu and a great beer selection on tap. Mango salsa swordfish and dirty rice dishes were really good. 
8302 4 I love that this place is open late, but what I love even more is their pie! They don't come tastier. I've also always had good, friendly service here. Just wish I lived closer. 
8303 4 We recently attended a lovely birthday celebration here that was held in their private dinning room upstairs. The food was exceptional and the staff were incredible - Napa caliber which is the highest compliment I can give any front person in a restaurant. Well done! 
8304 4 I love this place, it's much cleaner than the other IHOP places, less wait time and the staff are friendlier. 
8305 3 Solid food! Their steak was high quality, their Chicken Mole was quite authentic and their Margaritas were strong. The only thing that was interesting (not to my taste) was the pickled veggies. Overall, this place is much more authentic then the run of the mill Mexican food places. 
8306 3 Convenient location, quick and friendly service, tons of parking, good standard food - everything that's good about Panera! 
8307 4 I am a local and enjoy both the atmosphere and staff. Greats beats poppin inside. Wide and unique variety of food. Strongly recommend! 
8308 2 Food is amazing. Service is absolute crap. Came in today with literally no one else in the restaurant except for us and didn't get checked on once. Ambiance is awesome. I wish the service was better ... Then would be a 5 star. 
8309 2 Cool stuff but I am from Salem... lol it seems like a over priced and improved pac sun and the people working there treat you like your the one working there but they do have the best gimmick and little gifts 
8310 0 I pass this location all the time and decided to give it a try this time, and the food wasn't the same quality expected from Krystal's. 
8311 4 Amazing service. Super friendly, reattached my fog light and taped up my my rear view mirror for no charge. Super cheap. Go-to place 4ever 
8312 4 My favorite Mexican restaurant in Gresham! The shrimp tostadas are gloriously fresh and flavorful. Tacos are on point, soft or hard. Breakfast burrito will fill you up for the entire day! Awesome salsa bar. Perfectly blended horchatta and even a drive thru! 
8313 1 OK buffet, food is fresh enough but it's a dive with a lot of old people and rednecks. If your on a diet, pass on this place. Nothing healthy to eat, mostly fried foods and very oily vegetables. Read it got 100 points from health department (almost a closing score) 
8314 4 Cheap and also high quality sushi. I've been ordering from this specific sushi place for years. 
8315 4 Going to keep it short and sweet. The Truffled Mac and Cheese appetizer deserved 5 stars all on its own. 
8316 4 I've been coming to Bobby for my nails for over 15 years. He and his wife Cami make a great team! Relaxing atmosphere, awesome Pedicures and clean, quality services by all the techs! 
8317 0 Delivery took two hours and the food was terrible. Worst pizza I've ever had my life. Would not recommend or order from here again 
8318 1 Tried again this week, gave it another shot. Same results, greasy bun, so-so fries and a relativly neutral tasting burger. 
8319 0 Went there to have dinner. It was hot as hell in there. The bartender said"A/C is broke it is a problem all the time". My wife and I left without trying their pizza Pretty sad that ownership knows of the problem and does nothing. 
8320 3 Great Burger Joint ! The onion rings are insane for sure. Just good food ......... puts a smile on your face. 
8321 4 Loved this little store. Walked here from the pan pacific to pick up some essentials. They have everything basic you need and lots of other fun goodies too. 
8322 3 I LOVE Lady Siam. I've had their spring rolls, crag rangoon, bubble tea, noodle soup with beef and many other dishes. The food is always hot, fresh and flavorful. They are my number one pick for Thai in Arlington. 
8323 4 ROCK SHRIMP ROCK SHRIMP ROCK SHRIMP I order the same thing everytime and drive an hour to do it. My favorite restaraunt. 
8324 3 Update: I am very appreciative that the management at Horizons has made an effort to address my concerns about the service that I received. Because of their attentive and friendly service, I think they deserve some extra stars. I am looking forward to going back and giving them another chance. 
8325 4 Ordered from here yesterday and loved their chicken tikka masala! Definitely one of the best in the Boston area! delivery took about an hour which is pretty standard for most places in my area. Looking forward to trying more of their dishes! 
8326 3 Suan la Chow Show is what we came for. And it will always be one of our favorite dishes. We have tried (as have others), to reverse engineer the recipe. We can get close, but Mary is holding the recipe close!!! Delicious!!! 
8327 1 Pedicure was good, polish lasted. But very unhappy with Shellac mani. Used the same brand as usual (CND) but technique was not good. Shellac is chipping and separating from my nails after only one week. Usually lasts for three weeks. I would stick to basic mani pedi services here. 
8328 3 Great food. Highly recommend the Grilled Cheese with smoked gouda, pesto, and and smoked salmon. That's right. Staff is super friendly. Only downside is they have horrible music playing 90% of the time. The remaining 10% is when a staff member brings in their own iPod. 
8329 4 Allison is so helpful and the store is so well designed that you will want to buy all your shoes there and never leave! 
8330 4 Great outdoor seating with a beautiful view. Delicious cocktails and salmon cakes. The only improvemtn I would like to see is better salad leaves, they were too dry and bitter, and I think a few more outdoor night lights would be nice. 
8331 3 Nice brunch spot. The berries and cream crepes was so good. I also tried the summer in italy which is french toast with fruits which was also pretty good. Ordered takeout this time but would definitely come back to dine in. 
8332 2 Nothing special about this place, terrible service at the outside bar last time I was there. I saw the bartender taking out the trash more than she was behind the bar. Overall pretty average but a good patio to hang out and have drinks. 
8333 4 It's an authentic pub with great local brews and incredible food. Nice ambiance, great staff (thanks Jill!) You can't do much better than that! 
8334 4 I bought the man I love a benchmade knife (unprovoked) and he proposed to me. It wasn't quite one right after the other... but I like to think they are related. Thanks Northwest for helping me pick the perfect one out. 
8335 3 Have visited twice now, wonderful breakfast, try the egg pie, wonderful. Only complaint would be some of the waiter,s. If you decide to eat here often buy a cup, bring it in with you for a discount. Reasonable prices. 
8336 4 Great amenities, even better staff! Right across from the shoe and staffed by college students eager to take assist you. Valet parking or third party self parking only, which is to be expected on campus where even staff are required to pay for parking. 
8337 1 Food is ok but the service is not that great some employees are kind of rude. 
8338 1 Food: Awesome live band for brunch. But it was hard to get enjoy the music while plucking soggy fruit off my soggy french toast. Nightlife: Fun on Friday and Saturday nights; good music and dancing. Probably will avoid the food to avoid upchucking on my friends- drinks are enough. 
8339 4 This cozy Juice Boutique rocks!! I had Grandpa's Smoothie w/ peanut butter & Tassili had Sunrise juice. Both were yummy & soooooo good 4U. Freshly made & ORGANIC!! Chillin on a Sunday afternoon w/ my Sistar Tassili. Met the owners & their daughter. Very cool people... 
8340 4 Great outdoor space and food. I've been there three times in one week. I'd highly recommend both upstairs and down. 
8341 0 It took over half an hour to get the food. Twenty minutes in a line of 5 people. They got my order wrong and forgot barbecue sauce on the burger. Huge disappointment going half an hour out of my way to get here. 
8342 2 Tasty food. I had quiche made to order. Mushrooms very good. Kids Mac & cheese is Kraft, but good for the 5 yr old familiarity. Service is friendly and attentive, if not precise. 
8343 3 Yummy, reasonably priced pizza on Newbury Street. Ambaiance and decor are nice, and they can usually seat large parties or handle large reservations. 
8344 4 On a Sunday we put $100 down on 4 new Yokohamas for our 2003 Element. They got them in on Monday. On Tuesday I paid the balance ($614 out the door including the $100 down). It took about 20 minutes. Super nice people, awesome shop! 
8345 4 Great Place IF you can find a parking spot. Of Course, at good places, that's always the case. And this is a VERY good place. Get the smorgasbord. 
8346 4 This family owned business was excellent! Food was fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. The service was very friendly and helpful. Owner helped us with food selection since we aren't very familiar with Cuban food. Menu changes daily. Restaurant was clean. This is a restaurant definitely worth trying! 
8347 4 I eat lunch here 3x a week. The bread is always fresh. The sandwiches are delicious... try the chicken pesto on a grilled roll with buffalo mozzarella. Fast service, clean and friendly. 
8348 4 Amazing crepes. We are vegetarian and they accommodated our requests. Love the original arugularium crepe for breakfast. Will definitely come back again! Service is great and servers are very friendly 
8349 1 False advertising for the wine section. The years are not accurate. Glasses for wine are very dirty. Gave us plastic utensils. Otherwise great service. 
8350 4 So wish I could have spent more time here!!! Bartender was awesome (and hot), happy hour was great and music was perfect!!! Came in two nights in a row, and will be back as soon as I'm in Austin again!!! 
8351 4 The story of this place is fascinating. the Tour was fun and informative. Great cocktails and infusions. Can't wait to try the whiskey after it's aged in barrels 
8352 4 This place is great! The cashier is always nice and the food is good :) can't beat that, and it tastes way betetr than the chains like Moe's, Tijuana, Qdoba, etc. 
8353 4 Honestly one of the best brunch places I've ever been to. Great pancakes, biscuits, French toast -- omlets are awesome (ask to be cooked hard if you don't want it too runny). The berry syrup is AWESOME!! Honestly you just can't go wrong here. 
8354 4 Had a calzone and it was delicious one of the best I have ever had!!! Service is great and selection is awesome. 
8355 1 I always want to like this place but they're way too expensive for the kind of restaurant they are. 
8356 1 Used to love the rabbit here... really. I think something has changed and the menu looks like it took a detour from southwest to Italy. 
8357 0 Just don't go people. Horrible wait time, horrible service and horrible drinks ever-time we've come here. Don't go 
8358 4 Read the other reviews. I agree, this place is excellent. 
8359 3 Oh yea! This place is good! We came for breakfast on a weekend. Walked right in and sat right down, no wait. The food was very tasty and service friendly 
8360 0 Staff was rude, came on family night and they wouldn't take my coupon and coupon didn't say can't be used. Food was bland and not ready when we arrived. Ugh won't be coming back 
8361 0 Still very slow. One cashier on the weekends as the other workers are doing something else of a lower priority. 
8362 4 I'm a burger fan, so I always look for a great burger in Austin. Their burgers are really delicious. The meat is extremely high quality, which gives this burger a classy taste. Amazing burger for a 'drive through' service. 
8363 1 Try the "killer" drink has good flavor and comes in a shark cup with a plastic mermaid. Tacos were good but expensive at $12 for two. 
8364 3 We had a good time at the Chinese New Year celebration. The performances were quite good. The ticket price came with several dollars towards the food. 
8365 0 I'm 9 months pregnant and all I wanted today was a meatball. I ordered takeout and was so excited to come home. When I opened the bag I was so upset that I only got spaghetti. No meatballs even though that's why I paid extra! 
8366 3 this was realllly good pho. the food came out quick, the restaurant is clean with ample tables and seating. would highly recommend if you've got the vietnamese craving. 
8367 4 Always amazing service! They knew exactly what i was asking for and didn't try to up sell me. I can trust them and know my pool will always sparkle. Don't forget to download the app for 10.00 off at the register. 
8368 4 Mike is one of their best mechanics. He always makes sure to get the job done right. Everyone there is just great with people. They make everyone feel welcome at their location. 
8369 4 A great spicy fried chicken! Hard to find fried chicken with the moistness and spices which are soaked into the chicken and breading. Some of the best you will find in town. 
8370 4 Much better tonight. Fresh, flavorful shashimi made for a delicious dinner. Great staff. Attentive. Cool aquariums that fascinate kids and adults. 
8371 4 Stopped in for a bite to eat after hiking at McKinney Falls State Park. So glad we did! Everything we tried was fresh and delicious. Will definitely come back when we are in the area! Staff was very friendly and atmosphere was great. 
8372 2 Target is certainly a step up in it's genre. This "Greatland" location is a poor example though. I think it's the amount of traffic coming through that keeps things out of stock here. While this one may be bigger than most, don't think that automatically equals better than most Targets. 
8373 3 Very very clean place and yummy options in both vegetarian and non vegetarian options. The chicken biryani and curry were super yummy and the bondas and pakodas were so good too!the pineapple milkshake in the end cuaght us by surprise and was so refreshingly yummy ! 
8374 4 Hands down the best Italian food in North Austin. Skip the chains, this restaurant is home grown and delicious! 
8375 4 Friends from out of town came to visit and we had a burger-crawl. Went to four places: Flip, Varsity, Yeah Burger, and The Vortex. These were the best. It wasn't even close. 
8376 4 The food is amazing here. Their truffle rosemary fries are heaven and I loved their veggie burger. Definitely try it out. 
8377 4 It was a little spendy, and typically I would've felt a little out of place somewhere so fancy feeling. But I felt right at home and the food was worth every dime. I highly reccomend the portobello, spinach, artichoke omelet. 
8378 4 Always a fun place, but gets very busy! Lots of entertainment and a huge variety of beers. Food is good too, but it will cost you a pretty penny. Get there early! 
8379 3 Piano is a little too loud. However, the food is excellent and the overall ambience is nice. 
8380 4 Great experience from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. The food was great and the selection of dishes gave us some nice options. 
8381 4 Love me some Mama's. Fresh, friendly service and atmosphere. Great value and quick for lunch time 
8382 1 I really wanted to like. Close to home and perfect for Sunday after church. The tortillas and chips did not appear to be homemade. Queso served cold and was bland. Service was slow and inattentive. Not a terrible place just not any place I will plan to return. 
8383 1 Went in to check for vegan options. No crepes available for me. All have eggs and dairy in them. But they do gluten free. 
8384 4 Such deliciousness!! Katherine was an awesome server - so pleasant! She made the experience even better by making some recommendations to us that really made the breakfast that much better! 
8385 1 Happy hour margaritas from a mix, bartender seemed miserable. Left after one drink but food looked pretty generic and in huge portions to satisfy tourist clientele... 
8386 4 Very professional and reliable. I've been using their bi-weekly home pick up and delivery service. I highly recommend. 
8387 0 Food violation tickets issued by the health department. Need I say more? Just take a look at Fraser Health's website for Violation Ticket Offences Issued Against Food Facilities. 
8388 4 Wonderful location. Everything is always exquisite. Ask for Dalibor to be your server. He is as good as it gets. 
8389 1 A little too touresty for my taste. Food is so-so. And waits are too long. There are way better establishments in German Village. 
8390 1 Wasn't a fan and almost slipped on the greasy floor. They were to busy to get good service. 
8391 4 Incredible! So much patience for children, great physical and mental work for all. Cannot say enough about the family that runs the establishment. 
8392 4 The only thing better than a delicious breakfast burrito for $6.50 is a delicious breakfast burrito and unlimited diner coffee for $6.50. Also the staff is the sweetest. I feel great about this place, the end. 
8393 3 Aside from the funny name (say it out loud and you'll get it), good food with major variety and fun combinations. Avoid it during lunch time when college is in session, too busy then. 
8394 2 The food is just ok. The outside is so bright it's unbeatable. The deck needs some sail covers so as not to be so exposed to the sun's rays. 
8395 4 I had a great experience with Austin's Custom Tops from the measuring to the installation. Kevin steered me in the right direction when it came to choosing the right kind of materials for my bathroom countertops. Great communication, always punctual, excellent work. 
8396 0 Serious Customer Service issues at this location. Never had such a blatantly rude server in my life. If you are an airline employee staying at the attached Comfort Inn and Suites, don't bother with this place, they'll treat you like vermin. 
8397 4 I eat here three times a week and it never fails. everything I've had is top notch. especially love the gyro. don't be afraid because it's on burnside, this place is clean and the service is great. prices are totally reasonable and they have options for carnivores and vegetarians alike. 
8398 0 Horrible customer service. Been trying for 30 minutes now to make an apt for a stereo installation. Trying option 3 for Sales Associate and option 4 for Geek Squad. No one answers either line. I literally started calling at 12:00 and it is now 12:25 and still no answer. 
8399 4 Japa Dog is the reason I visit Vancouver. JONASAPPROVED! 
8400 4 My husband an I have been going to Dr. Bell for a few years now. He's wonderful and the dental hygienists are, as well. Highly recommend!! 
8401 4 I was suprised that I was contacted by Keith Beitler Sr.VP, COO and asured us that the problem we had would be fixed and extended a sincere apology. I'm glad and feel that our faith has been restored. I most certainly will give this establishment another try. 
8402 4 Ossorio's is wonderful!! Their pastries are fresh and handmade. Their coffee is great. We've also had their wood fired pizzas which are amazing. It's a great place with a wonderful atmosphere. Don't forget to try their homemade ice cream! 
8403 4 I absolutely love Yoga con Amor! I love the Vinyasa & Hatha. The teachers are patient, knowledgeable and have great personalities which is so important to me. It is just the positive energy that I need! 
8404 3 Saturday morning rush was crazy, as expected. Once we sat down we had prompt service. Drinks and food was delicious. Server recommended the black bean scramble, and I ate every bite! The scotch eggs were awesome! 
8405 4 Amazing tacos. And it's with the authentic mini tortillas. Taste like home. Various meats. All very tasty. Tacos estilo Mexico. Hechas con tortilla chica. Tienen varías carnes, todo muy sabroso. Mi lugar favorito para tacos. 
8406 4 Great deli! Amazing sandwhiches. Nothing is better than picking up their steak tips and a bottle of Stubbs on the way home to grill. 
8407 4 As authentic a German experience as you are going to get in central Florida. Authentic food beer and bands playing all your favorite polkas and encouraging Prost! 
8408 4 What a GREAT place! Super friendly too. They have a wonderful southern menu, and serve breakfast all day (they're open til 3PM). The homemade chips were great, and I can't wait to try their homemade corned beef hash...it looked amazing. 
8409 4 Definitely one of the top donut contenders in town! I enjoy the grown-up flavors, and the locally sourced ingredients. Not to mention, friendly service every time I've been to this location! 
8410 3 I like this place. The barbeque is moist and tasty. Ice cold beer. Good service I have had the sandwiches as well as the brisket meals with cole slaw and veggies. BBQ sauce is tasty with holt and mild/ 
8411 4 Consistently delicious in both brews and burgers, great staff, fun atmosphere, punny shirts - what more do you want in a burger joint? 
8412 4 Great local establishment and tasty burgers! I really like their new Philly cheese steak slider. The Staples are great too ( esp sellwood ). 
8413 4 Fresh shrimp and fresh homemade soup! And Don't get me started with those free corn fritters! So delicious! Come hungry! Thanks for great service Josh! Well stop back on our next trip! 
8414 1 Unfortunately this location is very slow and looks dirty. You wouldn't believe you are in the Heathrow/Lake Mary. 
8415 2 Dated old, needs reno's or updating. If you're a Sheraton or Starwood fan then you can stay here. There are a lot of hotels in Vancouver and this wouldn't be my first choice. Views are spectacular as at one time in Vancouver's history was the tallest building in the city. 
8416 4 A buffet featuring a large salad bar, soups, pastas, breads baked potatoes and dessert. Make sure you try Joan's Broccoli Madness - my favorite! A very good value for the money. I go about twice a month on a weeknight. 
8417 4 Yutzy's is great! Spices, bakery, jams, jellys, dry goods, local produce in season, but what really keeps folks coming back is their deli counter. Meats and cheeses at prices much lower than you can get in your local grocery deli! Well worth the trip from Columbus. 
8418 4 Damn they just do everything right! I have tried most of everything they have, and it's all perfect. The meat is perfection, the buns are soft but don't fall apart, the spreads are kinda magic! Plus everyone who works there is really sweet! 
8419 4 My rating is for the pizza only!!! As I've been going there since I was a kid and it's all I get. That with a salad and sometimes the onion rings. I only get in there about 3 x a year, but every time it's worth it!!! Best pizza ever!!! 
8420 4 my son loved it we went three times this year havent made it back for the new part of it cant wait to go back 
8421 3 Yummy food and scorpion bowls are amazing! I especially love that they have a separate menu for those with a nut allergy like myself :) 
8422 4 I know you've seen similar pictures from other reviews...another won't hurt Rasberry Rosemary Buttermilk. Get it. That's it. 
8423 4 Worth the wait! Best meal I've had in a long time. The fricasee champignon was rich and fantabulous. Lavender latte and chocolate-lavender mocha were awesome. And the bacon... Oh, the bacon! 
8424 4 I had the waffle and bacon, my brother had the French toast and sausage. It was all delicious but the French toast was amazing. Seriously, the best I've ever had. The service was friendly and quick enough. Everything was made from scratch so I would have expected to wait longer. 
8425 4 The best sushi I have ever have in my whole life. Before I ate the Spin Roll Sushi, I did not like the idea of eating raw fish, lol. But I changed my mind. They are the best in town. 
8426 3 Outstanding pho and summer rolls. Very clean restaurant. Service was fast and the food very flavorful. Will cone back. 
8427 4 So my first thought was I was gonna get IHOP or Denny's style food... ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!!! The food was out of this world amazing. Our server Erik was extremely helpful in giving us suggestions on what was good. Definitely a come back spot!!!!!!! 
8428 4 Still amazing!!!!!! I know when my dogs do circles upon seeing the Dot Dog owners, they are in the best hands ever. A gem in our neighborhood for sure! 
8429 4 I used United Worldwide to get me to Logan airport by 6:00am. Making reservations was very easy and the car was there 15 minutes early and the driver was very friendly!! I have recommended United Worldwide to my friends and family and they have all had excellent experiences as well. 
8430 4 Theo and his wife work together to provide amazing service and delicious food. I highly recommend the authentic Brazilian cuisine and will return next time I am in town. 
8431 0 I called and left a message on a machine that said they'd call back in 15 minutes. 20 hours later and still no call. I'm moving on but company with a 5-star rating does not ignore phone calls. Who is writing these reviews? 
8432 3 Nice little shop. Stopped in after a show. Only tried the iced coffee-which really hit the spot. But all the pastries look d yummy!! 
8433 4 Awesome service. On time, thorough, enthusiastic, and great prices. I've tried other mobile detailing services and they don't compare on any front. Go for this one!! 
8434 4 The brussels were great, the pizza was very good, the pasta pomodoro was amazing. The atmosphere was cool and the art all over the walls was eclectic and interesting. Our server Kaley was the icing on the cake. We'll be back! 
8435 4 LOVE the rib sandwich here! Drinks are great too. Can get a little busy, but the wait usually isn't too obnoxious. 
8436 4 good food, good decor and friendly staff. One of our favorites. I love the morrocan influence, the waffles and they make really good coffee! The lavender mocha is a must try 
8437 4 Manny was extremely professional and very helpful. The food at Chinese Mirch is the best Indo-Chinese food around. 
8438 3 Pekoe offers a nice selection of teas, their coffee is also good and service is friendly. The atmosphere is pleasant with enough seating and a small patio. Light colors and contemporary, actually, reminds me a little bit of Vic's. Good option for a small break during the day. 
8439 4 Went here for valentine's day and had a great time. Our server Geronimo was super knowledgeable and friendly, making for a great dining experience, highly recommend him. To top it off the food was fantastic as well. Make sure to try the Amaro drinks with your dessert. 
8440 4 Unpdate: Been missing our old stomping grounds in Sanford " Pachino's". Was great to see Ben, have those ONE OF A KIND Garlic Knots , and his Meat Lovers & Bianca pizza. Sorry to have moved. It always happy to go back when we can!!! 
8441 4 Everything was so great, but most importantly I am super lactose intolerant and I've never been to a restaurant before that offers toffutti before! I really appreciated that so I could my bagel with lox 
8442 3 Hostel was hospitable from the very friendly staff to the complimentary beverage for relief from the humidity! For one slightly past my "hostel" staying years, this was comfortable, inviting, and intriguing! The only caveat is the din from the environs is real so bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper!! 
8443 3 We went on a 'down' time. PARKING - Easy on the street but was during 3-6pm day time. DECOR - Love the spacious couches, large windows, sectioned off areas, a pretty spacious bar area. 
8444 2 Hotel service was great. The property is starting to show a little age. Elevators are old and gym area kind of so so. The service made it worth the stay. Room was cleaned good every day. Staff was especially nice. I recommend it. 
8445 4 I've been wanting to check this place out for years. Finally got my chance and I was not disappointed. I would recommend trying as much of the menu as you can because it's all good! Best Chamorro food I've ever had in the Pacific Northwest. 
8446 3 Big, gooey, wonderfully unique donuts. Psyched for this place and their recent success. Can't wait to come back! 
8447 4 Fast and efficient service for an exceedingly fair price. Both men behind the counter were a bit curt, but I can't complain when it's $2 a key and I was in and out in under 5 minutes. Would recommend. 
8448 4 Excellent and quick service. I really needed my phone screen fixed fast, because I needed it that afternoon, and they accommodated. Plus, just generally nice guys. Definitely recommend! 
8449 4 Great service. Incredible food. Try the ribeye, and (my favorite) Lobster Mac and Cheese! For dessert, the Creme Brûlée is out of this world. 
8450 0 It's a donut and that's it. Lemmings line up to wait for no real reason. 
8451 3 Wish parking was better..but that's the Austin way of life. Great coffee..got the winter half moon latte. Came in on a Tuesday in the afternoon and there were no seats for 3 of us to study at. Intimate setting 
8452 4 Easy access Ample parking Quick seating Clean table Diverse menu Great Thai soup Complimentary soup of day with entree Nice waitress Quiet atmosphere Clean restrooms Great prices-$13 for 1 person with beverage Free tooth picks 
8453 4 I had a lamb burger which was really good. This is a very creative burger joint. My friend ate a veggie burger. The only downside is that this place was crowded even at 2:30 pm!!! 
8454 0 Insofar as this is a terrible bar, I furthermore assert that my friend shan't not have been exiled from their premises. 
8455 4 Great job & honest price for headlamp replacement. I have a European car that requires a bit of effort in changing a lightbulb. A new lightbulb assembly and replacement was only $40.00. Fair price. I will return. 
8456 4 Green Chile Pork taco - that's all you need to know! And it was phenomenal!!! My stomach is growling just thinking about it!!! 
8457 4 We Always make sure to stop by here when we come up from Eugene. Loving Hut has amazing food, great service and a wonderful message for the world. The sweet and sour divine is too good for words. 
8458 4 Just a great pizza delivered! Timely and still hot, with a thin and chewy crust. Really reasonable prices too! 
8459 4 From the drinks...appetizers.. entree to deserts. Awesome Customer service was great. Looking forward to coming back ! 
8460 4 David is our "fav", he takes such great care of us and mixes with the BEST!! He keeps us coming back!! 
8461 3 Wonderful food! Awesome scenery!! Bar service was much faster than sit down portion of restaurant. The fish and chips were the best I've ever had. 
8462 4 Delish bagels!! So fresh and they remind me of New York. Big fan of the employees too! Very friendly service!! 
8463 4 very clean place with polite and professional staff. I definitely recommend this place to everyone. 
8464 4 Fantastic coffee shop! Bright and open with lots of seating. Good coffee by Cuvée. Fast internet that's provided by the hotel (100mbps). Great place to come get good coffee and get some work done. 
8465 3 Good food, good service. Not a chain. I love it and their patio is awesome. I will be back. 
8466 3 Interesting menu, off of the beaten path of menus. We enjoyed the flavorful dishes, and the drinks were superb. Perfect for drinks and a smaller appetite. Go for the unique offerings and flavors, in food and drink, you won't be disappointed. 
8467 4 Hidden gem! I was meeting a friend here for lunch and had trouble finding the spot. My god, they blew me away! I had the scallops and couldn't stop eating! It was great!! Highly recommended. 
8468 4 Very good restaurant, I have been eating here for over 11 years now and it's always a treat and an experience to come here. 
8469 4 A dream of a coffee house. Vietnamese iced coffee, amazing desserts, comfy chairs and free wifi. Bonus points for playing a great in-house soundtrack and using iPads with Square card readers! (it's just cool) I could sit and enjoy a coffee here every day. 
8470 0 I would recommend either delivery or take out for this restaurant. My sister and I tried to go here twice both times the air-conditioning is not working on severely hot days in the month of July I would suggest that the restaurant get their air conditioning fixed !! 
8471 3 good food for lunch break and fast serve. will definitely come back again! 
8472 3 Another great meal at Joe's! Sam, our waitress was great and quick! 20 min wait to be seated at 5:00 on a Sunday. I didn't expect them to be so busy, but it is a holiday weekend. The s'mores dessert was yummy. 
8473 4 If you've got the money and want to be pampered and sample some of the best and most interesting food in Austin, this is the place. And that's that. 
8474 3 Love the tots, hate the kickballers. Just don't come on kickball night and you're golden. Those fuckers just block every single TV in the joint and make it more like a frat party than a bar. Overall, good food for a sports bar, decent beer selection, nice location and atmosphere. 
8475 4 My mistake, I actually went through different restaurant and review this one in error. They can keep the five stars and I'll make a point of going there this week while I'm in town. 
8476 4 What a funny little restaurant if almost looks like it would be for takeout. Ordered the chicken appetizer - wonderful! And pad Thai! Definitely going back :) 
8477 3 Bar crawl on the Freedom Trail and one runs into this place. I was really impressed by it. Typical Irish bar, nice bartender, they know how to pour a pint of Guinness as well. I would like to make a return to Boston and keep this place in mind. 
8478 3 Food is great. Space is great. Other guests? Not sure yuppie quite captures the holier-than-thou feeling I was surrounded by. Loved the polaroid pictures and would go back in spite of the fact that I was obviously beneath the company gracing me with their presence. Puh-luh-eeeeeaze. 
8479 1 I've come here before and it was really good, but the quality was definitely gone this time around. Left all the beef shanks uneaten because I couldn't even bite into it. 
8480 1 Average wine, average food, average service and average atmosphere- the price is above average for what is provided. Although I'm very disappointed and will not be back, it was one of the only places that didn't have an hour wait to eat, hence the 2 stars. 
8481 3 Some very tasty dipping sauces. The pomme frites and the Liège waffles are pretty good. They also make poutine, and they have a very interesting sandwich menu. Good service. Friendly staff. 
8482 3 Service was great, portions were perfect for the pricing. Three co-workers ordered the salmon on a plank and loved it. 
8483 4 Me and my family went here tonight and it was amazing. The service couldn't have been any better and the food was delicious and mac and cheese to die for. Typical pricing but worth every penny. We will definitely be returning. 
8484 4 The restaurant delivered!! Great service and delicious food! I loved the crab Rangoon dip and the Deliverance meal!!! I will be back! 
8485 4 We have worked with Mark many times over the years for both power washing and gutter cleaning & have found them to be economical and efficient! Good to work with and punctual. Would not call anyone else. 
8486 1 They had no forks!!! This was 2 hours before they closed. The fries were pretty good though, and the shrimp was decent. 
8487 4 Great time well worth the money and the experience is one of a kind. Thanks captain Thomas. I love the water fall and I got soaked. 
8488 4 This might be my new favorite breakfast place! Tried it out in January and everything about it was awesome. Great choices on the menu. Service is outstanding...Bloody Mary was good! And even better their Mimosa's are huge!!! Can't wait to go back! 
8489 3 Called to get them to come back and deliver the drink I ordered, but they did come back. Food tastes great. 
8490 4 This place was so awesome I got a buffalo cauli sandwich with fries and it was so bomb Most delicious vegan food I've had The cook was fine too so that's a plus 
8491 3 Very good Italian food. The happy hour is excellent. Penne carbonara was a standout. Glad to find some good Italian in Colorado! 
8492 3 Meats are very good. I had the brisket and pulled pork sandwich. Sides are slightly above average. 
8493 4 We are right across the street from a bus stop that takes you downtown, and a 15 min walk from the newly developed boardwalk on the river. Place is decent but Savannah, property manager, really makes it the great. 
8494 4 Very, very friendly people who work there -- which is more than you can say for most dry cleaners. Fast and affordable service, and they also do great alterations (hemming, in my experience) 
8495 3 The best Italian food outside of the North End. With 8 tables the dining is certainly intimate. On Friday & Saturday you better put your name in and then plan to go for a drink. I'm a fan of Chicken Marsala and don't forget to order the house Merlot. 
8496 2 Stopped in for a quick cocktail before heading into downtown...small, comfortable and interesting. Divey but the atmosphere is thoughtful and you can smoke inside. We sat at the bay window and sipped. They also have underwear with 'the bside' written on the butt. Cute! 
8497 3 I'm a huge fan of this place! They have a great selection of soul and classic rock. The prices are extremely reasonable, and I haven't heard a record that didn't play terrifically. This store has a great feel and I they've won me over. Customer for life! 
8498 3 Have come here multiple times for bites with the hubs and friends. Plump mussels, luscious oysters, cocktail specials. Truffle fries are delicious and happy hour menu is very decent. Great location and although service can be spotty, once it gets rolling it is quite enjoyable! 
8499 3 OMG so good! Food=Delicious Drinks=Fabulous Staff=Friendly & Knowledgeable Love this place. 
8500 2 Decent burger - nice selection of condiments. I'd say better than Mighty Fine but about as good as Five Guys (but pricier). Casino el Camino still has the best burger in town...still miss Becks Prime though (used to live in Houston). Will go back to try the bison, lamb, etc... 
8501 4 The staff is great and the doctor really takes her time with patients. I have been considering laser hair removal and will definitely be doing it here since they have been so great with my regular dermatological issues. 
8502 4 Fantastic atmosphere, delicious food for meat lovers and vegans alike! Awesome veggie burger, salads, Reuben.....Cool beer selection. Cool people. You gotta go! Chamblee has a new star!! 
8503 4 Popped in for a lil champagne and charcuterie- great time! Great service, knowledgable on our meats and cheeses, and made it fun for my kid as well. Def swing by if your in the North End. 
8504 2 There is really NOTHING in Beaverton. But there is El Pollo Loco. Concentrate on the dollar menu. Get heaps of thighs. You will not be disappointed. 
8505 4 Food was great. Service was friendly and prompt. Chill atmosphere. Love that dogs can eat alongside with their humans. 
8506 3 Really nice looking Starbucks inside the Animal Kingdom. Staff was friendly and pretty quick. The attention to detail inside the place was pretty incredible. Even more amazing was the pricing was pretty average and not marked up because it was inside Disney (cheaper than NYC at least). 
8507 4 Great food, great service and great prices! I had the lamb gyro but I plan to come back and try more options. 
8508 0 Wow. It's like Hotel California. You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave...because you'll never actually make it through the checkout. 
8509 4 This place is our favorite chinese take out restaurant. Super close to where we live, clean, good food and friendly.what more can you ask for a Chinese take out 
8510 3 Perfect go-to hk-styled restaurant with consistent hours of operation. Your typical Chinese food and above average service here. A smaller place but I haven't waited for more than 10 mins whenever I come! 
8511 3 Yum. Great Food. We really like Indian food and have enjoyed many dishes. For intimate dinning experience reserve a table down stairs. 
8512 3 Fun times! Great atmosphere...reminds me of the clubs in L.A. And the bar tenders were generous! 
8513 4 Best Pizza Ever!! Love the story! Venice to Vancouver. We love the pizza Mr. Did! Perfect crust and awesome toppings. 
8514 1 This place always smelled good so I gave it a shot. I was disappointed in everything I ordered. It was all edible but none of it was enjoyable. Service was meh as well. 
8515 3 Line was long but the donuts were good and HUGE! Does not accept credit or debit cards, they do have an ATM in the store but it's better to just make sure you have cash on you. 
8516 3 Courteous staff. Competitive pricing. I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this store 2 days ago. I appreciated their honesty and quick service. Definitely will return and would recommend them to anyone that will listen. 
8517 0 Worst chipotle ever! Dirty, bad balance of ingredients, and bad flavor. How is this possible??? Also, this one doesn't sell beer. I shouldnt have eaten the burrito...... 
8518 2 The tacos here are pretty good and cheap--I can usually be in and out in under 5 minutes during the mornings. However, it is very small and can get very "cozy". 
8519 4 THE place for Christmas shopping for all of the men in life. So professional, so knowledgable and so kind! Their selection of men's clothing and accessories is on point and reasonably priced. 
8520 4 Good for late night eats. Steak bites, grilled BBQ ribs, grilled asparagus to name a few of the bomb shiz they have on happy hour. Great pours, cheap beers, nuf said. 
8521 4 Best chicken everr Best service everr Best business ownership in austin everr 
8522 4 Biked from Portland to the Sextant. Great ride, and then a Bloody Mary with a terrific view at the river! Service was terrific. Everything ordered was as expected. I'll be back soon! 
8523 1 I was surprised at the small number of non food booths. Very crowded. Some of the food looked interesting but very long lines Especially with an entrance fee I was expecting more. Less interesting then a trip to Granville Island 
8524 4 This place is great! $1 Sangrias and free app at checkin. Came on a Wed and it was Karaoke night. Good crowd and great staff. 
8525 2 the student was nice, the reception area and greeting desk were not receptive to me as a walk in It seemed they tried to talk me out of coming in for services. 
8526 3 amazing goat curry and cabbage!!! Absolutely delicious. Also try their sweet tea! 
8527 4 i got my best brow threading here their service is great, employees are very nice and polite and they really care about the customers! definately coming again! 
8528 3 Nice views on the water, fun atmosphere and tasty seafood! Lobster rolls were delish! 
8529 4 Hell ya! That's my kinda pizza. Got bike delivery, staff was very nice in guiding me on the menu(my 1st time calling or trying the pizza) Thanks guys, keep up. The good work! 
8530 4 I absolutely love this place after visiting Atlanta last night on a Saturday night for the first time I really enjoyed myself and the atmosphere was great thank you I really had a good time and will be back in the future again 
8531 4 New murals by local artists make this my favorite Fellini's location. Calzones are delicious and filling. Great atmosphere. Patio seating available with fountain. Ample parking. Friendly staff. 
8532 3 Been to Kimchi couple times for lunch. its a fun little place. Food is good, servers are friendly. I usually have their Bento boxes. Its not the best korean out there, but its pretty decent. I would definitely recommend the place. 
8533 4 Best Tiramisu I have ever eaten. The Seafood Special has more seafood than pasta. Fantastic! 
8534 4 Can you say yum!!!! Best Indian food yet. Spicy enough to make you sweat but not spicy enough to burn your mouth off! Lunch buffet today! Price $10 per person. Great selection! However, if you like your food extra spicy they do accommodate!! 
8535 4 So unique and delishios food choices! I went with my boyfriend and we were wow'ed with all of the options. The crab Rangoon dip is out of this world. The burgers are FANTASTIC!! 
8536 4 For pretty much the same price or less as a Disney hotel you can rent a condo or house with a private backyard and pool. It's only a couple minutes from Disney and is very safe and quiet. We had a great time and will definitely come again! 
8537 4 Order an artichoke sandwich, boyfriend ordered some type of burger. Both tasted absolutely amazing. Bloody Mary's also great! Dogs are welcome here and I believe they eat free on tuesdays. Will be returning! 
8538 3 Overall, I liked the food and atmosphere, although service was slow. It's always a bit crowded. but the place doesn't get me excited, like some other Austin mainstays that have a more unique menu. 
8539 4 I will fess up that I don't drink much wine. However any of the wines recommended, my guests and friends rave about the choices. Lots of selection. 
8540 0 Ticketed for parking in a restricted area although there were no signs ($55). Five other cars near me suffered the same fate. Total scam by the city. 
8541 4 Trendy cafe in the SoCo area. I stopped by here during a street festival where i had an excellent pan seared tuna salad. The decor is modern with a retro 70s touch. Great margarita's 
8542 2 Ok, nothing special. Friendly service, the burgers are good , but the menu could do with some variety. Three of them differ by only a single ingredient. Would go back maybe once or twice more to try other offerings, but that would probably be it. 
8543 2 The shows are nice but that's about it. Everything else is extra. You have to schedule time in advance for the dolphins major attractions are closed. Not really worth $99 a person at full price. 
8544 4 Fresh ingredients on our pizzas made this one of the best we've had on the North Shore. Add great service, and we had an excellent meal. Stay tuned for more reviews on this welcome find. 
8545 4 Swim lessons kids. Hands on instructor, maximum 4:1 ratio. Lots of personal attention for each child. Reasonably priced. Very nice clean facility for pool. Family changing rooms separate from womens/mens lockers. Life guard as well as instructor. 
8546 3 New ownership and a helpful/fast staff makes this place a vast improvement over it's previous incarnation. They care about the quality of tires the sell and are one of the few shops open on Sunday. Tell 'em I sent you. 
8547 2 Nothing to get excited over. I don't think the coffee tastes as good as starbucks, but I'm also only ordering the girly drinks. Overall an OK alternative, but I would rather go to SB or TexExpresso. 
8548 3 The food was great. tried the calamari, pizza and caramel apple crostata. all highly recommended. the ambience is very nice. However, what really stands out is the friendly and helpful the service. I would go back just for that. 
8549 4 Incredible food and service! Very modestly priced for the quality of the food. Definite recommendation 
8550 4 HEB Prices is very competitive and have good quality. They also have lots of coupons therefore you can save some money. 
8551 4 Amazing!!! Chicken was absolutely delicious along with huge waffle! Highly recommended Sweet Jam! 
8552 1 Any one with dietary restrictions beware. Good luck trying to substitute or modify any menu item. 
8553 3 I tried their ramen with salt based broth. it was very good but I wish the price was lower and the broth would have been perfect if it was just a little bit less salty. 
8554 4 Authentic Italian deli and restaurant with gelato and excellent coffee. Great pizza. Unbelievable wine list - one of the best in Austin! 
8555 3 Cash only hole-in-the-wall, but their Tacos Al Pastor can't be beat. 
8556 3 Great atmosphere and good eats. I highly recommend the French dip and the creme brûlée. 
8557 4 Everything looks and tastes amazing. If your on vacation looking for an inexpensive dinner this is where you want to be. Out of the 7 days we were on vacation, we had dinner here 3 of those nights. The fajitas were my favorite! 
8558 4 Love this cafe! I'm all about coffee, this is a good change of pace from the normal Starbucks routine. The cafe is huge, nice areas to sit and people watch (or homework or work..) coffee is delicious! Really great service as well. 
8559 1 fuck - I just want a donut - I dont need a "gourmet" twist to one - just a donut. I feel like its overdone - glad they exist - i mean - sure why not - but yah - once ya had one you've had the experience. YAWNNN 
8560 2 I'd written a review some time back about La Parilla and somehow it transferred to Tkilas. I don't see a delete option and I don't want malign Tkilas because I've never been there. So sorry. 
8561 0 I ordered rotisserie chicken, more like a damn pigeon, server was slow to take care of us, but quick to grab the check, never again 
8562 0 Ordered Dukboki with cheese but there wasn't a shred in mine Not the same without cheese 
8563 4 Best automotive shop ever. They did not tell me to say that. Very knowledgeable, very professional, prompt, clear explanations of problems, good prices. I would recommend to anyone near Boulder to take your car to Boulder Valley Automotive. 
8564 4 Great gourmet burgers (all natural beef) and crispy hand cut fries. Service was excellent too. 
8565 3 Generally good experience with the service group. They dealt with making sure we had an appropriate loaner for the few days our Rover was in the shop. I have seen improvement since my initial review - up to 4 stars. 
8566 3 Tolles Ambiente und coole location. Sowohl aussen als auch innen mit schönen Sitzmöglichkeiten. Die Speisekarte läßt nicht viel Aufschluss was man wirklich bekommt, ein wenig Phantasie braucht man schon. Die Cocktails gut gemixt und mit 8-13 CAD (ohne Tax) absolut im Rahmen. Service bemüht und sehr nett. 
8567 4 Quick, easy and great quality for the price! They specialize in eyebrows and are experts! 
8568 3 Went during happy hour. Had a salad, calamari, pasta with Bolognese sauce, brussels sprouts, bread, Crabcakes,, and a meatball.. Oh for $30. Very tasty and will return! 
8569 3 Food was awesome, only thing is , I wish it was served much hotter , some food was cold, other than that staff was wonderful and my food taste like heaven especially my jerk chicken , it was awesome 
8570 1 Crepes were super yummy! But the girl behind the counter is rude as hell! She made a mistake and scream at the customers telling them it's not her fault if they took the wrong order when the customer wasn't complaining but telling them that they got all their order correct. 
8571 3 Had some garlicky parmesan wings....yum and some fall of the bone ribs (honey bbq). They have plenty of varieties you can order - buffalo, bbq, teriyaki, etc. Prices are pretty reasonable. Used a groupon, but will be back w/ or w/out groupon. 
8572 4 Always a solid choice for either a casual dinner or date night. Pizza is awesome and the bar is fully stocked. Great people, too. One of our family staples in town. 
8573 1 Big plates of food for VERY LOW PRICE... but don't expect quality. 
8574 4 Vegan. Tea. Coffee. Sandwiches. Waffles. A few other items if you looking for a quick snack. Excellent place to sit down for some work or reading. 
8575 4 I am super impressed with my first visit! Nancy and Nicole absolutely killed it with my shellac mani-pedi. Definitely went above and beyond making the experience worth every penny. 
8576 2 I'm glad this wasn't canceled by the rain, but I was disappointed in the number and variety of vendors. It seemed to be more of a farmers market than anything else, and I didn't have as much fun as I remember having in previous years. 
8577 2 Food is good overall...but make sure you order extra. Maybe extra extra cheese on Any of the grilled cheese sandwiches because they are SKiMpY on the cheese! This is their only short coming... but I think that's a big one!! 
8578 4 Very clean, generous portions, good prices and delicious food! The owner was very friendly and welcoming. Highly recommended. 
8579 2 Im much closer to Publix but this Kroger has some good prices and I can get in and get out with what I need. 
8580 2 The food is great...but DON'T eat in! The dining room always smells like cleaning products. ALWAYS!!! Seriously, it is overwhelming. After about the 5th time I realized this is the way it is. And you know....I like the guy behind the counter! 
8581 3 Definitely a fan of this place. Came here to get our breakfast fix, and we were not disappointed. Food is great, and you can bet it is fresh. 
8582 4 Love this place! Staff is really nice and informative. Boards and paddles are in good shape and the spot is super convenient to get to! I've always been able to park in the parking lot which is a huge bonus! Can't wait to try Yappy hour one day!! 
8583 4 Great work, done on time and at a very fair price. Jeff repaired my amp head and actually upgraded the components to prevent a future repeat. Highly recommended. 
8584 4 Check out their happy hour on Sunday. 50% off ANY bottle of wine under $100. Great deal. A luxurious way to celebrate the end of a good weekend. 
8585 3 Nice hotel. Pretty decent rooms and great pool area. Room service was quick but the spaghetti I ordered was not the best. 
8586 4 Love love the pickles. Service good & staff friendly. Prices are fair & size of food generous. If you like great garlic dill pickles you will definitely be buying some to take home. 
8587 3 Great place to start learning salsa. The cover is the same regardless of when you arrive ($12) so get here early (8.30pm) and take advantage of the lessons. Also, the later it gets the more the mix of people tends towards experienced dancers, which can make it intimidating for beginners. 
8588 4 Some of the best Thai food I have had! Their crab ragoon is amazing- and so is their Pad-Se- Ew. Basil rice has just right right amount of kick to it.. Very fast service pick-up or eat in. 
8589 4 Out if the three burrito places on Huntington by Northeastern, this "fast food" is my favorite. They have pretty high quality amazing-tasting food, and always change up their menu so you aren't always ordering a normal burrito. I love the burrito bowls, personally. 
8590 3 So Fish Daddy's has has a reno! The service is fantastic, the decor is great and my maragarita.. right.on.time. we ordered a sirloin , fish and chips, Daddy's Painkiller and a Daddy O Margarita that was lip smackin' good! 
8591 4 All you need to know is that this place is great. Fun spot for some live music and beers. 
8592 2 First time here but I think I'll be back. The everything bagel I had was a little harder than I like, but everything included with the lox was delicious and the place is perfectly clean. 
8593 1 Very rude people. Mis-leading on shipping info but for additional$$ you can get them to tell you a straight answer on when your product will arive 
8594 2 Food was pretty good. Service could be better. It was busy concours weekend. Salad presentaion inside slice of prociutto was different. 
8595 4 the carrot cake French toast is like breakfast dessert! and the bloodys are awesome.. Great place. 
8596 0 We live in Lexington and bought a solar system through Astrum Solar last summer. We've been waiting since then for Nstar/Eversource to connect us to the grid. What a disappointing waste of time. One more reminder of the horrible service within monopolies. I'm about ready to call the AG. 
8597 1 Nice decor. Typical small coffee house menu. Had Philly cheese steak panini. Toasted bread, melted cheese and ice cold beef. Way too salty and quite garlicky. Would try again for drink and soup perhaps but not for lunch. 
8598 4 The fresh seafood was outstanding!!! We sat on the back porch and it was delightful. The crudos were outstanding and of course we loved the caviar!!!! We had so much fun! The kitchen was beyond clean!! Highly recommended! 
8599 4 Catherine was a sweet heart and welcoming. I got there Saturday afternoon around 8pm, NO LINE! Service was quick. 
8600 3 Sports bar/restaurant with cool outside space. It is even heated in some areas but unfortunately was too cold out to enjoy. Relaxed vibe yet busy. Only four stars because not much on menu but food was good. 
8601 4 Quick, efficient and now I have a clean car inside and out. The 5 wash booklet totally worth the cost. 
8602 4 My favorite buffet in town. You really get a piece of everything when you come in. The food is fresh and service is awesome. Be sure to ask for Zoli and he will take wonderful care if you! 
8603 4 Great lamb, beef, falafel and veggie wraps! 
8604 4 O. M. G. The food.. it's freaking amazeballz. I got the Shepherds Pie. Huge portion, so yummy. I got the Cleanser juice too. Also very tasty. Yeah, eat here. It's great! 
8605 4 Terrific find! My husband had the vegetarian enchilada and tostado and I had the chorizo tacos. Superb and fresh and as our server said, 'made with love!'. 
8606 3 Love browsing at the cool early to mid century advertising posters. Lots of cool Swiss, German, and Italian posters. Check out their website to see the collection online. They are expensive, but if you're looking for the real thing - then come here. 
8607 3 One of the few...very few...pizzerias in ATL area that you can count on the center of the pizza actually being cooked...instead of a raw, soupy mess. Fresh made, inventive ingredients and combos. Stellar Brussels Sprouts that are extra crispy. Fast, friendly, attentive service. Recommend. 
8608 4 Great service. Mitch was the bartender- he suggested and made great drinks! Cant wait to come back. 
8609 4 Their sodas are amazing, the waffles are to die for and the servers are totally sweet :) would absolutely come back. 
8610 1 This place appears to be closed. Too bad too, cuz I thought it was delicious. Oh and their answering machine isn't setup and they have no notification of closing. 
8611 2 food is great, just order about 3 weeks ahead. the service is sooo slow and the staff is lifeless and disengaged. 
8612 0 Bought one drink here. They took the liberty of tipping over 100% on my card. I had to call my bank and get the charges reversed. Scam!!! Terrible place. Watch your credit card statements. 
8613 2 Great food, delicious oysters. Service took forever and they had the nerve to bring our check 5 minutes into our meal. That is just rude. The kitchen deserves the tip, not the servers. 
8614 4 Off the charts! My wife is Vegan and this is one of two restaurants where we can both eat happily! Awesome Indian food, great service and good value. Highly recommended! 
8615 4 Absolutely exceptional service. They repaired an inexpensive piece that has an immense amount of sentimental value. Their work was top notch even though they deal with much more expensive jewelry. It was ready the next day and everyone was a pleasure to deal with. Highly recommended. 
8616 3 This place is restaurant cum fast food cum sports bar. Undoubtedly one of the best burgers I ever had...nice place quench your quick hunger. 
8617 4 I love their frozen yogurt selection and their topping are epic. While this is a great to visit, finding parking might be a challenge. Great experience to wrap a long work day and a great choice to take the kids for a treat. 
8618 4 Polí nóstimos!! Delicious food, friendly staff... at a fair price. We dined on Lamb - the plate, the salad, and the gyro sandwich. Generous portions, fresh, and tasty. We will be back! 
8619 1 Decent comfort food, but the service is lacking. Ashley helped us and had an attitude the entire time acting like she was going out of her way to do her job. 
8620 3 We came here for lunch. It wasn't too busy, the service and the food were excellent. If you like hot pot I recommend this restaurant. The food was fresh and the broth was excellent - fresh and flavorful. I will be back! 
8621 0 I cant recomend this place its anti gun I value my safety Other places are gun friendly 
8622 4 Fun place with great Ramen! Friendly and accommodating staff. Seating is very Portland with a friendly table sharing tactic that encourages the I interaction between strangers in an easy going environment. The red vegan was amazing, but the tokyo with the steamed pork is like butter, really good! 
8623 0 This was probably the worst mexican food I have ever eaten. Everything was incredibly mediocre and bland and the service was terrible. Never had such awful refried beans. Will not be coming back. 
8624 0 Just one employee to help 15 people jn the line. This is sad!! Tuesday, 9/6/2016. 4:30 pm 
8625 4 This is not a Sushi review, (although my wife did order a roll and I tried it, it was good). The noodles are excellent, they hand pull many different styles. I like the triangle ones, they are awesome. Dan Dan noodles are about as good as it gets. 
8626 4 Kill to birds with one stone, Have the best Chinese food in the area and support a Humphrey St. business! (parking in Hadley School lot) 
8627 4 Tucked away in Orlando's city walk is this awesome sushi bar. Sushi is made right in front of you with fresh fish. Staff were great and service was quick. But most of all the sushi was delish! I recommend the crunchy tuna and the red dragon roll. 
8628 0 Horrible customer service. Nobody acknowledged me when I walked in. Slow service. I was going to get my nails done and I waited 20 minutes and nobody helped me. This is a really unprofessional salon. Avoid it at all cost. 
8629 2 My first experience here with a Groupon was uninspiring as there was basically no pressure, but the manager very kindly offered me a free massage to make up for it, which was better. 
8630 4 Second time going to Classy Nails and I still love it!! I only ever go to Karen 
8631 4 I LOVE CACKALACKS!!! Best chicken you will taste in your life! only bad thing is you won't live long eating these delicious bad boys lol 
8632 1 I wanted to like this place. It's a cool little spot to get a bite. Outdoor seating. Lots of people around. But the food didn't have the depth of flavor I was hoping for. Better spots to be found 
8633 0 Careless and dangerous advice given. They solicit business in any way they can. (You'll notice other reviews suggest aggressive sales tactics too.) Store manager denounces modern medicine in favor of herbs. Beware. 
8634 4 Favorite Restraunt ever!!!!!! I especially love the pesto chicken pasta yum. The service could be better but was delicious while you are there get some desert. 
8635 4 The happy hour here is phenominal....really cheap but good quality food. The service was good also. And the atmoshpere was very quaint and cute. The french onion soup is amazing, and the date cake is also really really good. 
8636 3 Entered very hungry, and left full & satisfied! Great Cuban and the kids loved their Ham & Cheese press. Worth another visit!! 
8637 4 Ive had ADT for several years now my rep Israel Diaz has been very beneficial to me and my ADT experience If you're in the Bakersfield area Id highly contact him if your considering an alarm system, especially the ADT Pulse system it's top notch as far as im concerned. 
8638 4 Delicious! Falafel platter was great- tabouli was so fresh and the falafel was seasoned perfectly. Prices were fair and the couple working the truck (seemed to be the owners) couldn't have been nicer! Definitely recommend!! 
8639 3 Bob's has delicious subs and pastas. I just wish they had delivery! 
8640 3 So I really like this bar. During my visit on a weekday happy hour, the music was chill. Which was exactly what I needed after a hard days work. The atmosphere is relaxed, adult, and authentic. 
8641 4 The food is good, sweets are good... But you just cannot miss their Badam milk.... as simple as that ... 
8642 0 Boring, expensive, small portions. "Homemade" syrup tasted like rotten fruit. Service was mediocre and entitled. Your s*#! does stink employees of Sanborn's FYI... 
8643 3 I think this place is ok. Their food is not very presentable but tastes good. I don't find anything too special here. There is nothing bad really just nothing going too good either. Just ok. 
8644 4 One of my favorite restaurants. Can't beat the buffet and the cream puffs are top notch. Service is always friendly and even when they are busy, the kitchen gets you what you ordered quickly. 
8645 4 Some of the best Thai food I've had in Austin! Their curry comes in huge portions and I always go home with delicious leftovers. 
8646 3 This iconic view of portland is a must see and visit. Its what makes portland unique. It's also a great place to walk around and see the portland skyline or what is of it. It's not anything monumental but it's quite a unique bridge. 
8647 4 Food was fresh and delicious. Very reasonable prices. Will definitely take my family to eat there again soon! 
8648 0 This target is the WORST! I've had to see customer service the past 3 times I've checked out because the items were scanned wrong. I've been over charged or had items doubled. Make sure you're checking your receipt if you go here! 
8649 3 Great food, not too pricey. Ambient was a little dark but helps if it's one of those sunny Florida days outside. You Gotta try the dumplings. Nice assortment of beers. Great service and attention from the hostess to the server. 
8650 3 The Giacomo's alternative when you're not down for the whole line thing. Chicken parmesan was good. Not the best I've had in the North End. Same with the bruschetta app. Very good, not great. A very 4 star experience. Not 5 stars, but still much better than average. 
8651 2 Love this location, convenient pit stop & nothing much in the area in terms of Vancouver Liquor store but parking sucks in the day time. cool that you can buy a 6-pack after you leave their pub too, provided that you're walking home ;) and they do deliver! 
8652 1 Here Thurs. PM with a friend. Poor waiter. Appetizer took a LONG TIME and dinner came about 5 min. Later. Food was fair at best 4 shrimp in the shrimp scampi...4 ! Probably won't return. 
8653 2 Yogurt was delish but the staff was a little on the downer side. I understand it was the end of a holiday weekend but we got out into the rain to grab yogurt there! In their defense... They let us try all the flavors we wanted and it was late 
8654 0 I agree with the person that complained about alterations. They completely ruined a pair of jeans I was having patched. They also run late and didn't have my dry cleaning there when they told me it would be ready. Disappointed... 
8655 4 The massage and the place is calm and relaxing, I advise you to come and try their work its amazing 
8656 4 Legal Sea Foods is on point! From the Chunky New England Clam Chowder to the Steamed Crab legs the meals are mouth watering! Other dishes I highly recommend are the garlic mussels and oysters! It's another no-brainer! Check it out while you are in Boston! 
8657 0 The service and welcome was very very bad. We went for lunch, rather than asking us to wait, the waiter said, it's gonna take 15 to 20 minutes.. He was not polite also. I won't recommend this place 
8658 4 Best Burger in years but it is all of the other things that make this a favourite. Try the Ginger tea too. 
8659 4 It's been a few months since I've been in. The old sign is still up but they must have switched owners. It looks like the menu has changed a bit. The chicken shawarma is even better than before! 
8660 2 Solid latin offerings here, great spot for an authentic cuban sandwich. Love the cuban chicken dishes. Or ask what's good that day and go for it. 
8661 0 Waitress took a twenty dollar bill and never came back with the change. She assumed it was the tip on a $40 bill. 
8662 3 I love this place. Old school diner with great greasy, fattening, carb-laden breakfasts. Very friendly staff, great location in Multnomah Village that feels lost in time. 
8663 3 Great assistance and very knowledgeable, prices are really reasonable 
8664 4 Fantastic food. I could tell it was a great place because the parking lot was full and there was people waiting outside on a Tuesday evening. It was my first time having duck and it was perfection. 
8665 0 Placed an order both stating "NO BROCCOLI". The meals were covered with broccoli and the flavor was awful. Both meals were thrown out. Garlic bread was burnt as well as the mozzarella sticks. Was a total waste of money. 
8666 4 Bought a few of their beers at a local place in Seattle and new I had to stop in at my next Portland trip... All their beer is fantastic. When I stopped in I wasn't disappointed. Great location, make it a must when visit local breweries. 
8667 4 Great and unique flavors! Rich, creamy and delicious. Had some excellent vegan ice creams also! 
8668 3 Food is very good. I prefer the steak tips myself but alot of good deals Staff is always great. My favorite server si Angie. Very attentive very friendly, very pretty and a very cool Irish accent. 
8669 1 I really have nothing nice to say Expensive, Parking is Hard, Food is lousy, bowling is a joke. 
8670 4 I work down the street and this place is great! Yummy sushi and seaweed salad. The lunch specials are delish and a great bargain. 
8671 4 Tried it for the first time yesterday, very good. Really like the bread they have and definitely can't beat the price 
8672 3 Good service. Good drinks. Why the bump to four stars? The men's restroom downstairs! This was one of the nicest I've seen. Spacious, clean and a couch and a fireplace! Good job! 
8673 3 Really good service and good Indian food..I would highly recommend the roganjosh. A good blend of flavors with the right amount of spices. I was also surprised with the great quality of naan bread which was perfectly cooked. 
8674 4 AMAZING COFFEE. Good location (not a lot of parking, but walkable if you live in the S. First area. Hands down my favorite shop in Austin!! 
8675 4 Great place to go for great food and entertainment. Waitstaff was very nice and helpful. Food was delicious, the dancing was a blast. If you dont have a good time while there it's your own fault. 
8676 0 Terrible service. We ordered food and 1.5 hours later it still had not arrived. I called and the lady kindly offered me a refund. That was her definition of customer service. 
8677 4 Absolutely love the deck/patio and backyard feel, not to mention the fantastic food from Patrizi's food truck. Super friendly bartenders, not overcrowded, away from the street - I have zero complaints. Just know it is tucked away nicely and is hard to spot from Manor. 
8678 4 Amazing Mediterranean food for a great price! Had the beef and lamb combo plate for lunch and it was delicious! 
8679 4 Excellent pizza, but bring back the coffee shake!! Really bring back the coffee milk shake, it was awesome 
8680 4 I wasn't super pale before the airbrush but it turned out looking very natural, even and fresh!! many people asked me if I "got some sun over the weekend." I loved their office, it was very tasteful and welcoming. I will definitely be returning and recommending to friends! 
8681 4 ***Ate here @ The 2012 Taste of Atlanta event*** Had the "Combination Feast"...it looked funny, but tasted damn good! Especially that beef stuff that looks like a turd! lol! Thel amb meat is on point too! I've slept on this place for year, but I'll definitely drop by now! 
8682 4 Richard is awesome. I don't ALWAYS get the style I want, but his confidence makes me like my haircut lol.. and then it grows in really well. haven't been to any other hair salon in the past year! he also resembles my uncle.. woohoo! 
8683 3 Cozy cafe on Newbury with tasty Vietnamese / Thai eats. Convenient location, reasonable prices, large portions. Decent pho, huge menu including boba drinks. Really friendly staff and fast service ftw. Great neighborhood option for those in Back Bay or shopping on Newbury. 
8684 4 I found this Thai restaurant at yelp! Small, cozy restaurant. Service was good. Food was excellent!! Will visit again. 
8685 3 Great food needs a bit of work on the service, particularly bar service. Loved the happy spoon, black cod and miso, and several other dishes. 
8686 4 Really fresh toppings and yogurt! Friendly and helpful employees, I took my yogurt to go and they put an ice pack in the bag so it wouldn't melt!! 
8687 4 Gus was so sweet when helping me order when the online thing was messing up. Give him a raise. Also sell your special seasoning and garlic sauce in mass quantity pleas and thank you :) 
8688 0 Food was gross and bland Orange juice wasn't orange juice that's was sunny delight Slow service!!!! 
8689 4 Really really good food! Honestly the OMG French Toast was the best french toast I've ever had and the breakfast tacos were so full of flavor. Everything that came out of that kitchen looked so good. They played some fire throwback songs too! 11/10 would recommend. 
8690 0 the chips and salsa were 10 times better than the food ... Bland , bland. Bland - don't order the ahi tacos - sucked big time - get Asian nachos from turners seafood in Salem to compare 
8691 4 Got a beer flight and it was delish. Great beer options. Didnt have food though. But the atmosphere was great w option to bring dogs 
8692 3 Visited Skyview based on a Groupon deal. I enjoyed the view of the city. It was something neat to do. It's a one time type of thing though. Good activity to bring friend's or family from out of town. 
8693 3 If any canadians out there are in need of a poutine fix, this is your spot! Very cool and casual spot. Fries were yummy. 
8694 2 Memo to self: avoid calamari in Irish bars... Chewy (frozen), no lemon slices? No sauce? 3 stars for cheap beer and parking. 
8695 3 A quick run for a Coffee frap while my clothes is drying at Washatopia. Always pleasant and quick. This place is great. 
8696 3 I always get excellent and friendly service here. This morning is no different. The baristas are always so sweet and on the ball There aren't many seats here so this Starbucks is more of a take your coffee to go place. 
8697 0 Absolute trash. I'm not sure who DJ's but he/she isn't good. Your job is to read the crowd not play trash all night. 
8698 0 If your into fast food places with an Ethiopian menu, Desta is for you. I expected a more classy establishment, instead I found a tourist attraction more in the style of a Golden Corral. 
8699 1 Lobster roll was nothing to write home about. It had almost no flavour. It is a cabin-like place, but the bug plus is it's right on the water so the view is wonderful. Would not go again though. 
8700 2 I agree with the rest of the Yelpers on this one: you could definitely do worse than The Sevens, but don't bother making it a destination. There's nothing particularly bad about it, there's just not anything particulary outstanding about it either. 
8701 0 So far there's a whole lot of waiting going on and not a whole lot of transportation. Not exactly how I planned on starting my vacation, so hopefully when they actually let us onto a shuttle the ride itself will be spectacular. 
8702 0 I really liked this place until I found out they lie about there glass and manufacturers and up sell cheap crap. Don't waste your money on liars looking for a buck. 
8703 1 The food is what you would expect from a Baja Fresh. The problem I had was they missed half of the ingredients. I ordered a roasted veggie burrito with chicken, which comes with beans and rice. They forgot the rice and the chicken! That being said, the veggies were good. 
8704 4 Tip from a Portland resident: Please skip Voodoo and come here instead! These are where the real donuts are. 
8705 4 I've been going to the Parkway Cafe for decades. The comfort food based menu, friendly & fast service, and unheard of prices for Boulder make for a great experience. I think it's best for breakfast, but the lunch specials can be great too. 
8706 3 The staff is always nice and the happy hour is very reasonable. The black bean and maki salad is so tasty! 
8707 4 Quite possibly the best burger place in the World. Gourmet, locally sourced burgers with great fries! Service is great & happy workers. They have always accommodated my daughter since she was a baby in a stroller to a crazy active 4yr old. 
8708 4 Always a great experience!! I have been a client for several year and have always enjoyed my treatments from the wonderful staff. Dr Vandeveer is very warm and personable and have enjoyed her one on one conversations at the amazing client appreciation parties. I recommend them to all my friends! 
8709 2 The rustic handcrafted noodles are earthy and chewey. However menu selection isn't too deep. I was hoping for Japanese pub food like karaage or okonomiyaki. 
8710 4 This place is exceptional place to grab a well-made cocktail on the weekends to avoid the hustle and bustle of the typical douche establishments. Pretty Cool place to chill 
8711 3 Reliable and efficient, this auto shop has a good reputation locally and they live up to it. Their service is perfectly fine and they are able to provide some good customer care. Doing business with Cooper's was a decent experience and I'm happy to recommend them. 
8712 4 Real interesting flavors - even the bizarre ones are delicious. Always fresh & warm. I believe once they run out they close, so don't expect donuts at 6 pm, or even 3 pm on a wknd, really. Skip the Voodoo line, these are worth the (shorter) wait. 
8713 4 Turtle Dragon has a wonderful group of practitioners. I saw Zach Beattie several times for hip pain and PMS symptoms and it's made a world of difference! 
8714 4 Great breakfast! Nice to have local, Fresh, in season choices! I would highly recommend this little gem! 
8715 4 Amazeballs!!!! Breakfast tacos with sprouts?!?!?! Too good! 
8716 3 Right in Dedham Square is the Dedham House of Pizza. The staff is friendly! Also the are efficient and professional. The pizza is very good and they have lots of subs and dinners. Additionally they have specials of the day I like how the place is very clean and welcoming. 
8717 4 Nectar cafe is so damn good! The staff is super nice and helpful and the food is to die for! Great for vegans and non-vegans! 
8718 1 Went for $1 domestics on Tuesday. Definitely have had better service. Mostly a college crowd. 
8719 3 The food was very good and the atmosphere was nice and calming. The manager or owner lady came by a couple of times and thanked us for.coming. The only negative things were how awkward and nervous the waitress was, and there was too much pepper in the fried rice. 
8720 3 Small place with great food. It was late in the evening but the service was good and the food excellent. The salsa bar had some good stuff on it. I would go back again if I'm in town. 
8721 3 #Yelp100 New to BJs Club, always been a Sam's club dude, but this place is nicely laid out, good selections of most items, I'm a fan of Bjs for sure 
8722 4 Took my daughter and grandaughter there, it was great, home cooked food.good service. 
8723 4 I give Bob five stars simply for its green curry - just perfect. Very nice staff and accommodating for our no reservation large group. 
8724 4 This is one of my fave breakfast places. It has a really fun atmosphere and classic diner style breakfast. I have been going here for years and have never had a bad meal! 
8725 3 Although they don't always carry donuts with ingredients that call my name, it's still just amazing what they can do. I only wish they had more choices for coffee. 
8726 3 Sausage and maple waffle and killer espresso. 'Nuff said. 
8727 1 The food was decent. The service, however, was, pardon the French...a s&#t show. Enough said, because I don't even feel like spending the energy to write this review. 
8728 0 Sadly i used to be a regular. Dropped in one night for some chicken teriyaki waited ten mins then walked home. The chicken I got was not even cooked! I couldn't even bite it. Totally bummed, this place was once great. 
8729 2 Excellent Pizza a bit pricey but still ok for the first rate ingredients they use... Will def go back 
8730 3 Doesn't look like much on the outside but definitely knocks it out of the park in terms of bang for your buck. The tortilla soup is tasty, the stuffed avocado is delicious and who doesn't love bottomless tortilla chips..? Stop in! It'll make you look like a real foodie. 
8731 0 Worst customer service ever! Scammed us when I bought my wedding dress then got me again when I had to buy a dress for a friends wedding! Terrible business! 
8732 3 I haven't had dumplings in years and I'm eating primarily on the gluten free ones here. They were super good!!!! 
8733 0 Very racist staff. Will never go back. Staff was very rude and didn't serve to people of different races 
8734 4 Lovely place The whole family enjoyed it , a lots of choices and everything looks delicious 
8735 1 I've been here 3 times. Food quality is ok. Food quantity is impressive. Waiters are less than impressive Building itself is cool. A happy hour drink might come half full. It's a chain..what can I say. 
8736 4 I want to write a long review of Mount Bonnell, but there's not much that can't be said in a few sentences. A fun hike, if you walk the stairs. Spectacular views. Romantic. Great photo-ops. And it's free. Honestly, what more needs to be said? 
8737 4 Place is absolutely divine! Everything from the service to the setting was superb and the food was delicious. I'll be going back there soon 
8738 4 Fried Chicken slider was delicious Beef sliders were just as good. The fries taste fresh cut (like In N Out). We will definitely be back. 
8739 4 Outstanding service. The black seafood paella was amazing. Well worth the drive from Sorrento, we will definitely be back again. 
8740 3 Great house beats. Tiny bar in the back. Comfortable seating, very unique. You're basically lounging on raised carpets. Only good for smaller groups (under 6). 
8741 3 The service was great and the wait time wasn't too bad. I ordered the half rack rib meal with fries and Brunswick stew. The food tasted good, but I had to cut my own ribs. 
8742 4 Great food! Great people! Open late, what more can you ask for? Buffalo chicken wings are highly recommended! Steak and cheese is also pretty decent as well. Definitely worth the trip if your in the area. 
8743 1 Don't sit at the bar. All they do is service bar. Weak at best. Burger is great, but doesn't hold a candle to Chattanooga 
8744 2 Not a bakery and rude staff -- very popular with locals though. The place was clean and food was fine, but this should be labeled restaurant. Good location, but you may have to park a few blocks away. 
8745 3 We needed breakfast quick as we were in a hurry to leave town and found ourselves lingering and savoring a wonderful breakfast! Customer service excellent great experience 
8746 4 The room was great The hot tub was great Everything was great Even the pantry restaurant was great 
8747 3 Cool space. Not your typical spa music playing in the background. She was knowledgeable about naturopathic remedies. She was able to spot my trouble area without me pointing them out. She offered recommendations for methods to heal problem areas. 
8748 4 I got the buffalo "chicken" burger. It was awesome. Must go back for slushies. Nice patio too. 
8749 3 The food here is very good and the staff is helpful. If you like your pizza crust crunchy ask to have the crust cooked longer or else it will be soft. 
8750 3 The frik is really good! I loved the cheddar one. You have to get the poutines and customize them however you like. All of the Saus that I have ever tried are delicious! Get them all. 
8751 4 Excellent pizza, the basic cheese pizza is one of the best in the area!!! Always clean and friendly!!! Highly recommend!!!! 2 words you need to memorize...Garlic Knots. 
8752 4 Incredible Persian food cart. The koobideh is excellent! I've been waiting to find a great fast food Persian place, and I've finally found it. Trust me, you will love it... 
8753 3 Had their vegetarian combo, amazingly tasty. Really good for vegetarian people. the food is flavorful just like indian food. 
8754 4 Amazing amazing amazing! The desserts are out of this world. I had a cup of tea and a Le Russe. It was amazing. Got some macaroons to go and they were amazing as well. Highly recommend 
8755 4 Great home cooking especially if your from latin america... Hot sauce is perfect balance of heat and flavor... Great decor 
8756 3 This place is one of my favorites. Today the floors and tables felt a bit sticky. This place needs a thorough cleaning. The staff and food we're excellent and consistent. Bottomless fries always guaranty you're full. 
8757 4 Ordered two slices of pie for takeout. Queue was long since its was a pretty busy night. Manager gave them to me for free for waiting. Doesn't get better than that. Pie tasted good too. 
8758 4 Five stars for the Mac and cheese with the jalapeños, chicken, and pepper jack cheese. My boyfriend ordered it today and I gladly helped him eat it. The portion was huge, but we devoured it. I wish I had more! 
8759 1 Poor customer service. Soup was delivered in very chipped bowls. The food itself was pretty good but not anything notable. Portions were decent other than the egg rolls which were tiny. The price for the overall experience was a touch too much. 
8760 3 Good fresh sushi. Staff was nice. 
8761 4 This place was very good! Best steak tacos I've ever had! Highly recommend! Good service too. 
8762 4 My family and I had a fun experience on this tour! We tried a different variety of foods: seafood, Chinese-Mexican fusion, Vietnamese, BBQ and desert for last. Our tour guide, Jalil, had a great sense of humor. Ask him to sing for you! He'll do it for free. 
8763 3 Loved this accidental find. Freshly prepared with quality ingredients. The grilled flank steak is listed as an appetizer but served as a full lunch for me. Would definitely return 
8764 4 Wow!! Jose and Cecilia made our dining experience amazing!! They both had personality and great suggestions!! Our steaks were perfect!! Highly recommend!! 
8765 4 Blue Star Doughnuts has the best doughnut in Oregon called the Blueberry Bourbon Basil Glaze. Wow 
8766 4 I like this little bakery. They have great cakes and buns and I have never had anything from there that didn't taste fresh. The people there are really sweet. 
8767 3 Best coconut milk soup I've had. Hot, zesty, sweet and gingery. I ate the whole bowl without even noticing. I think I'll be stopping off the bus to pick up their soup on a regular basis. Good service and open, quiet atmosphere. Reasonable prices. 
8768 4 It's so good that the only negative thing about it is that you wish the burger was bigger. Definitely worth it and they are quite reasonable 
8769 4 Professional and quality service for a reasonable price which is so hard to find these days. Impeccable response time as well. Would use these guys again without a question. 
8770 4 Delicious Indian food and awesome ambience The restaurant is slightly pricier than other Indian restaurants in this area but the taste of food beats all others. I will definitely recommend this place for Chicken Biriyani , Chicken Tikka and Butter Naan. 
8771 0 Worst service I have ever had. We were never assigned a waiter. It was fairly busy and every server/busboy completely ignored us. Food was ok. They comped us desserts because of the terrible service, then put the desserts on the bill. Definitely avoid this place! 
8772 2 ok...so this is pretty good pizza. not greek...italiano 
8773 4 Love my hair! Constantly great service and fantastic downtown location... Clean environment and friendly staff 
8774 2 The quinoa burger is tasty and a great option for veggies in ATL. But the sweet potato fries are the real jam. It's a fun environment but can get crazy busy. I'd recommend going for lunch when you can really enjoy the food and aren't cramped among the crowd. 
8775 4 showed up on time for both the quote and the work, scheduling was quick and easy and they did a great job. 
8776 4 This place is not to be missed! My two girlfriends and I loved our massages. This is a first...we all loved the experience and thought our therapists were amazing. I will make sure to get time there every time I come to visit Portland. 
8777 2 Yeah. Unmmm. They'll get to your order when they get to your order. Don't expect to be in and out on this location. 
8778 4 Food is awesome. Generous portions and best value I've found near Austin for Ethiopian food. 
8779 3 Fast and friendly service. Delicious comfort food. Always consistent. Mmmm maple bacon. 
8780 4 GREAT!!! Wish the line wasn't so ridiculous though. =( 
8781 4 Awesome service and delicious Sushi... Will go back any day is great!!!! The Katana Roll is delicious !!!!! Recommend the Green Tea and dessert the Green Tea Tiramisu, fabulous food. 
8782 4 Simply awesome chicken sandie. I got a side of the spicy sauce to dip and it was the right choice. nummy!! 
8783 4 Out for a walk and so glad to welcome a sushi place back to our 'hood -- and what a great find!! Yummy food -- attentive service and good prices (get a ton)! We loved the "angry chicken". Thanks! 
8784 2 I don't have a ton to say about Wang's. It gets a third star for the pricing. It's cheap. The food fits right into the generic fast Asian food mold. I haven't found anything on the menu special, but everything I've had has been ok. 
8785 0 I have been to several nail salons around the country , but I've never been to one where my fingernail bled for 10 minutes and turned black. The manicurist suggested I get a dark red to cover up the cut and bruising, and I was still charged for the manicure. 
8786 3 Love South of the Border foods. Gave Casa del Pollo a try since they are close to Marriott's Courtyard. Homestyle Costa Rican food was delicious. The chicken tacos were a hit. The burrito's large. Give them a try. Yummy! 
8787 3 Bought 4 small dessert cakes /slices , some sandwiches and some madeleines for a bday picnic. Every cake was a hit! Especially the lemon. The Madeline was a bit dry but the sandwiches were great. Would definitely return for the cakes and sandwiches. Worth the calories and the price. 
8788 3 Thanks "One Love Jerk Grill"-Mobile Kitchen! Thanks for serving our area at the "Resurgens Plaza" off East Paces Ferry Road near Lenox Mall. I ordered the Veggie Plate which includes Rice and beans, Veggies and Plantains. It was delicious! Mary M. 
8789 4 I've been coming here for 7 years. The ladies do a great job. Don't be rude if they are running late. They do their best to fit you in, and they don't rush the job. Make an appointment, because they are busy all of the time. 
8790 4 Stanley recently did a Keratin treatment in my hair, and was,as always, fantastic! He is great to chat with, and makes me feel so comfortable. My hair is so soft and shiny as well! Definitely visit Stanley at Toscana! He will hook your hair up! 
8791 4 Truly love this place. The interior design is aesthetically beautiful: Huge space and wooden motifs. I love the sausage egg and cheese bagel. My partner loves the Deagan or the Denver. Best and fast place to go for a quick breakfast! 
8792 4 This is a great little spot! I love their chicken, the beans and slaw are awesome too. Service is always friendly and fast. My wife and I always get a 3 piece dark, a 3 piece white and fried pickles! Oh, their fried pickles are a must! 
8793 0 Just wonder how they even stay in business. Have tried to call several times, left messages, and have still never spoken to anyone with a couple of questions I had. If they don't even answer the phone, I don't think they could be a very legitimate business. 
8794 4 I had the tavern burger and it was great. The environment was friendly and the service was great, all that you could ask for when going for dinner. 
8795 4 Chef Claire is hands down the best caterer in the city. We use her for both work and personal events and consistently receive compliments on the food (which we always attribute to Claire of course!). Order from here - you will not be disappointed. 
8796 4 So glad we found these folks- Really great plants at a fanatastic price Very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. The east side is lucky to have these folks and their neighbors Tillery Plant company 
8797 3 After eating at the anderson lane location several times times, I retract my previous 3 star rating and remarks. The shroom burger is heavenly and their queso is quite tasty as well! Plus, gotta love a place that serves their beer in Big O's! shakes are pretty dang good too. 
8798 0 Horrible. The General Gau's chicken was fried fat and skin. The crab rangoon was all cream cheese, no crab. And all of it was over priced. Cost us $70 to feed 4 people and none of it was good. 
8799 4 John was very pleasant and helpful and was able to replace my dead alternator within hour of me bringing in my car. Thank!! 
8800 4 Great service, authentic Italian food and gorgeous atmosphere. I highly recommend this place for a romantic dinner. It is a hidden gem in a not so beautiful part of Austin but close to main attractions such as arboretum and the domain. 
8801 4 Get the spicy curry catfish and pad kee mao, both so incredibly flavorful! Service is always really friendly! Love this place! 
8802 0 I just want to let everyone know that I was completely correct in that no one from Lucky Strike had contacted me to apologize for our terrible experience. We will not be visiting them again and will ensure that we let anyone know who asks how terrible their service is. 
8803 3 Like - def. better then the old Shabusen. better service, better food choices. love their bbq beef and shortrib. add $1.99 for all u can drink soda. Dislike - bbq chicken taste bitter somehow... hamachi sushi was not fresh. 
8804 4 Super great menu and cocktails ... feels like a Cuban cocktail club inside ... plantains & salads are my fav of their many excellent dishes & the Caipirinhas are perfect! Great patio & easy parking. 
8805 4 Very kind and chill people work here! They just put you in a good mood, no matter what. :) Also, students get a discount! 
8806 4 So glad we came across this gem in Austin! Great bartenders that pick awesome selections of drinks you may prefer especially if you're just passing through. Amazing barbecue from Stubbs as well which went fantastically with the beer Will be back most definitely! 
8807 4 I got my wax done here, they are really quick and very professional. 
8808 4 The pizza slices are HUGE and awesome. Great greasy, cheesy NY pizza. The calzone I ordered once was so big I ate it for two meals and it was full of toppings and came with extra sauce. Love this place. 
8809 4 Very possibly the best brunch I have had in Portland. The food, staff and overall interior design was exceptional. I'll be recommending Lechon to friends and coworkers, and we made a reservation for a business party the following week before we left. 
8810 3 In the Shingle Creek Resort. I ordered the three tacos and they where rather good! Being from New Mexico, they stacked up minus the green chile. The large margarita was huge and I would suggest something more gourmet rather than the plain house Rita. 
8811 4 Fantastic Argentinian food and easy to eat gluten free. Picada tapa of cured meats and cheeses, beef tenderloin with amazing chimichurri, asparagus and papas cremosas (scalloped potatoes), red wine and flourless chocolate torte. All fabulous and wonderfully friendly staff too. Great ambiance and on a fun part of 6th street. 
8812 2 I like the restaurant. I Enjoy the potstickers and they keep me coming back. The menu is large and all the BBQ meats are good. 
8813 4 Great service. My pedicure was so relaxing and my nails look great. They take time and pay attention to detail. 
8814 4 Excellent customer service! I am very pleased. They are much better than their competitors Quick turn around! I have co-signed several items and will continue. Andrea and Eric are great! 
8815 4 I loved renting from the Orlando Sixt team and will never go anywhere else. The staff members were professional, helpful and the facilities looked more like an upscale night club than a rental car office. A+ Orlando Sixt! 
8816 4 We love the house barrel wine. Food is yummy too. The wait staff is great also. They changed how they cooked some of our favorite items and it isn't the same. Hate when restaurant change how they make something and it turns out not for the better. 
8817 3 Great food. Reasonable price. A bit crowded and no parking. Love the selection of salads and stews! 
8818 4 What more could I want from a neighborhood restaurant. The chicken parm is off the hook. I'm not even high yet. Can't believe the service. Jesse the bartender is what will make me come back here. Thank you for the great experience and you now have another regular. 
8819 2 Winter Garden chili's has the same menu. Service and food are pretty standard. Affordable decent food for lunch or dinner. 
8820 3 Excellent food. Nachos, taco salad, enchiladas suizas, tacos, and just about everything else I've tried have been awesome. Decent bottled beer selection. Interior is nice, but we usually do take-out. 
8821 4 Great diversity in dish choice and each has a distinctive flavor. Incredible happy hour, theme dinners and best of all, owner and staff care. 
8822 0 They have really slipped ... service was poor , food was blah ... what happened ???? Red robin was a fun place to go .... 
8823 4 Was thrilled when this place finally opened. I've been several times and have always had amazing service, drinks, + food. I've also taken non vegetarians here who were impressed with the food too. Love the creative menu, great for brunch or dinner! 
8824 4 Great quick service! Waiter Matt is amazing and gave exceptional service! Will come again. 
8825 4 Tucked away below the street and full of great food and people. Would definitely return here. 
8826 4 Great food!!! Price reasonable considering the great food. I felt like i was in Brasil...those black beans...yum! 
8827 4 Was out on business last week. Great Atmosphere and outstanding food. If you have the room, get the buffet!! Good night! 
8828 4 Thesmoothiesthesmoothiesohmysweetmarymotherofgodthesmoothies. This place is just a mouthful of happy. It doesn't matter what you get, cuz it's all good. Just order, give money, take food, sit down and PUT IT IN YOUR MOUF. Oh, and did I mention the smoothies? Try the smoothies. 
8829 4 Great banh mi and crispy rolls. I've come two times and both have been good experiences. It's clean and has a nice, calm atmosphere. The staff is friendly too 
8830 3 Great food for a great price. The vegetables are always cooked to perfection and the service is always nice. Recommend if you are on a budget and want some good veggies. 
8831 4 Nice laid back atmosphere with tons of great beers and plenty of tables. Big city is a mixed crowd with a definite college following and can be really busy on Friday and Saturday nights. 
8832 4 Fresh food and good service! It's a great place for lunch. They also have outdoor seating. 
8833 0 Deplorable... absolutely disgusting conditions. The restrooms in foreign countries are cleaner than this one on 185th in Hillsboro. And to think that the staff use these same facilities... than go back to serving food. 
8834 4 First time here and the staff was friendly, Joe was very helpful explaining the menu and did an awesome job preparing my pizza. New favorite place 
8835 4 Excellent actor work. Beautiful costumes. Entertaining and educational. Definitely recommend. 
8836 4 I love the Palm Springs vibe. Great spot to stop in for a drink or enjoy a nice day...Cool drink menu and excellent bartenders! 
8837 3 I had an excellent dinner of Shrimp and Scallops finished things off with an excellent creme brûlée. The shrimp and scallops were to die for - perfectly seared. The scallops were buttery, melt in your mouth goodness. Yummy deluxe. 
8838 2 Just don't look around or up or elsewhere....but food is good fer sher! Fire Marshall must eat free here....no proper egress for emergencies and not disability friendly. 
8839 3 Bring an appetite, Leave with a box and a smile!!!! Chicken and waffles. Yummy. Huevos Rancheros tasty. Busy but friendly service. Happy place. Highly recommend. 
8840 4 Always a pleasure to work with AG Boston, friendly service and always deliver. 
8841 2 For a place called Hong Kong, this place is pretty American. Otherwise, the stars are for the scorpion bowl-sweetness. Everything else is just dirty and grungy. =/ 
8842 4 Everyone who works here is super nice and friendly. They always get me in for nails over lunch. They do high quality work with high quality supplies. Wouldn't go anywhere else for nails. 
8843 4 Very nice people all round. Great in sales and design and the installation guy was spot on. Good price and a great finish. Awesome company to work with. 
8844 4 Hands down unbelievable food. I ordered linguini with clams in a red sauce. It was a huge portion and I was super satisfied. :) 
8845 4 Great place and even better service. A big group of us went in last weekend and both servers were impeccable, absolute perfection. Good food and the music of course was wonderful...Thanks for a pleasant experience! 
8846 4 Sometimes you need to feel like you're not a trash person and this is the place to do just that. You can bring your computer, eat a salad, and sip on some matcha. Your life will seem at least 10% healthier than whatever you're doing currently. 
8847 3 I saw this vegetarian food truck at SoWa and decided to give it a go. The vegetarian sausage in the fire wrap was surprisingly flavorful and the seasoned fries were crispy, garlicy, and salty. I consider myself an avid meat eater but I'll definitely be coming back. 
8848 3 I second the review that mentioned authenticity. I wish I had somewhere this cozy in Lair Hill. Crossing the street can be a bit tricky as mentioned but the latte, the ambiance, and the service was refreshing. 
8849 0 Not great customer service in their service department. They probably get away with it due to being the only Honda inside the perimeter. I'll be going to Carey Paul (AWESOME service) or Gwinnett Place Honda from now on. 
8850 4 Very good customer service. Robin and Mike took care of an order of mine for curtains that I ordered in store snd had shipped to me. They were very helpful and patient. The staff there was also very nice when checking out. 
8851 1 Would not recommend the clam chowder unless you like big pieces of potato with the skin on. The seafood pie was heavy on crackers and light on seafood drinks were good service was good location is excellent 
8852 4 Bodywaves is a great. I've seen both Franklin and Caitlin and they are both fantastic. They are able to work all the kinks out leaving me feel amazing when leaving. Added bonus is they will validate parking for the nearby garage. Highly recommended! 
8853 0 Do not stay here! Construction everywhere, they gave me a room that was already occupied, very embarrassing. 6am jack hammers and people outside working. Gym is not functional. Even if there was no construction the walls are paper thin, I can hear every move the people next to me make. 
8854 4 Best espresso ever.!! Love to spend time drinking coffee and enjoying some ice-cream It could be slow sometimes but it's totally worth it/ 
8855 4 I've been going to Laura on a monthly basis since my initial review--I've even got my girlfriend, my sister, her roommate, and my roommate going to see her at M&McQ! 
8856 4 Pulled pork on fries with spicy aoli and parsley truffle salt. Can't go wrong!!!! Service is friendly. Lance will take care of you. Patio is open and on a breezy night with a PBR it's magic! Wash away a crappy day with a cold one and a Sellwood Slider!!! 
8857 4 This place was really good and the staff was super kind. We happened to go on Super Bowl so I scored a burger for 1/2 price but more than made up for it with the cheese/meat tray. 
8858 4 The Waypost is your standard NE Portland hipster hangout. Prices are great on sandwiches and pastries. Beer and wine is served along with coffee and tea. There is a very relaxed atmosphere and you could easily hang out all day. Free WiFi is available. 
8859 3 Food seemed to be pretty good, homemade which is nice. Inside is a little old fashioned. 
8860 4 THE PIE, THE PIE!!!! OMG! GO GET SOME! really adorable space on Alberta st, and love the baked goods! 
8861 4 Wow! Really good! Best gravy. Claudia best waitress! Unbelievable specials! Wine selection was awesome with excellent recommendations. So happy to have a place this good in Polaris area! It's our best find since JGilberts 20 years ago. 
8862 4 Great local establishment. Live bringing the kids to get ice cream, floats and sherbet. Staff are genuinely nice 
8863 4 Incredibly good food, and incredibly good service. We catered from here for a wedding celebration, and Christina and her staff exceeded our expectations. I would highly recommend Me So Hungry for catered events. 
8864 0 Poor service, attended a rock concert past Sunday. The clientele has totally changed. It seemed to go downhill where all the thugs hang out. Employees looked demoralized and most of them could not speak English. Tanks where the dolphins and orcas looked dilapidated. Don't think I will ever go back. 
8865 4 I get my alterations done here and I wouldn't go anywhere else. Tom is the very best and he understands how a piece of clothing should fit. I trust his work so much! I think it's very reasonably priced. 
8866 4 Great hot food when it come out. Need I say. Hospitality was great. Made me feel at home. 
8867 3 I just moved to Columbus from SoCal, & I enjoyed seeing the animals hang out with us. I would of have given 5 stars , but our waitress was really slow 
8868 3 Although we had to wait 40min to get a table it was all worth it. The oysters where a great appy. The buttermilk chicken and the kale salad a nice addition and the vanilla pie finished a great dinner. Cool place, go and eat! 
8869 4 Matcha moon is really good, not grainy like Starbucks- and breakfast tacos r always a hit. Migas is what I got 
8870 3 Stopped in based on Yelp reviews & the Cubano & home made chips were as good as others said!!! 
8871 4 I love the hot dogs and the deep dish pizza here. I highly recommend Stopping I. And trying this place. 
8872 4 They have a giant bear that gives you awkward shoulder rubs while you eat some of the most delicious chorizo. Only in Portland! 
8873 4 I'd give five stars for its hot pot! Definitely the best Chinese hot pot in the Boston area. If you miss real Chinese hot pot, go to KOi. The spicy base and tomato base combination is my fav. Don't miss this!! 
8874 4 A very pleased first timer! The chicken schnitzel was amazing, onion rings on point, German Mac was good. They have a wide selection of beers and the service was great! Glad I came! 
8875 3 Great place for hearty breakfast. Huge pancakes and everything is big. If you are counting carbs or calories stay away. Closes at 1 but the website says 2 so that should be clarified. We've watched too many people get turned around. But definitely great place for breakfast in Metrowest 
8876 4 if i could move into this place, i would. the atrium is absolutely amazing. plus, i could gaze at john singer sargent's "el jaleo" as long as i pleased. simply delightful. 
8877 4 Ok so I had to come back and shower This spot with more praises ... The food gets better every time I come back...if that's even possible Their Singapore noodle is fabulous I haven't had a dish here I didn't like... My advice is come hungry 
8878 4 Bought my Roland JDXi from here with a two year warranty that I ended up having to cash instaff is friendly and knowledgeable. I always leave with more new information about gear. Thank you, Guitar Center! 
8879 4 I love this business--just like back in the day. Local, friendly, and down to earth. They repair for reasonable prices, and it's just great to have a reliable appliance company in the neighborhood! 
8880 0 We were seated in 10 minutes. Then no one took our order no one even asked us what we wanted to drink and they aren't even that busy. TERRIBLE SERVICE! 
8881 4 I have been going to Nadya for a couple months now. She has given me the best massages i have ever had. Definitely would recommend her! 
8882 3 First time customer. One of the BEST roast beef sandwiches I've had! The roast beef melts in your mouth. 
8883 0 This is probably the worst Mexican I've ever had. I came with 2 other people and they both said the same. The chicken was watery and had a weird texture to it and the overall taste of the food was not that great.. 
8884 4 Love the bourbon barrel aged stout on nitro 
8885 4 Great staff! Awesome selection! Snagged a couple of garage comps that I would normally buy via mail order, but they had them and more!!! 
8886 4 Went there for lunch and got the bulgolgi bento. It was cheap, filling, and super delicious. The bento came out pretty fast so i was in and out in a timely manner. Which is what bentos are all about. Will definitely be back. 
8887 4 Nicely run golf course that was fun even when they were busy today. Luckily we were ahead of a foursome and had nobody behind or in front of us today. The putting greens were very challenging and fooled us many times today. Love this well maintained and classy golf course. 
8888 4 Overall, great place! We did a walk in and they were very accomadating and kind. They also have great pricing! 
8889 3 Brisket is great, a little pricey, but really good. Try a brisket quesadilla! Owner is really nice and friendly. Great place to stop for something quick. 
8890 4 Fantastic food. Great ambience. They even upped the service as it was a special occassion for us. We will be back when we get a sitter sometime in the next year! :) 
8891 3 Yum! Tasty food. Fresh ingredients and a really nice staff. I will definitely return for some more bulgolgi beef (sorry if I butchered the spelling!) 
8892 4 Very helpful & knowledgeable, they have a huge & unique selection, that you don't see in box stores. 
8893 3 Great for dim sum anytime! Try the house noodles hong kong style. They are the best! 
8894 3 YUM. Everything I ate here was delicious, and the service was great, even when they were pretty busy. Good Margaritas, and of course great tacos. Their shrimp taco was my favorite. Will definitely be going back soon. 
8895 4 I love this place. It is sooooo delicious and the staff is amazing- sooo sweet and welcoming. I love how much they advertise veganism :) I have taken omni friends here before and they loved it as well! 
8896 1 Shit. Trains are delayed unapologetically. NEVER on time. How can both directions be broken you ask? Well there is no way to know. Hope they fix it before it spreads cause it's been shit for years now 
8897 3 Food is good but pricy when compared to the other bangladeshi place on mass ave (Darul kebab). 
8898 0 Why are there so many damn flies? Can anyone see this? Nobody seems to care. It's disgusting. Drinks are fine but who knows how many flies have walked all over the food and drinks. I've even seen bees inside. Even sitting outside you have flies on you. Just horrible. 
8899 4 I'm reluctant to write this because I'm afraid that my new favorite hangout will get too crowded. Great vibe, friendly service and a poster of Syd Barrett. 
8900 4 Love it! Get your tire changed & listen to great music. Just sad to think that it will be eventually be a victim of the californiacation of Austin. Sigh. 
8901 4 Had a great time at Hopdoddy. Great great burger, yummy fries great service!!!! Worth the wait!!!! 
8902 4 Great customer service and very knowledgeable about parts and auto paint. Always willing to go the extra mile. 
8903 4 This place has THE BEST mango fried rice I've ever encountered. I recently moved out of town, and this is pretty much the thing that I miss most. 
8904 2 I'm not a huge fan of this place but it does have charm. Definitely different than most pho places. It feels authentic because it's run by Buddhist nuns who speak little English. 
8905 0 They charge for water cup. Stale doughnut. Sassy attitude. I don't normally take my time to write reviews but this was exceptionally bad. 
8906 4 Wish I could come here more often! It is consistently great - both service and food. One restaurant where you can't go wrong! I would definitely recommend eating here! Be sure to make a reservation, even week nights are busy. 
8907 4 Wicked awesome tour with Jack F.!!!! Strongly recommended!!!! Go luck to Jack F. for the new football session!!! 
8908 2 For the price it is amazing ! Service was great but the salad bar and side table was lacking. Not as clean as I would have thought for the area- could keep better maintenance on the salad bar and side table. 
8909 0 Horrible service and not so good food. I was really looking forward to this restaurant and all my excitement was shot down as soon as we walked in the restaurant and had our first interaction with the staff. 
8910 2 Selection is hit or miss-- but I expect this from this type of store. Can be expensive. Definitely worth stopping in! 
8911 4 Best Cuban food I've tried in Boston; can't wait to repeat!! I went for brunch but the lunch/dinner menu looked great as well. Service was excelente :) 
8912 4 Simply amazing. Best chicken sandwich I have ever had. The fries and ranch are a perfect pair and equally delicious. Very rich flavors and will fill you up. Got my food pretty quick. Great atmosphere. Clean and organized. Well worth the price. 
8913 4 We came here for brunch and the service and food was exceptional. We had ceviche and steak n eggs. Both were amazing. 
8914 4 Absolutely fabulous scallops, and staff! Incredible mouse w health/salt and bignets! Too die- my friend had a delicious fish and we split a bottle of wine! 
8915 3 Good live music on the weekend, fit for older couples or tourists... but a nice evening once and a while for locals 
8916 1 Unimpressive. The pub was empty and service was as slow (as a turtle). t Vancouver has wayyyyy too many awesome places (Guilt and Co) for me to go back to this place. If you are walking down the street, keep walking my friend. 
8917 4 Best brunch I've ever had. The Liege Style Waffle with white chocolate pistachio rosewood syrup was amazing. Get this for sure! Les Boulettes was the right amount of spicey and very filling. The staff was on point and helpful. 
8918 4 Really clean place and you certainly get what you pay for ! I have gotten my nails done and 2 pedicures. So far and they have been amazing every time ! I never make an appointment but they can always accommodate me ! Love it here. 
8919 4 This place makes some of the best Chinese food in Boston. They have a wide selection of food to choose from and not too expensive either. My favorite is their boneless ribs, shrimp fried rice and orange beef. 
8920 4 Absolutely incredible. My first chiropractor experience for a tough crick in my neck. Two visits and back to normal! Dr. Marc was very kind! 
8921 4 Loved this place - best culinary and service experience during our Boston trip. Amazingly courteous waiting staff made our visit even sweeter. Do try their TomYum Pad Thai, Kimchi Fried Rice, Pad Thai and the fried Ice Cream. Thank you! 
8922 4 Fantastic place. ...people r so nice. ..very relaxing. ..best nail place I have been to. Give them a try n u will come back again 
8923 3 What's not to love? I'm vegan and I have no problem whatsoever finding delicious foods to eat. I also love the atmosphere -- very romantic, in my opinion (but I tend to bring girlfriends here most of the time). 
8924 4 So I'm went for the 1st time in June Amazing Food server was not to friendly but the Tator Tots melt in your mouth the burger amazing U even had there brew it was good I'm recommend this place it was worth the drive yummy 
8925 4 Pizza Colore is definitely one of my favorite pizza Places in Boulder. The service is good and really fast. It's a great place to get food and eat outside or continue wandering around Pearl. 
8926 4 Fantastic flavors. Crazy busy lunch, so recommend getting there early ...11:20....or late...after 1. Free salad bar, spring rolls, soups and more. Green curry and Thai Rice rock. 
8927 3 Favorite aspect of this restaurant is that you can sit outside in the heart of Fanueil Hall. They are connected/affiliated/the same place as Ned Divines. The salads are good and oversized. 
8928 3 Great atmosphere and the food was really good. Small portions though. The whole tabled ended up ordering more food. Would come back though. The live band is fantastic touch. 
8929 3 Love this place. Love how it's basically a highly controlled and limited buffet that the owners have spun into some kind maternal we-cook-it-you-eat-it-no-ordering-necessary dining experience. Love the samosas and the tea. Love the proprietors well-meaning but often unfunny and occasionally uncomfortable jesting. 
8930 4 Great food at a great price! Make sure you try the meatballs, Pizza and Chicken Piccata! Been coming for years and have never had a bad meal or bad time. The "place" to bring family and friends for New York style pizza in the Orlando area. 
8931 4 Been breakfast tacos since as long as I could eat whole food. Everything is compared to this and nothing compares. I honestly have never had anything other than a breakfast taco. No-tang is sacred but this is so sacred to me. I love you, Ken's Tacos, in real life. 
8932 3 Great little spot to grab lunch near the Arena District. Sesame chicken was excellent and the hot and sour soup was very tasty. Potstickers were slightly over cooked, but the pork filing had good flavor. Overall, a great find to satisfy your crave for Asian cuisine! 
8933 3 Can't really say anything negative about a place that serves burgers with donuts as buns. Can't wait to take advantage of trivia night on Monday's. The donuts melt in your mouth you forget you are eating cake. Great for a dinner out or random desert craving. 
8934 4 Great authentic mexican food. Their carne guisada is delicious and they also serve breakfast all day on the weekend. Try the porkchop with huevos rancheros. Food is good and cheap. Staff is very friendly. It's a family owned business and you can tell they sincerly care about their customers. 
8935 4 Quality local ingredients from inner city farms & local suppliers. 100% compostable packaging. The food is fresh and very filling! Vegan / 100% gluten free. I hope they succeed - all the best! 
8936 4 So good! Get the oyster tacos and port tamales! 
8937 2 Got a burger with goat cheese and it was amazing if not a little sloppy. I couldn't finish it and unfortunately was unable to save it because it was doomed to be soggy in an hour. 
8938 3 Great wine selection! The staff is knowledgeable and friendly when looking for a recommendation. 
8939 3 Great ambience during the Canada vs USA Olympics Hockey Semi-Final game! Their portions are very large too and very filling. I had the Chicken, Walnut, blue cheese salad and that was very tasty. I would def recommend this place as a great get together with friends for a sports event 
8940 4 Came here to get a pedicure with a friend. The people working here were extremely nice and the massage was amazing. Super affordable , $26 when paying cash. My nails were painted very nicely. I will definitely come here again. 
8941 2 The service was great and the coffee drinks amazing. The food was just alright. Don't go hungry, but do go if you want a quaint place to read the paper and drink some good coffee. 
8942 4 We had veggie bagel and fruit waffle. I have never had a better waffle and the bagel was also excellent. The lady behind the counter was kind and parking was off street super easy. View of the top of Hollywood Theatre sign from front window. 
8943 4 Fast service, they know your name and if not ask for it! Super cute crew and peppy!!!! Clean atmosphere comfortable furniture and great snacks 
8944 4 Eat here!!! You will not be disappointed!! Kung pap is excellent (not fried) Pho is freakin amazing!! Noodles always perfect Staff is wonderful, always on point and friendly! 
8945 2 I personally didn't like much The hamburgers regular sweet potatoes is not that great so to me didn't worth going 
8946 4 The customer service at Ghion Cultural hall is amazing. The atmosphere & food were equally amazing. I will be back. 
8947 4 Great customer service !!! Awesome & Friendly staff, they were really helpful giving us samples. the best ice cream. 
8948 3 Very friendly staff, easy check in, affordable, and clean. The location is convenient. Yes, the decor is dated. The breakfast was standard. My family and I will return. 
8949 3 Had a long wait for a table. But can't be avoided on a weekend and the staff were terrific and made it up to us in sides! Burgers were tasty, sides were good, Jens chicken sandwich was awesome. 
8950 3 We took the family to Boston for Easter Sunday. This was a great hotel for us and the kids. 
8951 4 Place was great, staff was friendly, and most importantly the food was amazing and well priced! I definitely recommend the Caesar salad. I would recommend Locale to anyone! 
8952 1 You know what you're getting when you visit Kilwins because it's the same in every location in every state. So, they are consistently okay when it comes to their offerings of ice cream and fudge. 
8953 4 Christina pierced my Tragus! She was awesome. She walked me through what she was doing and before I knew it she was done! Great experience! A little pricey but worth it! 
8954 4 This is as close to dining in Italy as you'll find in New England. Chef Paolo is bringing exquisite, authentic Genovese cuisine to the North Shore. If you're looking for fine dining in a fun, casual atmosphere run, don't walk to Prides Osteria in Beverly. 
8955 0 This used to be a nice hookah lounge. However, I recently went and it was super GHETTO! The service was terrible also. I won't be back! 
8956 2 WAX focuses on natural beauty treatments and is environmentally friendly. The aestheticians and staff were knowledgable. 
8957 0 RIPOFF! Paid over $10 for a bowl to go that was only 16oz and even though I paid for extra chicken it hardly had any. It was 90% spinach which costs next to nothing. NEVER AGAIN! 
8958 4 Update: I said yes to my dress here! I absolutely love my dress and can't wait to come back for my fittings! 
8959 1 I just dont care for pizza but my bf loves theirs so I guess its good since he ate 3/4 of the napolitian in one sitting. I liked the antipasto plate of different grilled veggies and stuffed face with their awesome dinner rolls. 
8960 3 Love this place! The Warm Goat Cheese salad is a must! Although it is a bit pricey, the portions are a very good size. On Wednesdays it's $3 beer nights! 
8961 4 I really like the free pancake using the yelp check-in. The food here is wonderful. Good portion of food for the amount that I paid. Definitely come back often. The customer service is great too. 
8962 4 Great coffee, pour-over and cold brew, and great espresso with perfectly frothed milk or soy milk. The Little Tart pastries are outstanding and we know from pastries. Cool staff, very friendly, and a nice clean open feeling in the room. 
8963 3 Two thumbs up. I honestly think its the best Thai restaurant in Austin. If there is one that beats this place, let me know. 
8964 3 It is quick as their name suggests express. We gave order and the food was out in sec. Sushi and entree were good. Friendly people and quick service. 
8965 4 Quick service, and the shop next door is nice to sit in. It's an oil change, not much more you can ask for. 
8966 3 We grabbed a quick breakfast upon our arrival from Logan... Real quick service. Can't front. For a quick breakfast, It's a great option + open 24 hours. 
8967 0 Terrible terrible terrible food and service!!! This is my most terrible restaurant experience in this area. I have no idea how they got four star on Yelp. This leads me to doubt the credit of Yelp. 
8968 3 Everything was going good until a roach crawled on me :( but overall nice cool place 
8969 3 I had a breakfast skillet- so good. Everything on the breakfast menu sounded great! The service was wonderful and the prices reasonable! I'd recommend coming here! 
8970 4 Always loved Donbas Donuts. Great people, great food and fast service....what more can you ask for? 
8971 4 Didn't stay here, but attended classes for my conference here. Astonishingly beautiful. Had an amazing breakfast catered at one my meetings. People who stayed here raved about the rooms. 
8972 1 The food is really just one-star-worthy. The reason I give it two stars is that the waiter was really friendly, and price is good....... Won't go/order again... 
8973 4 Best 1/2# burger. Very friendly. Excellent prices. Memorabilia nice but too much money. Very clean place. I would definitely recommend it. We are from the Temecula area of .CA. 
8974 4 Probably one of the last real diverse community centers in our city. Nicely kept and clean, great people and low priced 
8975 4 This place was exactly what a group of five looking to have a fun week in Orlando. Right on iDrive close to everything fun in Orlando. And if your looking for great drinks, The bartender named zero makes a strong margarita on Tuesday's three dollar margarita night. 
8976 4 They are the most affordable and great clinic that I have been in Austin. The Veterinary Doctor is amazing. The only negative is that they are extremely busy and there is a long wait to get the appt. Keep doing what you doing. 
8977 4 The whole staff never fail to impress me, they are always helpful, friendly, enthusiastic & Knowledgeable. 
8978 3 Stopped while we were passing through Salem. We had the forest mushroom and the soppressata. The pizzas were delicious. I recommend sitting at the bar if seats are available. 
8979 1 Love Joes Crab Shack, but have to say the company has been sold to many tines in the past few years. Good items dropped from the menu. Went last night and my steam pot came to me cold. How does that happen. Pretty expensive food for it to be cold. 
8980 4 Came here for lunch around 2pm and was greeted by friendly staff. I quickly received my drink and followed up by ordering their pho special. Really good! Definitely will be coming back. 
8981 3 Second time coming here while in Austin, the wait is always extremely long but both times it's been worth it if you have the time. I had the migas the first time and second time the crab cake Benedict. Super yummy. I'd recommend a Bloody Mary aswell 
8982 3 I stayed here for 3 days last week. I really liked this hotel. Very large rooms with microwave, and fridge. HUGE bathroom, of of the largest I've ever seen. Staff is super friendly. Really nice gym and pool. I would love to stay here again. 
8983 4 Love this location! Great food, wonderful vibe, easy to get to! They were great at accommodating my allergies and the manager checked everything with me. It's nice to have a safe place to eat. 
8984 3 Try the buta (pork) kimchee rice burger Back for more Okinawan Taco rice Visa, MC, debit cards accepted. Still rated high on my list for things quaint, cafe's al la Japonais! written by iphone 
8985 4 We just had a wonderful dinner here tonight. The atmosphere is great and the food is terrific. We had plenty to take for leftovers. The staff was attentive. Wish we weren't from out of town and had more time to come again. 
8986 3 I just moved to Dunwoody and this place was very lucky indeed. It is so delicious and generous portions make me a big fan. I love the sweet and sour chicken and can't get enough Kung powwww!! 
8987 3 Really, really tasty hot chocolate that was oh so creamy. On a fairly cold day, this was a good stop along the way on my way through Nob Hill. Short and sweet. Enjoy! 
8988 3 Nice upbeat place. A welcomed change in the area. The crepes are tasty and freshly made in front of you. It may seem pricey, but the crepes are extra large and full of goodies! Recommend! 
8989 3 Great addition to the area. Excellent flavors and huge portions. Thoroughly enjoy the Combo platter. And you need to get extra hot sauce. Good stuff. 
8990 4 A must see when walking around First Thursday, Motel continually offers interesting art in their rotating gallery. Even better is store, which shares space in the gallery, and offers art, jewelry, trinkets, wallets, journals, etcetera created by local artists and other arists from across the country. 
8991 2 The food was ok. Just like average Boston seafood restaurant. The oysters were mediocre. But, the roasted Maine lobster was delicious. If you come here, I def recommend the roasted lobster as a main dish. Service was mediocre. Nothing special. 
8992 4 Cinnabon, like Paris, is always a good idea. The counter service is fast. Its best to enjoy your food in the food-court and not have it irradiated by the TSA if you're thinning of carrying your cinnabon aboard your flight. 
8993 3 The heating has been fixed AND there's a featured comedy night. Little Vegas in little Vancouver indeed. 
8994 2 Sushi was good, volcano roll was great and so was the sweet and sour soup. The waitress was not so great and I think it's a bit overpriced for what you get. 
8995 3 Favorite non-IMAX theater 
8996 2 Great house tequila shots, but overall this was an extremely noisy experience. Music was absolutely blasting by the bar and I couldn't hear myself think. 
8997 0 Staff is not bad, the nurses are the worst they aren't very educated in pain management. 
8998 4 Mcmenamins is our favorite northwest destination. We bought a passport and are going to try to visit all of them. around 59 locations, and if you visit them all, you get several nights free. They never disappoint. Seriously, all their places are awesome. 
8999 4 I have gotten my iced coffee here almost daily since moving to the area three years ago. Always consistent in good service and freshness. Definitely couldn't live without this place I love Tim Hortons!! 
9000 3 Sweet filling delicious breakfast place. The taters were quite good and my omelete/scramble whatever it was had lots of goodies on it. Hot, strong coffee accompanied and all for a reasonable price. I haven't tried the scotch eggs yet, but everyone is raving about them. Word. 
9001 2 Sea World is fun but too expensive. Parking. $15 Stroller rental. $19 Popcorn (2), hot dogs (2), colas (3), snacks (2) is $37 Carnival game $5 On the bright side, iris not as crowded as Disney. 
9002 4 Oh wow I just tried their maple chicken sumpin' sumpin' sausage at the Hollywood Farmer's Market and it was genius! 
9003 0 When you are charging $16 for an entree and $3 for a naan...make sure to deliver a quality product. Crap entree with old pieces of chicken reheated...tikka masala tasted like some spices cooked in a lot of cream. Wouldn't recommend at all! 
9004 0 you will get sock water instead of coffee here!!! worst coffee I have ever had. 
9005 4 Best breakfast tacos for the price and fast. Only 1.94 for my favorite egg, potato, onion, & chorizo breakfast taco for lunch. 
9006 1 I had an urge for flame broiler. Got there on a Thursday at 7:20pm and they were closing shop. They advertise closing at 8. There's clearly no management , the employees just wanted to get out of work. 
9007 4 The new sister restaurant of my local favorite Washington Square Tavern. This place gets one star over Washington Square because you can eat outside. Again a great choice for 30-somethings hoping to avoid the college crowd. 
9008 3 Tastes good, they have a good bogo deal but otherwise is kind of pricey. Definitely worth it for the deal. 
9009 3 Great steak. Really enjoyed the meal and the evening. Very top cut steak and service comparable with high-end steakhouses. Quaint location. 
9010 4 This place has the most creative and yummy tacos! The location in Dallas Ive been to many times, the location down here much nicer. Can sit on the bench and enjoy the weather and eat tacos :) 
9011 4 It was my husband and I's first visit since the new name. We loved the former restaurants so we had high hopes for this one. Thankfully it did not disappoint! The tacos were great and the special tempura fried lobster and crab stuffed potato skins were amazing!! 
9012 3 Great food. Service needs some attention. Lots of bartenders, but not very attentive. Nice atmosphere. 
9013 4 Delicious. The fried cat fish melts like butter in your mouth. We wanted fried oysters but they ran out. 
9014 0 Worst Hawaiian food ever! I ordered their Moco Loco. The rice wasn't fully cooked and my hamburger patty was tough. 30 minutes after eating it, I was rushing to the bathroom nauseas with cramps. It looks like other reviewers had issues with their beef, so watch out!! 
9015 4 So being that I am new to this type of recreational activity I must say the staff are super helpful and attentive towards your needs. The options are pretty vast. The service is really prompt and friendly. I would recommend anyone and everyone to try this spot out! 
9016 1 The fact that the white chocolate cake here is much-lauded is a testament to how weak the Atlanta standalone dessert game is. The kinda-snappy guy behind the counter didn't help either. 
9017 4 Best Media Noche by far. Fast service. Worth the time to go from Dunwoody. Sandwiches are large too. Also have had the chicken soup, empanadas, yucca fries, and the kids love the passion fruit juice. 
9018 2 The food has always been good, but the price for the amount of food is crazy. To top it off they have started giving you your food in smaller container and pretending its still the same amount when its not 
9019 4 Very recommended! - Excellent location, great price and friendly personnel. 
9020 4 Peppermint ice cream is so minty! There's a lot of candy cane in this ice cream which is awesome. Some other places have very few. I will be coming back! 
9021 4 Muu Muu's has it all; atmosphere, sweet tunes, strong drinks, tasty food and awesome service. My favorite bar in Portland hands down. 
9022 2 Food was sub par. Didn't enjoy our meal. I had the Gnocci with meat sauce but there wasn't any meat in it. Wife had the veal and it didn't have any flavor. On the bright side service was attentive. Ambiance was underwhelming. 
9023 4 Wonderful service and great drinks. A little confusing about the hours, when they were open. Happy Hour was great. 
9024 3 The food here is just OK, and the service is hit or miss to say the least. (Sometimes its downright terrible), but that misses the point of coming here. Frozen ritas are fierce and twice as strong as most places. 
9025 4 Buttermilk bars the way they are meant to be. Hard to find elsewhere, especially ones this good. You can have your fancy, expensive, trendy doughnuts. This unassuming place has the real deal. 
9026 4 One of our favorite family restaurants. Casual and relaxed. Amazing pizza dough with sea salt. Love the olives and bruschetta. Love the Rosemary bread! We enjoy chatting with the owner and the waitresses are always sweet. Our son's "go to" spot for every special occasion. 
9027 4 Lamb lamb lamb and lobster bisque. That's why I love this place. The salad bar is good but be careful not to fill up on the salad items save room for the good stuff. Did I mention how good the lamb was lol 
9028 4 I come here every time I'm in town! I usually get the steak chimichanga decent sized garnished well with sour cream Pico de gallo and comes with a side of rice and beans! If that doesn't fill you they have 2$ tacos ala carte :) 
9029 4 Clean, modern, super friendly caring staff. You also get a nice view outside while they clean your teeth. Was always impressed my hygienist remembered who I was! The Dr.'s here are also amazing and really care about your satisfaction. 
9030 4 Very fresh!! Love their customer service. Beef n blue sandwich was really tasty. They have fresh coffee too :)))) 
9031 4 I'm a local. I found this gem recently. Been like 3 times in 2 weeks now. Outstanding. The reviews are spot on. 
9032 3 Always love the tacos here but they really need to fix the bee problem outside so we can enjoy the Austin weather! 
9033 3 Gastown Classics Brunch..... Pretty busy for weekend morning, waited for 20 minutes. Standard brunch. Excellent environment and friendly employees. (´`) 
9034 3 If you like subway you will love firehouse. Firehouse is pretty much a higher quality subway. 
9035 2 Not bad. Spring rolls had more rice than I generally like. The pho was tasty but could have used more herbs- like basil. 
9036 0 I got e-mail from them yesterday telling me that they are going entirely out of business on June 30. What is going to happen to their Wi-fi service? 
9037 4 Had dinner at this humble, but very flavorful traditional Ethiopian plate and some lamb stew. The plate consist of a variety of vegetables, injera bread and some lamb stew. Everything was outrageously good. Highly recommended and very affordable 
9038 3 Food is pretty good. Certain things need a little help. Drinks are right on. Sausa margarita all day. The carnitas is good but can be a little dry. The chips and salsa are a great start. All in all, come here for a pretty good Mexican fix. 
9039 4 I'm a tea person and I love their tea menu. It's set in an idyllic neighbourhood and is a lovely place to hangout with friends or catch some quiet reading time. They have good wifi too. 
9040 3 Good fish and chips. The tartar is excellent. Friendly service. Great place to see the Premiership with a pint of lager. 
9041 3 Friendly staff, nice decor, decent prices. I had oysters, chicken wings and rolls which were all great. Really good happy hour specials 4-6. Fun 
9042 4 We reopened in a new location on 6/22/15. It's been 470 since the fire closed us on March 9, 2014. Hope to see you all soon. 
9043 4 The food is great, the lines are long, the wait is worth it, it's very filling, but it's pricey. I'd still go back. And have. 
9044 0 This place was ok for the price, but the pillows all smelled really bad and made it hard to sleep. I would not go back here, as the pillows really ruined the experience for me. O body wants to smell other peoples sweat 
9045 3 Downtown Crossing has lots of great places to shop. My go to spots were always Macys, DSW, H&M. There are lots of historic spots in this area too like the Old South Meeting House. You can jump on the Freedom Trail from here and follow it around the city. 
9046 4 Sat immediately @8pm Had meat plank, hummus, beers, special cocktails.. Great service. 
9047 2 I tried the shot it was good nice pick me upper the line wasnt long at all and the prices are a nice steal 
9048 3 BEST chocolate chip cookies I've had (and I've had a lot). Love the staff. Service can be slow but they're making everything fresh and in-house - good things take time!! 
9049 3 Great place for food and drink. Pool tables. The staff is always friendly. Good place to grab a beer and watch a game. They also have trivia and live Irish music. Good sized bar! 
9050 3 Excellent service, good food. Its a big place and it feels a little outdated. I was seates right away, my waiter was awesome and the staff in general was extremely friendly. They are willing to modify any order it sounds like. 
9051 4 Union Square provided the donuts for our wedding dessert. They prepared a huge variety in three different sizes and our guests couldn't stop raving about how delicious they were. Loved featuring a local business on our special day! 
9052 4 Best Mexican in Saugus. Always like to sit at the bar. Baja Fish Tacos, double rice with a cadillac margarita. Strong and tasty drinks, always fresh and always top notch. 
9053 3 This place seems to be renowned for their appetizers which you can order right at the bar, and that seems well-founded. Portions are big, the variety is great, drinks are poured generously, and you leave on the tipsy and full side. A great place for a tipple after work. 
9054 2 Only have 2 free lunches in Austin. Wa seeking the best. This wasn't it. Pretty good. Not the Texas BBQ I've heard so much about. Meat had been sitting there a while. Beans and Mac n cheese also sitting a while. I'm going to keep searching today. Going to franklin. 
9055 3 I had to stay in Orlando and essentially kill a week. Very quiet hotel. Shuttle to parks. Area is not very enchanting Food was so-so and guests from overseas, at times unbearable. Staff was perfect.. 
9056 3 Best value priced meal: half salad plus flatbread. If you eat a lot then take something else like a cup of soup. I like their butternut squash. If you're looking for coffee this is not the place. 
9057 4 Great experience from start to finish, very professional, friendly, prompt. And they charged less than a quote from a popular competitor I had found on Angieslist. 
9058 4 I found the ISGM fascinating. The setting is unique and wonderful, not to mention the art. One thing that really impressed me, however, is how friendly, inviting and helpful the staff and docents are. They truly made the experience exceptional. 
9059 1 Went in to check out the hot food items, but they seemed to have been sitting there for a while. Didn't seem to have the same turnover as say Yaohan down the road. Decided to take a pass. 
9060 0 This is a chicken bacon panini seriously There's 10 % of chicken on this meal 6 dollars for this 
9061 4 Possibly the only museum in town that definitely defeats the MFA - the ISG is one of the most beautiful places around, particularly if you've got a penchant for 19th and 20th century art. Absolutely take a day to tour the many floors... its worth it! 
9062 4 What a great little spot. We had a perfect taco Tuesday out on the patio. Margaritas were good. The tacos were great and very tasty. Such a relaxing atmosphere and we will definitely go back! 
9063 0 Just got one of the worst haircuts I've ever had. The guy used scissors on a fade, I had to go home and use my shavers to fix it. I wouldnt recommend and won't be going back. 
9064 4 This is one of my favorite Thai food spots. The atmosphere is nice but casual, and sometimes they have a person playing the piano. The staff is always very friendly, and the food is delicious, all the way from classic pad Thai to more original items. 
9065 0 Nice guy at the window. The food was cold largely do to a woman in front of me who had a "complicated order".... They should tell the to pull up. Not acceptable. 
9066 3 So far I am really enjoying the place and the neighborhood. The location is great and it is pretty quiet for a city apartment. Nice to have Kroger nearby. 
9067 2 lunch - good burger and good salads. At night it's scary when the cougars are on the prowl hunting for young men. 
9068 4 Absolutely wonderful place to dine. The food is spectacular, true to small plate tapas where you can basically try the entire menu for dinner. The wait staff is EXCELLENT all three times we have gone, absolutely top notch. They truly create an experience. Would highly recommend 
9069 4 Had a fantastic time here. The food and service was fantastic and they took extremely good care of our huge team. Thank you! 
9070 0 OMG, took at least 5 min to take each order, couldn't find any items on register, didn't know what came on the burger....hope you don't have a flight to catch anytime soon!! 
9071 0 Two years ago when I first tried Mel's it was surprisingly good, came back this year and it was awful, food was like a high school lunch, tasteless bland and expensive for the little food you get, staff was rude / uncaring, very disappointing 
9072 4 We sat at the bar and Ariel was fantastic. She was attentive and friendly. The drinks were delicious and the service perfect. Cannot wait to come back for a meal. 
9073 2 I think Jillian's is overrated. It is really expensive and you can drop a ton of cash before you realize it. The pool tables are nice though and it is kind of a cool place. It's worth going once in a while, but I couldn't be there all that often. 
9074 1 Basically, the same exact merchandise as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, only about 20% more. The stuff is laid out better, and the Market Basket next door is great, so if you're doing grocery shopping anyway, it's worth checking out. Otherwise, save the trip and do your off price shopping elsewhere. 
9075 1 Mediocre at best. Austin is a very cool food city- go find a place that does what they do really well!!! This place has a menu that's all over the place (hamburgers, bolognese, enchiladas?!) and none of it is more than mediocre. Service was quite slow. Meh. 
9076 4 Best dinner ever. Was not disappointed. Definitely will come back. We came for girls night and were very satisfied when we left. The salmon is on point. I recommend it if you want to feel like you are in paradise from the coconut rice 10/10 for sure ! 
9077 4 Excellent food, Lovely Ambience and such lovely hospitality by the staff! The Portobello mushrooms and paneer pancakes with nan were are favorites! We accidentally dropped a precious gold bracelet and Liz spotted it and gave it to us! Really kind and honest of her! Overall, a great evening! 
9078 0 Which idiot put the address of the RMV in the middle of government center? Isnt this RMV at the chinatown stop? Where is the RMV, at the chinatown stop or in the middle of government center? 
9079 4 Very Kewl chic place! Sexy crowd and great staff. Food pretty good, Crab cakes big chunk crab meat, yumm! Wings pretty good too. Hookah is $25.00, (only kinda downfall $15.00 refill after only an hr). 
9080 4 How could you go wrong with 4.95 chicken souvlaki? The best value in town and the price doesnt reflex the quality of the food. Parking is always easy to find. 
9081 4 These people are good to work with, they were sensitive and caring and took care of all the details ! Would not hesitate to use them again ! Thanks for the good job ! 
9082 0 Barely any Skor pieces in their McFlurry! So Cheap! 
9083 3 Nice ambience. Decent crowd... And a good collection of beer on tap and bottles. Do try the fish and chips! 
9084 4 Easily my favorite bar in the city. Great bar and service staff. Good prices. And for bar food, it's really spot on. Come here often, and will continue to do so! 
9085 4 Awesome spot great drink prices, super friendly staff and some how the foods really damn good. A go to spot for me and the wife. 
9086 4 Anna was excellent today! She was quick to begin her cleaning tasks after we did a walk through my home! Anna is a great cleaner and I would have her back in my home any day! My home is sparkling clean! 
9087 3 Great Gyro- that about sums it up. This place is always packed during lunch hours and often runs out of supplies near closing. Either way, if you can slide through within the time frame, get down on a spectacular Gyro that definitely lives up to the hype. 
9088 2 Only had cocktails at happy hour... Dishes that went by looked great and atmosphere is young and fun! Would like to go back and eat there. 
9089 3 Great coffee and atmosphere 
9090 4 Wife and family love this place. New beer. Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is great. Steaks are great. Service is exceptional. 
9091 2 BBH - Meh. Regular pho (rare steak with beef balls) - Decent. Spring Rolls - Amazing! Get the spring rolls. It's the only item on the menu worthy of 5 stars! PS. They have a (small) private parking lot at the back. 
9092 2 Good food and plenty of it. Wife loved her omelette. Good French toast and bacon. I asked for crispy hash browns and bacon and unlike most places they served me crispy hash browns and bacon. 
9093 0 Absurd yuppie outfitter. Very expensive. Come on down and pick up a designer hand bag and a.....hatchet??! 
9094 3 Wanted something close to my hotel. Their pasta dishes sounded good, so I figure I would give them a try. I thought the service was excellent. Huge portions too. 
9095 4 Great place to eat. Great food and the scenery is very nice. We went for my sister's bday and the service was quick and the staff was awesome!!!! 
9096 3 A great place for a meal that will leave you feeling satisfied. Vietnamese and Thai food are both very flavorful and that's definitely what you get here. Good prices and no wait on a holiday evening. Easy to miss from the street. 
9097 0 Just stopped by to get a thai tea n the lady said they dont have to go cup and unbelievably saying "we're not starbucks u cant sit n drink u have to eat" im like........... seriously lady? 
9098 0 Just another side note.. I requested a refund for food I never received and of course my card was never refunded! This place is unbelievable! A call to the health department should be made! 
9099 4 Great Food! Great place! Great staff... First time in Salem and really enjoyed the food. Black bean burger and wings yummy! Loved it 
9100 3 Was staying at the Avalon, awesome hotel, Outstanding customer service! I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Salmon. The sauce was too die for. The English muffin was a little too tough for my butter knife. I would definitely have breakfast here again! 
9101 4 The food here is amazing the staff is wonderful.......I live the atmosphere so family oriented I will definitely be returning 
9102 4 Full throttle always takes care of me. Never a rip off, always there to help, honest and fast. I have recommended them to multiple people and will continue to use them as long as I have a VW. 
9103 4 Great experience. Loved the actors and have learned about history. Being non Native American i didn't knew a lot of the things explained about the tea party. 
9104 4 We had a small issue with our wine. However the host/waitress stepped in and solved it quickly! The meats were excellent. In our hometown of Atlanta this would cost double. We recommend 100%. Great food with great customer service. 
9105 4 So good!! Pizza & "macaroni of the moment" always fantastic! We love the clam/mushroom pizza. 
9106 1 Dime a dozen lounge near the Douche Ranch. Meh. 
9107 4 Very yummy food and excellent service .. it's sad you guys aren't in New Jersey !!! But lucky For me .. My MaMi lives in Kissimmee .. I will most definitely be back .. My moms says give you a 5 and you always listen to your elders .. lol 
9108 3 Great prices and really good food. The wait can be long for brunch time on weekends but so delicious. 
9109 0 I asked for a trim and got a major chop plus thinning of my already thin hair. Hello 1994? It's the Rachel haircut and I could cry since it will take me another year to grow my hair out!! WHY DON"T SALONS LISTEN 
9110 0 Don't come here if they aren't answering the phone - they close the kitchen prior to what is listed online and on their door. I got here at 9:30 pm and the door was locked even though there were people inside and the sign was listed as closing at 10. 
9111 4 I'm pretty sure their pineapple upside-down pancake is the best pancake I've ever eaten! That combined with their delicious hash browns, gourmet local coffee and inviting dining area make this an awesome place to stop for breakfast! 
9112 4 The chachapa was delicious! Great flavor all around and good price considering the size of it. 
9113 4 Wow...not much else to say. In town for bizness and found this place on yelp. I eat all over the country and this place is a must if you're in Columbus. Bar Tender Shane is the man #mancrush 
9114 3 Great menu... Lots of choices! Too bad they took some favorites off the menu. Still...good staff, tons of different beers and 4 (soon to be 5) locations. 
9115 3 This place was packed but we somehow scored a table and our food came out quickly. The people here hustle, fantastic service. 
9116 0 Got cussed out by a waitress for accidentally turning off a few lights on a power strip. Seriously? Walked out and she was still cussing me out? Will never be back and I've been here probably ten times this year easily. 
9117 3 The food (we got soup and sandwiches) was good, but I have had better vegan nut-based cheeses before. Service was very friendly and the environment was nice as well. I'd love to come back when in the area again and try some of their other options. 
9118 1 Not what I expected when I go to a Marriott course. Not in good shape. They charge for range balls!? No beverage cart because the "tee sheet was light". Did charge less than most resort courses around here. 
9119 1 Thanks to a number of reasons, pricing, douchiness and others, this is no longer a hangout for me. It's still fine if you're 20 and drink vodka sodas. 
9120 4 Karaoke on Wednesday nights is a lot of fun and their drink specials are amazing! 
9121 2 Very expensive but good gym attire. I come here to look fabulous at the gym and it works great. The only problem is this place is very expensive and I hate parking at legacy place. Other than that great store. 
9122 3 4 stars for the freshest sashimi, average sushi and awesome oysters with great service and good value for money. I ordered a sushi boat with oysters. Loved every bite. 
9123 3 This is a very nice modern hotel. I stayed there for business and it was great. The decor is modern and tasteful. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The restaurants and bars are good too. 
9124 3 Really good liquor store...great wine and beer selection, Knowledgeable staff. They have great on-line specials. I recommend signing up to get their specials. What more can I say? 
9125 4 Large variety on tap with staff ready to help you find what is perfect. Not a huge variety of bottled beers however what waS there gave good variety. 
9126 3 If you like german sausages and cream puffs, this is your place! They also have other good options like the reuben, deserts and oh yes, large draft biers. 
9127 1 Just ok. Ginger garlic rice had a strange fishy taste. Curries were simply sweet without any other flavors. Service was very, very slow. I don't know if we will try them again. 
9128 4 Chorizo burrito add beans or The Sand Diego burrito. Go to choices and both are awesome! 
9129 4 Delicious pizza and pasta at this little Italian place and they have good deals for lunch. Not to mention that finally there is a nice patio. 
9130 3 Cool place, cozy feel to it. Good service and great food. Perfect for brunch! 
9131 4 These guys were great! They moved a piano for my workplace that was in precarious condition. They took really good care of the piano, took the time to position it, and were very friendly and courteous. I highly recommend their services! 
9132 2 Chopped brisket sandwich was okay. Potato salad was good. 
9133 4 Love this hotel!!! The service is top-notch, very clean and relaxing. The grounds and decor are beautiful. My husband, daughter and I will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Disney World! 
9134 4 If everyone who cut men's hair did it as competently at Ratana, then no one would ever complain about a haircut ever again. 
9135 2 ordered the Steak Sandwich, very tough steak. Location is very small, arrive early for lunch. Service was attentive 
9136 4 Very nice and helpful staff. Came in with a popped tire for a stroller and fixed it on site! What a life saver! Staff were helpful to avoid blowing the tire again and very friendly! 
9137 4 What a find?!?! We wanted authentic German food and we found it. So yummy!! Service was also warm and friendly. I highly recommend it. Worth the drive to a local neighborhood spot for those visiting. The pickle soup is a must!! 
9138 4 Awesome haircut and shave, exactly the type of place I was looking for a guys place to relax and have a haircut Tim is outstanding ! Definitely will be back 
9139 3 The atmosphere and decor is mostly what makes this place shine. Their skillets are pretty darn good too but different every time and u are almost always guaranteed a line up. The coffee and service is fabulous. 
9140 3 We are grateful that the staff could accommodate our softball team. The pizza was really good also. Really fresh dough! 
9141 3 Best lobster tail I've ever had. When they overcooked the steak, they worked tirelessly to fix it and were extremely hands-on in an effort to make me happy. Made me like the experience even more. 
9142 4 Great food delicious drinks and excellent service! Went on a Monday night and sat at the bar with a few of my friends, we had the pleasure to have KJ as our bartender. She was fun friendly and fast! We will definitely be returning! 
9143 4 This is your friendly, neighborhood hole-in-the-wall diner. And if that's your aim, you'll love it! It's very reasonable and the food was delicious and the service was friendly. I'll def. be going there again! 
9144 3 I like the noodle, broth, lard & spicy options. Broth though was a little too salty and not as flavorful as other places. Wish they had corn as an add on or garlic. Bowls were small. Gyoza was basic but good. 3.5 stars. Nice staff. Clean room. 
9145 4 Great place to eat Latin food! We ate arepas and empanadas! Both great and it was enough for lunch. Sad that they didn't have a real aji (spicy sauce in Latin America) 
9146 1 Maybe my view would change if I tried another time, but I doubt that will happen. Have only had take out. Meat is good, not great. Sandwich poorly made, skimpy portions, though bread pretty good. But the price...fugeddaboutit! 
9147 4 Warm environment. Nice staff. Had an everything bagel with egg and avocado. Absolutely fantastic. The coffee was extremely good with low acidity. Great for a light brunch. 
9148 4 Extremely clean and very friendly service! The best subway that I've been to. Afruza and the Asian young lady is very pleasant. The boss did a great job in hiring them. Very alert jumping from the convenience store to working at the subway counter. 
9149 4 The punany wrap is five stars! That thing is delicious. I also had the sea moss drink but was not a fan. It was my first time having sea moss, so sea moss may just not be my thing. Get that wrap though, you'll be glad you did. 
9150 4 All of the five star reviews are spot on! Thank you, Remedy Urgent Care for all that you do! 
9151 4 Took my Dad here for a late Father's day with friends and it was exceptional. Cocktails were on point and the steak, as always, was to die for. I need to go back just to try dessert and coffee some evening as that looked delicious too. 
9152 2 Someone was nice enough to reach our to me and offer me a refund and free pastries, I'm giving additional stars for good customer service and I appreciate the owners for considering my opinion 
9153 4 Very clean and modern looking salon. Customer service was good and the employee were polite! They paid close attention to detail and took their time so my shellac mani looks flawless! Thanks girls! 
9154 4 Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! The lady from the pub crawl recommended this BBQ place and it was the BEST BBQ we had in Austin! The guys were great and we can't wait to come back to eat here! The brisket was my FAV! 
9155 3 Just like others have said, its definintely in a random place. Don't let that discourage you, the food and service are excellent. We love it. 
9156 4 Soaring Over California in California Adventures theme park? This is much better. Hold on tight for a breath taking experience! 
9157 3 First time here since I was visiting. Tried the Philly Cheesesteak. It was awesome. Very close to the real deal from Philly. I would go again. 
9158 4 Lee and her sister do amazing work that is cost effective and performed in a very timely manner! I will definitely stop by again if I need anything adjusted. They are cash only so make sure to go to the bank beforehand. 
9159 3 Love the Half Fast! Great subs, huge selection, and decent value for price. The atmosphere inside is a bit dark, but hey, I'm sure that works well for those days when you just need a sandwich and a beer (or two). 
9160 0 Not much "in stock" as far as furniture. Not very friendly either. Will shop online and elsewhere. 
9161 3 Great food! Had the Steele slider and Nashville chicken sandwiches. Great options for beer as well! 
9162 1 Not a bad place to read a book or get your work done, but the owner often kick you out or turn off the wifi before it closing time and kicks you out. The coffee also is not fresh... 
9163 2 The place is not bad, but just the way it works is weird. The food takes a little while to come out, and there is order to it or at least that is what it felt like. I like the food but it's not great. 
9164 3 it is a nice place for a cheap buffet， and they have various kinds of food and fruits. Could be a little bit noisy but who cares ：） 
9165 4 Love it. Especially for lunch, what a deal. Dinner's food is obviously just as good, but you don't get soup, or egg roll, and pay twice as much. Can't go wrong with sesame beef! 
9166 0 I came here because my usual pho place was closed but I just needed to satisfy my pho craving...big mistake! I found a dead cricket in my food and it instantly made me lose my appetite they were acting rude after I told them too. Never coming here again!! 
9167 3 Good, creative cuisine!! Portions are small, but good flavor. Atmosphere is great. Downsides were: expensive, food comes out not very hot, and coconut mousse cake needed more flavor. 
9168 3 This place is amazing!!! Sherri the bartender was so friendly and shook our hands at introduction. She made us feel important and like she cared! The atmosphere is fun and the beers are good! We will be back! 
9169 4 The two things that held me back from giving 5 stars have been improved. Serena's has brought on a great new waiter who also is the pastry chef! We had an amazing panna cotta the other night that was made in-house. 
9170 4 This place was absolutely amazing I don't know how anyone could rate it less than 5 stars. The steaks were out of this world and the Mac and cheese side was fantastic. 
9171 4 Delish been several times already, love a good dog so does my Boston Terrier Morgan. I have been a customer since they located on soco Patrick ****** 
9172 4 My go-to spot for a late evening meal. Their happy hour menu is nice. Their tiramisu is next level. I try my hardest not to get that every time I'm there! 
9173 4 Zach and Johnathan were SUPER Friendly and helpful. I had a slow leak in my tire and they fixed me right on up. They were totally professional and now they have gained a new customer. 
9174 4 Gorgeous museum. The courtyard was beautiful. My friend and I drank our beers in the courtyard while waiting (the only place allowed) for our show. 
9175 2 Average place food-wise, but the staff is friendly and the decor is beautiful. There is no parking directly out front, but metered spots down the street, not too far away. - absolute best guacamole around - I recommend the pollo a la crema 
9176 4 Great local theater. Very clean never really crowded. They serve kettle corn! I go often since my husband is a huge movie buff they play a good mix of new movies and some block busters not all. I just saw Avengers and thought it would be crowded but it wasn't. 
9177 1 A sports bar!!!! Cold beer, good bar food. Apps on point but hands down the slowest wait staff in west orange county. If you plan on getting out of here in under an hour dont come 
9178 4 Best mussels and custom drinks. Great food and great service. Don't usually like Indian food but I like this place. 
9179 0 Never called my number during a rush. Waited almost an hour for two chicken bowls. Late for work now. Looked like it had come out with a larger order and was never called. 
9180 4 The Ron burgundy is a must that everyone will enjoy! If you like a little spicier go for the double d or the el camino! The el camino is my favorite! It has a little kick but its not too spicy and is very delicious! 
9181 3 The menu is full of great home style fair like chicken and waffles or huevos rancheros! K 
9182 4 I absolutely love this place. The food is magnificent and the ambience is really cool. It's a smaller place, but they do a lot with what they have. Order the Good Wolf burrito--you won't be disappointed! 
9183 2 BBQ is good. Not exceptional nor distinctive. Only one sauce offered. Ordered 1/2lb of brisket, pulled pork, and ribs. But was less than 1/3 lb servings each. Mac n cheese side was good. Very noisy in the inside dining area. Rooftop would have been better. 
9184 2 Mehhhh everyone raves about this place but I don't see the big deal. Staff was too busy gossiping to be attentive, food was ok. The only "good" thing here is the coffers, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. 
9185 4 Very easy to deal with. Quality of the furniture is superb! Prices very good! Delivered quickly. Cushions they made for our furniture are beautiful! 
9186 4 I've never done a Yelp before for anything but this place was worth one. Good customer service, nice location. The food is fairly priced and if you're looking for Brazilian food/something new this is the place. 
9187 2 Disappointing. I am a Red Robin lover but find the service at this location to be terrible. The food quality is inconsistent. 
9188 0 Food was really good, waiter was nice, but not even five minutes after finishing our meal, the owner walked over and said we need to leave so they can seat more customers. I guess we can't allow our food to digest and finish our coffee. Won't be back. 
9189 2 Cream corn, fries, chicken & waffles were good. Meatloaf melt did not impress. Bacon in it was good. Bread had a nice sweetness but meat was dry... Inside is cute and kitschy. I'll stick with 4 Rivers. 
9190 2 Sorry! I really wanted this to be my go-to place, but the last two times I went here, the service was very slow, and the lady was somewhat dismissive. In my first review, I gave an extra star for cheap and quick service, but the inconsistency drops it back down. 
9191 4 Coming back here soon! We had the arepa reina, torta cubana, empanadas de cangrejo And the sangría. Everything was perfect And fast! 
9192 4 Awesome, huge burgers. A little messy, but good. The line/wait can get quite long, and service is so, so. 
9193 4 Went here with a living social coupon for a Brazilian. I loved Joan. She was excellent, meticulous, and professional. She did a fantastic job and I made another appt before I left! 
9194 4 Possibly the best food we had in Austin. The carrot-cake french toast is a brilliant way to convince you to have dessert for breakfast. The tomato salad was also incredibly refreshing and delicious. Bloody Mary's are world famous and did not disappoint. Really really great spot! 
9195 4 Totally loving this place! Came in the third time this week! The bread is different from American bakery and it's very good. Their shakes are made of real fruit and I love the mango one very much. Food is amazing too. Tried the Brazilian burger and it's very tasty too! 
9196 3 Love this place. Very close to where I live, coffee drinks are good, muffins taste great especially the pumpkin. Customer Service is top notch, the girls working there are friendly and on top of it. 
9197 4 I love this place!!! Thanks for taking such great care of me- my gluten free extra cheese-y cheese plate was wonderful! Right down to the juicy , perfectly ripe blackberry garnish. And, that green olive?!? BEST. I'VE. EVER. HAD. 
9198 4 This is definitely one of the best restaurants in town! I love the owner; she is so sweet to her regulars, and the other servers have also given nothing but great service. I would recommend the tom ka gai soup, the mango sticky rice, and the curries. 
9199 0 No bueno. The chicken tasted very cheap and strange. My husband is not a very picky eater but he barely touched his food. Service was great but I can't come back to a restaraunt based on good service only. I need the good to be somewhat decent. 
9200 3 this place pretty much ruled. i love the charmingly scattered design and cozy, if a little cramped, feel. our server was great, always refilling our coffee, the biscuit was mindblowing, and mindblowingly huge, and the shrimp and grits were perfect. the best meal of my trip. 
9201 4 We just had great experience using Little Guys Movers. The crew was extraordinary.....nice, professional, easy going and so very helpful! And, they showed up on time and were very expeditious in getting the job done. This was my first experience hiring a moving company, and I couldn't be more pleased. 
9202 4 Best brownie sundae ever and huge. Perfect for sharing. Brownie was warm and tasted fresh. Sweet staff, very courteous. 
9203 3 Good experience both times I've visited. First time got the brunch burger and I'm totally a fan and then the PB&J burger which was surprisingly good. I would definitely go back. 
9204 4 Very clean, and nice presentation of food. Everything tasted fresh, and the black rice was something new for me. Delicious! 
9205 3 Caesar Burrito (romaine lettuce, herb croutons, feta cheese, caesar dressing) is the BEST I've ever had. I had it about two years ago and still on the hunt for a decent replacement in New York City. 
9206 4 I did something really dumb to our back door deadbolt (jammed it, unscrewed it and could not get it back together) and Mike's had it fixed in a couple hours for a very reasonable price. 
9207 0 Over hyped like others said. $7 for a shortcake!!! $4 for one canolli and I have had good canolli but this one was not good at all. I rather have Publix bakery. Sorry, not impressed at all! I won't do it again 
9208 4 Went back to Porcini's for another incredible dinner tonight and I can say hands down they still have the best chicken parm in or around Boston! On top of that our waitress, Cheryl, was phenomenal! She has a gift for being attentive, cheerful, and so genuine and nice. 
9209 3 Very good food at an average price. Excellent service with very friendly employees!!! Very quick to serve food. Only gripe is I got the chicken that had a few chewy pieces ( fat not trimmed off). Crab Rangoon was fresh and excellent!!! 
9210 3 This place has amazing food. I have only ordered delivery, but the food is just so great. Definitely one of the best pizza places in the area. 
9211 3 Really great food at good pricing. Pretty quick too. The service is a little laissez faire, but whatever... 
9212 2 The portions for the sashimi are small compared to the high prices. The service is excellent but the consistency of the hamachi / yellowtail is disheartening. Although the sashimi is passable the prices are too high considering what where you are and what you are paying for. 
9213 4 Today, I took advantage of the great shuttle service and I didn't waste time... It took me right to my gym and back to the store after my workout. I appreciate Curry Honda Service seriousness and I am always served by courteous and nice people! 
9214 4 Such a good neighborhood bar. Great food with a simple menu. Pleasant bartenders. Lots of space to sit, and free pool! 
9215 3 I was a walk-in for a regular mani-pedi and was trying them because they're super close to my new home. Friendly, clean place, and can't beat the prices! Anna did my nails and did a great job. I'll be back. 
9216 4 Super tasty pastries and treats. They did a very generous promotion thing and brought a platter by our office. They didn't ask anything in return. They were professional/on time and did I mention the pastries and treats were super tasty? I did, didn't I. 
9217 4 best pizza by the slice in town. the staff is insanely friendly & they know you by name. and if you get a whole pie -- there's no doubt it's a finisher situation. omg if you get the stromboli -- so.freaking.good. 
9218 3 I went here with my persian friend so I had a little advantage. We went and had the lunch buffet and I really enjoyed it! They seriously have the best hummus ever! Stuffed grape leaves were good too! Wud def. Come back! 
9219 2 I can't say I've ever been very impressed with a meal here, but yet I continue going back. I guess that says something, right? It's decent Mexican, though I could recommend better. Great location though, and the drinks selection is pretty fun. Sans the bloody marys. Holy horseradish. 
9220 4 Great food and service! Two kinds of salsa, both delicious (we even asked to bring some home!) Prices aren't too crazy for midtown/highlands either. Will definitely be coming back soon :) 
9221 1 Service is simply atrocious. Should be zero stars but the food is their saving grace. 
9222 4 Try the Lamb Chops and a specialty Martini... TO DIE FOR. 
9223 2 Pretty average Shane's. Lots of seating and of course ample BBQ sauce! Went with the Big Daddy. When I received the dish, was skeptical due to the somewhat small appearance, but ended up being a pretty filling dish. 
9224 4 Awesome oysters and other seafood. Great atmosphere and the layout of the restaurant is cool. 
9225 3 Good place to get some drinks listen to music and enjoy hookah. The prices are decent, not too expensive and the service there was great. From the hostess to the waitress they made sure you were well taken care of. Definetly will visit again. 
9226 3 This is one of our go to places for breakfast in Portland. The omelettes are terrific. The wait staff are great as well. 
9227 4 Great place to eat. I have tried several items from the menu and everything was fresh and tasty. The rotisserie chicken was so amazing and the Brussel sprout salad was crisp and fresh with a kick! The owners are super nice! Great menu 
9228 3 Great taste little messy overloaded yet delicious Be great to provide buffalo sauce on the side 
9229 2 A good spot to check out once. The servers are friendly and fun atmosphere. You really pay a premium for that atmosphere. 
9230 4 I tried barre3 again, gave them a second chance. It was awesome. I am now attending on a regular bases. Never gets boring, and every class is a challenge. You leave the studio feeling a sense of accomplishment. The workout focuses on everybody part. Instructors are very professional and caring. 
9231 4 This chicken totally rocks! Make sure to get the bone in chicken....the flavor is out of this world delish! Mac and cheese was great too! Thanks gus! 
9232 0 On my recent visit to Austin I revisited this restaurant, may I say the service and the food were just not that good. Tip look else where for good Indian food. 
9233 4 Awesome sushi rolls! A dinner experience here with cocktails to pair is best. 
9234 1 Ive had an ok meal here , tonight we gave it a pass because as we were about to go in ,then saw a dog on the table ? I love animals but this was someones pet on a table hanging out. 
9235 4 Love the vibe here!! Very friendly people!! And the food is amazing. Highly recommend Sofrito's. 
9236 2 Fantastic service, excellent lamb and chicken schwarma roll ups. The falafel was crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside. It was very tasty. Excellent tahnini sauce, what more could you want? As a reminder: hungry customers might think about getting two roll ups as they aren't the biggest. 
9237 4 My bf and I refer to this as the Church of Kappy's. I DARE you to find something that they don't have. There's a huge selection, good prices and friendly staff. It's tough to go in and not buy a ton of things. We go back quite frequently. 
9238 4 To redhead/brunette girl with the big smile who works at this location. Will you go out with me? Check Y/N. You are super cute. 
9239 4 Such good food!! Such reasonable prices! Highly recommend. We order from here regularly. 
9240 4 Great lunch spot on campus. Interesting menu, locally source ingredients, fun(ky) hang out spot. 
9241 4 The cupcakes are delicious and so fresh. These are the best with a variety of flavors. I had a dulce de leche cupcakes, we also ordered German chocolate and Cannoli cream, all so good. 
9242 4 Wow wow wow this people should really teach customer service class to a lot other restaurants!! Outstanding and the food just had if my madre cooked it.... would give a 10 star for sure 
9243 0 Dirty.sat 10 min no one would help us. All tables were dirty. Bar top dirty.dont wast your time 
9244 4 Great location, beautiful clubhouse and amenities. Greystar has a great team in the office and maintenance to assist all the residents. 
9245 3 Good creative food in a fun atmosphere. Service is very friendly and attentive. 
9246 4 We love it here! Amazing food, doggies everywhere, and our server David took such good care of us. Thank you guys! 
9247 4 loved it all the shows was great i go back every year its that good. well worth the money at £79 for 3 parks for 2 weeks its a steal 
9248 4 I eat my fair share of Thai food. I've been her twice and have enjoyed the panang and red curry with basil rolls. One of the hidden surprises is the coconut soup that comes with the meal-- amazing. This is a true diamond in the ruff. 
9249 4 Beautiful place! Plentiful wine selection from all Over the world. A fun one stop shop! Great wine tastings! Staff is very friendly and work hard to educate you on your wine purchase 
9250 3 Great food. The calamari was def. one of the best. The Chargrilled Swordfish with a side of broccoli and rice pilaf was also good. I would stay away from the steak though, it was bland. But overall, tasty seafood and wonderful service! 
9251 4 I have never written a review and may never again. That's how good this place is. Go here for brunch, get the avocado/crab, Mexican corn, RF tacos, and french toast. Achieve the bliss I presently enjoy (bliss brought to you in part by some side salsa for the tacos). 
9252 3 Every once in a while I pick a random spot with my buddies just to break with routine hangouts. This was one of those random adventures. It paid off handsomely. This is a truly cool bar. Nice ambience. Reasonable drink prices. Friendly bar tenders. 
9253 4 I hope we have some place like this in Toronto! I love starting my morning with great breakfasts! We had Cassoulet and Paella, both were in great portion and delicious!Also recommend the green tea latte :) 
9254 4 Yes - this is INSIDE the Bank of America building. Great cup of coffee - we had the Boss with 4 shots of espresso and mocha. Sipped on it most of the morning. 
9255 3 Potato wrapped snapper had great texture and flavor Truffle Mac and cheese couldn't go wrong Expensive but delicious 
9256 4 My back spasms were out of control so I made an apt with Sophie. Now mind you I'm a big guy, 5'11 220, so it's tough to get deep in the muscle but Sophie was amazing! I feel so much better, and I'm Looking forward to my apt next month! 
9257 3 A bit on the pricy side for what I usually spend. But everything was great. Nice atmosphere, good service and the food was delicious. 
9258 4 The owners of this joint are extremely friendly and welcoming. I had a black coffee and it was great, no bite at all. 
9259 4 Blueberry pancakes!!!!! Everything here is awesome (breakfast wise, never eaten lunch/dinner) 
9260 4 New owners! Clean, sharp. Fantastic service. The food is yummy now. Had the South of the Boarder scramble. Tasted soooo good. On bed of fresh spinach. Excellent. Latte fantastic! 
9261 0 Chicken was good. But I totally got food poisoning from this place. Can't say I'll be going back anytime soon 
9262 3 Was here over the weekend.....margaritas are top notch....the food was above average...would definitely go back, service was good, waiter was attentive and informative. 
9263 2 If you are going to get anything from here, go for the gyro! That's the best thing on the menu and the only place I know of where you can get a good gyro....and I've been in boston for 11 years! 
9264 0 GROSS&GREASY I ordered take out from here and was very disappointed. I ordered General Tso& egg rolls. The chicken was heavily breaded& large. The egg rolls were super greasy and had no flavor. Major let down 2 entrees and 4 egg rolls was $30 
9265 4 This is our first time here, good food friendly service. Prices are reasonable. Husband had Couve Cristo lots of meat. I had steak bite and it came with bacon, so yummy. Dinner salad could be a small meal on its own. 
9266 3 Love this place!! No matter what lady I get she always does a perfect job. The service has always been quick and neat, and a mani/pedi is only $30. 
9267 3 A different menu than we are use to but delicious and beautifully presented. Loved the oatmeal raisin cookie as an appetizer other than bread. 
9268 4 I went here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend and it was great. We got the Chanel replica, TFC, volcano and a few other rolls I can't remember. But they were really good. Great experience here 
9269 4 Love the flexible hours offered by Jackson Ruiz. It made it SO easy for me to get my hair cut regularly and work around my work schedule. Every person I've worked with at Jackson Ruiz has been wonderful! 
9270 0 No hostess to seat us. Waited to be seated 5 min. Finally someone comes over. Ordered food as soon as waitress came for drink order. Waited 45 min for food. Will not go back. 
9271 3 Love this place. Consistently great Thai food served by nice people. What more can you ask for ? :) 
9272 4 Went here for the first time for the Fuzz Club. I'm so glad it's here! Great atmosphere inside and a huge patio to escape to. Plenty of parking. I'll never go West of I35 again! 
9273 4 This place is amazing. Best Turkish food in town, hands down. Our server, Sam was engaging, knowledgeable, and efficient! We ordered so much food because everything was so delicious. I would recommend the lamb sauté. It was sooo delicious. We will be back here for sure! 
9274 4 I like this spot you can really save sometime running around with your head cut off you can get all your party needs here and some 
9275 3 This business is relocating to a larger space next month. Family run. Good food. Reasonable prices. Smoked chicken is delicious. The biggest knock is the tiny space - but that will be fixed upon relocation. Check them out after they move! 
9276 4 What are you waiting for..........Go,! Exceptional service and food, well worth the wait. Theo's is everything they say and more. One of my top breakfast meals ever! 
9277 3 Super happy hour food. Steak tacos are huge, and delicious. I love the chipotle salt they rim their margaritas with. Late night happy hour every night is awesome. 
9278 3 Went here for first time Friday night. Ladies were really friendly. Food was good and got a fair amount for what we paid. will return. 
9279 1 This Safeway isn't awful, just meh. Pros: Wheat free section At any given time stuff is on sale, a lot of stuff Discount card just uses your phone number (I'm looking at you Save On) Hours Cons: Staff Produce Selection of juice Location Moderness 
9280 4 What a little gem. Best crab legs you'll ever eat. Hands down. Get the shabang seasoning- you won't be disappointed!!! 
9281 0 No outside beverages allowed. So we took our coffees and went to Base Camp instead. Much better choice. 
9282 2 Parish offers sandwiches created by local celebrity chefs. The prices are outrageous, but you are going for the experience. 
9283 4 Classes are always fun, and full of learning! My toddler has loved classes for over a year. Teachers love what they are doing and truly care about the kids in class. Wonderful, I highly recommend Grow and Sing Studios! 
9284 4 Hot damn, I love this place. You will wait for a table almost any time you go, but it's worth it. The only thing that would make this place better is beer! 
9285 4 Fantastic and reasonably priced. Staff was charismatic as well. Will keep returning to try everything on the menu. 
9286 4 I had an awesome experience here! The staff was very kind and helpful. Our waiter was on top of everything, food came out fast and then have a great wine selection! I can't wait to go back. 
9287 4 I love this place! Soch a pleasant surprise to walk into the basement of the Hotel Boulderado and there are all these little chambers/rooms/bars! The night we went, they had an excellent live jug band playing! So fun! 
9288 3 Tasty food, very helpful recommendations and friendly service. Good portion sizes, reasonable prices, clean establishment. 
9289 2 Pretty cool spot. You will usually hear some awesome ambient music from Moody right upstairs. Reasonably priced menu and a substantial wine selection. Pizza and wine are usually my goto here! 
9290 4 Good place, great food...and fast service! Love the wholesome bowl with spicy chicken! 
9291 4 Not just for wine!! Excellent bottled beer selection and they usually have a couple great beers on tap (and they'll fill growlers). My girlfriend goes for the wine, I tag along for the beer. Local favorite. 
9292 4 Love the service every time my boyfriend and I come here! A very sweet girl named Jadalyn, I believe, wanted to make sure my boyfriend enjoyed his iced coffee, incase she thought she made it wrong. Very polite and sweet along with the rest of her co-workers! 
9293 2 Don't get the shrimp and grits for $9. It is served in ramekin dish. Wife got chicken and she was happy though. 
9294 0 If you are going here for the juicy pork belly in the other pictures you see on yelp they don't serve it anymore. They only have these dry deep fried strips. Its just bland unsmoked bacon. Nothing special. Shame, I bet this place was great once. 
9295 4 Everyone makes mistakes. How a business deals with it tells you all you need to know. Big time screw up with my tires. Fast fix. Seriously, that's class! Thanks, Hilda. Thanks all. 
9296 4 Delicious alternative to fast food! They definitely know what goes into their sandwiches and smoothies and you will too because they give the calories and nutritional information. Although I recently went to lunch I really love the breakfast. Friendly staff, spacious seating as well as an outdoor patio. 
9297 4 Have been going to Bob's for many years. The best quality meats , cheese's and Italian sub's you will find. 
9298 4 Great food and fast service. Neighborhood kinda of place that has a Cuban flavor and connections. The staff is attentive and quickly filling my order. Free drink refills soft drinks. Outdoor seating for customers and yes to carry out. I will be back. 
9299 2 Good place in downtown for lunch. People craving for a spicy dish try spicy chicken pot and ask them to make it extra HOT! 
9300 0 The name has changed again, but the service has not improved. Or perhaps they don't like single diners because other tables seemed to get more attention. 
9301 4 My favorite salsa in the city!! This place is quaint, cute and everything we've eaten has been super yummy! A favorite for our whole family! 
9302 4 Best Pizza I have had in a very long time! Outstanding place with a great verity of pies to choose from by the slice. 
9303 2 Food was a little cold, shredded chicken was dry but salsas were delicious and were able to mask the dryness. My kids liked the carne asada tacos. Convenient if you are staying at the Marriott. Closes by 2 though. 
9304 4 Bought cell phones here. Service was very nice and friendly. They were very helpful and patient. I very much appreciate all the time they spent with me. 
9305 4 Hind has been cutting my daughter's hair for 2 1/2 years now. She is the nicest person and does the best job!!! We love her!! My daughter always walks out with the most beautiful haircut. I definitely recommend her as a stylist! 
9306 3 Great pad Thai, quick delivery. The vegetable pad Thai has a lot in it- green beans, baby corn, broccoli, carrots and zucchini. The Bangkok bags are great too- Thai take on crab Rangoon. 
9307 1 Let's play a game of word association. Flavors: decent Price: okay Space: tiny Facilities: dirtyish Customers: Harvard Boba: inconsistent Rewards card: crappy program TV: ABDC/SYTYCD/UFC Service: hit-or-miss. usually miss. Boston Tea Stop: meh Overall: I want Lollicup. 
9308 2 Wanted to love it but felt like a factory riding on a wave. Good food; sucky service. No full bar. 
9309 3 Absolutely love this place and the gluten free waffles. I had the dutch Apple waffle with cinnamon and agave nectar and it was so delicious Everyone who works here is super friendly. Their drinks are also just as fabulous. The only downside to this place is the lack of seating. 
9310 3 Was visiting from Los Angeles my experience was great! Good food, great customer service and the Key lime pie was to die for. 
9311 0 The only vegan option I can find and y'all won't place a to go order on game day. What's the point of being open? To top it off the "host" didn't even acknowledge me until one of three people standing at the front told him to turn around. Completely ridiculous. 
9312 4 I love the bread and butter to start, they are by far the best and it's addictive. The dinner and service is excellent as well. I try to come once a month. 
9313 4 Had a great experience! Alana did a great job serving us! Love the chips and salsa. We told them we had to be out in thirty minutes and they moved quickly to accommodate us! 
9314 4 BEST DONUTS EVER! In the war between Voodoo and Blue Star, I'm firmly on the side of Blue star. Krispy Kreme, Dunkin; Donuts, etc.. don't even come close. They are far far faaar away. The donuts aren't too sweet and the flavors are incredible! 
9315 3 Had Beef noodle soup and deep fried pork rice. Both were good. The parking area in the plaza can get hectic. Go early at dinner time. 
9316 4 It's like a board and tabletop and card-gamer's heaven. The board game area- OMG. It's amazing! We spent almost 4 hours just browsing all they had to offer. We love it! :) 
9317 0 很失望，广告发了很多但是东西都不入味，感觉不像炒的，是不是东西就煮了一下然后倒点酱汁上去就完了。重点是我们点了3磅虾外带店家只给了1磅。回家后发现了打电话回去居然要我们再开会去拿，而且一直强调自己order的没问题。。。也是醉了好么 
9318 4 They cut great hair and are always focused on their craft! Cool gals and very customer service oriented. My business partner loved his haircut after he went today, telling me that he was very impressed. I will be taking my girl friend for nails soon!:) 
9319 4 Visiting from Los Angeles and came here with a friend since The Matador came highly recommended. Great food and drinks! Really liked the tortilla soup, black bean dip and founder's margarita. Employee named Angel was helpful and friendly! Server was great and attentive. 
9320 4 Amazing and best latte in Austin--half moon latte=delight! This is seriously the best coffee place in town. Woodfired coffee is second to none. Sometimes it can be a bit stuffy inside, but makes for a cozy south Austin atmosphere. 
9321 4 This is an excellent place to go after church for some delicious plantains, rice and beans, and meat of choice. I got the Cuban coffee one time and, not knowing what to expect, was pleasantly surprised with how tasty it is. It's casual and laid-back, a good place to chat. 
9322 2 Bun tom ga nuong. Meh Vietnamese food. The nuoc mam is so diluted, but the meat is seasoned fine 
9323 0 Just stopping for dinner waited an hour then skipped over not sure the reason why bad service could be an issue or maybe it's our color 
9324 2 Really nice food but service was incredibly slow. Came in with an hour to go before I had to leave and didn't get anything until 45 minutes after I came in. Really nice people though, and the food seemed very nice. I'm sure it will get better on speed... hopefully! 
9325 4 I used to live in Mexico and so I like authentic Mexican food. I love this place, especially the pastor, which is pork and pineapple. Awesome! And the fresh corn tortillas are wonderful! 
9326 4 We've now been back close to a dozen times (after moving to the neighborhood last year). Why? Margaritas are solid. Food is interesting & solid. Can often get in when the other 28th St hot-spots are packed. It's just solidly solid and it's turned into one of our spots! 
9327 4 My second time here and I enjoyed both meals. I had the fish tacos once and the bacon chicken club burrito. They were both really fresh and flavorful. The have a huge selection of hot sauces that you can pick from. It's definitely worth checking it out. 
9328 3 One of the best vegetable phos we've tasted hands down. The broth is a beautiful symphony of finely orchestrated spices and pairs well with the hand pulled chewy noodles. I would stir clear of the dan dan noodles (). 
9329 4 Must get the wontons!! Had a great amount of wontons and bok choy. The broth is also superb. Need to visit here every time I come to Portland. The staff is also very nice. 
9330 4 This was our first time at Egg Harbor. What a great place. Super menu, awesome service and free parking. You can't go wrong. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked great. The servers were the most attentive we have had in a long time. Keep up the good work! 
9331 4 Best Thai food ever!!! Tried dragon noodle, calamari, and crab lagoon!!!! Staff was very nice and food was good. Green tea smoothie was awesome! !!!!! Must try!! 
9332 4 This is my go to place for music. Great food. Good service. Definitely need to check out for happy hour drinks as well. Nice outdoors area. Reasonable prices. 
9333 1 Was craving wings so we ordered from this place as it is conveniently right down the street. Cajun, hot and lemon pepper. Man, these are the SALTIEST wings ive ever had. Im full since i had to kill two bottled waters to rehydrate. 
9334 1 There are several factors in my 2 star review. 1. Theater is next toy house and plays a lot of 3D movies - 5 2. No refill on a $6 cup of soda - 0 3. No recycling of any kind - 0 
9335 3 Waitress Gillian was great! Awesome potato heads, awesome happy hour prices! Very cute place! 
9336 4 Beer and board games galore. Plus original nintendo on a big projector. Gets super busy on Friday nights/Saturday afternoons-evenings. Try early Saturday or Sunday! 
9337 4 I really enjoyed the coffee here. On a caffeine-fueled weekend trip to Portland I tried to visit as many of the coffee places as I could, and this was by far the best. Good pastries too. 
9338 4 Love this place! I've been here every morning for the past week. They make breakfast bowls to order and their food is so fresh and good. Lunch is legit too! I'm officially a regular! 
9339 4 Great atmosphere!! Food is delicious!! Grapes hanging from the ceiling are totally real! Defiantly coming back for more!! 
9340 4 Vibe teeters on being pretentious but the staff is warm and welcoming. The food, baked goods, and coffee are as good as it gets, definitley worth checking out. Little pricey but quality matches, so not pricey just a different tier of cafe 
9341 2 Good had no flavor. I added plenty salsa and cilantro It didn't fill me up either. My food got to my table before I even sat down. I was getting my soda and salsa and the lady said here's your food. Less than 2 mins after I ordered. 
9342 3 Glad to have a banh mi shop close to home. So far I've had the lemongrass chicken which was good, the meatball (not great) and BBQ Pork which was quite good. Nice baguette, good veggies. Good green tea bubble tea, although a little on the watery side (consistency not flavor). 
9343 4 I agree with the other reviews here. I love shawarma and the wrap I had here was one of the best ever. I haven't seen him at Robson and Hornby for a few weeks now and my shawarma cravings neeeeed satisfaction.... Has he moved? 
9344 4 First time customer. Falafel and gyro were awesome. Will definitely be back. Very reasonable prices too!! 
9345 4 Nice Starbucks in a great location. Within walking distance from the Salem Inn. Plenty of parking. 
9346 3 Best buffet is south Austin. Good selection of Chinese as well as Korean food. Many more light dishes than traditional Chinese buffets. 
9347 4 Really good! First timer!- Garlic wings were great fresh and didn't taste like old oil - I got the grouper sliders nice and spicy flaky and fresh!- will come back- this place is packed for a reason. Happy camper 
9348 4 Perfect place for breakfast. Beautifully presented, locally sourced ingredients, and knowledgeable service. Any place that offers mini waffles for dessert, is a winner in my books! 
9349 0 Stayed at Rosen Centre for 2 nights in Feb 18. Horrible experience. Tried to extend my check-out time by only 1 hour because traveling with 2 small kids and we needed some more time to pack up. Was denied by mgmt. Food not that good either. 
9350 3 Chips, guac, salsa and queso were meh. Southern tacos were good. Our server, Naia was amazing and all the staff was wonderful. We even got a free dessert! I probably won't be back, but I had a fun night with the love of my life. 
9351 3 We enjoyed our stay here. Room came with a sink, small fridge and microwave. Bed was very soft to the point you nearly sunk into it. We suggested that room was probably due for a new matress. Otherwise clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly. I'd recommend it. 
9352 3 My wife and I spent a great afternoon at B&G's and tried a wide number of items on the menu. My favorite oysters were the Bristol Bay but I also tried the Island Creek and Conway Royale. 
9353 2 Yea it's pretty good. Best fried chicken I've had in Austin so that's something. Had a to go order for two breasts and a wing, only got one breast... for $15 that's pretty disappointing. Check your to go orders people. 
9354 3 I am a big fan of this place. I've been going to Cappy's for almost 10 years now. There menu is cheap, they are open late, the have great food and great workers. You definitely have to try their Chicken Cutlet with the works. One of my favorites! 
9355 2 Airport cafe. Not bad overall for a cafe in an airport- clean and well stocked with tasty looking food items. Good help got me my order quickly and on my way just as fast - nothing spectacular but decent overall. Worth a shot if in this terminal! 
9356 0 Referred here to have wisdom teeth extracted. I have called the office 9 times today, a Tuesday, only to receive an answering machine each time. We will be looking elsewhere for care. I have heard amazing things about this practice. I wish we could have experienced the same. 
9357 3 Hi guys, Here at BKP writing from the lobby and all I can say is these guys understand portion size. I ordered 2 slices of pepperoni & mushroom pizza and got enough to feed 500. Reasonable prices and carry Aquafina bottled water. 
9358 3 The two locations serve only four different sandwiches. Menus change daily. It's basic and casual, turning out high quality meat sandwiches.The porchetta sandwich is a must. Opening a store in Seattle soon, which makes me happy. The meat hook toilet paper holders in the bathroom is a nice touch. 
9359 4 Love this venue! The food was great. The two bands were absolutely amazing. Our server Aldo was great! Quick service and checked in us often. I will be back. 
9360 3 Really cozy place and the person working was so nice. Not sure if he was the owner or not but either way he was nice! 
9361 4 Lobster tacos to die for!!!! Best bolognase!!! Oh ya!!!!! Matt and Todd are great!!! 
9362 2 Good food. I love the atmosphere. Awesome location. You can sit out side with a roof on the sidewalk 
9363 4 Food is always delicious! I would also highly recommend the brunch and the bloody Mary's! 
9364 1 Meh. Everything tasted the same. 3 types of curry (Beef meatballs, chicken, paneer) were all in similar tomato base. Not what I'd call good Indian food. 
9365 1 Food was decent. Service was very poor. Ordered egg rolls that never came out but they appears on the bill. Benefit of doubt, they were "busy." Will not be returning anytime soon. 
9366 2 A place to get alcohol. A few sales here and there to keep me coming back. What I enjoy are wine and whiskey tasting events they hold at their stores. 
9367 4 Ideal for walking, jogging, bicycling, doggie lovers, etc. Once around is about 2mi. Parking is free for Cambridge residents. This is a very tranquil and peaceful place. 
9368 0 Long wait, very slow service, overpriced bad food. Definitely not worth it, wouldn't come back. 
9369 4 A super nice guy quickly fixed my silver ring that I bent out of shape while gardening. I'd recommend them and it's convenient to stop by while at the Clackamas Mall. 
9370 2 Not what I was expecting, so the third star is for the benefit of my doubt. The burrito was tasty; think Chipotle but not overly cilantro'd. The ambience was meh, and the lack of beer was distressing. Hopefully when the beer is actually present, I'll find everything else better. 
9371 3 I'm a big fan of the mussels appetizer, & the Scallop Risotto. Others at my table loved the beet salad & meatloaf. Such a great neighborhood restaurant! 
9372 4 The best tacos ever and the service is amazing! I dined alone but felt that I was looked after by the staff as they continued to check on me. 
9373 2 Just had drinks here, great beer selection. This would be a great place to come and watch football on Sundays or any other big sporting event. 
9374 2 It may not be nearly as popular or offer as many services as its neighbor in Allston, but if you want a clean car it will only cost you $8. They usually don't have a wait and you'll be crusing 'round Brighton in your clean car in a jiff. 
9375 3 It was a great experience. They didn't have the car I ordered but for a minimum price I was upgraded to a bigger car. It worked out great. We will surely use Ace rental in the future. 
9376 2 The price is fair, decoration is cute, and service is fast. However, the food and drinks aren't very outstanding, but it's a nice place to chill and hang out with friends. 
9377 4 AMAZING! We were just passing through town and stumbled across this jewel. The owner is extremely friendly and helpful. We had the egg rolls and fish tacos which were both fabulous!!! I would drive out of my way to have this authentic Hawaiian food again!! 
9378 4 THE BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT EVER... Went there tonight and it was a great choice, great food, best margarita, service is an A+, manager is very friendly and attentions. Live "mariachi band"... Simply the BEST!!! Highly recommended!!! My wife and kids loved it, We will certainly go back. 
9379 4 They did an amazing job keeping the classic Smokey's vibe! Amazing pizza and the nicest staff in town! Oh and the Jo-Jo's......gotta go, time to call in another order! 
9380 3 This place is fantastic. Great outdoor seating, excellent drinks and what I would say is the best Pain Killer in town! The food is yummy... Try the dirty fries... How can something sooo bad be sooo good! 
9381 2 It's alright. We went after the club in Boston. Price is more expensive than nyc. The person got our orders wrong. One of the rice didn't come with pita bread and the other one didn't come with veggie..... Prob just gonna get it from nyc.. 
9382 3 I was craving dumpling and I thought the were pretty scrumptious the dough was pretty thin and they didn't stick together too much, but I had the pork leek dumplings and I was super satisfied! 
9383 3 yummy mezcal drink was made to my specs, since they didn't have it on the menu. was very tasty - nice bartender =) 
9384 3 Amazing experience!! Only complaint is it wasn't long enough ... took family from out of town and they couldn't stop talking about how great it was :) 
9385 4 LOOOOVE Barcelona! I've been there twice now and each time had an excellent experience with both the staff and the food. It really is top notch tapas and totally worth the higher pricing. You won't be disappointed 
9386 3 Beer was ok. Only tried the couch and Lou a cult both were decent. The steak nacho were really good though small. Good enough for an appetizer though for 2 
9387 4 Barbican Hen is our 'go to' place for breakfast when we have out of town guests, or just want to treat ourselves. The food is imaginative and wonderful, but I think the service really makes this cafe special. 
9388 4 My family and I love this place! The fish tacos are fabulous as is the sushi. Always great service whether lunch or dinner time. Highly recommend 
9389 0 Love the food but they have kept us waiting over an hour past our reservation the last few times we have come. Yes you are popular but you need to manage your limited tables better. 
9390 3 Too much to choose from!! Breakfast is really good here!! Stairs have to go through the back if disable!! Then u encounter stairs in this place!! But food yes if u just want to get stuffed!! 
9391 3 A fun, donation-based tour ($2 suggested) that takes about an hour. Informative on beer processing and tasting. You get to try 3 generous samples. We had the lager, Oktoberfest, and double black (only available in the brewery). 
9392 3 Homemade pasta, great arrabiatta sauce. The tiramisu was fantastic. Nice ambiance, and the staff was wonderful. Would go back again. 
9393 0 Every person except two who work at the pharmacy is completely incompetent. I have ran out of essential prescriptions with no notification that I was running out. My doctor and all other health professionals that I spoke to said to transfer my prescription because of their in professionalism. 
9394 1 Pretty good egg roll. Egg drop soup tasted good but was so oddly thick. Cashew chicken and chicken w broccoli both tasted almost exactly like how I remember lean cuisine tasting. The quest continues. 
9395 2 Yummy, cheap, great hungover food. Inside is very small - but they play great music. I've been here a few times and would go back again - as long as you aren't looking for anything amazing. It's a cute little diner. 
9396 3 Awesome food! Not very authentic, but still extremely delicious. Go for the lamb tibs and make sure to use injera as your utensil. 
9397 4 Best Indian food in Austin! Excellent food at good prices. Many authentic choices I love this place, I come here every time I am in Austin. Highly recommended but be careful, hot is hot. :-). Don't miss the eggs, shrimp, etc. so many great dishes 
9398 2 I wasn't really impressed. The food wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked and it was a little too pricey for its quality. Nice environment though. 
9399 3 Onion rings are not greasy, crisp, but not sure if they are homemade. Either way they were tasty. The polish looks great! Tomato, onion, peppers, cucumber, relish, on poppy seed roll. Pickle on side. It tasted even better than it looked! The sausage isn't overcooked, not too shabby. 
9400 4 This place was my home for waaay too long, and I'll miss it. 
9401 3 The place is very popular and has a great deal of traffic. I didn't have any problems since there's plenty of people helping out, including directing traffic. Fire pit was raging and had a merry gathering. Plenty of trees. Lovely place. 
9402 3 They have good food and nice service. They provide unique food. However the amount of food is not awesome. You might end up eating 2 dishes for each person. Parking is a little bit of problem as only street parking is available. So try avoid Saturday night. 
9403 2 This place used to great....now it is a little less than average. The service was extremely slow. It took more than an hour and a half to get served. They ought to rename this and call it " very slow and below average sushi" :( 
9404 4 dear phara, your restaurant is my favorite place to eat. awesome awesome awesome. :) 
9405 2 Just had brunch here today. They have work to do. Service was slow in both taking our order and getting our food. Food was just OK. What we didn't like were the number of flies hovering around our table. Ugh!!! 
9406 4 The location of the Taj Boston is the best. With close proximity to Boston Commons as well as shopping and restaurants, we'll definitely consider the Taj for our next trip to Boston. Not to mention the amenities. 
9407 3 The raw octopus is much better than I thought, and the salmon belly is a great meal for people to eat at night and not gain weight 
9408 4 I eat here all the time and its amazingly consistent and well prepared. In all fairness I had really given up on Chinese food until I reluctantly tried this place, and boy am I glad I did. The food is really amazing. 
9409 3 Free wireless, tasty drinks and desserts, cute barista w/Mark Ryden tat, patrons who bend over directly in front of you to inspect the pastry case thus giving you an onslaught of rear views. What's not to like? 
9410 2 UPDATE! Nothing's coming. 
9411 4 Use this location for my frequent business trip and personal travel. Staff is always super friendly. The shuttle service is quick and easy. 
9412 2 My first time here and the service was absolutely fantastic. The food, not so much. I got the fajita burrito with beef and the beef was very bland and slimy. I'd be willing to give the food another chance if for nothing more than phenomenal service I received. 
9413 4 Outstanding!!!! The lunch buffet is amazing and the price really cannot be beat. We purchased 10lbs of Picanha for grilling and received short class on preparation and seasoning. They really go above and beyond for customer service. 
9414 4 On a road trip from Boston to Florida, we are out many times. The family universally agreed this was their favorite. 
9415 1 Third time here and the food needs more seasoning The new place looks amazing and the food looks very good But it has no salt or flavor The meats are ok But if you're paying that amount of money they need to seasoned better the customer service was good 
9416 3 Very tasty crust. Thin, chewy, warm and perfect. Looking forward to going back for another round. 
9417 3 I went to Sushi Factory on Christmas for their sushi buffet. The restaurant is clean and sitting is comfortable. The sushi was good and the price was right for $22 per person. I think it's worth a try. 
9418 4 The snowcrab was amazing! I went there twice during my vacation to have the snowcrab and I wish I had made it back there more times. The service was very friendly and overall experience was good. 
9419 4 Tastey Tastey Treat. Anybody diggin the talking food tickets? "Tu comida esta lista"- ready to be Scarffed down with garlickinsauce 
9420 0 Ordered shrimp scampi takeout - tiny flavorless shrimp - angel hair pasta stuck in clumps - minimal sauce for $17.00 - very disappointed - 
9421 3 It's free. It's relatively clean. It appeared that the kids that were there were basically trying to find a place to smoke... and they need to work on their 'sneakiness' skills. Dog friendly. Volleyball court, basketball court, field, grills... all in all a decent park. 
9422 4 One of my favourite restaurants in Vancouver. It's tiny, so be prepared to wait for a table. But the burrata (cheese) and prosciutto alone are worth the wait. 
9423 4 You could probably pick any donut in the house and not be disappointed. On top of that, the coffee is off the chain! And to top it all off, the staff is among the nicest in Portland. 5 stars! 
9424 4 Wow! Really special food. I will write more later - the flavors and combinations were unusual, delightful, unexpected and most importantly delicious. Service was too notch, enthusiastic knowledgeable and friendly. Quiet and sophisticate d atmosphere. Great. Desserts incredible. 
9425 4 As a native of the New Orleans area, I can tell you that this food is legit! It is delicious and amazing. crowded, but charming. Their biscuits are out of this world as is their home made jam. 
9426 2 Not bad, very fresh, cheap and fast. Can't say it is the best but definatley not the worst. Fairly enjoyable for a quick lunch. 
9427 2 Dunno why nobody is mentioning the live music this place has. It's usually good. It's worth just having a beer and listening to the band. You can also smoke. I've never eaten there, being poor :) and working till late so I have no comment on the food. 
9428 3 Great shop with wide selection of higher end brands. Ann Marie did a fantastic job for both my makeup trial and wedding day. I didn't feel obligated to buy everything she used, but certainly splurged on the lip liner and lip color. Prices are typical for the area. 
9429 4 awesome family own business with everything you need ice cold beer on tap with Growlers food Munchies gas and post office 
9430 4 Another little neighborhood bar my boyfriend and I frequent. They have great snacks, especially during happy hour. Last time I went I got a Dark n Stormy which was pretty tasty. They use a ginger liqueur which makes all the difference. They also have a nice lil patio! 
9431 4 I showed up an hour early for my service appointment. Super friendly people said no problem and took care of my car. Bought my car here and I always get it serviced here because of this. Plus that cookie at the end 
9432 4 This is my favorite breakfast place in Boston the service is great the food is great and the owner GEORGE is awesome my favorite on the menu is the savory Benedict and the homemade corn beef hash is the best in the city 
9433 1 Nice and crispy outside but since you start eating it there no flavor inside and is not even cook right 
9434 1 Very disappointed with our dinner tonight. Our salmon was raw inside. We weren't treated too well which seemed to be directly related to us not spending money on drinks. We won't be back. 
9435 4 Does anyone know why they closed or if they are relocating? I'm heartbroken, when I came to get my crepe today and seeing they were closed! 
9436 3 Update - I was informed after this post that there were some major staffing changes after my first visit, so it was probably an anomaly. Looking forward to my next visit to see if third time's the charm! 
9437 4 One of the best places to eat food! Very high energy environment, and exceptional appetizer selections. Extremely high quality!! 
9438 3 Frito Pie with beans / brisket was great - big chunks of tender beef. Enjoyed the variety of BBQ sauces and fixings they offer. 
9439 3 Hot pot. This place is bigger than it used to be and the menu offering changed and it is not quite as good and more of set menu. At least you don't have to wait. 
9440 3 Amazing service. She really took care of how I wanted to shape my eyebrows and it was over by the time i could register the pain! Lol I would definitely recommend this place for a painless eyebrow threading experience ! 
9441 3 I went here yesterday for a spur of the moment pedicure, I got Mary and she was a wonderfully pleasant woman! She was the perfect balance between chatty and allowing me just to relax. She did a great job! I would go back! 
9442 4 The "special French Dip" is to die for! Im a total French Dip junkie, and this badboy takes the cake! The fries are pretty fantastic too. This place is total dive bar fabulous. 
9443 3 The happy hour is great, they also have appetizers included. Even when the restaurant is really busy, the costumer service is outstanding. I would definitely recommend this place. ( just for the happy hour) 
9444 2 Not a bad venue for a band. Really small setting, so you will be very close to the action. Im' not sure how many big bands play here, but you'll get plenty of local and small bands making their rounds here. 
9445 4 One of the two best food trucks in town, for my money. Excellent falafel, piping hot, with great sauces and a smile. 
9446 1 Two stars for rude, unwelcoming staff. I appreciated the food. It was beautiful, curious, and incredibly delicious. But a $300 experience is easily ruined when every person that interacts with you makes you want to retort, "do you even want me here or should I just leave now?" 
9447 3 Weekend brunch is awesome, best in Boston. $25 per person is high but kids are free and the seating is relaxing and quite. Nice to enjoy an extra coffee with a second helping of eggs. 
9448 4 The name says it all. This place makes amazing affogato and espresso. Do yourself a favor and check this place out. Very cozy / rustic feel with large wooden picnic tables outside. Love it! Also you can order Eugene roasted coffee from around the world. 
9449 4 Delicious craft beers brewed right on location. Friendly atmosphere as well. Go for a Sticky Foot Pale Ale, you won't be dissapointed. 
9450 4 this place rocks, good food, good friendly service. Mate is the best tea out there. 
9451 1 So bad. I don't where to start. How can Mexican food be that bad? Service is great but everything else so bad. Casa de matador is right down the street if u want to over pay for crappy Mexican food... At least they have atmosphere. 
9452 4 There isn't much bad you can say when practically everything on the menu was delicious. Noteworthy items...arros negre, lamb skewer, and papas bravas. Service was fantastic as well...this is definitely worth a second trip! 
9453 2 Wasn't very impressed with my latte or the speed or quality of service. Plus is that there are a lot of comfier wing back chairs but even those had holes in them and were falling apart. 
9454 2 The lamb with cumin was ok, not the best I have ever had. Also not very impressed by their cold dishes. The two dishes I would recommend are dry fried beef and dry fried chilly chicken. The beef especially worth trying. 
9455 3 Completely satisfied with the service. Called and got pricing estimate over the phone and service within the days. I was informed via text each step of the way, and billing was painless. I will be a return customer. 
9456 4 Only tried the bouldering section, but fun routes and different styles of climbing available. Would recommend to any level of climber! 
9457 4 Lambert's is great for grabbing a quick lunch or stocking up on groceries for the week. Their deli and salad bar are both unbelievably good. Everything is vibrantly fresh and the staff is extremely helpful. 
9458 3 An early Tuesday dinner was a joy. Food and service were standout. The view can't be beat. This is worth the drive and will stay on our list of restaurants to revisit. 
9459 4 My favorite go to right around the block from my apartment! Food is great especially the french fries. Jason who usually answers the phone is amazing so funny and personable. They make sure to have your food ready in a timely fashion and have great combos! 
9460 4 Love we found this spot shortly after moving to Lake Nona. A place the whole family enjoys! Just wish they started open all day!! 
9461 0 Stop calling and snail-mailing and offering me the paper. 
9462 4 Eric from East Austin Succulents landscaped the front of my house and did an excellent job! I've already talked to him about my next project around my pond in the back yard. So glad to have found him! 
9463 4 By far the BEST Italian Food since moving to Austin 12 years ago. Priced RIGHT, GREAT Food, Nice Atmosphere Extremely Enjoyable 
9464 1 Nothing spectacular. Tasteless. Maybe that's a bit too healthy? Even the smoothie with banana (which usually adds to the sweetness) was on the tasteless side. 
9465 0 I didn't feel safe here as a solo woman traveler. 
9466 2 Very average. My wife's Cuban sandwich had very little extras on it. My chicken fingers were OK but there was a nice selection of sauces to help. Good service and the food was quick, but overall the food was just average. 
9467 4 Creme brûlée donut-seriously orgasmic. If a donut could be life changing, this is it. Fab staff, great vibe. Just come! 
9468 2 Was ok. Had a living social coupon so thought we would give it a try. The chorizo was good but a little oily. The home made bread was great. Stay away from the octopus. Too slimy. Clams in tomato sauce was above average 
9469 1 Waited over 45min and being from Cali I expected more from this place. Sides were very bland. Ribs were not the best. However the peach cobbler was very good. 
9470 4 Professional, clean and convenient place in Coolidge Corner. They have 12 wax package which is definitely a good deal 
9471 1 Friendly service, but the nachos were medicore, piled too high instead of wide, and very soggy and inedible as a result. The atmosphere is fun, and I would definitely come here for drinks. Food? Not so much ... 
9472 4 Kevin was the best! He was there on time and was fast, professional and a nice guy! Will use again in the future! 
9473 4 Very quick and prompt service. Food was excellent! Worth the trip and the price. I will be back very soon. 
9474 4 Fantastic meal and service before going to see a musical at the Fox. Will definitely come again. 
9475 4 Love mojo crepes so glad they added a cart over here! They different flavors are super tasty and you can choose to make your own if you wanna go down that route. Be sure to stop by if your in the mood for something sweet. 
9476 4 Staff are very helpful, the unit works for our needs, location is convenient and fairly easy to get to for me. Not sure what else there is to say! 
9477 3 Quite a decent place to stay. Staff was friendly and breakfast was not bad. I read about the negative reviews on cleanliness, but my room was quite alright. The only concern is that it's a huge place with confusing hallways, also the parking places need maintenance. 
9478 4 Love their Gyro price is awesome and now they serve meal combo with fries - kids love it too 
9479 1 Late night goooood. Reminds me of pizza places back in NYC, although slightly less seedy if you can believe that. Thin crust that is probably better when drunk than sober...but good nonetheless. 'Nuff said. 
9480 2 The chicken was great; crispy, moist and flavorful. Waiting 35 minutes for a two piece snack though was ridiculous. They have a few kinks to work out. 
9481 4 Great ambient. Food is perfect, one of the best steaks I ever had. The only issue is that it's a bit expensive. 
9482 2 To their credit Kimberly called my wife today to deduct $50 from the bill. Her rationale was that she wants happy customers. I commend their behavior and appreciate this. 
9483 4 Excellent service and most delicious food! Everything we ordered was fantastic and extremely flavorful! Enjoyed the decor as well. The little town of Winter Park is a great little get-a-way spot with awesome shops, restaurants, museums and boat tours of the beautiful lakes. 
9484 4 Curried Mussels are just amazing!!!! Don't leave the restaurant without trying one. Great manager on that Saturday evening! We had little issues then he fixed it right away for us. 
9485 3 This place has been my go-to for years. Affordable, filling, decent quality, best bang for your buck. Service is subpar but you get what you pay for. Best quality/price/portion ratio when it comes to sushi in Vancouver. You can easily get super full off $15. 
9486 2 Watershed announced today that they will be closing August 6th. Sad news for Decatur. 
9487 2 Pros - Affordable Location Clean Rooms Friendly Staff Free Wi Fi. Cons - Construction. Hotel is going through a remodel. Parking Lot. Beds in Queen Suite looked more like a Full. Elevator If I knew the construction was complete, I would probably stay here again. 
9488 4 Great customer service. They didn't push me to spend more or buy add ones. I got next day delivery even though I bought the mattress right before closing and they could have said no. I'm very happy with my bed and how they treated me. 
9489 4 Place is absolutely beautiful. Extremely pricey but we stayed using a DVC membership. Staff is extremely helpful and the location is spotless. We had a three bedroom suite with a view of the lake and it was amazing. 
9490 4 Don fixed my wedding dress emergency (mystery black smudge appeared on the front) on EASTER SUNDAY in ONE HOUR and refused to let me pay him. 5 stars doesn't even begin to cover it. 
9491 3 Very unique place to eat. You can bring your dog, they have a amazing patio to sit on. Really nice cocktails and a decent amount of ever changing specials including soups. Service has been excellent every time I have been here. Bacon infused bloody marries are a must! 
9492 1 After moving back to the area from Phoenix, I was super excited to see Chuy's!!! Not the same. No lobster tacos, no bike night and meh service. I won't be back. 
9493 4 Great sushi house. Family owned, where ever sushi chef has his/her own special roll. Definitely hit this place up! A constant diner dive for me and this was my first trip! 
9494 4 Excellent food and drinks the Scallops are amazing and the spreads are seriously delicious. Great way to end 2017. 
9495 4 Great food. The staff is super friendly and helpful. We had a great time. They had live music that eve too. I will be back! 
9496 2 Awesome food...poor service. 
9497 4 great burgers and shakes, but long lines unless you go mid afternoon on weekday 
9498 4 This is a nice place love the atmosphere, the wine, passion fruit sangria, the flights...so far every time I visited Cooper's it was a pleasure and even joined their Club. 
9499 4 My go to sushi restaurant. Great sushi, great hibachi! I can always depend on the great quality of their food and great service! 
9500 4 Amazing food, amazing service, amazing staff and amazing management! Cozy environment and very clean restrooms. 
9501 3 great food very affordable been going for years Monday night special is steak night (love the pepper steak ) Tuesday night special is Burger night ( love the bacon cheese burger yummiest ) Wednesday night special is Slovakia night Thursday night special is Salmon Lee :-) 
9502 4 Mr Dooley's is just plain fun. Small but super comfortable interior, great staff, super nachos and bar food combined with great music makes Mr. Dooley's well worth the walk from downtown. What more can you ask for? Get away from the overpriced over crowded Faneuil Hall bars and head here. 
9503 3 We've rented a car from this location twice now. Both times they've picked us up, the employees have been friendly and professional, and we've gotten in and out quickly. We will definitely continue using this branch. 
9504 0 Have a hotspot there, everything going well, 5 hours later getting very bad diarrhea..... Definitely something not clean.... 
9505 4 Love the blue and gold decor, the menu and the service. Our waiter was superb, he even offered to serve us the next time we dined there. Portions were large and delicious. Very romantic for a date, and appropriate for a business dinner. 
9506 3 I My wife and I checked this place out over the weekend. Nice and roomy inside and pretty new. I had the Italian sub and she had Classic Reuben and they both were very good as were the fry's. Cold beer and good service. we will be back. 
9507 4 Great place. Tracy was awsome! She knows whats shes doing. She did the back fills on my nails and it looks very natural. Smooth finish & Perfect shape. Looks like my real nails. Place gets busy at times so setting an appointment is prefered. Prices are affordable. 
9508 4 Great atmosphere with great staff! The Agua fresca gets your taste buds hopping while you munch on some great salsa. Go for the JuJu breakfast if you are heath conscious or a vegetarian. Breakfast tacos are dynamite if you want to make it your way. 
9509 4 A terrific store! Very helpful staff and I was in a rush. They expeditiously helped me and I was grateful! 
9510 4 Ordered pick-up from here and have also eaten in the restaurant. Service and food quality is always impeccable. I definitely plan to become a regular. 
9511 0 The slowest service. I was visting the area for the second year in a row and had the same slow service. The barerista looked like see was day dreaming the whole time and acted like it was the first time she had seen coffee. 
9512 3 Bibb salad is considered one of the best things I've ever eaten. Pizza is not far off. Sangria was delicious. 
9513 4 Great food. fresh and wide assortment. Good sushi too. We visit this buffet when we are in town. Fast, good, and reasonable. 
9514 1 don't get why everyone thinks this place is so hot - atmosphere's lacking and they don't serve hard alcohol.... the people make the place, but honestly ther are fun people at better places too. 
9515 3 Great service. Clear communication and follow through. Hallelujah. My little car is running great. I just moved my business from another Toyota dealer/service provider (12 years) to Broadway - it's closer and much better. 
9516 4 The Tavern in Porter square is a great place! great on Tuesdays for 1/2 burger day and to watch sport events. The Tavern has great food, and adapting new menu's. All around great service by there staff, and the food never fails to be great!. 
9517 4 I mean come ON, If you were the kinda guy that Tim L is, you would be after the slurpees and the bus passes at this place too. 
9518 4 There must be a frozen yogurt genius in the kitchen behind the self-service dispensers. Every one of the dozen choices have been mixed on premises, and they are terrific. Off the bike trail, and easy to miss if you didn't know. Now you know. 
9519 4 This place is great! Friendly, attentive staff, clean, contemporary atmosphere, good food, nice drink selection and a patio. All bases covered! 
9520 3 Excellent place to eat dinner. When I come to Columbus, I have to have bd's! The food is create your own bowl with meat, veggies, and spices. It's usually busy but little wait time. The only draw back of this place... It's noisy. 
9521 4 Definitely worth going to if you're in the Orlando area. Pollo de la casa was delicious and the margaritas were large. Prices are super reasonable. Me and my family really enjoyed it. 
9522 0 A man came out to give us an estimate, looked around, said he would email us an estimate and we never heard from him again. Thumbs down. 
9523 4 Ok, this place is great..amazing fresh seafood, the service tremendous (OK, Rebecca might be the best wait person ever!) , and the Oysters......amazing selection, and quality. Expensive and highly recommended! 
9524 3 We ordered 1) Shanghinese noodle 2) Pork dumplings 3) Vegetarian dumplings 4) Mushroom and bamboo 5) Tofu and vegetables Delicious and great value! 
9525 3 Best frozen yogurt In town always has great flavors , great prices and amazing service , come out to Hilliard to check out Yo Lish 
9526 3 It's a New England Deli. So ah everything a deli has to offer. Food is great. Roast Beef as good as or even better then kelly's. 
9527 0 We waited over an hour for our food, which is itself frustrating, but their customer service was bad. Not once did our waitress check in or bother to communicate the ETA of our order. My friend was so mad we nearly walked out. Worst ihop experience ever. 
9528 4 Been going here for a while. One of the best thai restaurant in greater boston. From pad thai to ginger chicken rice to fish, all have been great. But their tom yum soup can be a little too spicy.. 
9529 0 Went through the drive thru. No napkins, no straws, no receipt and cold fries. They need 3 windows. One to pay, one to get your food, and a third to get your order fixed. 
9530 3 It is located on the board walk. Our fist evening had no reservation but got a seat at the bar. The service & food was awesome. 
9531 0 Used to really like this place. But, New menu. :( Prices went up. :( Food stayed the same. Disappointed. Tiny Queso dip for $9.99. Crazy. Bad service. Taking this place off of my Mexican list. 
9532 2 Local coffee shop. Nothing particularly noteworthy. If you're in the area, a good shop for the expected selection, but not worth going out of the way. 
9533 2 It smells great from the outside, and it pretty divey inside. They need more outdoor seating. Our kids liked the pizza, and the gluten-free pizza was very good. 
9534 1 Ordered from foodler because it had a lot of decent reviews on there. I am not sure how... Pizza crust was reminiscent of a school cafeteria, spanakopita tasted weird, greek salad OK. Only reason for 2 and not 1 stars is the fairly low price tag. 
9535 2 The service was good but food was very mediocre, but taking in consideration it's a restaurant in UBC it taste better than most restaurants here 
9536 3 Korean food is always a bit expensive so that was to be expected. The tofu and beef soup was delicious, especially with an egg in it. My friend is a vegetarian and ordered the bibimbap combo and was delighted. Definitely recommend! 
9537 3 Generic Chinese food; 4/5 for what it is supposed to be. Big portions, cheap prices, free delivery to the hotel. It delivered pretty fast too. If you want typical American Chinese food fast and cheap, this is you place. 
9538 4 Wonderful service! Wonderful food! Vikram was there too saying hi and making sure everyone was enjoying their food. It was a great atmosphere and made for a really enjoyable dinner! 
9539 4 I've been here several times and I must say that the staff is very friendly and attentive. I also like the fact that the hotel works closely with different organizations to host events. It seems to be a very popular place for conferences. I would definitely recommend. 
9540 2 Nice for a small place to grab & go. Nothin g really made it stand out for me. I'm sure if I'll be coming back any time soon. 
9541 3 Typical Cuban place with some good Cuban dishes and good services 
9542 4 Great adventure to have in Boston Harbor. The trip was exhilarating and lots of fun! This was my second time going and its the best boat trip that you can take. 
9543 3 Quite expensive, but get the lobster roll. Service was ok. Make reservation if you don't want the long wait. 
9544 4 Diana is wonderful. As a professional bodyworker myself I am very picky and hesitant on who I let work on me. I was more than blown away with Diana's knowledge and skill set. Very good stuff. I'd highly recommend her!!! 
9545 3 Its all good!!! Plenty to chose from and lots of goodies.. Worth a visit for sure.. The veal parm sub is killer 
9546 4 Solid pizza by the slice option. Ate here with friends for lunch, and we were very pleased with the pizza. Great lunch specials (2 slices of cheese with a drink for $5). The pepperoni rolls ($1/roll) were quite yummy. 
9547 2 My husband and I had an anniversary dinner here. Nothing about the restaurant stood out. Atmosphere was a-typical. Service was quick and friendly. Food = over priced for quality. 
9548 3 Great selection, great customer service (for the most part.) I would have given 5 stars but I asked a question of an associate named "James" and I was given a dirty look and short answers, like I was troubling him. Everyone else was super friendly and considerate. 
9549 4 Very helpful!! Not a single thing broken!!! Highly recommend! 
9550 4 Really good! I like this place better than the other bubble tea place in the area (Bubble Queen), but the fact it is cash-only prevents me from going more regularly. 
9551 4 This place is unbelievably tasty. It's like eating Asian food while on MDMA. 
9552 4 Just got my nails done. This place is a hidden gem. They came out amazing. And the guy that did my nails was so nice. Sorry I don't remember his name. I'm definitely going back. Just amazing. 
9553 3 Fried pickles are magnificent! They are spears and enough for three people. Waiting on my chicken but I'm feeling pretty positive.... 
9554 2 Stopped here for a few drinks before dinner, there were some hits and misses and some ingredients that ran out pretty early in the evening. The appetizers were nicely done though. 
9555 4 When I want Cuban food this is where I go. The maduros are like dessert and the cafe con leche would rival Starbucks any day. The people are always friendly and the food comes out fast. 
9556 4 The food was served quickly, fresh, fresh, fresh!! The service was spot on. Sounds odd, but had the Smoked Beet Hash....it was awesome! The place was super busy, but the Wait Staff was on it. Table turned quickly and cleanly! Would stop again! 
9557 4 I finally found a orange chicken dish that is spicy enough!!! Great service, very fast, guaranteed I'll be back again! 
9558 4 never a let down awesome salads pizza subs and the owner is always pleasant 
9559 2 The food was pretty good, and the price was fair. We came in for breakfast, and enjoyed eggs Benedict and an omlette. Both were tasty, but the coffee was awful. All around decent experience and will most likely return. 
9560 0 Lousy club! And extremely overpriced for what you get - ceilings that leak continuously, equipment that's been broken for 6 months, nasty locker rooms, b*tchy staff. Given that it's inside the Sheraton Hotel one would think it'd be at least half-way decent! 
9561 4 Betsy did an amazing job on our house. She truly went above and beyond! I have never seen my bathrooms look so clean. She even did laundry! And she is just so nice and professional! I highly recommend you book with her. 
9562 0 Food was ok, customer service was terrible. I couldn't tell who was an employee and who was a customer with people going in and out of the kitchen and dining area (without washing their hands, gross). This place needs new management. 
9563 4 Just phenomenal. I always order from these guys. Speedy delivery, always hot! Great menu with just enough options. 
9564 4 Great place to go. Try the tacos. They also have a great selection of margaritas. Sort of a Mexican infusion style cuisine. Service was also very good. We sat at the bar because it was so busy.... 
9565 3 I live down the street from this place and go to it regularly. It's my go to in Waltham for pizza. Chicken bacon ranch is my favorite. Everything I've tried has been good. Pickup is usually only 15 minutes 
9566 4 Got a cake for my son for his graduation. It was delicious freshly made and the staff were very helpfull and gave me good advice. Thank tou guarinos for everything keep up the good work 
9567 0 This place sucked. I had a terrible mixed drink and when I wanted to leave, they said they couldn't close me out for under $10 with a credit card. Also, if you find hipsters as annoying as I do, this is not the place for you. 
9568 3 The selection is varied and well thought out. From Belgians to Imperial Porters, the selection is always fantastic. The staff is helpful and friendly. Keg pickups are handled efficiently as well. I primarily pick up and take beers out, not drink at the pub they have next door. 
9569 4 Yep--awesome. 3 new passports, with pictures, including a minor, done within 45 minutes. Bonus: Somehow, the photos came out awesome. This from the family with chronic resting bitch face and child with manic over-smile tendencies. Go here--just make sure you have everything you need and that you get there early. 
9570 4 Went and had a awesome waiter named Dj who served us with great customer service Food was also very good Highly recommended 
9571 4 I've been super happy with my treatment at WD. Great doctor (Nick), beautiful facility and good results. 
9572 1 Second visit, food was good but OVERPICED........this is Medford with a view of the Mystic River not the Boston Waterfront. Will not be returning. 
9573 3 Met friends for dinner. PROs Really delicious noodles. yummy sushi watching the noodles being made good prices CONs pretty loud 
9574 4 Best damn donuts I've had in years! The service was good, the person behind the counter was very courteous & quiet. The donut selection was out of control, I had so many to choose from & everything was reasonably priced. I highly recommend checking out this new establishment. 
9575 4 Awesome! Everything was great service was wonderful highly recommend I will be back. The steak was perfectly cooked the appetizers tasted incredible love the empanadas and the Mimosa was just great 
9576 4 Disney doesn't offer alot to us vegetarians, except some fruit and french fries. ick. But Yak and Yeti always does a very good job with customer service and oh SOO very good food selections. Its healthy and tasty! it is one of my looked forward to places at Animal Kingdom. 
9577 4 I love the HIIT class held here. The venue is also posh and fully equipped with all the amenities you would need to get ready for work (following a satisfying workout class ). Absolutely worth giving a try! 
9578 4 I always feel so comfortable and in good hands when I come here, they do a great job, tell me everything I want to know about how to care for my teeth and develop a plan to improve my oral health. Would highly recommend! 
9579 3 The bread is where it's at. I've only had breakfast here and it is good. Every time i go to Bexley i have breakfast here. That said i think their eggs tasted a little too powdery. Did i mention the bread was amazing. 
9580 4 サイダリーに数席のカウンターと机がひとつだけのバー。サイダー＝日本で言うシードル？クラフトサイダーがビールと並んでこれだけ浸透しているとは！12種類のサイダー、全種類の飲み比べセットを注文。ドライなものは結構アルコール度数もしっかりあって、それぞれ違う味わい。サイダー、奥深い！もっと色々飲んでみたい。 
9581 2 This place is alright. I used to love it but they've changed their menu and the food is pretty mediocre. I think I'll try other places before returning to this one. 
9582 1 Great location and atmosphere but what a disappointment. The menu is limited and the food quality is poor. Beer selections are limited to local brews, no national or intl. brands. 
9583 4 Staff is very friendly, food was really good. Try the Moroccan meat balls with eggs. It was great 
9584 4 Went back tonight.....chicken way better! Huge portion as before. Staff always always nice. The lady was happy to see me again so soon. 
9585 4 Extremely good seafood! Tons of choices. Atmosphere is really nice in Maldens a very cute and quaint town. 
9586 3 I this place! The New Make whiskey is my fave but do yourself a favor and order the flight and try them all. You won't be disappointed! The music on the patio outside provided the perfect setting to end a long hard week. I will definitely be returning soon! 
9587 4 Absolutely the best bubble tea in Vancouver. Not much other food, though. Open late, line moves fast. Closed in November usually. Recently renovated (i.e. less dingy). 
9588 3 Good straightforward breakfast. Fantastic coffee. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Some outdoor seating. I had two eggs with potatoes an toast ($4.95). My wife had the fried egg sandwich ($3.25). Both of us were happy. 
9589 3 My son said to make sure we ordered the bacon cheeseburger pizza and that's what we had. It was terrific! The deep dish crust was cooked to perfection! Had a "Nitwit" beer that complimented the pizza perfectly. BJs is a welcome addition to the Austin restaurant scene. 
9590 3 Outstanding selection of meats and salad bar. While not cheap, but it is worth the special Times. Next time I will skip the salad and get my fill on meat. 
9591 2 I think the coffee tastes great, but not $5.35 for a 12oz alternative milk latte - great. Prices are too steep but otherwise great taste and cool vibe. 
9592 3 all the essentials. you can probably find more options and lower prices elsewhere. convenience is convenience. quick no hassle higher end convenience. 
9593 0 Prices are too high for what you get. Asked for them to substitute my steamed rice for fried rice on my $15 dinner, and they said no. I would have to get a separate side of it. Also doesn't come with soup or egg roll. Small portions. 
9594 4 My wife and I dealt with Hubert Miller for a new pantry cabinet for our kitchen. Very pleased with the service and superb quality. Simply the best 
9595 2 nice food (bit more expensive than i thought it would be), friendly staff, fast service. 
9596 4 If I ever leave Vancouver I will dream of these delicious burritos. Johnny-O is pure ambrosia. Some of the staff are too cool for school, but that comes with the territory in SoMa. Highly recommended, even for the wicked decor! 
9597 0 Found a dead ant in my double bacon cheeseburger - was it better it was dead or cause for more worry? 
9598 0 Ordered to-go and my meal was given to another person while I was sitting there. Didn't ask anyone's name just handed my meal to another person. I'm literally sitting in the to-go booth waiting on my replacement food for the past twenty minutes. 
9599 0 NASTY, NASTY, NASTY Bathroom had hairs all over the place, extremely hot water in bath tub. Not a place i recommend. I would not be back. 
9600 0 This place is gross..the chicken in several of our dishes tasted freezer burned..and the rice was gross..how do you screw up rice..I am originally from San Francisco and I know Chinese food..this was horrible..I threw away $40 worth of food and made my family spaghetti instead..so bad.. 
9601 3 The margaritas were good, the food was good, the music wasn't to loud. However, since it is a Holiday weekend the server was over worked! Highly recommend. 
9602 4 Great coffee shop.love your coffee and tea.drive thru 4 to 6 days a week. Awesome people. 
9603 4 Although, the line is always long it is worth the wait. Relaxed friendly environment and great service. Fresh, clean eating!! The burger was delicious and the fries were even better! We will be back again but not when the line is 2 hours long!! 
9604 4 Greatest professional sports franchise ever! It doesn't get any better than the Boston Celtics. 17 Championships and counting! 
9605 4 Felt like a lost American tourist in the queue, but courteous service and delicious product! Gotta love a double-double! 
9606 2 The service was fantastic and the ambiance was cool, but the food was cold and average at best. Way over priced. 
9607 3 I'm never quite sure how this place is still open. I have never been in when the restaurant was even 1/3 full. But the food is good, and it is always quiet in there. Try the buffalo burger! 
9608 4 Depuis le 50ème étage, il y a une très belle vue à 360° sur la ville de Boston. De plus, les informations transmisses lors de l'observation de la ville sont très bien structurées et très éducatives. 
9609 4 Wonderful location, extremely polite and professional staff who also are warm and friendly. Very clean and comfortable. The outdoor seating areas are a bonus. This hotel is located in a thriving area and there's a generous offering of restaurants nearby. 
9610 1 well, its a classic, country style diner, and i can make everything on the menu at home, so why go out? but if you loooove corn beef hash like my boyfriend does, you may end up doing a happy food dance. 
9611 4 Cute restaurant with local feel. Really good sesame chicken. First time and will be back. Lots of food for the price, prob could split one entree for 2-4 people. Will be eating amazing leftovers for days. 
9612 0 Maybe it was off day but, after reading the reviews, I decided I needed a sweet fix. Very expensive, small selection. Brownie was overly sweet. Blueberry muffin was dry and actually bitter. Oh well. 
9613 4 Sweet Potato Tacos for lunch was wonderful and I am excited to try the burgers recommended by Katelyn.... a fabulous server that made the experience even more memorable. 
9614 3 A wonderful experience in service and food. We had a great waitress Erika who was wonderful. First time here. Used our groupon coupon and had the fried calamari which was delicious. Had the lobster pie with crabmeat stuffing. Very good. My husband had the sea scallops. Will definitely go back. 
9615 4 best turkish food ever , best service and great sweet 
9616 4 Today is my second time here. Service was fast and pleasant. Both times I ordered the Jive Turkey and Sweet Potato Fries. Yummy!! I'll be back to try the Spiked Milkshakes and Grub'ritas when I'm not with the Mini Me. 
9617 4 K&M has been great to my wife and I. They have always been honest with us about repairs and do quality work without charging an arm and a leg. Highly recommend them for your car troubles and servicing. 
9618 4 This place is awesome. Sit outside if the weather is good. Have some empanadas. Chilaquiles. The service is wonderful and the food is amazing. 
9619 4 8:30pm in 10:15pm out two large rooms 450sqf with almost 99% of dirt is gone for 80$ + tip thx 
9620 4 Best ramen in the NorthWest. Broth is amazing, eggs are perfect and the noodles were to die for. Every ramen joint is compared to this one. 
9621 3 This was a great place for Sunday brunch. No wait, outside seating was beautiful, the chicken and waffle Benedict was the tables favorite meal. I had the pesto and sundried tomato omelette which really hit the spot for me. 
9622 4 I love the waffle window. I hit this place up every time we are in the hood. I have a few ideas and wish they would hold waffle competitions more often. Big favorite is the Berry Bliss. 
9623 3 Caldo de res, (a hearty beef veg soup) and homemade tortillas. Then a Tejano trio set up. Lunch and live music FTW. 
9624 4 Absolutely wonderful meal here. The staff are very professional and courteous. Had the parmesan sole which was amazing. Lovely location with view of the river, and wonderful meal! 
9625 4 My wife and I had a great celebration dinner at Gusto's. Great food and service. Also finished with fresh sorbetta. Very refreshing. 
9626 3 Monday nights are $5 open gym nights from 9-11pm. GreatOpen floor with a spring floor any regular cheerleading floor. The gym is mostly open floor with little utilities. No bars, foam pit, not very many mats, and only one tumble track. Great gym and good crowd on Mondays. 
9627 4 Thank you for the beautiful work on my daughter's nails. This was a special treat for her birthday! Now my husband wants to come in for a massage. Very clean salon and nice people. 
9628 3 Great place. Quiet and just as advertised. Got lucky that it was free co-work day, but even had I paid the $15 for a day-pass, I would have been very pleased. Staff was friendly and the location quite convenient in downtown Orlando. I'll be back for sure! 
9629 3 Barcelos Surrey,B.C. Nando's should b shakin' in their boots... Awesome Peri-Peri sauce...simply the best version of this African /Portuguese style of fare. Such clean food too!GUILT FREE GOODNESS. You need to go... 'appy Noshin' Brianm Foodieatlarge.yelp.ca Fb Tumblr 
9630 4 I really love this place! Their calamariroll is the best menu for me!! The friendly service makes me happy alway:) 
9631 4 Such a fun place! Pierre, the manager, was incredibly nice and outgoing. Makes such a big difference in a restaurant setting. More restaurant managers should strive to be like Pierre. 
9632 0 Beyond terrible, no clue how they stay open with pizzas this bad and subs are awful as well. 
9633 2 My nail tech was constantly interrupted by the phone, other walk in customers and the just disappeared for a bit. I just wanted to get in and out. I think her work suffered due to distractions. Otherwise happy they were open on Memorial Day. 
9634 4 Michael offers great service for half of what other companies charge. I just recently had a new element installed in my stove. Sears wanted $289! Michael got the part and installed it for $129 with a year warranty! Amazing! CALL HIM! 
9635 2 My preferred Thai take out restaurant. The brown soyed noodles are very filling and the crazy noodles are crazy spicy with thai basil. 
9636 4 I just wanted to show how much I enjoyed Altang and Chicken Teriyaki there. All side dishes were authentic and delicious. Just look at the posted pictures. 
9637 3 Good relaxing area, coffee isn't at the level of other places like Starbucks. Subway is just a regular subway it's a little small though. Parkin lot has a few potholes 
9638 0 They messed up my order and when it was delivered I asked the cashier who told me to bad we are not going to fix it 
9639 1 Treacly. The beet dish, the drinks and the Brussel sprouts. More sugar than a family of 4 should consume in a month in those three items, my order. The server was sweet, too, but genuine. I left wanting potato chips for dessert, salt and vinegar. With extra salt. 
9640 4 Absolutely fantastic food (my first experience with Ethiopian coisine) in a very nice laid back place. 
9641 2 Strong staple in Austin. Have had lots of great good here over the years. Good food if you are into greasy stuff. Ordered potato crusted tilapia and it was a grease fest. I mean I knew it was fried but wow its overwhelmingly gross. Note to self: stick to salads!! 
9642 4 Best salad bar! The line can be long but it moves pretty quickly. The employees are constantly refilling veggies and cleaning up. Great quality and low price! 
9643 3 Great selection of frames, comparable pricing, and friendly helpful staff from the manager, Brian to his sales associates, Amy and Luis 
9644 4 GREAT salad w a ground beef patty on top WITH a over-easy egg on top of that! 
9645 3 Tableside guacamole is amazing! Regular margaritas are alright but the patron margaritas are great! 
9646 3 I used to get take out from here on some week nights. Really good chicken parm and fried cod. Huge & Hearty portions and very generous portions. Great burgers too. 
9647 2 Took some clients to Tucci's for a lunch. We had a nice private room, and the food was nice for a lunch. The service was excellent, and I'm excited to return and try more items on their menu. 
9648 4 Friendly staff and super tasty food! They always have my orders ready quickly when I call in for pick up. The hot and sour soup, broccoli in garlic sauce, and Singapore noodles are especially tasty! 
9649 0 I got a yelp account just to say this is the WORST thai food I have ever had. and a little over-priced. 
9650 0 Crappy staff attitude. Botched order. Shitty location. Won't be back. Staff all look like work release. 
9651 3 "This is the brand new Walmart in the new Goldenrod area, super clean, friendly and has everything you need and look for when you visit a Walmart, but with out the ghetto nes of many of the Walmart I've visited in the past. So definitely recommend it. 
9652 1 Not my favorite breakfast place. We love breakfast food and were very unhappy with the taste of food from this place. My husband and I tried 4 different things and none of it worked for us. Service wasn't friendly either. 
9653 0 They water down their alcohol. Food is always subpar and service is not to a high enough standard. They like to have nice looking staff, who are also incompetent. Too many other restaurants in this city to have to settle for Earls. 
9654 3 The atmosphere is great and I enjoy coming every Sunday with the group I swim for. Things that could be improved: it is a little pricy almost 7$ for a coffee and bagel sandwich, and the wait times for food get a little long if they are busy. 
9655 4 Delicious. Every time. We live in Miami and every time we come to the area we come by. We had the Bubba, Salmon, and Sunburst rolls. They were all well prepared, fresh, and tasty. I would suggest you give this place a try. You won't regret it! 
9656 3 Was here with my partner for a Sunday lunch. We aren't vegan but decided to pop in due to great reviews on yelp. We had a delicious meal, great value for money, and enjoyed superb service with a smile. Will definitely come back if we're in the area. 
9657 3 Sleepy, quiet, cheap. The collection doesn't move so fast. But whatever -- I've totally found things. I mean, where else are you finding Mavis Gallant and Eric Hobsbawm for a couple bucks a piece? Plus it's a neighborhood shop. And the money goes to Bryn Mawr's scholarship fund. 
9658 4 We have been to Barrel & Boar twice now and have enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere both times! It is a little pricy for BBQ but it is definitely worth it. Very yummy!! 
9659 1 Went there with a group of friends for the restaurant week. The food was good, not great, even if the portions were small. However, despite the numerous waiters, it was difficult to have them taking care of us. Clear disappointment on that front. 
9660 0 Chips and salsa was the highlight. Chimichanga had what tasted like velveeta cheese on top (trying to be queso). Came with white rice (odd for Mexican food). Water was so bad I brought bottled water from the car. Not recommended. 
9661 3 Shrimp and grits was really good. Not too heavy! The portions were generous. We also got the burger and it was tasty-not the best burger ever but decent. $3 shock top beer during happy hour was a plus. The staff were friendly and the chef checked in on us. 
9662 2 Nothing fancy -- just a decent, friendly neighborhood pizza joint. Has a full-bar but family-friendly. Nice patio seating in the heart of Oakhurst Village. 
9663 4 After personally greeting me as I entered the door, Christian made a delicious turkey club sandwich and hot, tasty shoestring fries to order. Amazing customer service made my entire day. I'll definitely be back:) Thank you!! 
9664 4 Love this place. The Korean short ribs, curries and rice dishes are delicious and authentic. Place is really clean and the cute gal behind the counter (I think she is one of the owners) is always friendly and happy to recommend a dish. 
9665 4 The salmon is an absolute must try! The food was very full of flavor and savor, and I am quite tempted to go back again tonight. The wait wasn't that bad either. Our server was very great and very attentive to our table. 
9666 1 The tacos are great, but the patio area is constantly filthy and thus swarming with flies. Having to swat away flies after each bite is quite unappealing. Clean up the patio area and I'll increase my rating. 
9667 4 Masters of mix. This place is appropriately priced, delicious, and FUN! Will be back very, very soon. And often. Beard envy is a thing... 
9668 4 Always good and at a great price. Been eating here for years. Service is great, food is great, Mojitos are great. Why not five stars I don't know. 
9669 4 This place is a local legend.. great salsiccia, stuffed peppers, parm, all the usual suspects. 
9670 4 For a fast food place, this has excellent food, good service, and great value. I ordered a three entree plate with orange chicken, chicken with kale, and teriyaki chicken, all very tasty and fed two people easily. 
9671 3 I love this place, always a treat when I go, and always a great experience when I leave. Awesome food, open till 2am (which is awesome when being in the service industry), big portions. I highly recommend this place. 
9672 4 Stopped in before the Red Sox game. The service was fast and the cheese pizza was AMAZING!! If I'm ever in the area again, I'll be back! 
9673 2 What can you say... its a CVS... has everything I need for a quick stop... even drugs! 
9674 4 Delicious and healthy meal. Reasonable price. The server was really nice and attentive. 5 Stars! 
9675 4 If you looking a good quality lunch, picking something for dinner, this new Hainan chicken joint is the place to come. Clean, quick and very reasonably priced, and friendly service! 
9676 0 This was the worst ever Marriot experience that I've ever had. How is this place even a franchise??? Took 4 plus weeks to resolve my overcharges then they want to argue took over 8 phone calls at 35plus minutes to resolve! NOT A HAPPY PLATINUM MEMBER!!!!! 
9677 4 I'm not a huge burger person and was complaining about going here...until I ordered a burger because I was starving. This was the BEST burger I've ever had besides In-N-Out burger. No condiments needed. I will definitely be going back because I'm already craving their burger. 
9678 4 We love La Costita! We order from them using deliver dish at least once a month. The flavors are great, always consistent. I love the specialties. The salsa is really awesome too. Large portions, always a bonus in my book. 
9679 2 BRING BACK HONEY WE SHRUNK THE AUDIENCE. captain eo didn't wow me and I didn't really enjoy it. Hwsta however was amazing, please disney bring it back. 
9680 4 Wonderful and helpful staff, they have the newest technologies that not only make for a quicker and less-painful visit, you also can see on a screen exactly what they are referring to (blew my mind)! My ENTIRE office has started going here and we are all big fans! 
9681 3 We have now been here several times for both the Tapas and dinners and the place just keeps rocking our taste buds. Be there before 6 for the Tapas. 
9682 3 Great vibe for Saturday or Sunday brunch. If you love the young black (mid 20's 30's) hip hop and mimosas type vibe you'll love it. Their mimosas are mostly champagne, which is a plus! & their food is pretty good. 
9683 4 This was so interesting and fun. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable about all of Boston's haunted history and we got to do a little paranormal investigating at the end of the night. 
9684 4 Casual dining but better than any Mexican restaurant I've been to before. Their salsa bar is the best part! There are a variety of salsas to choose from. This place is clean and nice! Be prepared to wait if you decide to go during lunch because it gets busy! 
9685 4 very cute little corner! everyone there was friendly and there seemed to be a lot of regulars. i had delicious home fries and eggs benny and my friend got a beautiful stack of pancakes. definitely coming back! 
9686 4 I agree with Taylor. Matt was great and the Irish coffee is the best! I'll be back soon. 
9687 4 Very good service. Pricey burgers. Love the skinny fries. I got the luau burger. It was good but I've had better. We also had the burger with chili and an egg that was also good. What I could've done without was the mop water smell from the bar. Yuck 
9688 2 A bit gimmicky, but there are some cool flavors. But be warned, if you eat more than two, you're stomach will punish you. 
9689 2 Well-organized clean store with helpful staff and beautiful merchandising of sport and regular bras... I only consider shopping there during the semi-annual clearances due to their pricing. 
9690 3 Big dinner portions and reasonable prices. Love their rice and a huge fan of their pita bread! 
9691 3 Discover this place by getting lost in the area. Now I come back intentionally. It's a great find, the food is amazing. Love it!!! Highly recommended to anyone that love food like I do 
9692 3 BEST antique place ever to happen in central Florida! 2 levels of great finds! I enjoyed it and recommended friends to go there. The staff I will say are not too friendly, I think it's family owned? 
9693 3 Wonderful reasonably priced breakfast. Superb crepes and Mediterranean signature dish Shakshuka. Staff was friendly. A great choice for my vacationing family. 
9694 2 The food was great and it was at a reasonable price. The only reason why I'm giving it 3 starts instead of 5 is because the person serving the food was NOT wearing gloves. 
9695 1 Been here for take out twice. First time the food was mediocre. Second time I just order lo mein and it was also mediocre. Finding a good chinese place is so hard to do. 
9696 3 Not the best breakfast taco I've ever had in my life but it definitely did the job. We had a big order and they got everything just right which was good! The prices are also very reasonable and there was plenty of parking! 
9697 1 High-end American. High prices but unimpressive service and taste. There is better in Harvard Square (try Upstairs on the Square instead). 
9698 4 Plain and simple,excellent food and staff quick friendly service. Big part of quincy history. Family orientation. 
9699 4 It was very good and different! I'm so glad my suggested it. Service and atmosphere was great. The beer battered green beans were absolute worth the try. Not at all what I was expecting! Great experience ! 
9700 4 Best place I've ever been to. Had two pieces done here and both were done so well. They took me as a walk in both times and gave a good deal. Love them and won't go anywhere else. 
9701 4 This is a perfect, perfect shop. They have a variety of interesting gifts, jewelry and housewares -- a mix of old and new. They staff has always been very helpful and friendly. You can find interesting, affordable things here and there are so many new things each time I visit. 
9702 3 I mean, its Domino's. theyre in East Boston, I'm in the Throp, delivery is about 10 mins, what else is there? Consistent service and food, nuff said. 
9703 2 Two slices and i was stuff. Hearty toppings, almost deep dish style, thick crust. It was good but i am the pickiest pizza person. The leftover piece was almost better the next day. So filling though so if you are insatiable, go here! 
9704 3 He servers ask when they meet you how much time you have. Be careful with your newer because they apparently take as much of it as possible. Food was great (had the OFS Dirty South) and folks were friendly, it just took a lot longer than I like. 
9705 4 By far my favorite restaurant. Packed on weekends, the shrimp pasta plate is so delicious 
9706 4 Great place. I highly recommend! The people are beyond friendly, and the place is clean and cheery. My dogs love coming in and seeing their friends! 
9707 0 Epic fail in every imaginable way 1) meat-cheap, flavorless, and grotesquely greasy 2) fries have no potato flavor and the crusty stuck on seasoning 3) Pepsi products 4) ridiculously overpriced-$20 out the door for lunch 5) bacon-undercooked and fatty. Will return when it snows in Miami. 
9708 2 Food was delicious but portions were small. Waitress was friendly even got me another drink I didn't like the first one. 
9709 3 Pure chocolate plus pure honey - makes for some smooth chocolates. They also offer a selection of 'hot chocolate' like drinks. I tried one called the 'inner child' - which was excellent. This place is a block down from 'flip happy' crepes'. 
9710 4 Awesome drinks. Awesome, authentic food. The price is right. Get the tacos al pastor on red corn tortillas and a la partida margarita. AMAZING! 
9711 4 Amazing authentic Mexican restaurant. Great servers and food ! Cheap prices and fast service Don't be fooled by the looks of the place .! 
9712 4 I can't believe it took me so long to discover this little gem! I made my first (of soon-to-be many) visits to Pintxo Pincho last week and LOVED it! Everything was fabulous! Highly recommend! 
9713 4 The Cornerstone Inspection Group is fantastic!!!! We were very impressed with the details and well elaborated report. For this reason we very highly recommend them. 
9714 4 Amazing Colombian tapas in Ohio!? Check. This place was delicioius. The service was fast and great, and the food prices were extremely fair as well. Can't wait to come back here next time I'm passing through Ohio. 
9715 4 Depression caused by July 4th festivities, I find the closest bar possible. Good beer, great sandwich- and although it's $20, it's simple delicious. Comfort food for my soul. Joe, the bartender, was nice and overall on point. Nice spot and open late. 
9716 4 Really enjoyed my first time here! The bartender was super nice, friendly and knowledgeable. The kava itself was interesting and I will definitely try it again. I also really liked the atmosphere. Great place! 
9717 3 Great food and cool dining area. I was wondering why no wrap pics but they are pretty messy. 
9718 3 Powder extension with gel, colour is good, like it Hope they can clean my dead skin and massage next time Not sure what exactly is included in the service This cost me 60 dollar after tax and tip not cheap! 
9719 3 The place is small but the food was very good. The servings are a nice size. However, the service is slow. There's a large lot not too far from the place with free parking. I went there with my girlfriends but would go back with my family. 
9720 0 Worst place ever. After sitting down for 15 minutes, a waitress finally acknowledges our presence. The food was bland and not very good. Very bad customer service. Won't be coming again. 
9721 1 Burger was okay, fries sucked. Smallest menu I've ever seen. Gave me a small drink with my order...didn't like that. Staff was very friendly, but why do people hype this place up so much again???? 
9722 2 Pricing and presentation of food are spot on. The cleanliness and service were also quite admirable. The food...just okay. Lacked some seasoning and there appeared to be a lot more "freezer than fresh" options. With a little finesse, I'm sure this place could be a neighborhood staple. 
9723 4 Kelly is a sweetheart ... Accommodating, professional, quick & efficient. Who could ask for more? 
9724 4 I haven't went there and years and me and my family had an amazing time we went it was our first time back in over 15 years roller coasters are a great upgrade and my kids love them as well 
9725 0 I bought a Groupon for this place and have called 3 times to make an appointment. No one answers the phones and no one returns voicemails. I called Groupon and got my money Back. wasting of time. 
9726 3 Very tasty, the staff has always done a nice job. My only complaint is that it gets really loud. 
9727 4 Great for Locals. Cute mom and pop feel. Service was great food came out perfect timing. Quick and tasty! Ordered the egg bacon grits. Biscuits were fresh and fluffy. Nice big open seating area. Great for groups. Close to the interstate if you have a long travels. 
9728 4 Haley and Amanda were absolutely amazing. The food was fantastic and the price point can't be beat. Service and food were perfect. Highly recommend and definitely ask for Amanda or Haley 
9729 4 Great from start to finish. We eat at the bar and felt extremely taken care of. Tartar, Octopus, who how could ask for more...... 
9730 4 Best fried chicken I've had in Portland. Juicy meat seasoned just right with a juice crisp on the outside. I got the fried chicken salad and the Asian dressing paired with the chicken and avocado is amazing 
9731 4 I love Westlake Dermatology in Round Rock. Dr. Fridlington is the best. She is very caring and friendly. My whole family goes to her and we all love her. Will never go to anyone else. 
9732 4 This place is wow!! Such a simple bowl and it tastes wonderful!! Had the sauce with the green cap on it, forgot what it was called but it was sweet and savory! They are doing so many right things at this place! 
9733 0 I have ordered from here for last time. Worst Panera out there. They never have my breakfast. They never put food on shelf. I'm contacting corporate about management clearly I'm not the only one with an issue with this place... reviews are horrible! 
9734 3 The only critique I have about this place is their overpriced desserts. Other than that, their coffee is delicious. 
9735 0 Service was terrible. 45mins for 1 drink. Ordered food at same time and it came a hour and 15mins 
9736 3 Service can be hit or miss, but Cioppino is very yummy. I get it every time I visit! 
9737 4 The food and service was excellent! We had fish tacos, chicken fried steak, chicken BLT and Banana cream pie! Everything was delicious! 
9738 0 Our takeout order was half wrong. Food was missing, portion sizes were wrong. If it had been busy, I might be more forgiving, but the place was empty. 10/10 would not recommend. 
9739 0 Beware! Place was way too loud, wait staff sucked, food was awful and very expensive! Couldn't even get a glass of water to drink in under 40 minutes 
9740 4 I had a great blow-out with Katie last weekend! The spot is in a great location and the set-up is super cute. Both Katie and Heidi are adorable and so sweet! 
9741 4 I don't even know what to say...delicious isn't enough. Best.slider.ever! I had the Sellwood and the Hawthorne both were amazing. 
9742 4 Excellent!!!! Tastes like I'm back in Spain or at my favorite Spanish deli in Puerto Rico! Everything I tried was on point!! 
9743 4 The best pizza I've ever eaten. Who knew the best NY pizza you can get was in Texas? Perfectly executed, reliably consistent. 
9744 3 Btw, while I very much enjoyed the mac and cheese we were served last time, there was a smoked cheddar mac and cheese with gold fish crackers on the top and rotini noodles that was my absolute most favorite mac and cheese in Portland. Please bring it back!! 
9745 3 It's a favorite of my kids. Love the remodeled look. Simple, chain resturant food. 
9746 4 Absolutely beautiful. Very nice hotel in the Orlando Area - definitely recommend. C'est magnifique 
9747 3 Great local Mexican place. I always get the enchiladas verses. I can't stand the mariachi band which shows up some Friday nights but I haven't seen them in a while so maybe they no longer play there. 
9748 3 Just what the doctor ordered after long day! The staff is always courteous, and they pay attention to detail. I almost fell asleep during my manicure in the massage chair. Ultimate serenity! 
9749 4 Great storage, well lit and safe. The owners live on site and are always available to help!! Great price and they actually have covered parking, available! 
9750 4 I did a Groupon to try it out. It is hot and challenging, but the teacher was great and tells everyone to go at their own pace. Wasn't crowded in any of the classes I went to. Very cool vibe. 
9751 4 Wonderful meal and atmosphere. The outside is so different from what we discovered inside. The prices were unbelievable. Had a carnitas wet burrito and there must have been half pound of meat that was well seasoned. The guacamole was fresh and delish. What a hidden treasure! 
9752 4 Very friendly owner. The food is good and fast. It's not too busy, only about 15 minute wait on a Sunday morning. Very healthy breakfast place and affordable. Great location. 
9753 3 I always buy my jeans from jasmine sola!! great selection! Check out their website and print off the 10% off coupon and bring it into one of their stores- when your paying $200 for a pair of jeans-$20 off helps ease the pain!!! 
9754 2 Nothing that's going to blow you away. The food is good and that's the best part. Recommend for a quick Chinese meal. Haven't had the Pho here, which I can assume is their specialty, but I've heard it's great. 
9755 4 Really enjoyed this place. Location, decor, atmosphere,wait staff. Great happy hour and every dish had flavor. We tried the squash and lamb t-bone chops and they didn't disappoint. Saved this one to my favorites! 
9756 2 I was not impressed with their cabbage rolls it was very bland but the cream puff is delicious 
9757 4 Excellent ambiance. Cocktails on point. Food is made with lots of love. Record player. What more do you need! 
9758 1 First of all, they lose a star for not having a full liquor license. You can get beer ... but no hard alcohol. The food is fine - not great... but I think it's a little on the pricey side for what they offer. 
9759 4 I come to this location all the time and I've yet to have any negative experience. The food is always made well, my family and I always enjoy it. The only "downside" is that the wait for the food can be long but I still enjoy coming here! 
9760 4 Build your own pizza fabulous. Arugula salad very good. Blood orange lemonade very good. Pizzas are perfect size for one. Quick service, very friendly staff, very good food, reasonably priced. Highly recommend! 
9761 4 The breakfast here are amazing. From the cinnamon roll French toast to the biscuits and gravy, you can not go wrong. 
9762 2 Love the food and environment. SUPER friendly staff. Would give 5 stars if I could go there Sunday afternoons, they didn't run out of everything I am craving the day I m craving it and the prices were a tad better. Really do love it, though! 
9763 1 Came here for a Halloween event for work. Chips were a bit greasy but edible. It is an ok place for small gatherings and/or student gathering. Conveniently located near the Northeastern campus. 
9764 4 AMAZING! Totally worth the wait! Everything looked so good it was hard to choose but the maple bacon, the buttermilk, the sugar donut and the coconut were great! 
9765 4 Delish food and surprisingly affordable food. Plus, inside, you'd never know you were at a gas station. Glad this place is out here. 
9766 4 Best Shane's location I've ever visited at. Super awesome staff, food is always amazing and the music is crazy awesome!!! Love this place. 
9767 4 Great seafood, drinks and desert. 
9768 3 A beautiful garden With space for reflection And time for introspection Paths among flowers galore And waterfalls of different sizes For wonderful enjoyment by Human and dogs 
9769 4 Awesome place! Been going for years! Showed up last night soaking wet after got caught in rain at Epcot, and still welcomed openly! Very cool! Thank you 
9770 4 Been coming here for 20 years. If you are family oriented and love great food this is the spot. If you hate the loud atmosphere then gtfoh. Hands down the best pho restaurant in Oregon. I have been to them all. 
9771 2 Location is good and so is the staff. Not very impressive food options though. Pizza was sloppy Tried two different types of pizza but it was just ok. May be its more focussed on bowling than food. Reasonable priced and suitable for all age groups!! 
9772 4 The inn at bay pointe is FANTASTIC! The short rib Mac and cheese is to die for. My family goes here on Easter for prime rib. The inside and outside is beautiful. 
9773 0 Staff is horrendous at taking directions or being of any service, slow, overpriced for sorry chain food. Wouldn't spend a dime here 
9774 4 An awesome Italian food store! I had lunch of commencement day from Tufts catered by Bob's -- who knew I could make Nonna (Grandma) so happy? Try their sandwiches, and go for Jumbo-size and split it with a friend! 
9775 4 So hard to find good pizza in Vancouver. Try this place! Great crust, great ingredients and cool vibe. 
9776 3 Just as cool as you've heard, believe the hype! Do yourself a favor and order the Debbie Harry! 
9777 1 Not sure I would go back. The food was forgetful and I could never identify the employes. All the wait staff wore normal street clothes. No uniforms if any kind. The nice bar is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. 
9778 4 Loves whits.fast friendly service and delicious food.the whitties are the best especially the black rasberry and penut butter. 
9779 4 It was Antarctica cold out side and I needed to kill 15-20 minutes of time before my dinner party. Freezing I found this coffee shop. THE BEST FOAM EVER. I ordered a small cappuccino. And well they won it was a perfect cup! 
9780 2 I think you go more for the scenery was a very nice place right in downtown Austin we went in the evening the place was lit up the staff was friendly but the food is just kind of bland. 
9781 0 Not only is this business homophobic but also the staff seems to have gone through a training on how to be the most unfriendly at their job. Put your money to a business with better ethical standards. Turned around after I ordered. 
9782 3 Stuffed mushrooms were perfect. I got the "Godfather" veal plate(veal 3 ways) that is not on the menu, it was good. The atmosphere was like you stepped back into 1973. It was cool and the staff were very friendly. The area of town in strip club central, just an fyi... 
9783 3 If you like fresh , delicious Mexican food...you will love this place! I have had food inside the tiny dining area and have also ordered takeout and delivery. The portions are generous, great value! 
9784 4 Convenient for me and absolutely delicious. The bao baos are a lifesaver. Highly recommended. Their lo-mein is pretty standard fare, but the portion size was massive (ate for a couple future meals as a side). Shoot for something interesting, or just go for the bao baos. Before they raise prices. 
9785 4 The team was responsive and reasonable. I'm a realtor and enjoy sending my clients to Elk Electric for trustworthy, honest quotes and work. 
9786 0 First time we ordered pizza guy to us late and cold, even tho we're just around the corner Second and last time We ordered I got 2 hairs in my crust. Will never order from this place again. 
9787 4 Very knowledgeable chiropractor. Efficiently and gently adjusted a rib for me. This fixed the problem in one visit. Conveniently located off 183. Parking easy. He worked me in when I was in dire straits pain. Professional and caring. 
9788 2 Annoying loud babies should not be taken to coffee shops. And certainly not two of them. For fire roasted coffee, it was pretty bland. I found the coffee at Thunderbird much better and flavorful... 
9789 3 Curteous employees who went beyond their obligations to help out a non-local customers. Thank you. 
9790 4 I hired these guys to remove a hornets nest from my front tree. The gentleman who came out told me exactly what he was going to do, how much it was going to cost, and how long it would take. I would hire these guys again. 
9791 4 If you like a good hot dog this place knocks it out of the park!! Big hot dogs that actually fit in the bun cooked to perfection on the grill. Trust me when I say you will not get a better hot dog anywhere!! 
9792 4 So sad to learn they are demolishing this. Always loved coming here and seeing all the graffiti art work. 
9793 0 Worst experience. I just moved to the area. I ordered 2 shakes and they both looked and tasted like milk. We waited 15 min for these 2 shakes and they were awful. The employee did not apologize for slow service. Will never come back. 
9794 0 I am from Fort Lauderdale Florida...went to this restaurant while on vacation. A complete tourist trap. Food was retro 1965 awful. This landmark needs to be completely refurbished! 
9795 2 Was just ok. I thought it would be a 5 star walking in but the service and food was just ok. 
9796 4 The service was exceptional, the meatball appetizer was great, the Rocco pizza icing on the cake. Topped with a bottle of wine! No complaints! We were visiting Boston, exceptionally cool rainy May day! This place did not disappoint! 
9797 3 Marlow's is a very solid small chain. Their places are always nice and their menu has something for everyone. The staff at this location was very good. My only complaint is that they need to expand their tap beer offering. 
9798 3 Lunch Buffet is amazing! Always a fan of the chicken dishes. 
9799 2 This store is a trip. Used to be really sketchy but not so much since the re-model. Still a good store to shop at. 
9800 4 Best Kung Pao chicken in austin. I live about a mile and half a way. Delivery time is usually between 15 and 20 minutes. Even on weekend nights. Mongolian beef is also really good. Must try! 
9801 0 don't waste your hard earned money....very greasy food and whatever dish you order expect very little chicken or beef. The food lacks flavor and is just plain distasteful! 
9802 0 Worst Chinese food I've ever eaten and overpriced to boot. Not one dish hit the spot. I left hungry, with no leftovers and a big bill. Ambiance is also off. As others mentioned, dishes came out at very different times. I'm not wasting any more time writing. Just avoid it. 
9803 4 Yes yes and yes! Amazing selection. Lots of fun stuff to look at and vintage gems sprinkled in. If you are looking for cacti and more this is your spot. 
9804 2 Something for everyone type of shop. They constantly get new stuff so I love stopping by when I'm in the area. Prices though are a little all over the place. 
9805 4 Really great selection of oysters, the whole kitchen is visible to all the customers including shucking the oysters, everything is really fresh and a nice Presentation with all the plates. Best of Boston! 
9806 0 Do not trust the approximate wait times, it started 30 minutes, after over an hour of waiting they took so long i wasn't able to take my cdl test! Go to any other dmv, they are so slow and incompetent here 
9807 4 The best Ramen in the state of Oregon hands down! The noodles are delicious and handmade they serve mostly pork but it is very tender and juicy. A great place to go after your done shopping at Uwajimaya right next door! 
9808 0 kingsway location: ordered the $34.99 hotpot beef with long string noodles,was too sweet ,would not recommend it. Service is horrible,have to ask for basic essentials,such as a tong to pick up the beef bones. The house tea looks soapy!!! 
9809 3 Great breakfast, wonderful fresh squeezed orange juice, friendly staff, inexpensive. Glad we happened on this cafe. 
9810 3 Great neighborhood pizza joint, a throw-back to the old days of pizza. Their non-pizza items were also very good. Not a fancy place and definitely not modern but very good. Earns its spot on the top 10 pizza list in the US every year. 
9811 4 Awesome staff, great service delicious food elegant atmosphere. One of my favorite dinning rooms ever. 
9812 4 THE BEST! Adam was so helpful and took the time to explain everything to us. Extremely thorough and detailed. 
9813 4 Most amazing Mac & Cheese. Go very hungryas the portions are large. We got the ice cream cookies for desert and they were out standing. They come with a little pot of melted chocolate to dip the ice cream sandwhich into...its amazing! Atmousphere is nice and staff are very friendly! 
9814 2 I was underwhelmed. We had the Reuben, Tuscan Garbanzo soup, and the Oatmeal Cream Pie. Everything was okay but nothing was yummy. And it was fairly expensive. I might comeback if I was having lunch with a vegan but not otherwise. 
9815 4 Visiting from Halifax Nova Scotia. Excellent bike "Specialized " in perfect condition staff changed pedals for me at their offering Fair pricing. My GOTObike rental in B.C. 
9816 3 Amazing mexican food!! Great staff and great atmosphere!! 
9817 2 Maybe my standard is too high? Or maybe the beef noodle soup is just better in LA. I could taste the msg. 
9818 4 Great service, gracious people, cozy atmosphere. A place to relax after a day at the office! 
9819 4 I love Apache Cafe. A much needed jazz bar in Atlanta. It hosts lots of performances with promising talent in Atlanta. Very laid back atmosphere. 
9820 3 Love the salads! They do a pretty good Caesar Wrap as well. Service is friendly and the Sandy Springs location is clean and well organized. 
9821 4 I heard a lot of good things about this place and I wasn't disappointed. The food was great. It was crowded but worth the wait. 
9822 4 Fresh and well balanced smoothies, clean hookahs with nice flavors and a great atmosphere, the staff is really friendly and would recommend what to get bases on your taste 
9823 4 Navarre is now one of my favorite restaurants in Portland. I love the ordering system of checking off what you want on a piece of paper and having the option of a small plate or large plate. Every single thing we had was really good. The service was friendly too. 
9824 0 Standing here right and your staff STILL sucks!!!!!! How hard is it to greet your patrons and say hello?? Yall are terrible!!!! 
9825 4 Rainy Sunday morning. Pulled in and handed over wheel lock, 10 minutes and $16.24 later I was on my way. Friendly fast service...great care to finish on expensive wheels. Only shop in town that gets you in and out faster than you can get coffee. 
9826 4 Excellent iced coffee. Good, fresh food for Sunday breakfast. Lots of seating and friendly staff. What could possibly be better? 
9827 3 Probably my fave in the 'Couve for this comfort food. I never expect much for service when going for Vietnamese food, but eagerly await the day. Anyhow, Pho Green Papaya = great pho. 
9828 4 I took the soap making class last year and I can't stop thinking about it! The class was fun, inclusive, easy to follow and Beata was extremely informative! There are so many other classes I would like to take. 
9829 4 This hotel has one of the best brunches in Boston. I would have to say food wise I prefer the Langham because it has a slightly bigger variety but the view at the Taj sunday brunch is unbeatable. Excellent service and fantastic food. 
9830 4 Jake and Sennett were absolutely amazing!! Jake was very accommodating!! He was so sweet and made my night 1000x better I couldn't have asked for better service! Love you guys so much! 
9831 3 Value for the price. Not Morton's but better than Ruth's Chris. Service is decent. Not Bones or Chops but better than STK. Need a steak downtown dressed casual - it's the place to go. 
9832 3 Good prices and large portions make this my go to sushi place as I'm a fairly big eater. Can't go wrong with a teriyaki and roll combo for $8.95. There is better sushi around but for value for money I havn't found a place that beats this. 
9833 4 Nice to find a cool spot to stop on the way thru traffic. Think I might become a regular. 
9834 0 We waited for over 10 minutes without anyone coming to attend to our table. When we left, I mentioned this to the hostess and she was completely indifferent. 
9835 4 A let you all in a little known secret. You do not need to be a member of Costco to buy at their liquor department. They carry all named brands at discounts from 25-40% over most others. Check it out, then invite me for Margaritas. I'll bring the nachos. 
9836 3 My favourite ice cream shop in Vancouver. Nice selection of flavours; some rotate, while others seem to be mainstays. A bit out of the way and expensive, but the quality makes it worth it. The aesthetic is hip minimalism. 
9837 4 Best BBQ beef ribs I've ever had, meat candy and then some. Stellar rub and so full of flavor. The brisket and sides were all top flight too, especially the creamed corn. One beef rib was a meal. It makes my mouth water just looking at their menu. 
9838 3 Good variety of noodle and pasta dishes with different sauces and protein options. The service was fast and friendly and the meals were delicious. 
9839 4 Fantastic experience! Dr. Henry is friendly and very skilled in his profession! The level of customer service is great, the office is beautiful and the staff is very professional! I would highly recommend this office! 
9840 4 Great place to meet friends and listen to Irish music. Check out the Irish breakfast on Sunday! YUM! 
9841 3 Delicious. The butter ramen is so yummy and the happy hour Menu makes everything affordable enough taste it all. Love this place 
9842 2 I had made reservations for diner at a really early time because there were none for a later time but they were completely empty. Food was good but not great and I wanted great!? 
9843 3 What's not to like about shopping at IKEA? It's a large store with a large selection of home decor, with price ranges to fit every budget. 
9844 4 I had a wonderful experience at Soul Flower Wellness. The massage that I received was heavenly and very professional. I recommend this business highly! 
9845 3 2nd time here, Van did such a Wonderful Job. I called today and asked for her. She was in and so far an Awesome legs and feet massage. The chairs also are wonderul 3 settings for automatic massage. 
9846 3 hip vibe comfy seats strong espresso/ macchiatos I'm a fan 
9847 4 Gary is a skilled and caring optician. Genuinely good guy who sells excellent quality eyewear. 
9848 2 The ambiance was nice, but the food was really inconsistent. The calamari was bland and uneventful, but the pear crostada dessert was downright lovely. The cod with lobster risotto was nothing special, but the tortellini with butternut squash was to die for. Overall, it just fell short. 
9849 4 Great Salmon and Chicken with tons of Broccoli like I always man. Perfectly made just like I like it 
9850 4 Stopped in for breakfast to go. Family got the breakfast kaiser rolls and we all agreed that they were the best breakfast sandwiches we've ever had. 
9851 1 Probably better if you make the drive to Blaze at Disney Springs. The dough was undercooked, the red sauce was bland, and the toppings weren't fresh at all (soggy and wilted). Spend your $10 elsewhere. 
9852 4 5 stars for this little find! As their sign says, this isn't fast food, it's fresh food. We had the poke bowl, po'boys, fries and fritters--all delicious. Looking forward to trying more from their menu. Love their Wasabi slaw #mmmm 
9853 4 Very clean. Nice speedy staff. Great Specials. Fresh to order. Fresh ingredients. Good price for deal. OMG Great Salads! 
9854 4 Been to nearly all coffee shops in Boulder. This seems to be the best. Old world style traditional Italian coffee.Better than downtown Amante even. It's quite a hangout and seating can be limited. 
9855 4 Best bang for your buck for breakfast/ brunch in Boulder in my opinion. Service is good too, especially Katie! 
9856 3 Fresh tasting food, well made drinks and a huge selection of beers, Bodega is a great find with a comfortable atmosphere. 
9857 0 They close at 10pm on a Saturday. Service was absolutely insulting. I wouldn't recommend going to this place even if the food was good. 0 out of 5 stars. 
9858 4 Excellent service, excellent speed, excellent food. The decor of the restaurant has been modernized compared to other Red Robins I've been to. Had a very welcoming server who made sure everything went right. 
9859 3 Love to drink and hang at this place. My Band also plays there quite a bit, and it is a great place to play. On weekends the place is always jammed, but there is still room to move around. Great staff, great bartenders, and great drinks! 
9860 2 Like most Burtons location, the food is good and the service is fine. BUT, dishes and silverware are consistently dirty...how does that happen and how does the person setting up tables not notice? Eeghaad!! 
9861 3 Finally a real good Mexican food place in Orlando. I highly recommend.It's open late. the service was good. the price is decent. and the food was amazing. the place could use a cosmetic touch up, but other than that... excellent. 
9862 2 Really tasty food. Nice atmosphere SLOW service. We waiting 50mims for food. The table beside us waited 20 mins for their bill.... 2 servers on for the whole restaurant which is quite small. But obviously they cannot handle it! Good food, not that convinced if its worth the wait 
9863 2 Overall is good, is worth the line up I don't think so, mainly Instagram addict's go here. Believe me the food is great, service is ok, the hype about it I still dont get it. 
9864 4 My favorite restraunt in Central Florida! Best beer. Best German Food. BEST FOOD AROUND! 
9865 4 I usually don't do 5 star posts but I had the best Shrimp and Grits I've ever had and the chicken was awesome too. Patrick was a great server and recommended the perfect wine as he gave menu suggestions. Will definitely be back. 
9866 3 pretty good/cheap subs. we still call it bhob even though its now technically bhorb. chicken fingah dinnah! wicked bum-tuck ked! 
9867 4 After having a TERRIBLE experience as a caregiver for a medical patient down the street at Nectar, Treehouse Collective had us in the back and getting helped right away. THC is our second favorite dispensary and we love them. Always helpful, very cool and prioritizing their medical patients. 
9868 4 Piplines where great. I highly recommend them. Chris was very responsive and helpful with the burst pipe. She not only explained the issue quickly but provided information on how to solve the problem. I'll definitely be calling them again. 
9869 4 I have to agree with everyone else--both the selection and the customer service was amazing. And my toddler loved it! We bought a couple of bilingual board books about babies (her latest obsession) and I left a happy (and future repeat) customer. :D 
9870 0 Food is very Americanized! Two out of three non-spicy dishes were simply too sweet! As a Chinese, I would not recommend it. 
9871 3 A consistently tasty meal. The crab puffs(rangoons) are the best in town, seriously the best. 
9872 3 Food good...upper east side drink delicious nice atmosphere. ..uuumm but keep the music going during the band taking a break... 
9873 4 It's a nightlife street, and you're complaining about parking? Have you entirely missed the point of a nightlife street? Have you ever been to a city where bars are surrounded by gigantic parking lots? 
9874 4 Amazing cappuccino. Best I've had in a long time. Waffles and the caramel dip were really good too. Not a big fan of the lavender dip though. The lamb meatballs stew tasted amazing. Great place for brunch! 
9875 1 Delivery to my place (I live about 5 blocks away) took more than an hour. Naan is soggy. Korma is luke-warm and mediocre. Price is steep. Wish I would have just walked my ass to Teji's. Won't be ordering again. 
9876 4 The locksmith was prompt in arriving and rekeyed three doors for us. He did a great job! 
9877 3 My favorite place to get my comfort food, congee. It always hits the spot. The honeymoon fried rice is second on my list. 
9878 4 They have the best and freshest smoothies. I love this place. They are not far from my doctors office so I usually walk there after my appointments since you have to pay for a minimum of 1 hour parking 
9879 2 I've usually had good service at this place. When it first opened the service was impeccable but over the course of the time the quality of the service has dropped. I am definitely a returning customer but sad that the service isn't what it was supposed to be. : ( 
9880 0 The greenery is beautiful, but I found the particular employee I was interacting with to be especially unhelpful. 
9881 4 One cracked iphone screen + $65 + 1 hour = happy me! Friendly, courteous, and fast. Open at 10am. Worth every penny. 
9882 3 We had the tofu scramble with potatoes, tofu scramble with tempeh bacon, tofu scramble with vegan chorizo and the birdie sanders. They were scrumptious! Definitely recommend this place. Staff was very pleasant and food was delicious! 
9883 4 Was here about a couple weeks ago when they first opened. The service was good but my expectations were low because they were "soft opening." Went back yesterday, Amazing Boiled Bagels and Great Service! Sesame bagel with homemade Lox, so good. Glad you guys are in the hood. 
9884 4 They brought Dave Attell and Big Jay Oakerson to Portland. For that I will be forever greatful. The service was good. What else can I say? I'll definetely be back. 
9885 1 Ordered delivery. Timing was accurate; however, the pizza was almost cold by the time it got to my door. Also, I had asked for Italian sausage as one of my toppings. There were about 10 pieces. Not acceptable. 
9886 4 This place is definitely worth going to if you're taking a trip to city walk. We got the bang bang chicken and the combo, where the bones were just falling out of the ribs. Amazing food and service. Will def be coming back! 
9887 3 As BBQ joints go this is pretty good. Stopped in for a quick lunch and the joint was packed at noon. Got in and thru the line in good time. Food was good as always. Sure I will go back. 
9888 0 Terrible customer service. Rude employees, unorganized team of support staff. Don't go here; you'll wait a long time, and nothing good will come of it. 
9889 1 The food is ok and service is fine. It's really kind of dirty. Sticky tables, dirty chairs and walls. Oh yeah, I also ate an entire meal with no coffee and it wasn't even busy! 
9890 2 Food is ok BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY HAVE FRIED TWINKEYS!!! holy crap i had an orgasam in my pants.... sorry try it also beer on taps are pretty good 
9891 3 Pretty good cuban spot. Only my 2nd time having Cuban cuisine and I was very pleased. Food was good and staff was fun and friendly. I would def recommend this place for a first timer. 
9892 4 This place is amazing! The people working here go above and beyond to provide you with a great experience and the donuts are out of this world! It's a must when you're visiting Portland, and yes, thy are better than Voodoo Donuts. 
9893 4 Best shrimp tempura in town. I like the super white tuna with some crunchy garlic on, grilled seabass is fantastic. Ben Roll, White Tux and Hottie Susan is definitely must-get. Very niceeee 
9894 4 Service 10 Food 10 Atmosphere 10 Best French onion soup I have had in years. Great wine list including wines by the glass. Service was fantastic! I'll be back (maybe tomorrow) 
9895 4 best burgers in austin hands down, probably in Texas to be honest! 
9896 4 Great craft beer selection and giant portions of great pub food. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. There are TVs that aren't overwhelming and decent music playing. For a chill night with good food and good beer, this is the place in Marblehead. 
9897 4 The bacon wrapped dates & chili are AMAZING!!!! Location right across from New Seasons is convenient & they have covered seating in the back! I love eating paleo food that I don't have to cook myself!!!! Yay for Cultured Caveman!!! 
9898 4 This place was awesome. I ordered the fried chicken and pancakes and it was everything I imagined it'd be. 
9899 4 I'll admit, I've been here four times and always have gotten the same sandwich. I guess I now go for this sandwich. Oh, eggplant parm, I love you! 
9900 4 The food was MAGNIFICENT!!! Wow!!!! I'm speechless, the food was truly Off The Chart! Jerk chicken has serious kick and was OUTSTANDING!!! Oxtail, simply FABULOUS!!! This is a MUST try clean restaurant with spectacular customer service. 
9901 4 This place was fantastic! I went because the line was too long at Highland Bakery and was so so pleased. I had the Marley which was fantastic. The server couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. Highly recommend!! 
9902 3 They have very good toppings for your pizza, the pizza is cheap and flavorful and they make it very quickly. If you just have craving for pizza and do not want to eat a big one with so much cheese MOD pizza is the place to go. 
9903 4 Wow! This fried chicken was delicious!!! So flavorful and not greasy at all. The collard greens could've had a little more flavor and the mac & cheese was yum too!! The waiter recommended I take a piece of pie to go, and boy did that (chocolate) pie not disappoint!!! Yummmyyy!!! 
9904 0 I went to get a coffee from this Safeway Starbucks... I couldn't seat down and drink my coffee. It is a Homeless shelter. Not trying to act hillarysh or diss but it is BAD!!!! Bad smell and uninviting! 
9905 3 NY style pizza served fresh and hot! Ordered carry-out over the weekend and I think we found our new local pizza spot! Pie was hot and fresh and made just as ordered. Service was friendly and quick! 
9906 2 Music was really nice, but I think it may be this place's only saving grace. Drinks are overpriced, and their bathroom is disgusting. Nice people though, and I would be back if my friends made me. 
9907 4 It's a bummer they have closed, I would have liked to come back to this place.P 
9908 4 Awesome experience from start to finish. Professional staff along with a beautiful facility. My Mercedes SL has never run better. 
9909 1 Service is usually very slow. The food is sometimes cold by the time it reaches your table. I enjoy Tin Lizzy's and I love many of their options, but at this specific location, my experiences have been awful. 
9910 3 Love this Place,From the Music to the food,to the Satff,i'm Speechless. I'm here every Week End.GUYS GO TRY IT and you tell me :) 
9911 4 My wife and I love this place. We have been coming here for years. My favorite is the Caesar salad and the chocolate peanut butter fondue. Very unique and fun evening out. Just be prepared to cook your own food! 
9912 2 Just Ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich No Onions , with 10 pc buffalo wings all Flats combo lets see how it is as the delivery man is on his Merry Way. 
9913 4 I love this location, very close to where I live; the staff is super nice and very clean and organized.. I make weekly visits for odds and ends even just for snax for the kiddies 
9914 3 One of the few places I will eat Italian food outside of the North End in Boston. Always filling, never disappoints! My advice: do Family Style. They'll just keep refilling your plates with food. It's so worth it! 
9915 3 good sushi and the fried rice is really amazing but its a little pricey 
9916 3 Great food, but lately the wait is upwards of 30 minutes to get the food :( breakfast time turned into lunchtime waiting. Unfortunately if we want this in the future we will order ahead or choose somewhere else. 
9917 4 Awesome little gem. Wife and i where walking by and stopped in for a quick drink to check ot out. Well 3 drinks and a few apps later we will definitely come back! Bartender was Awesome! 
9918 3 Love there chicken momo's and choila. Mouth watering, I always order this. Nepalifood# 
9919 2 I had the Jerk Chicken Sandwich and I thought it was okay. It was hoping for a 'kick' in the flavor, but I didn't really get any of that. I'd like to give this place a second chance and try out their other items! 
9920 3 Excellent pork egg rolls! Great friendly service. They are very busy but they always get you in and out. My only complaint is they sometimes run out of chicken on busy days and the chicken can be kind of fatty. 
9921 4 I have gone here a few times and I am never dissatisfied. The service and the food are both excellent. 
9922 4 This is my second time using Peace Frog to clean my living room carpet and I am so pleased. John did a fantastic job! He was polite, thorough and quick. I will definitely use Peace Frog again! Great Job!! 
9923 4 I've been going here 8-10 times a year for 15+ years....and it has never disappointed me in any way. Standard order is: sausage/lamb combo, 2 high lifes & a roni/sausage/garlic....i always look forward to the next time I get to go here. 
9924 4 Great food, great beer, great sports. Did I say 'great' yet? Yes. But, did someone day, "32-ounce special?" They should! Check out Live Trivia at 8pm on Tuesdays. And, don't forget to thank your wait staff generously for their unmatched service. 
9925 4 Best Joe in Boulder!! Coffee lovers rejoice. Milk steaming perfection with mellow vibe and good news paper selection...free wireless too. Small double mocha recommend. 
9926 4 Excellent! Wonderful! Perfectly satisfying! These guys will pile your disposable plate high with most delightful Turkish home cooking. Everything so tastes fresh and exquisitely simple. My new favorite under 10 bucks quick grab :) 
9927 4 This place was amazing. Casual dining featuring fresh food, great drinks, fun atmosphere with very nice servers. I can't wait to come back! 
9928 4 Their iced chai is the stuff of dreams. Friendly, helpful service and a great neighborhood vibe; much preferred over Stauf's! 
9929 4 I had a great lunch here. The food was good Mexican food. The service was fast. Had some burritos and they were awesome. If I lived around here, I'd definitely come back. Definitely check this place out when you're in the area. 
9930 4 This place is the best kept secret! Do NOT try to do this at the Post Office. The people here are super helpful and I literally didn't even sit down. A huge thanks to the workers here. Everyone is friendly and they do it with a smile. 
9931 0 Terrible, Terrible service. The first time that I went, the food was terrible, but I decided to give them another chance. It was terrible the second time as well. The fries are gawd awful. 
9932 3 Initially had a bad experience at this location but since they've been open, their customer service has gotten much better. Great for gluten free pizza and their Caesar salad is amazing. 
9933 2 It is a lot better and cheaper then the old golds gym that used to be here way back. It is good for cardio weights , women classes, it has daycare, flat tv everywhere. 
9934 4 Family and I are very sad. The place looks closed... for good...empty. We are really, really hoping they moved but there's no note. 
9935 2 Pretty good, nothing to write home about. For me Mod Pizza tastes better and have better salads you can customize. I would eat here again. 
9936 4 I could spend hours taking photographs here. It was a highlight of our Atlanta visit. We came on a weekday afternoon and only encountered a few other living people. We saw a hawk terrorizing the squirrels, but other than that it's a really peaceful place full of history. 
9937 4 Gluten Free pizza is delicious! I love the atmosphere and service. Be careful with parking across the street in the library they boot cars. 
9938 4 The Godfather was delicious and super unique! Staff was very friendly and helpful. Their organic sodas were also a lot of fun to try! 
9939 2 This place tastes so good, but the price is too rich for our blood. It is worth treating yourself with a coupon. It still wont be like paying for Round Table...but it WILL taste much better. Again, gotta treat one-self on occasion, right?? Love the Bike T Shirts. 
9940 3 had a great burger with yam chips...it was delicious...will be going back for sure...decor is average but the environment seems to work 
9941 3 Take a close look at the West Tower of the bridge sometime, and look closely, and you might see the very faded - if it isn't already gone - Union Pacific Railroad emblem. Thank you random knowledge of school field trips past. 
9942 4 Best fast food chain in America, hands down. ALL of them are great locations, every last one. 
9943 4 Bobbie is the best! Professional & explained every detail. Replaced wife's phone with a smooth transaction. "Should have come here first" was our final thought. We'll be back. Duncan & Molly 
9944 3 I like this place, laid back atmosphere, awesome backyard, interesting indoor and outdoor spaces, decent drinks. 
9945 3 I've been trying to find a cheap place that does a great job of cleaning the interior of my car... this place is definitely it! I was shocked on how clean my car was on the inside! I highly recommend this place for anyone in South Austin! 
9946 1 Depends what you order. Not a hot lobster that's for sure. Beer and steamed shellfish? Sure. Nice atmosphere. 
9947 3 I've been here twice now, once for brunch and once for happy hour. Both were great experiences... The pretzel bites are amazing especially if you mix the dipping sauces as suggested by our HH server, Danielle 
9948 4 I had a really helpful appointment with Mike. He is helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and professional. He was so much more thorough than the podiatrist I had seen about my foot (for plantar fasciitis), making suggestions I had not thought about or considered. Highly recommend! 
9949 3 First time I went I got the bandito (black bean patty) and it was okay, tried it again and got the Magic Shroom Burger with chile con queso fries and my experience was transformed talk about a magically delicious meal! 
9950 4 VERY tasty sandwiches. We like the Italian and the turkey bacon ranch the best. Quick and easy. Cheap 
9951 4 The roe noodles are a must order (see all pictures of previous yelpers). Sashimi was perfect. DO NOT MISS THE CREME PUFF. Pairs perfectly with green tea ice cream. Prices are reasonable for food AND drinks - was all delicious! Check the bar seating to skip the wait time! 
9952 4 One of my few favorites in town! Great food, great drinks and great service! Menu is small but everything on it is fantastic! Great place for friends and family to gather. It's small so try to get there early! 
9953 3 First trip to Chuy's. The happy hour in the bar area is one of the best I have seen if you like awesome chips, beans, meat, cheese and salsa. The service was by far excellent. Get there early they pack them in... 
9954 1 some people prefer quantity over quality and im not to judge them ... i should just not listen to them. to my friends who suggested and took me to this place and will potentially never read this review. you guys blow. 
9955 4 Between the 3 of us we had 7 different taco and we all loved ours. Each order is one taco , so around 2-3 tacos will be good.to.fill you up. Love the Pork and Shrimp tacos. 
9956 4 Amazing service( Quentin our server was fabulous) and seated by the super welcoming owner, quaint atmosphere, delicious food! BranZini, pork and Brussels were few of our favorites. Definitely going back! 
9957 1 Stopped in for lunch after picking up stuff for work. We wanted to try the jalapeño chicken fries. Well I was disappointed with them. They was way over fried so tasted like jerky. They smelled good coming out of the bag. At least I enjoyed my whooper. 
9958 3 The food was good and I liked that the ambience was quiet and peaceful even though right outside was loud and busy. 
9959 4 Just what you need and nothing else. And that's a good thing. Good people. Good service. I shall return. 
9960 4 Still one of the best breakfast spots in EAV, if not Atlanta. Great service, great food, and they actually have several extremely healthy choices. Though I usually get French toast and bacon, they have grilled chicken breast and turkey bacon etc. 
9961 4 My go-to Thai place. Go go the crispy chicken or tofu pad Thai. They are really fast! 
9962 3 Amazing coffee! I was only there for about 5 minutes, but the baristas were so nice and made my drink exactly how I wanted it. If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely go again. 
9963 1 Hard apple cider fritter... Yum, right? I thought so with all the bites on the periphery of said item. Unfortunately, all the middle bites contained raw dough. Pretty gross. I wish the promise of the external bites could have been fulfilled. 
9964 0 I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and fries. I was given a lukewarm sandwich with the spiciness of a kids meal. The cheese, $1 add on, wasnt melted and still cool from the frig... Come on guys??..10 bucks for this...unimpressed and I wont return. 
9965 3 Great neighborhood bar that is perfect for a game of darts or a few pints., It is usually filled with some local residents, or a nice mix of college kids and young professionals. 
9966 4 All about the bison burger and the truffle fries.... when you crave this place nothing else in town will suffice. 
9967 4 Food is amazing! Service was perfect, top notch! Ambiance was cozy, modern farmhouse feel. The Gnocci appetizer is the BEST gnocci we have ever had! Maple panna cotta with sweet potato ice cream was yummy. Definitely on the list to visit again. 
9968 0 The whole experience was bad. We had to wait in line forever to pick up the tickets we had already purchased and the entire theater stinks terribly. Do not recommend at all. Stick to Regal Westgate.. Way better theater. 
9969 4 Best night club downtown Portland. Dj are the best. Security is awesome, bartenders are great! 
9970 4 I love this place! Me and a close friend of mine find any excuse we can to go for a trip to Golden Tent. Great variety, everything is always fresh, the staff is super friendly and the place is always very clean. My favorite Mongolian food in Clark county! 
9971 1 I love hot pot and this place definitely delivered on a semi-authentic taste and fun atmosphere, however the service was terrible! Our party of four waited and waited on our waiter to come take our order, bring us water, bring us the drinks we ordered, etc. 
9972 1 Drinks are amazing the food was not that great. Ordered a New York steak and it was probably the worse quality meat available all marbling and no meat. I would go back but only for the drinks. 
9973 4 Our all time favorite concert venue. Security is friendly yet does their job in keeping an out on the crowds. Totally enjoy this venue and have been at least 20 times 
9974 2 thin ramen noodles lacks the chewy texture, prob needs more egg, broth is good not overly salty, egg was good, portion was super small for the price, good but not wowed 
9975 4 I been coming to this place for almost 20 yrs; and still one of the best Mexican restaurant in town! Try mariachi night on Saturdays!! 
9976 1 Food was okay. Nothing to brag about. Small portions. Won't go back there anytime soon. 
9977 2 The food is always great and the service is fast, friendly, and intuitive to your needs. Lost two stars for dirty spoon atmosphere & the fact that they don't accept credit cards. 
9978 4 Soooo delicious! Not to mention extremely affordable considering how big their burrito is. I have taken many friends here and they always go back for more. 
9979 3 Nice place and quiet. Friendly staff. Took me And my wife as walk ins. We will be back. 
9980 3 We haven't had the steak or anything the blue ribbon good grill is known for but they made a very good kids cheeseburger in my French onion soup was delicious. We will come back another time try the steak and have a martini. They are known for $7.49 martinis! 
9981 4 So many flavors and toppings......such a fun place to go especially on a hot summer day. Funky friendship murals makes you want to give a stranger a hug or treat them to frozen yogurt. My favorite dessert stop downtown. 
9982 4 Incredible beers, chill atmosphere and great food at a pretty affordable price. Clam chowder was delicious and the House Martell Pale was perfect. Service from our server, Pen, was world-class - he was informative and helpful, paying the perfect amount of attention to our table. This dude needs a raise. 
9983 4 I honestly expected this place to be overrated, but it was byyy farrrrr the best donut ive had around boston. maybe anywhere. the strawberry one was fantastic, but really so were all the rest so....go for it and try em all! 
9984 4 So delicious. I adore my Monday night trip. The house special madras dosa and chicken and mixed veg are my favourites. The idly appetizers are also really good. 
9985 4 Best soup in Atlanta, by far! Everything from scratch, including the noodles. Rich, wonderful broth. We had the "Den of Dragon" and "Forbidden Kingdom." Both outstanding. Really good gren beans too. Very reasonably priced and filling. We'll be back, probably this week! 
9986 3 Solid bar. Ridiculously friendly bartenders who know a surprising amount about their beer selection. Really fantastic pizza. Not the atmosphere I typically choose for a bar, but fun for a large group, with foosball and pool and some decent tunes. 
9987 3 Got charged an extra $1 for chili flakes and got what seemed to be one shake of the peppers. They also forgot my soda. Overall really great pizza and the owner has a heart of gold. Customer service goes a long way! You don't get outreach like his ANYWHERE anymore. 
9988 4 Great food & Service,glad i stopped in for the 1st time,may u all have a great 2018. buy local stay local,thank you 
9989 4 Loved the food even though it took usanhour to sit on a Sunday evening. Worth the wait! 
9990 2 I went there expecting scallops and other food , but they changed the menu they day before I visited. It was disappointing. I tried A burger and mushroom cannelloni. Stout of the day, drought of the day. Food was okay. Beer was great. 
9991 1 Mediocre at best. I really wanted this to be a good experience. We had various small plates for the dim sum brunch, and everything missed the mark. 
9992 3 Sometimes the wait can be long depending on when you go but always worth it! They are great about working with your price point and getting you a great bra. Staff is super sweet and friendly! 
9993 4 Delicious tri-tip steak sandwich and salad and extremely friendly staff! Happy to have them in our hood! 
9994 0 Awful food! They have a buffet which offered runny eggs, cold cereal, bread, horrible stale pastries that were wrapped in plastic. They did have some freaks fruit though. Terrible service. Expensive for what we got. 
9995 4 Better donuts do not exist. This sentence is so that yelp will let me post the review already. Yelp gets one star. 
9996 4 Great burger and fries. Super friendly staff. Took detailed info on what you did not want in your burgers. 
9997 3 Very good compared to all the other Latin restaurants in the city...I went there yesterday and was very satisfied 
9998 3 A neighborhood gem. Great bakery, desserts and a deli counter full of prepared dishes. They have a good cheese selection also! Look closely, that dessert you are having at your favorite restaurant may be from Alon's. 
9999 3 The Barking crab was a change to the chain restaurants. I had the fried shrimp. It was fresh and juicy. I recommend giving the Barking crab your business. Great atmosphere and the vibe will help you to relax. If your a seafood eater, you will not be disappointed. 
10000 4 Better Than Yours!! These tacos are killing it! El pastor asada best ever!! Nothing that you can normaly find in pdx. This is authentic traditional mexican food!!! 
10001 3 Fish tacos were awesome! (Sorry no pic as we ate them right away) Shrimp Tacos were also good, but could have used a few more shrimp. 
10002 4 Oh nooooo! The French toast is omg fantastic. The hash is good, but THE FRENCH TOAST...!!! Ambiance and service is good too. 
10003 1 Horrible service and the food is barely above average. The pad woon sen barely had any noodles in it. The waitress was useless. We asked to split the check when we sat down but she at the end she said she couldn't do it. Not coming back. 
10004 0 Worst sandwich that I think I've ever had. They "toasted" the spicy chicken sandwich for me- it was hard brown old sub roll on the outside that was semi-warm, and ice cold on the inside. Rude cashier to top it off. 
10005 4 This place rocks!! Really authentic Mexican. Tried the pastor con queso torta and it was awesome.. The sauces in the bar are spicy!! 
10006 0 Wells branch location. Has the worst customer service at the front desk. I came in for an oil change the guy at the front desk tells me "oil changes are not their priority They only do important auto repairs"! Would a call from owners. Thank you 
10007 3 Across from Poor Calvin's, this spot gets a surprising number of canine visitors given the assumptions about the neighborhood. 
10008 4 I don't understand why this place isn't more popular. It's awesome! The food is healthy and delicious-try the squash curry. And it's inexpensive! Great for vegetarians and meat eaters! 
10009 4 Had a fine Wednesday night dinner here. Schwarzbier for husband, Chateau margui rouge for me, Oysters appetizer. Dinners: Strozapretti, Halibut. All quite delicious, good service, nice atmosphere in what seems like an unlikely location. Fine dining on the side of Mount Tabor. Clearly a popular place. 
10010 4 Fresh, quality ingredients, and an extensive gluten free menu. One of our staples for takeout, despite the 20-25 minute drive! 
10011 3 They were helpful and fast fixing a problem with my un-trendy mountain bike. No attitude. 
10012 4 Best breakfast in Boulder!! Love the feel of the place, our server was great, and the food was delicious. It's always busy though, so be prepared to wait. You can go walk along Pearl st. to kill the time 
10013 4 Phenomenal service! Our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable and came back with a detailed list of vegetarian/vegan-friendly options. A good selection of delicious options. Nice atmosphere. Huge portions-- had enough for 5 meals out of one dish. Pricey, but worth it. Try the sorbet mix for dessert-- superb! 
10014 4 FULL DISCLOSURE: I worked here. But I can attest that they used quality ingredients and really offer some of the healthiest vegan baked goods in town, while still being tremendously delicious. Everyone there is passionate about what they do and about delivering a quality product. Great little bakery! 
10015 4 Food was delicious! Service was great! Definitely one of the best poke bowls I've ever had! Prices are a bit more, but worth it! 
10016 4 Great agent, I've ran into many landlords/clients that work exclusively with Dino, all of them have good things to say. In my dealings with Dino, he has always been very professional and honest. 
10017 4 Had a great dinner at Eclipse Di Luna. Food was fresh and service was great! They had live music and also a soccer game on TV. Great atmosphere overall. 
10018 4 Love this shop! Randomly stumbled upon it while walking around Salem and fell in love. Great selection of unique candles, reed diffusers, and other items. I didn't get her name, but the woman at the register was very helpful, nice, and welcoming. 
10019 4 My family loves Chu's Best sweet and sour chicken ever! Crab puffs and egg rolls are also top notch. Many other dishes are wonderful as well. The orange chicken tastes like orange. I know that's different than Safeway or whatever but try something new. Great food. Priced fair. 
10020 4 Love this place! Every time I go in it feels like a family experience. Great food, with a little side of French conversation! 
10021 4 Excellent customer service, very friendly and personalized. Good value and great for making your investment last through the New England seasons of salt, sand, and sun. 
10022 0 Worst chai latte I have ever had. It tasted like boiled puke water. Never Again 
10023 4 Great staff! Our server was very lively and eager to serve us! Good location and cheese dip and salsa is very tasty! A couple of people at my table ordered margaritas and said they were really good! Looking forward to trying one next time I go! Will definitely be back! 
10024 2 The food isn't great but it's not awful, either. It's the perfect spot if you've got a hangover or want a casual breakfast without an insane wait. I also love all the ladies who work there. 
10025 4 Family style restaurant. I think the owner is the host and the waiter as well, great service !!! Fradiavolo and French onion were great as well as the garlic bread!! 
10026 3 Memorable Tabasco and honey fried chicken. Friendly service, and good desserts. Over average for bar food. 
10027 4 Went to check out this bar last night after eating at Intermezzo down the street. The reviews were great and figured I'd check it out with my girl.. Loved the atmosphere and the music was great!!! Def a must to check out! 
10028 3 Food was AWESOME (had the french toast). Staff was very friendly. Service could be a little faster. Look forward to going back here for dinner sometime! :) 
10029 4 Food and service was outstanding. Very crowded on a Sunday afternoon. It's a good sign that the food is good. The guys were very helpful and guided us through the menu. We highly recommend it. 
10030 4 I love baby As. Every time I am home on leave I head straight there! If you have a bad experience with a server don't give just talk to them. All of management is very understanding and will help in any way they can. 
10031 4 Best ice cream I've had! Creamy and really rich. We had the mint ( with fudge mix in-really minty) and chocolate with Oreos (really chocolatey but not too 'sweet). Only complaint is the calories I just took in!!! 
10032 3 Great service. Classico pizza was very good. Loved the cheese polenta balls. Our server was very friendly and helpful. Great restaurant for my first time visiting Austin. 
10033 3 Great coffee and a decent selection of bakery items. They've always been quick to make my drink. Staff isn't overly friendly and I don't think anyone has ever said hello, but I'm only there for a max 5 minutes so it doesn't matter too much. 
10034 1 Took forever to get our bubble tea made and then it was meh at best. I'm going to guess the froyo experience is better as we were the only ones there getting the bubble tea. 
10035 4 This place was really neat. I enjoyed it. I got to meet Steve from The Walking Dead just when he entered :)) 
10036 3 Joe Pizza is quick and delicious. Slices are huge, beware :) 
10037 4 Quite possibly the best meatball sub outside of Little Italy in Chi-town...or Parma in RI... Seriously good. I throttled a pair of them on my way to a round of golf in Whistler.... 
10038 3 Really good pizza, great choice of games and prizes. Could have been a little cleaner though ! 
10039 2 3 stars for the donut holes but everything other than that is horribly oily and super sweet. Definitely overpriced for average $3:50 a donut this quality. I wonder those who gave good rating never had a decent donut. 
10040 3 vegan breakfast burrito A plus fruit/yo/gran. parfait est parfait good coffee- all that matters friendly staff best during non peak hours yummy smoothies portions sized just right sometimes if they give away free stuff when they oops or make too much 
10041 4 I just walked in to the clay pit and Hannah, one of hostesses instantly knew my name and previous order. Since I'm not a regular, that made me feel much appreciated. Now I'm fighting urges to buy the saag paneer again... Yummy. 
10042 4 We rented the private room at this joint. Very cute space. Hidden and around the corner from the busy restaurant. Our server and bartender was super nice. Very lovely for a business gathering or party. 
10043 2 Good food a little bit too much salt in the food service not very good washrooms are filthy. Price is reasonable. Portions are good size. 
10044 2 Not a fan of Coast. I'm not entirely sure why it is such a popular place, to be honest. I find the food to be bland, lacking flavor and mostly taste of butter and salt. Quite disappointing. 
10045 2 2nd visit. Scotch egg just as delicious. Salmon hash had salmon to potato ratio approx. 1:10, so that was a bit disappointing. 
10046 3 YUM MOCHI! So many flavors - so delicious. I've had all of their flavors and am never disappointed. Would recommend for boba as well. More of a take-out place since the inside is small. It's a great place to stop when you're walking around the Harvard Square area. 
10047 2 This place was just ok. The atmosphere was nice and felt cozy but the food wasnt the greatest. 
10048 4 The food was outstanding as well help. We had a party of 5 with two young children and everybody was very helpful. R. Fink 
10049 3 Excellent meal Cool space and our waiter was really helpful. Scallops and pork tenderloin were great. Great selection of brews. My favourite was actually the Clementine dessert a very tasty orange palette pleaser! 
10050 4 they know dells. esp latitude and optiplex machines. Ask for Tony, he is always very helpful. 
10051 2 I'll agree with most reviewers in that this is just an average neighborhood haunt, good for a few drinks on a weeknight. Doesn't take many people to make this place crowded. Closet-sized bar area. Seven's Ale tastes suspiciously like Harpoon Munich Dark. 
10052 2 The food selection isn't much to talk about. It mostly revolves around a buffet option which includes most of their menu items. 
10053 4 I stop by this location on my way to work. Service is always fast and the staff is always friendly. I have only done drive through, so I can't speak for the inside. 
10054 3 as others have said...a little pricey but everything is in perfect condition and the shopowner fixes/sows anything that needs it before it is on the floor. great jewelry...lots of crystal and bead necklaces...can't wait to go back! 
10055 4 O M G! This was probably the best breakfast tacos I have ever had! I want to move to Austin just for this! Trust me, just go and try this out! You won't regret j 
10056 4 By far the best restaurant in Columbus. Amazing Italian food with a great bar. Wonderful atmosphere. Check it out. You will not be disappointed! 
10057 4 Driving from JAX to Orlando - it's a must stop - been coming here for 20 years....Rock Shrimp AWESOME, solid Seafood in a clean place that screams Florida touristy......I love it here!!!! 
10058 4 This place is always friendly and you get the feeling that you'll be taken care of when you go in. Dr. Daby and his hygienists are communicative and always show the utmost professionalism, while keeping a friendly, local environment. I'll keep coming here while I'm in Portland. 
10059 3 Checked out the treasures of the Forbidden City. Thanks! Saved me a trip to China. Lol 
10060 4 Absolutely loved the tour with Jake! Fun tour with a great guide.. the nxt gen of millionaires .... a must do! 
10061 4 Food was great! Lobster crab cake for appetizer, ribeye and scallop are the main courses and classic brûlée for dessert. 
10062 2 Usual Chipotle. Same food and service as all the others. Building was clean and kept up nice. Very nice patio. It was a perfect weather night so we ate out there. Will visit again when in the area. 
10063 4 Fabulous and fresh sushi. The Cucumber Lollipops and Spicy Tuna on the Rocks were fabulous starters. We followed with delicious sushi rolls that came out quickly, despite the crowd. Can't wait to go back! 
10064 4 Quick friendly service. My iPhone 6 needed a new battery and they knocked it out in less than 30 minutes - phone is working great now. Thanks! 
10065 4 Best pizza and chicken parm sub I've had since I've moved to Florida from NY.... been here more than 5x and it's always on point. 
10066 4 First time doing hot yoga and I had an absolute BLAST! It's very clean and reasonably priced. Tessa was so nice and welcoming! Will definitely be back next time I'm in town! 
10067 4 Great coffee great Donuts good selection, good looking girls what more can you ask for in the morning 
10068 4 I'm obsessed with the BLTs. I've never had their pizza, but if it's half as good as the BLT, I'll be a happy camper. I just wished they had Diet Coke. 
10069 4 Amazing service and food. Well rounded and affordable menu. Definitely recommending/revisiting yo a$$ 
10070 3 The food is awesome, particularly the dry-aged steak. The swordfish was very good as well. Great service, great atmosphere. I'm too young to drink, but the bar seemed nice. 
10071 4 Truly a standout. We had sushi, beef teriyaki and mai tais. Everything was great. The sushi chefs were very friendly and offered good suggestions. The food was quick and fresh. I will definitely be back. 
10072 4 Dr. Shadrick took 25 minutes out of his day to give me free advice over the phone. I don't think any other doctor has done that for me, ever. 
10073 4 Went back and tried the chicken stir fry this time, and guess what... ANOTHER 5-stars! 
10074 4 Good authentic Japanese sushi. Excellent customer service. Warm and delightful atmosphere. This is my third time here, I loved it as always. Highly recommended. 
10075 4 My husband and I love coming here for sushi! The fish is delicious and they give really big pieces on the nigiri (check out the photo). Make sure you come for the happy hour! 
10076 3 Mmmmm. This place is good and fast. They have anything you could want that is of Asian decent cuisine. I enjoy the fast service and cheap prices. 
10077 4 The maple bacon cheesecake is to die for. I had an awesome dining experience. This place is defs one of the better restaurants in Surrey! 
10078 1 Correct me if I am wrong ( and I very well could be ) but the Beaverton area seems to be void of awesome sushi places. This place was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The service was quick! I would come back...but I wouldn't mind if I didn't. 
10079 2 Laughing goat's Cappuccino was not very good, Ozo dose a much better job 
10080 4 I met my daughter for lunch. The chicken karaage was phenomenal. The service was great! My daughter's sizzling salmon was impressive. ! 
10081 4 Generous portions on the subs, and a great crust on the pizza. Great joint for the price, and available for those late dinners after work. 
10082 4 My favorite indian food and beautiful decor. When you want to treat your self or family to a nice night out GO HERE. LOVE IT:) 
10083 4 AMAZING! Best sausage of my life (the cheddar variety). Very fast service and outrageously delicious. Also, the pit master gave us an awesome tour of the smoker facility. 
10084 0 Status update: The sign on the window that says they plan to relocate is subject to the owner finding a cheaper and smaller space according to her associate. No location has been chosen yet. 
10085 3 Like nothing I've ever had before. It was a great on the go lunch decision. It was fresh, hot and flavorful beyond words. 
10086 3 Good carwash, they hand dry with towels. Helpful and friendly staff. Make sure you fold in mirrors if possible because brushes can be rough ! Unlimited carwashes for $29/month is a good deal! (Rough of one basic wash is $15) 
10087 4 This is great Pizza. Reminds of the places I used to go to in Philadelphia when I went to College there. The salads sounded good but we didn't try any as we were just there for a snack. Good beer selecton too, but didn't look at the wines. 
10088 3 Spectacular ambiance, one of the best services I have encountered. Won't say food was the best Italian I have had but at par with the best of best. Portions are less hence you can happily consume a 4 course meal which makes this place pretty expensive. Nice for dates. 
10089 4 Fast and honest. Wish they had a place up in DFW. Would recommend to anyone looking for tire repair/replacement. They saved my ass, and on a Sunday morning no less! 
10090 4 What a delightful place for sushi! Super nice chef and service. I had the ramen spicy noodles which was yummy and comforting. The avocado sushi was very nice. 
10091 4 The food was really good here. I'm not huge on Mexican food, but this place really impressed me with there bold flavors and I would definitely go back over and over. 
10092 4 This trailer is awesome! The owners are very nice and the food is delicious, fresh and affordable. Highly recommend 
10093 4 I love ameri bistro ! I get lemon pepper wings mixed with hot and EXTRA CRISPY.. Just fries them a little more like they do in New York. :) It's a small place, family owned and quick. I would order ahead. Very convenient by the Publix 
10094 4 For what it is, a kiosk basically, this was quite delicious. Fresh and interesting deli sandwiches, artfully carved and displayed. Pastry and fresh fruit. Lovely lunch. 
10095 4 Went to the grand opening of this place and loved it! Great selection of rock in roll shirts for females and amazing jewelry. Right across the street from ACL Live, so it's perfect! Located in the same building as City Hall so parking was a breeze. 
10096 1 I really wanted to like them... but food was blah, not cooked well. Seemed too rushed. The environment was loud and chaotic. 
10097 4 This place brings bad sooo many good childhood memories! Who knew a cookie could do that! I can't wait to go back! 
10098 3 Tough to rate. I know that they can't control how much space they have so I'm basing my rating on if they did have a lot of space. Nice casual bar. Very cozy and small. Real neighborhood feel. 
10099 3 Our first trip to Portland, so we were told that this place was a must try and it did not disappoint. This place is not your typical donut shop and is worth a visit. Our favorite was the orange olive oil and the Meyers lemon. 
10100 1 Urban Outfitters is an evil anti-gay company with poorly made clothes. http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4110344 
10101 3 The Burren - fun Irish Bar with good live music. If you choose to eat there, the food is actually above decent with some fun Irish specialties. Never had a bad time here. 
10102 1 Matcha green tea boba with salted cream topping was disappointing. It tasted like coffee creamer. I usually try to drink the boba even if I don't like it but this was too much that I had to toss it. Maybe getting it without the topper would have been ok 
10103 0 This place really is bad. Bad service, looks nicer outside than inside, hilariously overpriced, small menu of things I should have just made at home. Now we know, and now we won't be back. Sooooo many other places to go, save yourselves! 
10104 3 I enjoy their food! They are also one of the only Mexican restaurants that sells aguas mexicanas which is wonderful 
10105 4 Awesome. I have actually been a service tech and a patron of this location. So clean, so up to health code even at the busiest times. Manager expects nothing less than perfection at all times. No worries from cleanliness to service. Wish I could give 30 stars. 
10106 0 Iced coffee tasted off and when looked inside cup there were pieces of napkin. Gross!!! Stay away. 
10107 4 Have been going to Shimon for over 3 years and never receive a bad cut. He cuts men's hair very well. Excellent salon with extremely polite staff. Highly recommend and worth the money. 
10108 4 These guys are iPhone geniuses. Thirty minutes and my non-charging iPhone was back up and running. And it was hundreds of dollars cheaper than the solution Apple gave me - which was to buy another iPhone. 
10109 3 Updated review- I think this place is under new management. I had a good salad there last week and just now am eating the bibimbap- it's super yummy!! Definitely going to start coming here more often now. 
10110 4 I've had better meals here than the famous Pok Pok in Portland. They do it right. Papaya salad tastes like it does in Bangkok. 
10111 4 Lamb burger and steak were great! Ask for Hannah. She knows her stuff kids loved the Mac and cheese and the game tables are a lot of fun. 
10112 4 I've been here three times and will definitely be a regular customer. No matter the stylist, the gel nails stay on for 3 weeks. Beautiful space and it doesn't take too long. 
10113 3 Damn good food, and they're quick so you can actually eat there on your hour-long lunch break! Great for groups, too. 
10114 4 Josh is a dedicated trainer passionate about his work and seeing his clients succeed and meet their goals! 
10115 4 Fantastic service, food and wine! You're able to taste of variation of wines before making a purchase. They have different ounce pours as well. The ambience is lovely and the staff definitely know their stuff. 
10116 4 Fantastic! I can never find a place that serves food spicy enough. Not at this place, I ordered the xxl spicy sauce, and ooooooo that had some serious kick to it. I had the Cowboy, and will eat here again. 
10117 4 This place just tops off my life. I love Japanese food and I love plating. Perfect. I had the crunchy avo roll and it tasted amazing. It was healthy and the mayo was amazing with the avocado and the cucumber it is like ++= 
10118 4 Great spot in downtown Austin. I love stopping in here between meetings to get some work done. Staff is very friendly. 
10119 4 Love this place. If you're looking for a great salon you have to try it out! Always does an amazing job! 
10120 0 Horrible service they woman who was taking my order had a serious attitude problem and on top of that after I placed my order she started asking if they even have enough chicken to complete my meal. Never have I experienced such bad service two thumbs down 
10121 3 Love this Bar! It's basically what you would dream of doing with your own house if you could. Ha Ha. Very low key, relaxed with a very cool unpretentious crowd. Ping Pong table outside is a winner! 
10122 4 I had a wonderful experience here in June. Syndey and Brandon took my order. Food was was good, I went up for seconds. The sushi quality is to par, and plum wine gracefully served. Thank you for keeping the staff motivated and active to our guest needs. Positive review! 
10123 4 We love Green Apple! The staff are really friendly and have gone out of their way to make us and our kids feel welcome. Always clean with a good selection of yogurt and toppings. Nice to have a go-to spot right here in the neighborhood. 
10124 4 Sloppy, juicy, and delicious. Get the German Shepherd with a side of onion rings, add caramelized onions, and thank me later. 
10125 2 I was underwhelmed. Maybe there was too much hype? Maybe the donuts in my hometown are just exceptional (Chicago)? I bought 5 different types to share with friends. I thought they were all on the dry side. My friends agreed. 
10126 0 Their buffet is a waste of money. Don't even go there, and the food is horrible. I didn't like it. 
10127 3 Solid quality food, not fantastic but provided the alternatives in this area it is a great option. Pretty pricey though. Super nice friendly staff. 
10128 4 Awesome food! Delicious pizza!!! We had chicken with polenta and it was really good!!! Great service!!! 
10129 4 Such great tacos! The guy taking orders was also cooking. He was super busy but still got out my pastor tacos without delay. Plus he was cute. 
10130 2 Great place for lunch. Take my daughter here for lunch here regularly and sit outside. Service is good. Pizza is great...... I am a regular here. 
10131 3 I gave 4 stars because of the charge for parking, as Marriot Elite members shouldn't have to pay for parking. The plus to the hotel is that everyone gets a complimentary breakfast. 
10132 4 This is my favorite food truck at the hitch! Always absolutely delicious, never dissatisfied. 
10133 4 All the reviews were correct!! Great staff and HUGE selection!! Clean friendly environment. Be back!!!!! 
10134 4 One of the best ramens I have ever tried! Perfect broth and noodle firmness Gyoza is crispy and juicy 
10135 1 Came to try this place out, always pass by it on my way from shopping. No big deal ..... When I come to eat BBQ I have high expectations. Short on staff , won't be back. 
10136 4 Best pizza in the state of Massachusetts. Hands down its that simple and I have nothing else to say. 
10137 4 Awesome! If you like seafood just get the fish special. Impossible to go wrong. Also, bag of donuts....INCREDIBLE!!!! 
10138 4 Great place! Food is great, kind of hidden back in a shopping plaza but definitely worth eating here for Thai food! Hidden gem! 
10139 4 Great food! Kind of a divey find. They are moving down the street to a nice brick building with a patio. 
10140 3 Stopped there after a long day walking around vancouver and Capilano park. The place is nice with a great friendly vibe. I got a steak sandwitch (very good) and a beer. The price was also very reasonable. Overall good experience. Definetely recommended 
10141 3 Very cool decor, awesome chips and salsa, killer asada skirt steak tacos. I sat at the bar and the service was great. The mixed drinks looked good so I'll have to try one next time because I'll definitely be back. Shop local! 
10142 2 Really great view/location. We sat outdoors. Mediocre food. A bit pricey. Server not very attentive. Don't order the apple crisp... more like cold stewed apples. Not worthy of a return visit in my opinion. 
10143 2 The bun bo hue has the same broth as the pho. That's a pretty strong sign as to the authenticity of the place. Luckily, the pho broth is decent, but not worth the drive. Atmosphere upstairs is decent, but downstairs is a unimpressive. I won't be back. 
10144 4 Wild Tales has a bit of the same feel as the old Glowbal, which was great to my surprise. We started with a dozen of cushi oysters...fresh and delicious as expected. 
10145 4 Loved their baked cheese cake. If you don't like your cheesecake too sweet and too thick in texture, this is the place to go get your cheese cake. My wife also liked the strawberry crepe that she got. 
10146 1 Big restaurant in South Austin offering fast Mexican fare. Restaurant can get really noisy and is often very busy. Food is just ok, service can be lacking (esp. if they're busy). Not much on atmosphere. Hmm...not much else I can say, wouldn't go back if I had a choice. 
10147 0 They didn't put onions like I asked and it's burnt to crisp, burger taste good but so dag small,,,the shakes are amazing but burger was disappointing 
10148 0 CLOSED. Too bad. We could have used another good Indian eatery in the area. 
10149 2 For the prices, you would think it would clean. NOPE, car was still dirty and left marks. 
10150 2 Good food, nice portions, good service, and reasonable prices. A solid choice for dinner in the North End. 
10151 3 A hidden gem that I happened to stroll by with gorgeous views. Great drink options of wine, tea and smoothies too! 
10152 3 I hate the 'red carpet line out the door' thing - but everything else about Hopboddy is excellent. Their burger selection is excellent - I especially love their Ahi tuna burger. It comes with wasabi honey which is just the best, sprouts, tasty tuna. Can't beat that. 
10153 0 Nasty food. Dirty. Good ice cream. No bathrooms. 
10154 3 We love walking down after dinner in the summer for SG's great gelato, but its best kept secret is their donuts. Truly the best in town. Light, not to greasy, not to sweet and great flavors. The ginger is my favorite! 
10155 4 Just wanted to say that mini cooper shop made us feel comfortable and Bradley you rock thank you for mini Cooper we're loving it you guys are all five-star 
10156 4 I can't stay away. I wish my budget would alow me to eat there daily! Pro's: Great service, clean, EVERYTHING is FRESH and the taste ? Amazing!! Con's: A bit expensive for the decor and the location, they only accept cash or check 
10157 3 This station has the best mix of songs, mostly, with the occassional looser tune negative vibe. I'm a fan with my finger on the change-channel button. 
10158 4 It has become a staple of the Atlanta Skyline. Really stands out at Centennial Park. Can't wait for expansion The ride it's self is rather slow but a must see at least once. 
10159 4 I went to the Travel Clinic today to get some shots for travel to Nepal. I'm very needle- shy. practically needle-phobic, so I was very nervous about it. To my amazement, the shots were virtually painless. I highly recommend Nurse Catherine Sawicki if, like me, you hate to get shots. 
10160 3 Quality mochi ice cream. More flavors, please! Street Fighter II arcade cabinet in the corner. Thoroughly entertaining throwback, but fifty cents a go? Standing fan in the back. It's going to get hot this summer! I will be back. 
10161 1 Good location , room spacious, but the aircon/heater very noisy !. 
10162 4 This may be my new favorite pizza spot... $8 for a personal pizza with as many tasty toppings as you want?! The Nutella and banana is a good way to satisfy your sweet tooth and it's easily enough for two! 
10163 3 Colorful little booths, ok house margaretas($8) great chile rellenos ($9) and floutas($10). Good salsa. Good service. Definitely worth a trip. 
10164 2 This is our favorite to go to Italian restaurant, we love the shrimp Alfredo. The service has never been the best, either they are overwhelmed, irritated, or just not happy to serve you. 
10165 4 Great burgers. Fantastic sweet potato fries. Extremely nice owners. Try the turkey wrap. Try some chipotle mayo on your burger. Like having the whole wheat bun option. Enjoy the hometown atmosphere. Laid back and friendly. 
10166 4 I have no idea why this place doesn't have better ratting. We love everything that we ordered. Our favorite was the swordfish, that was superb, of top of a sunchoke puree was the perfect combination of flavors. The octupus, tuna tartare and the scallops ceviche was amazing too. 
10167 4 Best fried chicken ANYWHERE. I'm from Texas. This stuff crunchily melts in your mouth. It's so good. 
10168 4 Awesome!!! Yummy place right near my house. The spicy chicken momo was delish!!! I hope this place does well. 
10169 3 Recently stayed here and I thought it was great. Great customer service. Clean room and fabulous view. I would definitely stay here again. 
10170 4 A Pilates studio with all you want: reformer classes, 1-on-1 attention, gyrotonic equipment and 5 fabulous instructors that will get you in shape and in healthy movement. I have taken Pilates instructions in many places - this one ranks at the very top! 
10171 3 Great food, service, beer selection, and view. The oysters were amazing, although the clam chowder was just ok. The main negative was the music, sounded like a popular pop radio station. I would definitely come back though if I'm ever in Salem again. 
10172 4 Had the bacon wrapped almond stuffed dates and loved them. Pro tip: They go great with the garlic dill cheese curds from New Seasons. 
10173 4 Been here plenty of times and never disappointed Food is increadible and drinks are on point 
10174 4 Totally exceeded all expectations! I highly recommend doing this while in Boston. The actors are so engaging and knowledgeable, always staying character it makes for a fun afternoon event! Plus you get to have tea at the end of the "show". Great for all ages! 
10175 1 Downtown Historic Sanford is cute and has lots of cute cafes and antique shops, but I was disappointed with the Farmer's Market.....very few vendors, not a lot of variety. 
10176 2 I have been to the Blue Ox three times. I live in Lynn so it isn't very hard for me to get to. The food was OK. The decor and service is great! I love the atmosphere. I would recommend to anyone who wants to have a nice night out. 
10177 4 There's nothing bad to say about this lovely restaurant. The food, staff and atmosphere is always a plus. 
10178 4 What a great place to eat! Huge menu, with a huge list of food options. This place also offers breakfast all day long, and it has an amazing breakfast menu. My girls love the desserts, I recommend the Buckeye Pie! 
10179 4 If you have the app....it makes it so easy to enjoy one of the best, healthiest, and tasty lunches and dinners. Get the app...and enjoy the time saved as well as the food. 
10180 4 Had their white chocolate raspberry pancake and it was just AMAZING!!!!! The place is always packed but the food is worth the wait. Highly recommend 
10181 0 The tacos are a good choice. The Beef ribs are gone and that was major disappointment. If you are into Carpaccio, go somewhere else. They are awful, and they serve it with fruit. The look is nice and service is good. 
10182 4 The food is very good. I can recommend this place with confidence to anyone. Make a reservation as it is almost impossible to walk in. 
10183 4 Fantastic service from Simo Muhammed. He chased is down and shared a discount card with us 
10184 4 TOTAL 5 star! The beer has always been amazing, but this food is made with the same care and quality I remember from Germany. Can't wait to go back! Be sure to order the combination plate and the fondue. 
10185 0 Horrible! Small beds, couldn't get the heat to work properly, nowhere nearby to go for dinner. Will not be back. 
10186 4 I just took the most amazing class!!! I had so much fun and got such an amazing workout!!! Nothing like this in Boston!!! Will definitely be going back again !!! 
10187 4 Best salad I've had in recent memory. The seafood tasted great, and everything was fresh. Highly recommend. 
10188 3 Also sells awesome and sizable breakfast burritos (no potato though) -- get the salsa verde on the side! 
10189 4 First time trying this place and it was amazing. Everything from service to food. Very efficient staff and prices were fair for great seafood! So excited to add another favorite to my list. 
10190 2 Same old chipotle as the rest. Thankfully this location is on the larger size, meaning lots of tables and chairs. The only downside is when the sun is setting if the blinds are not closed, u WILL be blinded if sitting in the wrong spot. 
10191 4 This is my favorite Chinese food in Portland. The decorating is pretty old, but the food is great. I love the shrimp in lobster sauce and the chicken fried rice. 
10192 3 Delicious pizza! Loved the chicken parm slider appetizer and bread pudding dessert. Ambiance is nice, though tables are quite tight when the restaurant is full... it's a bit like dining with your neighbors. 
10193 3 Snow crab legs and the salmon were delicious. Love that they start you off with complimentary hush puppies. Always happy to stop in here for a meal. 
10194 4 Dr. Roger Gafur has been looking after my whole family and I for years now. He is very thorough and gives me great tips for eye health. John is great at keeping my glasses services and working properly. I highly recommend you give them a try. 
10195 2 Had chicken breast. Taste really good. Only the small plate size is too small. A good place to eat not a good place for eat full. 
10196 3 The environment was so friendly, you can chat with strangers in the same booth. I ordered hazelnut coffee, it was so goooood！! 
10197 4 Life saver. While traveling we had an issue with a small batch of clothing and needed it laundered. The staff were helpful, professional and friendly. They quickly got our clothes cleaned up, same day and the price was way less than I would have expected. 
10198 3 I went here after an EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) event - pretty interesting to have a speakeasy-like setup underneath a hostel. I ordered from an African American bartender who made me a "Baptist" - good drink, good fun, recommend it! 
10199 4 What a cute little business! Maggie rocked my haircut! I can't wait to go back oh and the price is right!!! 
10200 4 Hidden gem in the heart of Boston! The lady is very friendly, funny and pleasant to interact with. I regularly get my suits dry cleaned here, and tailor suit pants to the right length. Cheap and fast service. 
10201 4 Favorite new sandwich spot in town! Brought my daughters in and they both got the Hobomock. Fair portions and prices! Very polite staff as well. Will be back! 
10202 4 The breakfast burger is the best. Very friendly. Caution the Nola is excellent but HOT! 
10203 3 Predictably great food! It can be very busy/loud on weekends and it takes awhile to get the checks with groups. 
10204 4 This is my favorite steakhouse. Best steak in town. Love this yummy place. The Porterhouse steak is scrumptious and the servers are first class. 
10205 4 I normally bathe my dog myself but this time I decided to treat her to something special. I also had them trim her nails. She was SO happy when I picked her up! I will definitely be going back! 
10206 3 Short, but nice course in Newton. Decent value, especially for residents. Accuracy is important and rewarded. I would suggest taking a cart the first time around - some of hte holes are hilly! 
10207 4 Great place to live. Services and facilities are top notch. Super happy with the sound protection in the apartments and excellent maintenance of the property 
10208 2 One.of my favorite pdx Starbucks. The staff is always friendly and courteous. For the area its really really clean and the.drinks are nice and.strong. Love it!! 
10209 4 We came here for late night happy hour. The guys had whiskey on the rocks, gals had whiskey cocktails! All were excellent! The pimento cheese and the nacho apps were delicious! 
10210 0 I wish i could give this establishment a zero. An employee here, this evening, called me a CUNT. Classy establishment. Enough said. 
10211 4 "It's some damn good soup I must say. But stop telling everyone. It's hard enough to get there before they sell out" a quoted from a fellow yelper (an elite! :-)) after I checked-in on Facebook...enough said. 
10212 2 Good sushi, but really unfriendly and the price was not so good for sushi in Vancouver as well...not gonna be my favourite sushi place here 
10213 4 The most perfect gel manicure I've ever gotten and a great price too. They also have a deal where you get $5 off if you pay with cash for a pedi and gel mani. They massage you with hot stones during the pedicure too! Will definitely be going back. 
10214 4 Skip the over-hyped wacky donut shop and treat yourself to Blue Star. It's on my go-to list to show visitors around PDX. Can't go wrong with the lemon poppy and the passion fruit is surprisingly delicious. 
10215 4 I am obsessed with this place! Their beer selection, random groceries and coffee are phenomenal. The sandwiches are made with so much love. I always get the turkey and am never disappointed. Can't wait for their second location to open! 
10216 4 The food here is always really good and they work quick. I find it a little pricier then other joints but the quality it worth it. 
10217 4 Locally sourced wild game hamburgers that are ridiculously good. T he elk burger comes with caramelized onions, butter lettuce and cherry demi-glaze. The bison burger was definitely my favorite with feta cheese, bacon and spinach. The patty had a nice zing to it without being too spicy. 
10218 0 http://www.sushi-time.com/index.html Is this your website? Because it says "fresh sushi" and what I got today is loaded with preservatives. 
10219 2 Good main courses and friendly, though understaffed, service. The banchan is less than average though. 
10220 4 Best authentic Mexican food here in SW. Orlando. All local Floridians please support this awesome restaurant. I love everything I have tried. Their tacos are amazing. 
10221 2 Kinda dead for a Saturday tbh. The sauce on the prime rib was good. Can't say the same thing for the prime rib tho. Employees were nice. The barrel theme inside got a little old tho. 
10222 4 I dream about these things! There's so many to choose from. I just go up to the menu, close my eyes, and point to one with each hand. I hv never been disappointed. They're tasty & I swear they're good for u too! 
10223 2 This place is the slowest chick fil a on the planet. I feel like they could possibly be understaffed??? Idk all i know is every time i come, it takes 15 + minutes to clear 5-7 cars causing the line to be wrapped around the building consistently. 
10224 2 This place is more cozy than the food is good, but it's an interesting change of pace and has a nice atmosphere. I'll probably be back here on a nice day to hang out under their ivy-covered outdoor-seating terrace and get some work done. 
10225 3 I love This place. Good sushi, good entrees, creative drinks. Parking is rough, but that's downtown Delaware in general. My only real complaint is service, especially when ordering cocktails can be very slow. Seriously order two drinks... 
10226 0 This review is for their Ob/Gyn through Harvard Vanguard. It is a very unprofessional office, stay away. 
10227 0 First the appointment was rescheduled and I was not notified. A really great way to to treat a new customer. Not happy i bought an extended warranty for my new Samsung range if this is going to be how I am going to be treated. This really sucks SAMSUNG!!!! 
10228 4 Friendly staff, good food, cheap beer, no cover - ever. 
10229 0 I didn't even want to give one star employees were rude and as soon as I sat down roaches appear i was so disgusted! 
10230 4 I love this place! Great service and an excellent patio. The food and margaritas good too. 
10231 2 There's always a long line although the meat is delicious the bread is too hard and doesn't compliment the sandwich as a whole 
10232 4 Amazing!! Biscuits were the best I ever had and the waffle top notch. Very unique menu options. Large portions. Prices ok but everything in Boulder is pricy. Super long wait but hats expected too with a good restaurant on a weekend day. 
10233 3 A solid restaurant! Selected the Pork Phad Thai had several layers of flavors. Also selected the chicken skewers... Peanut sauce tasted homemade and was fantastic! 
10234 4 Ordered "The Cricket" sub kale for wheat grass. It was amazing. I loved the decor and vibe of Juiceheads. You have to try the Vegan Chilli if you. Very delicious. I wish I had tried one bowls. 
10235 4 This place is amazing for breakfast and brunch. The waffles with fried chicken was the best breakfast I've had in a very long time. I would highly recommend trying this place. 
10236 4 The food is amazing. The employees are awesome. The owner, John, is the bomb. The croissants/pastries are super yummy. Go there! Support our local business. 
10237 4 They were delicious heavenly burgers that filled our stomachs just right. The atmosphere was perfect for this burger joint! We will eat here all the time! 
10238 4 Loved the hotel. The staff were super friendly, from front desk to all servers and front door personal. Very home feeling and warm. Breakfast was super. Gym and the pool are awesome and I love the Seymour Pub next door. By far the best stay in North Vancouver! 
10239 3 Came here to see Lachlan Peterson in June (2016). Great space! Hope to go back! 
10240 4 Amazing steak tips and tacos! The atmosphere is great. Love the hole in a wall place! Highly recommended 
10241 0 Chicken lollipop is really like fried pakoda. Schezwan rice is not upto the mark. I won't recommend it to anyone. 
10242 2 customer service ehhh, 3 star because pretzel was fresh out the oven. 
10243 0 Ordered a large dark combo, and the chickens were swimming in oil. There were so much oil that even after the toast on the bottom was soaked, the basket was filled with it. Same with my coworker's basket as well. Others got the sandwiches, and they were okay. 
10244 4 Everything we had was fabulous; fish tacos, cheese quesadilla, fajita tacos, shredded beef tacos, and cheese dip. The BEST things were the enchiladas verdes! The verdes sauce was the best I have ever had. The salsa was fresh and tasty. 
10245 4 I could eat the migas breakfast taco and the al pastor taco every day. We went on a taco crawl and this place was the only place we gave more than 3 stars too. What separates this place from most is the homemade flour tortillas. 
10246 3 Cute little market. Loved that it was easy to park close by and it was not super crowded. I will defintely be going again 
10247 4 I wouldn't buy a car any where else. Great service, great people, and great prices. I have bought 3 cars from here and service them here as well. 
10248 0 The ambiance may look appealing but the service is very poor. If you liked to be ignored this the place to go. Bring your friends and neighbor wallet way too pricey for what they serve. Limited menu and poor service. 
10249 2 The green beans mixed with spaetzle and bacon may be one of the best side dishes ever devised. The Reuben made w a big pink slab o' sausage was just OK. Good service and tasty beer. Worth another visit next time I'm in Columbus. 
10250 4 Great spot! Tasty chickpea dip and a bunch of really cool records. Imagine the shop from High Fidelity with less pompousness and beers on tap (the Cascade Lakes Mosaic IPA was delicious). I'll definitely hit this place up next time I'm in town. 
10251 4 This is a fantastic authentic Italian. The best pasta dishes (lasagna if my favorite) in Boston. No need to go to the North End, this is bellissimo! There is something fantastic here for everyone in the family! Great wine selection too!! 
10252 4 I absolutely love this place. My tech is super efficient and works with me. I forgot to remind her that I needed a full set instead of a fill and she accommodated me the very next morning. Sam is amazing. Ask for her! 
10253 4 Best realtor in Portland!! She worked hard to sell my house quickly and got me too dollar!! Thanks Maria for everything, your hard work allowed me to sell my home and start living my dream!! 
10254 4 Haven't even checked in but Angela in reception has been wonderful to work with! She was patient and kind over the phone, looking forward to my stay. 
10255 4 Food was delicious. View was great. Lots of fun drinks to choose from. Took family to celebrate Daddy Day. All four of us had a great time. 
10256 3 I've been stopping in regularly for a couple years. I like their pizza, subs, and salads. The staff are very friendly. And orders are ready pretty quick. 
10257 0 Awful. Pizza sauce tasted like it was from a can, "garlic" bread had no flavor and the salad we were given was full of wilted old lettuce and hair. GROSS! Don't go here, the restaurant is run down and scuzzy. Will not be going back! 
10258 2 The service sucks! The woman at the register is rude and has a very poor attitude! The food was very good, but it took long for the food to come out & when I asked how long, the woman said "I don't know".. super careless. 
10259 4 Mmmm... came back here again on this visit to Portland... Yummy curry rice bowl...Mmmm!!! 
10260 4 Great selection of beer. Really enjoyed the ambience and a good place to relax after a long day. Great staff at the bar who know how to strike conversations. 
10261 4 Awesome theatre, love the service and loved the fact that you can text a number to get a free small popcorn. This place is super clean and very eventful. 
10262 4 I could write a long winded commentary about how tender this was and how flaky that was but I don't feel like it. All I got to say is Damn Good and I will leave it at that. 
10263 1 Hostess was terrible. Did not want to be there and obviously wanted everyone to know. Food was okay and only good thing about that restaurant was the free chips. 
10264 3 Great for group dining. Great local sourcing, fantastic wine list. 
10265 3 Great hangover food. Cheap tacos. One taco can serve as a meal. 
10266 4 Best Thai in the bus!! The only thing better than the food is the owner "Z"! Please do yourself a favor and visit this amazing little place!!! 
10267 4 I switched from my previous dentist and could not be happier. Dr. Richardson is very friendly and her staff have always been super welcoming. Stephanie the hygienist is thorough and personable. I actually look forward to dentist visits. 
10268 3 I've been for their spa pedicure a few times now and am impressed. The sterile look of the sign out front does not match the spacious and modern, comfortable look inside. The technicians and staff are friendly and the price is right. Will give the manicure a try next time! 
10269 0 Quality of food is good but a rip off, just be beware if you order food to go, your California rolls will hardly have any crab in it. They stuffed in too much cucumber and avocado in it. Also, the tuna rolls were not fresh. SMH. 
10270 3 It's hard to find really authentic German food, unless you go here. Get ready for brats and beer cuz this place gives an all access eating pass to German cuisine without the 6 hour flight across the Atlantic. 
10271 4 This place is simply fantasic. They have great food, great service AND reasonable prices. The waffles are excellent. ...in odd combos that pique your curiosity and taste great. Eggs done right, fresh veggies, decent coffee. We try and go whenever we're in the area. 
10272 4 Excellent service! Tiana is energetic and clearly a pro at her craft. Her studio is clean, spacious, and has a comfortable / cozy feel. I got a deep tissue massage and my whole body felt amazing afterwards. Thank you!! 
10273 0 Food is not that great, but they are charging you like crazy people. They will give you a check with 17% tip added on top of taxed total, you don't even have a chance to express how disappointed you are at the food on the tip 
10274 4 Did a lash tint and lash lift at rouge and it turned out amazing. I'm ditching mascara and opting for these services from now on. I highly recommend rouge and their wonderful staff 
10275 3 The donuts here are very good. This is a must go when in portland. I would recommend the blueberry and glazed. 
10276 3 I really liked Papa Razzi. I'm not big on the chain restaurants, but I enjoyed this place. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. I got the cavatappi affumicati (pasta with eggplant, cheese, and tomatoes) and it was yummeriffic. 
10277 4 They have amazing and quick service.. i gor the SNS with ombre finish and absolutely loved it .. 
10278 3 Good burger, always attentive service (we've only eaten on the full service side). Wouldn't even think of going here on a weekend....it's good, but not 3-hour wait good. The onion rings are awesome, the "adult milkshake" is very good. 
10279 0 The problem was not 2 yrs ago. The problem was 9 days ago. But thank you for reviewing my post. 
10280 3 Great little market. Sat outside with a bottle of wine. Great view of the lake across the street. 
10281 4 Always enjoy the experience, service and food here. Plan on visiting during off peak times if you want to sit within a reasonable amount of time. 
10282 0 This was really, really bad. I ordered the the Chicago combo. Cold, squishy bun. Barely warm dog. Ice-cold relish and tomato and pickle, couldn't find the sport pepper. Fries limp and cool. I ate about a third of it and tossed it. The Diet Pepsi was pretty good, though. 
10283 4 Hands down best pizza in Boston. Sausage and garlic pizza is my favorite. I just keep coming back for more! 
10284 4 Great burgers, fantastic fish sandwich, world's most awesome fries and top it off with a nice beer selection. Pure heaven. 
10285 0 Would not recommend this place. Crepes dry. Rushed service.. first and last time. If you are looking for sit down, table service and traditional crepe, this isn't the place. 
10286 4 This is an awesome brewery! Brewers are super friendly and knowledgeable. Beers are distinct and unique. A good time with good beer. 
10287 4 Very Austin place. Captures the spirit of what the city is and has to offer. A must see when visiting Austin. 
10288 2 Agree with previous reviews, great BBQ but little pricey. One side, two slices of brisket, 2 ribs and my husband had same but with potato salad and 1 drink it was 30$ bucks!! Whoa. Patio seating is nice. 
10289 3 Delicious. Absolutely great. Wait was only about 10-15 min around 11:30 am on a Saturday. The price was a bit steep but quality and taste was on point. Potato and beef hash were cooked to perfection. 
10290 3 Drunken noodle was bomb, steamed veggies and shrimp also were good. Only thing missing was more sauce! Ask for some on the side :) 
10291 3 Ive been going here for almost 8 years now. Get your hair cut by Mike if he is there. Apparently he now typically only works mournings. 
10292 4 Came here for dinner, and really enjoyed the experience! The food was delicious, and came out quickly. We got the samosa chaat, vegetable biryani, and the murg (chicken) curry, along with the lassi. The service was great. Will definitely be coming back often! 
10293 4 You need to try the Thai Smoked Chicken hash and Steak and Potatoes. They also have the best fish tacos you're ever going to have. I could come here every night. You know what ...? I might. Don't take my table! 
10294 4 Everything was great!! The view, service, drink and food was amazing! I've already sent people that way and they have all agreed 
10295 3 Great space, great cafe and teas. I will be back. D.patnod. Acup H. Square. 
10296 3 They just remodeled the whole place and it looks so much better! Staff is usually really nice always very helpful. Clean and very well stocked. Gas service is also great here. Fast and easy. They have tons of lanes and service people! 
10297 4 This place is as good as it gets for us and our puppy. It's cheap (donation based), friendly and nice. You can't go wrong with that. If we had to go to a regular vet, we would be broke by now for sure. 
10298 0 Arranged a cab to the airport for a specific time and they never showed up. When I dialed the number it transferred to a cab company in Boston. Won't be calling lucky 7 again. 
10299 0 Even for resort food, this was TERRIBLE! Everything from the food to cage fighting on the blaring TV. Would expect more from a Sheraton. 
10300 4 It was great.The green beans were especially yummy with the garlic and soy sauce.We had a large group of people.It was soooooooo yummy(:!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
10301 4 Party of 8. We were seated in private room with Windows on 3 sides. Best harbor views of anyplace in Boston. Food & Drinks were good. Swordfish, Lobster Rolls, Calimari, all done well. Hats off to Nicole, our server, very charming, took good care of everyone. A Very Enjoyable Night. 
10302 4 Best resaurant in salem! Has resonable prices and hotel wide variety of of items on menu. Best atmosphere and open late. Constant pleasant staff Great intimate bar. Best Halloween parties any where 
10303 3 Good service , nice location and nice staff, first time, I went, MUSIC was SO LOUD, so I stopped going ... yesterday I decides to give it second chance , music was not so loud , so I was able to have meeting and do my work. Hope they conyinue 
10304 0 Great waiter (great personality) "Rell" but food was very cold both times he brought my wings and tacos out. The manager was very apologetic but overall the food was grossly disappointing!! I will definitely not be returning to this location!! 
10305 4 Saw Casablanca at the brand new digital movie theater upstairs at the TCAN. Came out in the middle of last Sunday's snowstorm for the show and it was perfectly worth it. Great venue. Will be back soon! 
10306 4 For the price, it's hard to imagine a better deal for breakfast. The bagel sandwiches are delicious and quite large. They do a bang-up job with their coffee too. 
10307 0 I don't understand how you make it to eighty years old without learning how to talk to people. Old African American woman needs to get out of 'customer service' and learn common decency. 
10308 4 had some pain in my neck before and felt so much better afterwards. prices aren't crazy either. i highly recommend it 
10309 0 Wanted tacos. Ordered tacos. Tacos came out cold. How do you fuck up tacos!? On a Tuesday? At Mexican restaurant? Made by actual Mexicans? 
10310 4 Love this place!!! It's a beautiful, spacious studio, and all of the instructors are so nice and helpful. Everyone is very welcoming to newbies. Comfortable yet challenging environment for everyone, from beginners to the most advanced yogis. I highly recommend this studio! 
10311 4 Excellent customer service, very knowledgeable staff, clean and sophisticated clinic. Christine Blick is an outstanding Doctor I recommend her! 
10312 1 Food is good, atmosphere is amazing but service is consistently bad. We have felt that they wanted customers there. It's such a strange thing! 
10313 4 This is one of our favorite places to go. The food is always top notch and the service is great too. They always go that little extra mile when celebrating a special occasion, too, which makes you feel valued as a customer. 
10314 3 They gave one of my coworkers a bunch of free egg rolls because they said they were training new people. They were delicious! One batch was spicy, the other was normal. They had plenty of meat. The only caveat: the spicy is SPICY. 
10315 4 Perfectly good place to meet an associate, do a little work, or have a casual lunch. Friendly staff. Convenient location close to 85. Recently expanded. Can get crowded a lunchtime. Breakfast, seldom a problem. This is my go-to place. 
10316 3 My girlfriend and I had our first official date here. We have been meaning to go back but it looks like we missed our chance. I am sad to see that this place is no longer open, we both really liked the meal we had there. 
10317 0 Would give 0 if the app allowed. Through course of week, they straight didn't show for 3/4 calls and were 30 minutes late on the last. Ended up tipping the concierge extra to use a diff company 
10318 4 Absolutely loved this place. Been there only a handful of times due to living so far away but everytime I'm in the area, I make it a point to stop there for some coffee 
10319 4 Been getting my hair cut here for almost ten years. It's an old school, straightforward, competent barbershop. Actually, they could be total artists, and I would not know because my hair is so easy to cut. But for what I want, they are exactly right and totally fair. 
10320 1 Watch out for the mice! They actually have a name for one- Jerry. Beer is good though. 
10321 4 Just like home! I love how fresh it is. I'm from Washington and I'll definitely be back! 
10322 1 Meager toppings, poorly made. Employees did not seem to read online order. I asked for extra sauce and light cheese. I got extra cheese and light sauce. This is not the first time, so I am unlikely to go back to this location. 
10323 1 We went in during the farmers market, which the place was slammed. I think the drip coffee had been sitting a while, really tasted watered down or not very strong. Otherwise a nice, pleasant little spot. Just didn't enjoy my coffee flavor or strength. 
10324 3 A very nice find on a rainy night -- despite its location in a shopping center this spot felt very tranquil, sushi was very good, fresh, some inventive rolls. Attentive service. 
10325 3 All 3 dishes we had were delicious, very hearty and savory. I will be back. Making it a point to try the beef momos! Also the hand pulled noodle soup is great here! 
10326 1 The beef noodle soup is very light , not very good local taste, need to improve the broth. And the price doesn't worth the taste, I would recommend to go other restaurants if you are craving for some Taiwanese or Chinese food. However, the service there is great!! 
10327 1 It's pho but kind of on the expensive side. Spring rolls come out fast but are kinda soggy sometimes so they don't always make to order. 
10328 4 We area business here in Wilmington, and have ordered breakfast delivered for our staff. Great half bagel sandwiches, chock full with fresh eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, or just plain cheese. Delicious, and great coffee and juice. Try their catering it's perfect. Linda C at CLASS Inc 
10329 2 I first came here when my sister was in town. She loves this place, but not somewhere I would think a guy would shop at. To my surprise they do have guy stuff here. I managed to pick up a wallet and some readers here at a reasonable price. 
10330 0 This is probably the worst casino I have ever been in, very poor service only one place to eat. I would never gamble here nor will I ever go to another show here 
10331 4 Everytime I come, they have great flavors. None too sweet or tart. Loved the strawberry such a natural flavor! Toppings are great too wish they had more chocolate options. 
10332 4 The apple fritter was amazing! We wish we would have gotten there early as there were only 3 donut options left by 3pm. Good thing there is a location in our hometown of LA 
10333 4 Really big fan of this spot, it's tucked away but a hidden gem. Great location right in Somerville, their beers were excellent and the space is full of vendors to checkout. There was live music when we were there and we had a great time. 
10334 4 Apna Bazaar has a great selection and friendly staff. The prices are reasonably economical. The restaurant in the back has incredible snacks to finish off the shopping! We got the pani poori kit, and had a fun time making pani poori with friends. 
10335 4 Very comfortable, friendly waitresses/waiters and it mixes 2 great things: Food quality and price. I have been coming to this restaurant for 3 months and I always find seats. The food is excellent! This is definitely my favorite Vietnamese Restaurant in Boston. 
10336 4 Looks unimpressive from outside but amazing food and service! 
10337 3 I've been to this clubs many times over the years and have always found that the dancers there are among the best looking in the metro area. The environs are mildly divey but not bad. I only wish I lived closer. 
10338 4 Aimee is the sweetest! She always makes sure I'm comfortable and does such a great job. She's awesome and makes my experience relaxing and as painless as possible for my wax! 
10339 0 Management acts weird when i walk in all he did was keep looking at me like i was going to do some kind of crime after that never went back 
10340 4 Really yummy food, really nice staff. I recommend this to everyone whether they're vegan/vegetarian, or not! Really happy my friend showed me this hidden gem 
10341 0 Sunday night disaster! Cook staff completely incompetent. Worse burgers in history. Sorry, you lost us as customers. Was here once before and it was great, tonight was a deal killer. Owners of Oaks Bottom - fire your Sunday cook staff. They screwed up 2 burgers! Not rocket science! 
10342 3 The food was fresh and tasty. They have options for the kids. We had a party of eight and were seated promptly at our reservation time. The service was fantastic and the price was incredibly reasonable. This is definitely a gem of a place to eat inside of the parks. 
10343 4 the owner is Very friendly! Food is very flavorful! And they give you a lot for your money! Jumbo subs are HUGE! If your in the area I would recommend white sport 
10344 0 Service: poor Atmosphere: poor, loud, messy People: impatient Never again. 
10345 3 Come here if you want some round melon balls and soft ice. Sweet with milk on top. Seasonal fruits for the mood. 
10346 4 Food was great, services was excellent, hot and sour soup was amazing. They just kept bringing food to the table. Prices were very reasonable. I would definitely come here again. The young girl who waited on us was nice and personable and that was very refreshing. 
10347 4 Awesome staff! Great for large parties. EVERYONE in our party (of 17) LOVED their food. Our server was very professional and attentive. We didn't have one complaint! 
10348 4 Fabulous wine flights, great service, divine cheese plates, and chocolate fondue to finish a perfect dinner with friends :) 
10349 4 Love the food and service here. If you go on Tuesday they have 1/2 off bottles of wine! 
10350 1 Very disappointed! I ordered the 3 shrimp and 1 crab cake. The food was bland and the prices were high for what you got. The crab cake was the size of a silver dollar. I won't be going back to this restaurant. 
10351 4 Love this place, I have yet to have anything that I did not enjoy from here. I love to get cakes from here for birthdays I especially love the strawberry cream cake but everything looks wonderful. The only down side is that it's a bit cramped and constantly busy. 
10352 3 Amazing dine in! Great butter chicken lots of big pieces of chicken and heavy on the cream. Great shahi paneer and fish pakoras. Nice naan. When you order take out they provide you with a small order of salad which is a nice accompaniment. Beautiful upscale atmosphere 
10353 4 My family and I love love love this place! Never had a complaint and been going here for 10 years! Great food! Great staff! 
10354 4 Fantastic, we just left after 1 week stay. Great experience, beautiful hotel, super clean and extra nice and professional staff. Heated pool and jacuzzi open till 12, toddlers pool also amazing Very good "tuna melt" and drinks at the pool bar. Highly recommending. 
10355 0 Worst couple slices i've had in Austin thus far. Maybe i got the leftovers being it was like 2:30? It tasted like day old frozen Za. If they had a public restroom i'd pull a top-shelf. 
10356 3 This is the kind of burger that you will always feel guilty for eating, but just can't resist every time. I have been to this location many times and I will go again and again in the future. Oh, and if you get fries, expect a truckload! 
10357 4 Booked the cruise for my friend and I's 26th birthday party. everything about the night was amazing and was very pleased with the outcome. We did the night cruise, which i highly recommend as well since the lighting on the boat was nice and the weather was alot cooler. 
10358 3 This place is so cheap it boggles the mind. You can get trendy going-out clothes for next to nothing. Obviously not the best quality stuff, but with these prices that doesn't matter. 
10359 3 Good food but give you too much food. If you like a lot of food this is the place for you. They give you double the food you should be eating. Must admit the yogurt and fruit is my favorite. 
10360 0 Not authentic at all, chicken shawrma taste random, i even cant taste the chicken Plus tooooo pricy !!! 
10361 3 Good grub, good drinks, friendly peeps and kewl atmosphere 
10362 4 Small, but delicious beer selection. Had the Slow Ride and it was perfect. Very pretty view, obviously, being at Oasis. Very large, lots of seating which is a rarity for an Austin brewery. Friendly staff. No complaints. 
10363 4 I live in LA for 2 years now but AM still craving their Pound Cake!! yes it's that Delish! 
10364 2 Decent food, it's more on the expensive side though. If you're vegan watch out for some of the options, as the thai options have fish sauce in them. They were giving out samples and it was not marked as having fish sauce. 
10365 4 The pizza is fantastic. We are new to the neighborhood and happy that we have a new go-to when it comes to picking up a pizza on the way home after a busy day. We've eaten in as well, but just in the bar. No disappointment there either. 
10366 0 Went for the Sunday brunch and there was plenty of food but it was a buffet, as one would expect, but the food was cold and tasteless. Have had better dinners there than the brunch experience. 
10367 4 Love it - delicious, inexpensive and very clean. They might consider turning their music down a little but otherwise, this place is perfect. 
10368 3 Great spot & food, but we went on their second Sunday brunch/DJ offering and they were a bit understaffed, but I know they are working out the kinks. I'd love to see their full menu offered on Sunday's once noon hits:) 
10369 0 This place has no redeeming qualities. Everyone says it is good for when you're drinking, but if that is the case, I am going to consider quitting drinking. This was possibly the worst prepared food I have ever purchased. 
10370 2 The food is fine, alcohol is decent and the service can be great or awful. The bouncer is ridiculous. 
10371 1 super over priced. i ordered a grilled cheese sanwich for my son and it cost over 7 bucks. its just cheese and bread!!! 
10372 4 For what it is, a local sub/pizza joint, Nick's is great. Big menu, lots of cold/hot subs, pizza, salads, etc.. Excellent pizza. Huge steak subs. Fast service. Delivery service is new to 2009/2010 and can be spotty so picking up may be recommended. 
10373 3 Beer and burger special for $5.95. Best lunch special in boston! 
10374 4 Loved it. Everything we ordered was excellent incl. duck, sweet and sour pork, chicken corn soup, fried onion pancakes, bbq spare ribs, pork dumplings. Service was good and restaurant was clean and pleasant. 
10375 3 I'm a fan! A lot of choices but I went for the signature spicy tuna burrito. Huge roll made me so full. Except for the tuna, the roll was packed with fresh goodies, picked ginger, seaweed, lettuce ect. Will definitely be back 
10376 3 The beet salad and calamari appetizer was delicious. The service was excellent very attentive. Would highly recommend this restaurant! 
10377 3 Food was great this time. Sometimes it is hit or miss. The music is much too loud and not fitting to the setting. 
10378 3 I liked the fact that they accepted my last minute appointment, I happened to be in the area and needed a pedi ASAP. The service was excellent, my feet look amazing :) On this occasion I chose the service which included a massage and it felt great! 
10379 4 They're always clutch and nice. I've had all 4 tires either patched or replaced stemming from a friends recommendation and they haven't let me down. Also the affordability and friendly environment is a plus. 
10380 3 I can't wait to try the breads from this bakery....I bought the Pineapple Bun and the Red Bean Mochi Bun. They were about $1.35/one. No seating area and difficult to find parking. 
10381 0 Went for massage. Don't think the therapist had any clue what she was doing. All I got was a good slathering of oil. Complete waste of time and money 
10382 3 Spinach artichoke dip was honestly the best I've ever had. And Eric N was my bartender, he was super attentive and personable! Great experience! 
10383 4 Love it here! I usually try things on the "specials" menu. My favorites are the crispy fish fillet with black bean sauce and the spicy string beans. The staff is great. The decor is funky and fun original art done by the owner. Have a mai tai and enjoy! 
10384 3 One of my absolute favorite restaurants! HUGE plates for a good price. Always enough to take some home. The only thing I'm not a big fan of here is there Pho. Kind of bland. Other than that, love. 
10385 3 Great lunch! Large portions!!! Tastes wonderful! Compound butter addictive! Turned me around on Brussel sprouts! Would come back if i lived in Austin! 
10386 3 Solid Buffalo Burger. Grass fed and tasty burger for a decent price. I toured the kitchen and all the ingrediants are fresh. Love it for lunch. 
10387 4 The food is amazing. I have lived in Texas on a border city of Mexico and the food compares closely. Very authentic. They even have horchata! 
10388 0 The retail store is fine, but for some reason they've given the login and password of their social media presence to some pro-Trump, alt right white supremacist. It seems "off brand" to me, for a record story in a progressive place like Portland. 
10389 4 Love this place! First time coming. Excellent service from the beginning to the end. Food was great. Our bartender Ashley was amazing. Will be back soon. 
10390 4 This is such a well run establishment with really friendly staff, good food, and a great atmosphere. Great neighborhood spot. Their house burger is killer. I crave it from time to time 
10391 4 Great charcuterie and cheese plate! Amazing whiskey sour. Friendly staff. Cool place for happy hour. 
10392 3 Try this place the first time. Pretty good. Had coffee and Hungarian Goulash soup and ApplePie French toast. Price is good. Taste is good too. Place looks clean. Will be back to try other food on the menu 
10393 4 I really like this place. The atmosphere is great. They have a good selection of teas which is what I always for. Katie recommended the mango black. She was very friendly and helpful. Thanks Katie! 5 stars all around! 
10394 4 Amazing food, I originally went for Portland dining month. It was so good we went back. The waiter was a bit slow and wanted to take our plates early. The quality of food made up for the waiter. 
10395 2 Went on a theater night so of course it was packed and noisy. Food was 4 stars, maybe even higher, but service was pretty average. 
10396 2 Started off pretty good. The food was good but a little too heavy on the cheese and salt. Service started off good but then it slowed down. My marker for good service is when there is no empty drink on the table for another round. 
10397 4 My favourite sushi place! Cheap, so tasty, efficient service, nice environment!! In addition, there are many house special dishes which are extremely yummy. Try out this store and you will go back again. 
10398 4 Great gym! Right off 3a, very clean and has lots of good machines. Cant beat the price!! 
10399 4 Really great roast beef sandwiches, reasonably priced. Eat in or to go. No decor, so you come here for the roast beef. 
10400 4 The calamari is so good. Tempura style I would say. Also like the wild mushroom omelet. Dishes are small so you can really try a lot. Will visit next time! 
10401 4 The restaurant looks friendly and casual with a style. I tried smoked duck and it was fabulous. 
10402 1 Employees should wear gloves. They come from back room and don't wash hands. Manager was not customer service friendly. 
10403 4 Favorite ramen place, and favorite jinya location by far. Natasha was super nice and informative about each dish. Overall great experience:) 
10404 1 I was pretty disappointed. Granted, we went for the lunch buffet. So maybe the full-service menu is better. But the food here was really lacking a wow-factor. It was fine, I'm not sad we went, but I won't be going again. 
10405 3 Awesome food. Whenever we go it is not busy at all, and the service is good. I love the pad Thai, the pineapple rice, and the red coconut curry- all must-try's!!! 
10406 1 Great food. Rarely open. Inconsistent hours and when I inquired about that I was told to call before I come. I like to know when I'm craving something good that I can count on my favorite places to be open. 
10407 4 Always really friendly and delicious good southern style breakfast choices. Within walking distance of our house so a special treat after we go to the park. 
10408 2 Very clean but service wouldn't crack a smile. Ordered egg flower soup which was bland, and egg roll wasn't too bad but not great. Might go back. 
10409 4 Great place clean awesome food maybe a bit pricey but was still worth it. had just opened when I went there a few months ago. am looking forward to another visit. 
10410 0 Never came to took order. We have 2 babies and waited and waited. Walked out There are plenty of waitresses there too! One even came by to tell us to move from our booth. This place is small so it's not like there are a lot of tables! 
10411 4 The whole Noche experience was wonderful from start to finish! The service was top notch, our server overheard it was my birthday and came out with dessert! The plantain chips were delicious, the grllled romaine salad was awesome, the paella was some of the best! Highly recommend! 
10412 4 this is the only place in the world that calls themselves "world famous" and is actually world famous, oh my goodness. this place is the absolute best place in the world!!!!!!! chicken was juicy, spicy, perfection! dessert was literally so good!!!! 
10413 4 Thank you Taylor Florist for being able to trust you. I am in California and I called for roses to be sent to my mother in law in Mass in sympathy. they were so beautiful. Thank you again Lynda Leonard 
10414 3 We've been twice to Furniture World and it's always a breeze. They work with you on price, offer a wide selection and don't consistently hound you while you're trying out 42 different couches. It's affordable and easy and delivery was a piece of cake. 
10415 4 Our cashier Sam was great! Their staff seems very knowledgeable and willing to lend a hand. 
10416 4 Went there today after being referred by someone at The Herb Shoppe on Hawthorne. She said they had a really good selection of herbs and spices, which they do, and I fiiiiinally found Ceylon Cinnamon! Rad store. 
10417 3 I liked it. Good service. Reasonable food. Good value. I little something different. 
10418 3 If you are a Curious George, the curious little monkey, fan then you must stop here. There is a small store in New Orleans but this one is HUGE. It's right there by the metro line so you can't miss it. 
10419 4 I ate there on a Wednesday for lunch. I had the Miso soup, which was excellent. I had the Japanese Bento Box "Chilean Bass". Every component was perfectly prepared. The service was quick and friendly. Our waitress was excellent. I would definitely visit this restaurant again. 
10420 1 Okay place, unexpectedly decent wine. It was empty when we went, so it felt nice to have such a huge space to ourselves. Other than that, nothing particularly remarkable. 
10421 2 Slooow service and have already run out of products ie. chai and pumpkin syrup and they are a new facility. I'm sure they will improve, the more experience they have. 
10422 4 Lisa did such an excellent job with my cat-eye full set! This was my first experience with an eyelash extension service and I was so pleased with the outcome! My extensions look so natural and are so lightweight. Will definitely be coming back for fills!!! 
10423 2 I found cool vintage bracelets, but most of the vintage clothes/boots I easily found in the local thrift stores around town. Doesn't hurt to check out what they have in stock. 
10424 4 Fresh, healthy, delicious authentic, different, superb service, nice decor, a great experience 
10425 3 Cru has a really great burger! Really great, with hashbrowns to boot. I would have never found it, but It im glad a buddy turned me on to it. 
10426 2 Good but nothing special. I was drawn in by the hype. Unfortunately the cappuccino was nothing special--the coffee was ordinary, not robust. Also the advice to get the chocolate croissant "warmed" did not work out. They microwaved it and that made the pastry chewy... Oh well, still a fun place. 
10427 3 Cute atmosphere- beautiful porch. Portions were huge. Staff was friendly. Would return. 
10428 4 Good gyro in a cute little building that looks like a house. Very fresh salad! I will come here again when in Austin. 
10429 4 Friendly staff and the best gourmet donuts around. The lemon poppyseed cake donut is second to none. 
10430 4 Cute, clean and quick! Glad I found somewhere close to home! The staff was nice and I like the loyalty program...now if only they could figure how to make their services pain free! 
10431 4 Todd did an amazing job, I'll definitely recommend and surely come in again. Thank you! 
10432 4 Delicious!!! Very reasonably priced and the service was great. Ethiopian is my favorite and this was some of the best I've had!!! 
10433 4 Amazing coffee. I tried their soy latte and lavender latte and had to come back the next day before I leave town. Try their chewy waffles as well. 
10434 0 We found some sort of bug in our room. We woke up with bites all over our hands and faces. The management was unwilling and uncaring in regards to the situation. They told us we were overreacting and that they had no obligation to make our stay more enjoyable. 
10435 2 The drinks are creative, tasty, and classic. However, the service here is unfriendly and pretty much pretentious. I'd rather have another greasy dive in the neighborhood over this cocktail closet. 
10436 4 ONE WORD!. AMAZING!!!. The only con is there in Atlanta and I am not. Great service, great quality food for bargain pricing. Indulge in a slice of their tres leche cake. 
10437 2 Fancy restaurant right at the conner, next to The mall. Food was alright, but where I sat was to dark for me :( The service took quite long on each process. Especially, the waiting time that I had to wait for my food (It was not busy at all) 
10438 4 I was in town for the weekend. My favorite bar of the day! Ask the bartender for the history of the bar, it's worth it! I didn't eat, but the atmosphere and staff are so fun! Stop in for a bar when in Boston! 
10439 3 Wait wasn't too bad to be seated on a Friday morning. Service is a little slow, maybe understaffed. Our server was very pleasant and apologetic about the wait. The cauliflower and kale hash was amazing, as was the Korean style pork. Good portion sizes too. 
10440 4 I love this service department. They fixed my damaged Toyota Highlander for free. I ran over a huge tire tread which damaged the undercarriage of the car. Thanks for the awesome service and the cafe was an added bonus. 
10441 4 Wow what a place All around staff I give them 5 stars Food was great tasting And also great eye appeal. You do get your money's worth. Great job one and all. 
10442 4 Great cozy breakfast spot! Really enjoyed the food we ordered and our lattes were delicious. Will definitely return! 
10443 4 This is my favorite Starbucks location in Vancouver. They manage a huge number of grumpy/groggy customers heading to work, and manage to smile somehow. I also want to shout out to Brenda who makes every morning a pleasure and takes time to really connect with her customers. 
10444 0 Bleh, awful Americano. Sour sour sour. Bitter bitter bitter. And the ultra weird thing is that it tasted a wee bit spicy?!?! 
10445 4 Best Thai food in Texas! The spicy catfish is my favorite, the staff is always friendly and efficient. I dont live near here, but when craving Thai food, Titaya's is always worth the trip. Never disappointed! Keep it up! 
10446 4 Had the Spinach salad. It was fabulous with their home balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Lots of fresh strawberries and blueberries and Carmel pecans made a delight balance of flavors. 
10447 0 No customers in the store, but there were a few employees. I wasn't acknowledged by anyone for the ten minutes the lady at the front desk was on the phone. When she got off the phone, she was snappy and gave me attitude. 
10448 4 One of my favorite Best Buy stories ever. I always get the help I need. And no matter how many products I go in for I'm usually in and out of the store within seven minutes from start to finish. 
10449 3 Need to make reservations because this place is very very small and busy. Food is good and the prices are reasonable. Friendly staff. Gave it a four star because it is very small and tight. 
10450 3 I ordered chicken fettuccine and garlic bread, with a slice of cheesecake. I really enjoyed my meal and I am excited to try more items from them. They were very friendly as well! 
10451 4 By far my favorite Pho restaurant in the lower mainland. Very friendly and superb service. Highly recommend trying the Pho or salad rolls, very delicious. 
10452 4 Amazing shop. They are so helpful, and even make alterations there if what you like does not fit you correctly. I love the vibe there as well. 
10453 4 Happy hour 7 days a week from 4 to 6. The monkey brain blew my mind and was HUGE for $5?! Seriously, go for happy hour. Also the chef seems cool as fuck and I want to party with him. 
10454 4 Been here several times. Solid choice for Cuban/Latin food in the Disney Spring area. 
10455 1 I'm really sad that my mocha was not a mocha at all and I got a mouth full of espresso grounds in the middle of a meeting. For the money there has to be more than just pretty foam designs 
10456 2 Great location. A bit pricey but all the food is great and they have an original menu of bevy's to please everyones taste buds. Some of the rif raf tend to float on through from the nearbye E.Hastings district 
10457 0 So apparently you can not order a pitcher of beer or a bucket if you re not sharing it with someone. That's just unamerican. Wow. 
10458 4 Best place to eat at Atlanta airport. A legitimate restaurant. If you have the time go here! Two word pork belly. The rolls are fresh and delicious as well! 
10459 4 The breakfast buffet is very good--omelette station, fresh fruit, eclectic selection and excellent service! 
10460 4 Great shows, fun for the whole family and a great way to get educated on the sea life. I suggest getting a pass so that you can visit as much as possible. The new sea lion high is a great show and a must see. 
10461 4 Love Thai food and this is one of the best (if not the best) thai food in Austin. Who cares about ambiance when the food is so good. The wait does get long during the weekends so I typically order takeout for the family. Everything is really good 
10462 3 Art is a very pleasent man, but he quotes a little high. 
10463 4 Long time listener first time in 2018 seeing roller derby live. So does this qualify Texas Rollergirls officially opening for ZZ Top? It is going to be an exciting day. I love Texas and I do have my cheap sunglasses. 
10464 3 Fantastic tacos, not fancy but delicious and very reasonably priced. Routine take-out spot. 
10465 4 Love all the dumplings. This is a small place with limited seating and very casual, but the food is really above average. So many great dumplings!!! 
10466 3 Does Safeway medicate their employees? Everyone here is outrageously helpful and pleasant. 
10467 2 Food wasn't as great as the Newton, Ma location. Plus the seafood didn't taste fresh. Will give the place a try again in couple of months 
10468 4 Deliciously fresh juices and smoothies and super awesome people. We love funky fresh!! Try the Soul Power.. soo yum! 
10469 4 Love this place. Taco Tuesday is my favorite, the margaritas are very good, and the ambiance is so comfortable. Very reasonably priced. 
10470 1 The service was ridiculously slow for lunchtime when almost no one was there. The pizza was just ok and the temperature was warm but not hot. I wouldn't recommend. 
10471 4 A great coffee bar with a clean and modern atmosphere. Staff at Caffé Medici were very professional and knowledgable. I thoroughly enjoyed my latte as did my buddy...who's quite the critic. The next time I find myself in Austin I'll definitely be paying them another visit. 
10472 3 Loved this place! The waffles were delicious, the food was filling and reasonably priced, and the service was fantastic! Bree was wonderful. 
10473 4 Great experience , nice and clean place. Smells amazing Good customer service ! My nail tech is amazing and does a awesome job. However expect to spend about 2 in a half hours there to get nails done: she takes her time and does a awesome job with no rush. 
10474 0 There was a homeless person standing facing this store location's entrance, holding a sign in one hand and a box cutter in the other hand. The guy behind the counter said this was normal. I did not feel at all comfortable being there so I left. 
10475 4 Quite a surprisingly spectacular attraction! I was very impressed by the cinematic quality and the overall production. It feels like you are constantly being whisked away to somewhere new. My 10 year old daughter wanted to go on again right away, and couldn't stop telling people about it for days. 
10476 4 The Lunch Crew at this Red Lobster are amazing. Samantha, Andreas, and Lee Ann provide phenomenal service! In addition to the usual Red Lobster fare, there's some decent priced Lunch Options. 
10477 4 6 super chargers here. Clean restrooms and plenty of food kiosks. Clean and secure. 24 hour services in the middle of the Florida Turnpike. 
10478 4 This is the second time I've been here and I must say its the best ever!! I had ribs and sausage my husband had tips and sausage we both had drinks and the bull was minimal! I would recommend champions to everyone 
10479 4 I was having issues with my phone and service. I had never been to this store but i will never go anywhere else again. Greg and Bobby took care of everything for me with no hassles. This is an amazing retailer! 
10480 3 Quality food made fast. Great prices and easy to navigate menu. Prices and menu descriptions are printed clearly. Hot food is hot and cold is cold. Everything is well seasoned and prepared with a wonderful smile. 
10481 4 Love living at AMLI Covered Bridge!!! Moved to Austin in May from San Diego. Beautiful complex and the most friendly & helpful staff. The complex is super dog friendly for all of us who own furry pups too. It's been a pleasant transition process. 
10482 3 This place is delish, an gluten-free friendly. Try the desert pizza :) Be sure to check in on foursquare to unlock discounts! 
10483 4 This is probably the only Mexican Restaurant I go to, coming from a very Mexican family where we cook really good home cooked meals, its hard to find a good place that almost tastes like home and this is it. REAL GOOD MEXICAN FOOD. 
10484 3 I'm a newer customer at this establishment and I must say I'm glad I found this place. I tend to stop in after I pick up my baby from school. Very friendly staff. Great pizza especially the bbq chicken flat bread. I would definitely recommend this place! 
10485 3 So apparently it's korean owned which makes me sad.. But of course they need Japanese staff to fool us, so not sure where the cooks are from.. The food is good, and place looks nice, affordable. But Shiro is still better, maybe because it's 100% Japanese? 
10486 3 The coop scramble is great. Breakfast served until 2pm! Perfect for my drinking habits. 
10487 4 Many healthy options and excellent customer service!! Chicken salad on spinach wrap is excellent and their Bulletproof Coffee is great!! Highly recommend this place and the owners and employees are so kind and welcoming and strive to please their customers. 
10488 3 An Entire Poutine menu! Then add Pork Belly! I'm in heaven! This place is great, with a lot of personality! Lots of dipping sauces (saus, get it?) to try! Be aware of specialty items on the side menu!!! 
10489 0 I have been to Qdoba frequently, but I will not return to this one. Rice was either leftovers from the previous day or not completely cooked and the pinto and black beans were hard. 
10490 2 It kind of gives me the creeps but it's fascinating all the same time. It's too dark for me in the evening. The place is really busy, but totally worth a stop if you have time. 
10491 3 We found this place to be pretty sweet. The restaurant is crap, but everyone was friendly, the rooms are awesome, and the price is right! 
10492 0 Service was terrible! We overheard the other waiter mentioning specials that ours didn't say. When we inquired he sounded annoyed. We waited forever for our check while he bussed empty tables. Not a good experience at all. 
10493 3 Their handmade chocolate is a killer. My mouth melted as I put the chocolate in my mouth. Yes, literally melted. Service is friendly and attentive. Good ambience. Coffee is comparable to JJ Beans, hmmmm~ I will sure visit as often. 
10494 4 I just love Collage. It's got everything you need and nothing you don't. Go spend the money! 
10495 3 Thursday night was very low key (11-12am). Bar tender was great and the game room in back was awesome! Free darts & shuffle board. $1 video games and skee ball. Didn't try the Food but it looked like fried goodness. 
10496 4 They have a great selection of spirits, lazer tag and some decent food. But the service with a smile is what gets me every darn time. We love us some sweet attentive Chelsea! 
10497 3 I liked the beer and the appetizers we had were tasty, especially the biscuits. GNOM! They have a really nice selection of cocktails and beers and our waiter was awesome. 
10498 3 Breakfast is horrible. It is extremely generic resulting in why the hotel gives you free breakfast. Other than that, the hotel is luxurious and you are guaranteed to have a great time. 
10499 1 Apparently I've been making grilled cheese sandwiches in my own house in record breaking time... for years. The place was almost empty, yet it took like almost thirty minutes for a very expensive grilled cheese sandwich. They also forgot the tomatoes. 
10500 4 Biggest selection of cards I have found in town! Fun place for prerelease as well! Not the best for just browsing cards. 
10501 4 This place is so good. I've been picking it up for Takeout. They are fast. And it's like home cookin'. The desserts are also amazing. Can't wait to go back 
10502 4 One of the best restaurants in Austin. Pricey, but well worth it for the food and atmosphere. Perfect spot for special events as well. 
10503 1 I have a Cuban place I love but it's too far away so I was excited to find zazas right around the corner. Unfortunately I still need to make the drive as the food was a major meh, not bad but not worth spending money to go out to eat. 
10504 4 Great place. Loved the staff, they are very nice. The place is kept very neat and clean. The paraffin pedicure is surely worth a shot. This was my first time here and I would surely come back 
10505 4 I love O'Connor's. They have a great selection and almost always have what I need. They have not let me down in the 2 plus years I've lived locally. Oh and let's not forget the creepy part. They have high school girls working the registers. Enough said I think. 
10506 4 Oh my goodness, Dan Schaeffer and his ProTect Painters team are fantastic! Prompt, professional, and a pleasure to work with. Showed up when they said they would and finished the job on time. Courteous, efficient, reasonable, top-quality--you just can't beat it. 
10507 4 So good!! We had no idea what to expect coming here but we will definitely be back. We had the waiter order us a sample platter with a little bit of everything and we cleaned the plate. 
10508 3 If you love funky digs, good beer and soul music then come find me at the Elephant room. We'll be friends. 
10509 4 I just love this place, great food, chill atmosphere and reasonably priced. Food portions are perfect for those that are extremely hungry. Well seasoned food. 
10510 0 Food was just average. The dessert wasn't just average...it was awful. Brought it to the attention of the manager...who didn't care at all. I was born and raised around good kheer and gajar halwa. And Cumin had awful dessert with terrible service. Never going back. 
10511 4 I had a Keratin done and it is the best one I have ever had. Kara is really good at what she does and I would not hesitate to return. I am actually going back for a cut and color in about three weeks. I highly recommend this place 
10512 4 Excellent food, service and price. We ordered the lemon and herb chicken and it was delicious! The garlic bread yum yum! 
10513 3 Pretty standard Chinese fare. Bonus points for a very friendly staff. Support local family business! 
10514 3 Fun festive environment. Guacamole is excellent and food is very good. Great after work crowd. It can be very loud! 
10515 3 Food is amazing. I had rice over beef. A little hot/humid inside. It's like going into a house in a humid, foreign (Arabic) country. Free Wifi. Definitely a place to go with friends or to study on a cooler day. 
10516 3 This is such a gem in Lansdowne Mall. Dumplings, noodle soup bowls, green onion pancakes, and beef rolls. So good. You can even see them making the dumplings fresh right infront of you. If more food court restaurants were like this, fast food wouldn't have such a bad rep. 
10517 4 Fantastic flavor in their chicken tibs and injera, anticipatory service, and still easy on the budget - they even have Monday specials for their chicken dishes. If I lived in Atlanta, this would be a regular stop. 
10518 4 Excellent and quick service. I had a minor problem and Walter was able to help me immediately after I called. 
10519 3 This is a very good alternative to your typical Safeway or King Soopers. Really good deal on the weekly produce sales. Excellent customer service. 
10520 4 I've been going here for 20 years now. They make the best Souvlaki I've ever had. I love their food. 
10521 4 Great little place. Super friendly people. Great breakfast. The mint lemonade is amazing. So much fresh mint, it's drank green like a kale drink. Very sweet but really good. 
10522 4 Well worth the food and service. Stay away from the Fogo....This is the better "Brazzilian". 
10523 3 This place isnt fancy or anything but the food is spot on, nice and friendly waitstaff and the food is awesome, get the beef enchiladas they rock and the queso is always awesome. I highly recommend it 
10524 4 Amazing, food focused sushi that will definitely leave you very satisfied. Waitress was genuinely amazing too 
10525 4 I have been to Disney, Epcot and Seaworld over the last three days. Seaworld was certainly my favorite! Good rides, decent food and shorter, faster moving lines. 
10526 4 Very clean, great service. Lots of colors for my wife to choose from. I had my eye brows waxed and Susan did it just the way I wanted it. So glad to try this place out. Will be coming back often. 
10527 3 I didn't know that my Mercedes C300 could be serviced here!! Saved me a ton of money, and my car looks awesome. 
10528 4 Fast, friendly, great work! He forgot to take off something for the front-facing camera, but I took it back and he fixed it right away. 
10529 4 This place serves the best breakfast in vancouver. Everything on the menu is really good. I had the meat lovers skillet and it was yummy. They are always busy and there is a waiting list, but we'll worth the wait. 
10530 4 I love Deb. I get the best haircuts from her. She is very friendly, very talented. I is a treat to see her every time 
10531 3 Best Vietnamese food place in Downtown Atlanta.Definitely recommend to visit.Only reason I an rating 4 is due to long time you have stand in queue to place order something they should learn from chick-fil or chipotle how to manage rush hours 
10532 4 Great people great, 10/10 would do again. Lindsey was pleasant and the food was prompt. It's an amazingly cute place. Go for brunch, enjoy a mimosa. 
10533 4 Recommended from some buddies from the burbs but we always flaked out because it was too far until this location opened up. Great because it's fantastic bang for the buck and good quality. It's a great location for transit users but not so much for parking. 
10534 2 Typical Indian lunch place where you would like to eat once a month if you work in the same/one of the nearby buildings. The food is just average, which is not a bad thing.. 
10535 3 Pretty good food. Dont feel its authentic but the quality of the food makes up for it. Great service...not too expensive and they serve beer too! Nice outside eating section as well. 
10536 0 Ur there for a view. The food is as bad as Applebee's. It's over priced and like many of the reviews before the service is bad. There is a great restaurant next door I would recommend instead. 
10537 2 Known for chefs around town donating a signature sandwich Beet Salad- doused in balsamic dressing and had an odd combo of tomatos and blue cheese. decent but too heavy on dressing Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich- potato salad good 
10538 3 Recently moved to Austin and was looking for a good vermicelli bowl ... Found it at 888. 
10539 3 I had the beef and octopus tofu soup yesterday. It was a bit saltier than I expected, but it was extremely delicious! Will go back again and drink a lot of water! 
10540 4 Wheelhouse is a great little grease joint. Don't go here if you want a lot of space. Don't go if you want healthy food. But if you are willing to squeeze in, you'll get the best breakfast in Quincy, possibly anywhere. 
10541 4 First time at Calle Latina was 2 years ago and the atmosphere, food and service has always been GREAT. The food is authentic, which is definitely appreciated. Parking can be a little complicated if you don't know the area, otherwise, I highly recommend the empanadas. 
10542 4 Some of the best Thai food I've ever had. The Kow Soi is perfect and they are not afraid to make it hot! 
10543 4 Their mango curry is amazing! Great service, quick delivery. 
10544 4 Had crispy chicken bun and shrimp dumping and they were delicious! Really a hidden gem in Brookline. Highly recommend! 
10545 3 Great place for breakfast! I ordered the biscuits, gravy and two egg special with coffee. It was $8 and was delicious. It is a clean and spacious place to eat. 
10546 4 holy cow, the fried chicken was absolutely delicious. one of the best fried chicken joints in the country for sure. 
10547 0 They broke my gears board and scrached my car. I paid for the most expensive interior/exterior cleaning, but the car looked almost the same as when I let them to be "cleaned" 
10548 4 If you're in Austin find your way to this super hipster spot! It will definitely redefine your definition of a donut. From the creative names to the colorful donuts on display, this place lived up to the hype for me. 
10549 4 I went here for the first time on Friday evening 8/4 not expecting too much. There were four of us in our group. I had a chicken curry rice plate and it was delicious! So happy this place is so close to home. I will be back again very soon 
10550 4 Oh my gosh I LOVE this place. The falafel gyro is my go-to and the garlic sauce is soooo good! 
10551 4 Friendly staff and really the best espresso around here. I stop here to buy all of my work meeting coffees as well. Great place to stop for a coffee and I have tried them all. 
10552 3 Very cool place. Reminded me of several spots in the Bay Area (Poggio's in Sausalito comes to mind, but with a Southern twist). The spicy rigatoni was fantastic - never had fried oysters before but they were a great addition. 
10553 1 Order a Jasmine milk tea one time and it's was just milk with barely any jasmine tea taste in it. Gave it a second try months later and it was the same. I had to threw it away both times. 
10554 3 I've been here after work on a Friday, and it's a relaxing spot. Nice and quiet, simple spot. I had a beer and enjoyed sitting on a couch watching people walk by to decompress from the week. Wasn't too crowded either. 
10555 0 Does not take state IDs and lets busted people cut the line but deny entry for men with boots? Trash! 
10556 4 Been going here for years and my family and I are never disappointed! The General Tsaos chicken is the best ive had anywhere. Their Bun bowls are excellent! The wait staff is always nice too no matter how busy they are. 
10557 3 Great hotel with above average customer service and experience. Lots of extras. Any issues resolved quickly and generously so. 
10558 4 I came in with a huge knot on my back, and walked out feeling so freshed. Helen is great, she worked on all my problem spots and very attentive and patient, she gave me the best massage I've ever had Will recommend to everyone. 
10559 4 excellent rotisserie chicken! i just scored one for 2.99 the other day! hooray! post-strike, they're back in peak shape with peak supply! love market basket! 
10560 4 I can't top "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" Great food. Great service. And I think the prices are reasonable. The chicken was cooked perfectly, potatoes from potato heaven, and I even ate the asparagus - and liked it! I like the area, and parking was easy. I'll go back. 
10561 1 Worst outback steakhouse I've ever been to. They continually have bad service and the food is never cooked right. Drive a few more miles down 192 to Kissimmee and go to that outback instead. 
10562 3 This is a great Goodwill to shop at! It is always clean and well organized. The staff is nice and always helpful. Another plus is that they are open on Sundays while most other thrift stores or not. 
10563 1 This place is simply overpriced. Food is good. Service is marginal. I had a standard breakfast today for $28.64 before tip. (Coffee and OJ was $8.50 of that) 
10564 4 We went to Thailand this past January and this restaurant is exactly like what we had there! The service is awesome, the food comes out insanely fast, and everything is just delicious. I definitely recommend! 
10565 2 Our server cassandra was so nice, friendly, and patient! Ask for her when visiting Joes 
10566 3 Happy hour is the best, EVERYDAY (yes, even weekends!) from 3-6pm. They have a delightful and refreshing menu that changes seasonally, as all their food is sourced locally. The gluten free options are plentiful and DELICIOUS. I love the salad that has a wasabi dressing and hazelnuts. Come hungry! 
10567 4 Much better, noticed there are more menu items to choose from, great beer , incredible service and booz. Make sure to come check this new addition out. Steamed oysters take a bit to come out but still happy overall 
10568 4 Compliments to the chef and staff. We celebrated our 5 year anniversary here at this beautiful restaurant. Food was magnificent and the service was splendid. That octopus...the only time I actually enjoyed octopus. Gaucho bread and ceviche was mouth watering. Brilliant place and we will be back. 
10569 3 Three words: Beef. Lovable. Beef. Best burgers, servers and onion rings ever.. Hands down! Flipping out for Flip! Need more parking at Highlands! 
10570 4 Wow! Great sliders! Seriously, this is a great spot to get something real quick and then blown away with how good it is. I had the Steel slider and it was perfect. Also like the Portland bridge theme with the slider names. Next time I'll try the fries... 
10571 4 Very professional and high quality product. I especially appreciated that they kept me updated with scheduling using google calendar. 
10572 2 Ambiance : Ummm...not so good. Dark, stale cigarette smell, and sometimes a bit dirty. Service : Average Food : Amazing Cabrito (Come on, order the goat.) This is reason enough to drive down to Manchaca 
10573 3 This is the best food you can get in the food court of concourse E. considerably healthier than the other options. a bit pricy but the portions are HUGE. Pretty rich flavors for airport food 
10574 4 The best around. Healthier than ice cream and just as creamy and flavorful! I love the plain tart. Prices are reasonable, I will be a repeat customer for sure! 
10575 1 Flooring installers more than 3 hours late due to the store not telling them then vinyl and boards had been delivered the day before. Fantastic installation team. Day one down and one day left. So far so good, will update after install complete. 
10576 4 Crazy good biscuit sandwiches with incredible sauces. The Bird Bird Bacon has a savory chipotle mayo finish and the Queen Beak chicken sandwich has a peppery heat that is perfection. Though it's often crowded, orders come out super fast. 
10577 4 Very impressed with the prompt service and super-friendly staff! Love the convenient location too; they share a parking structure with Freddy's, so you can pop in, put in your order, and go grocery shopping while the pizza is being made. Doesn't get any fresher than that! 
10578 3 It's a good place for dim sum but make sure to make reservations. The quality and service are what you pay for in your final bill. My favorite dish has to be the chicken shredded chicken that has slices of jelly fish. 
10579 3 Prices are decent and they have a good variety of dishes. I've been here several times... food and service has always been good. 
10580 0 I stopped in here quickly to get my jawline and chin waxed I thought it would be cheap because it is an Asian place. The lady charged me $40!!!! I was ripped off, but too shocked to question it. 
10581 3 If you like seafood you should not pass on checking this place out. They are known for good seafood in the Boston area and they are sprouting up in the northern east coast. 
10582 4 One of my most favorite places for date night with my hubby. Atmosphere, decor, food, people, they are all perfect! Don't leave without the trying the lavash and all the dips! 
10583 4 The guys at shine were very professional and courteous. They wrapped my trees quickly and the yard looks amazing. I won't hesitate to use them again! 
10584 4 Perfect spices, nice atmosphere & music, great lighting and decor. Even the restroom area is pretty cool. Will definitely come again. 
10585 4 You're so money and you don't even know it. Awesome bbq,awesome owner. Jason wont skimp on the meat. Some of the better Q around, I'll defintely make this a regular and be back to try that Guesa 
10586 3 Stop by for an authentic taste of Shanghai hidden in the outskirts of Chinatown. Try their steamed dumplings, gigantic Lion Head meatballs, braised meats, cold kao fu, and string beans. You can always ask the owner for his specials and suggestions. 
10587 4 This is the best Mexican restaurant by far!! I really like their melon water so much that I ordered 2. They also give you a lot of free food to start with, definitely a good deal. 
10588 0 Rude waiter. Bad food and small portion. Asked for a cup of water for the kids and we were shouted back. Will never come again. 
10589 3 This is not your date night destination but a quick taco in a pinch is great. The selection is fresh and the staff are super friendly. They do have specials that look interesting and the prices are very reasonable. Cant be beat to cure a taco craving! 
10590 4 Just a fun kick ass place to go with friends. Good food good beer. The best part of it is the live music and the crowed of people there. It is a must if you have never been. 
10591 3 Excellent burgers. I didn't think it was especially expensive, but I also went for work and wasn't paying much attention to the price. The decor is energetic and eclectic. Great service. 
10592 4 The staff is always polite, fast service, fresh food, it always comes out right, huge portions, great place to go! 
10593 4 El Primo is the Jam! Best $2 breakfast tacos in the city! Lunch tacos $2.50 too! It's right in front of Once Over Coffee Bar so I usually grab a couple of tacos and a coffee and sit outside. There's a reason it's always got people here! Freshy fresh! 
10594 4 I'm visiting in town and Emily gave me a root touchup. She is terrific -- polite, considerate, very careful. The color is great, and my hair looks terrific. (We did a partial blow dry, which was perfect.) 
10595 0 Terrible. Totally unprofessional and does not know what she is talking about, 
10596 4 Awesome chiropractic care, conveniently located and easy parking. The pre adjustment massage was really effective in getting my body ready, and I felt like I was in great hands the whole time! Really knowledgeable and caring. So glad I found these guys! 
10597 3 Had great service on a damaged irrigation system. Lots of leaks were fixed, and system adjusted. Extremely fair price, and Logan provided great service! Will call them again for future work. Only nit was that they are extremely busy, so there is a wait for an appointment date. 
10598 3 Good food, quick service. Located in a quiet/pretty shopping center. Ordered a half size of the apple fritters - which were more breading than apple, but still good - and the Greek omelet. Was pleased with both. 
10599 4 Best restaurant meal I've had in Portland - ever. Everything was great. Fantastic food, service, wine, etc. 
10600 4 Excellent service, beautiful work! I had a gel mani and regular pedi. I called ahead on a Saturday afternoon and got an appointment same-day. I was excited to have an affordable nail place again and will return to have Ten (sp?) do my nails again! 
10601 4 Took my brand new Tesla here to get detailed after quite a few recommendations from coworkers. Employees are very pleasant and delivered great Customer Service. My car looked sharp. I love it. Highly recommended! 
10602 2 * I appreciate them having some vegetarian options. The veggie chorizo is delish and their award winning enchilada with salsa verde was ok. Not a place I'd come back to personally. * My friends ordered meat dishes and they looked incredible. They seemed pleased and cleaned their plates. 
10603 1 The place is really charming in the German Village. The food was so so. Nothing on the menu was authentic German food. I'm German and nothing would fly as German food back in Germany. The taste and food quality was subpar. 
10604 4 Micro brewery at the top of the Oasis restaurant, incredible views up here on their outdoor deck. The beer was also incredible with a wide variety of styles, craft beer seems to be getting better overtime in places you would not expect. Five stars ! 
10605 3 The ambience is good. Went here for a birthday. The food is good however, with the pig in the name, you would think they'd be more pig oriented food but that's not the case. 
10606 4 I went to Tin Shed during a visit with family and this place may quite possibly have the best breakfast ever! I live near Chicago and to say the least...there are plenty of great restaurants nearby but the "Everything Nice" was by far the best I have had. 
10607 2 Beautiful supermarket always find something I always have good deals hope it just get better and better 
10608 4 Yelp doesn't lie! Crystal is a vacuum savant. Took our seven year old Dyson, and within 15 minutes it was diagnosed and fixed. Can't do much better than that! Thanks, Crystal!! 
10609 4 Richard was great. * Showed up on time * Focused on the areas I requested * Went the extra mile by organizing things! I really appreciated his eye for detail. I am going to request him again soon :) 
10610 3 The food is always good. Prices are a little high. You definitely have to order a few items to feel satisfied. 
10611 4 Completely obsessed with the design. Bartender was on point. Got a Martinez, olives, and an oyster. 
10612 4 It can be hard to find good coffee at 6am. So happy I found this place. Really nice staff, good coffee. 
10613 4 Every time I grab something here, it's always delicious! The Cod Sandwich is amazing and they have the best tartar sauce in town! Always friendly and for a downtown restaurant, reasonable prices. 
10614 3 I love fried chicken so I was happy to find they do it just right here.This restaurant focuses on one thing and they do it well!! Chicken breasts are tender, juicy and flavorful without being greasy. Recommended for fellow fried chicken lovers 
10615 2 good atmosphere. Like the seats ( usually it's hard to find one)! can get really crowded ( I don't like the crowd). But fairly a good bar around MIT campus. I go there often. Most Grad MIT students hang out there. Some djs are good. 
10616 3 I bought my cat a cute Patriots bandana that he wears tied around his neck at this store. I also bought some small cat toys. We almost died laughing at the crazy dog clothes! It was a little pricey, but very original. I just wish they had more cat stuff. 
10617 4 Absolutely wonderful! Even the ketchup is house made and has a deep rich flavor. The wedge salad with salmon and mine the special of the day, a rib meat sandwich on a baguette was to die for! 
10618 4 Great office, great staff! It feels like a family which makes a dental appointment much easier. This was the best dental experience I've ever had! 
10619 4 Food was great! Started with spicy wings. My husband had chicken, Brie & fig sandwich on ciabatta bread. Delicious! I had Kale salad...great. The atmosphere and decor is very appealing. Wait staff extremely attentive. We'll be back. 
10620 3 I came here to pick up some gluten free sausages for dinner = awesome. I love the lamb one which i mix with my mac and cheese. 
10621 2 Great atmosphere (if you don't mind the smoke), but the whiskey is absurdly expensive. You must be paying a premium for being allowed to smoke your cigar there. 
10622 3 This is my favorite place to get this style of food. Vegetarian and vegan friendly. Over the eight years of enjoying this place, the prices have sky rocketed, which is a shame. It's quickly becoming unaffordable, unless for special occasions. 
10623 4 One of our favorite restaurants in Portland. Great service, thanks John, Daniel and Seth! Food is skillfully prepared and very tasty. Celebrating our 28th Anniversary this evening. Looking forward to seeing Devin Phillips again tonight! 
10624 0 Update: They ended up selling the car for even less than I had offered... and I had cash in hand. So, they aren't paying attention. Use that to your advantage. 
10625 3 In my experience, its not necessarily the best you will ever find, but consistent and has become a comfortable place to go and hang out ... especially when they got rid of the indoor smoking. Chicken Fajitas for one can feed two :) 
10626 4 Golden beet carpaccio heaven. Perfect balance of flavors and textures. Beautiful to look at. Devine to eat. Pleasant service. Clean open space. Weird lighting. 
10627 0 Pretty sure Anthony at the take out register in kitchen called my friend a n----r tonight. Either that or MAYBE he was singing a song lyric? (Doubtful.) Loved Santarps before tonight. Won't be going back again. 
10628 0 Ok food. But no Chocolate syrup to make any kind of chocolate shakes..slow service. Place could use a good cleaning. 
10629 4 Never been in the store but we have these once a month at work and they are PHENOMENAL. Definitely the best doughnut I've had in a 50 mile radius. 
10630 4 I love coming here. Food is always fragrant and tasty. We generally try some different each visit. Service is friendly and courteous. We usually order one dish per person and share with a couple bowls of steamed rice. 
10631 3 Claim Jumper just calls to me every once in a while...pretty good selection of food and portions are always plentiful. The atmosphere is nice and they have a decent bar and happy hour to partake in. 
10632 3 The food is very yummy here...I especially love the fried plantains! It's good to get in early for dinner, before the crazy dance scene starts up. When I have been there for dancing, it's fun, but just a bit too crowded. Be sure to sip a Caipirinha or Mojito. 
10633 0 Dishes were dirty, even after asking for clean dishes. Food was terrible. Fries and onion rings were burnt. Shrimp salad was disgusting. 
10634 3 It is a quiet place for delicious ramen. It is self-service style and my favorite is #1 Signature Ramen. 
10635 3 These are definitely some of the best tacos in Austin. This place is hipster heaven. Don't show up without your beard and Ray Bans. Try the puffy tacos! 
10636 3 This is the best Hudson Grille of the several in the Atlanta area that I have been to, thanks to the top-notch wait staff at the bar. 
10637 4 This is the place to get wings in Atlanta. A lot of variety in flavors and sauces. Burgers are also good. Waitresses are nice and it's a great place to watch a game. Order the guacamole, it's above average. 
10638 4 Cute little place with wonderful breakfast! Spent $26 and got a huge omelette, pancakes, bacon, sausage, toast and coffee for two people. The food was delicious and cooked perfectly. Love eating in local spots like this 
10639 0 Unwilling to do stand behind their work...After 3 years of giving them a lot of business they compleletely blow us off after the 1st disagreement regarding a Warranty Request. Very unprofessional. 
10640 4 Chill spot, playing live r&b, open mic, loving the vibe and seeing my beautiful people. Off in the cut would never know it was there, but has been a staple in the community for the last 20 years. Good food and drinks. Only negative is they need more wait staff. 
10641 4 Yum! Generous portions, breakfast all day and super friendly staff. I have been several times with a toddler and everyone is super kid friendly. I love the loaded tots! The burgers are great, too 
10642 4 Just purchased my first ar 15 here. Had a great experience! Was thoroughly informed, no trying to up sell, very honest. My wife purchased a handgun here too. They treated her with nothing but respect. Unlike other gun stores "gun room". Great prices on ammo too! 
10643 3 Great food. Great wine. Very friendly and attentive service. Came down because of proximity to Botanical Gardens, but would totally come back! 
10644 1 Pretty good, authentic food, but get it to go; it's kinda sticky & dirty inside, and not in the fun way. 
10645 4 Kim helped us find an apartment in Portland. We had some crazy requirements, but she came through for us. She was fast, efficient and found us something below our budget. 
10646 3 We love this place! It's quickly become a favorite date night spot. Hubby and I love their happy hour nacho bar and margaritas. 
10647 2 Is nice place but to small place with of high loud. The service is good. Is expensive 
10648 4 This place has the friendliest and helpful group of people. Great prices on the art products as well... Would def recommend this place over Michael's and the surronding art stores! 
10649 3 Really interesting things being done with flavor and texture here. Great, concentrated menu with care in each dish. No frills atmosphere, but it is technically in a mall, so be ready to wait. 
10650 0 Wow, we decided to try rr hamburgers, not a good idea. Also tried spinach dip., ok nothing to write home about. Ate hamburgers up all night sick. Still ill next day, dont know if meat or spices, but first time last time going there. Do not recommend... 
10651 4 The jerk chicken was everything I hoped it would be. The goat was delicious too. I'm so glad this place opened 
10652 4 The bartenders are amazing! They care about you and take the time. My family owns a bar out of state and we would hire every last one of them where we are at. Fun and professional! They treat you well and drinks are reasonably priced here. 
10653 4 I love this park! It's peaceful and beautiful. I've riden bikes through there many times. The 4th of July festivities are thebest. And I'm getting married at the park next year! 
10654 3 Tried it again - all the ice cream flavors and cone options were available and the service was GREAT! 
10655 2 I was not overly impressed with the rooms at Animal Kingdom. They were outdated and the bathrooms were extremely dark. I would have liked an option of adjoining rooms. The grounds were beautiful and my son absolutely loved the playground and water slide. 
10656 4 The food was great ! Unique compared to other Greek restaurants in Atlanta. Definitely upscale. I would recommend for a first date, dinner. Or anytime. The dessert was exceptional! 
10657 2 I dropped in once with some friends for a casual dinner. This is one of those open-air picnic table places where you get buckets of sea critters. Not a bad choice when you have a big group of friends, especially if the weather is nice. 
10658 4 I really like the red velvet cupcakes here. They are decadent, but not overly sweet. I bought and ate a ton for about a good two months straight. 
10659 3 This is not the most posh nail salon. Additionally, I feel like the process of soaking and shaping my nails was a little rushed however, here I am a full 7 days later with perfect gel polish nails! Additionally, the lady doing my nails was so sweet! 
10660 4 Great job by a great team. From the admin to those in for the long haul across the country, this group was fantastic! 
10661 4 Yuuuummmmm Gotta get the bar seat at the kitchen. I don't have time to tell y'all about each but it's all soo good. I was in an altered and celestial state afterwards. Weird to find such heavenly food in a strip mall. 
10662 3 Pretty good sushi. Edema me was excellent, very fresh. Nice atmosphere. Prices are reasonable. I'd go back for sure. 
10663 4 Love this place! Chill atmosphere but still good for a fun Saturday night out. Drinks are good and the bar staff has always been really friendly. Last week saw my first night of live music there and can't wait to go back! 
10664 3 This was my first time here. Food was great but both our meat dishes were way oversalted. I'm still rating high as the rest of our food was great and service was fantastic. 
10665 4 The food here is amazing at a solid price point and great service. Even surprised at how light and smooth their Turkish coffee is.. 
10666 1 Terribly staffed and mediocre food. Combine that with a filthy restaurant and you have a stereo typical indian restaurant. Check out biryani pot instead 
10667 4 This place is a little hard to see from the street, but it's pretty cool. Thry have a little area to sit and eat in the shade. We keep coming back for the fried Brussels Sprouts, so good! 
10668 4 Great food really enjoyed the Crabcake Benedict 
10669 3 Food is amazing. I just thought for a while had been in Indian Chinese Restaurant. Hats off to the Chef 
10670 4 Love this place! Healthy, beautiful plants in a great setting. The staff is friendly and helpful. The chickens are great to visit too! What a breath of fresh air after the large box stores. A must if you're in the area! 
10671 3 The lady here was so friendly. One of the best soy mochas I've had recently. Conveniently located across the strfrom a great dispensary. 
10672 3 I work in Reading and order out for lunch or dinner sometimes. I love their chicken kabob and greek salads. They have great chicken stir fry, awesome grilled chicken pita, pizza is delish !!!!!! I would definitely recommend them !!!!! Fast delivery too !!!! 
10673 2 Good value. $2.25 per selection. I spent 8 bucks and had enough to take home a snack. 
10674 3 Buon servizio che sa ben consigliare tra le varie birre proposte a menu. Peccato non abbia posti all'esterno. 
10675 4 Ordered the chicken kebab plate, pita bread, domals and hummus- not only is it delicious but it has stretched enough for 3 meals!! Good prices and very fresh and tasty ingredients. Will definitely be adding this restaurant to my list! 
10676 4 OMFGASAM best burritos ever and cheap! Plus super nice people. me [on the phone]: "Hello. Can I please order a bean and cheese burrito with black beans and guacamole" them: "yes" me: when can I pick it up? them: "3 min" Me :... omg." 
10677 4 I was recently in Austin for business and stopped in for a new bra. The service and selection was so amazing, I ended up restocking my intimates with loads of new wonderful items. I can't wait to return next time I'm in town. 
10678 4 Best taco I ever had! I wish I could fit in one more trip there, but they close at 3 on Fridays. 
10679 3 Love the food. Very friendly was worth the drive of 30 mins. The chicken pasteles was amazing.! 
10680 4 Omggggg!!! I can't believe I found a place that specializes in asian hair!! They made me feel welcomed and they did an amazing job!! Thank you Q and Nina!! 
10681 4 We go here at least once a week. They have super tasty sandwiches and always great service. Can't go wrong with a Mr bestwick! 
10682 4 The food is absolutely delicious and drinks ate great! Love coming here with friends. 
10683 3 Great independent kids resale shop with lots of mama buys too! 
10684 4 Thank you SeaWorld for honoring Veterans with free passes to your park! What an awesome experience! The shows are so fun and the exhibits are very informative. The free beer at Mama pretzel is also a bonus! Make sure you have your ID! 
10685 3 Came here for a late dinner and got: - beet salad: way fancier than i thought it would be. Really delicious app. - pizza: average, nothing especial, my cheese kept falling off the dough. - crabmeat ravioli: also very delicious. Overall, solid restaurant with good food. 
10686 3 Mangieris is consistently good pizza. Plentiful selection of fresh ingredients. The pizza feels a little healthier than most, perhaps it's that whole wheat crust! 
10687 4 Great place to come eat. One of my favorite places to eat in Quincy. Hotspot buffet is amazing. Must try. 
10688 4 I wanna go back, I GOTTA go back to O-HI-O! 100 days until Kickoff! Why isn't there an OSU in LA?? I miss it. 
10689 4 I just wish the burgers were bigger BUT they are always amazing! I'm greedy! LOL! 
10690 4 very excellent massage here! i was served by William, and he did a great job, in targeting my tight muscles. Keep up the good work! 
10691 4 I shop here nearly every day. The farmer's market is much better for produce, especially prices, but other than that I can get almost anything I need here. 
10692 4 I just had one of the best breakfasts of my life. Zack's, you continue to impress me. I ordered the crab Benedict, and it was to perfection. Hollandaise sauce was perfect, the staff is super friendly and attentive. Will be back for sure. 
10693 4 Joe B is the best. He gave me one of the best haircuts I've ever had in my life. The compliments haven't stopped rolling in. Keep in mind, however, that he is only comes in on certain days. Otherwise, the owner is great as well. 
10694 1 I had paid for the rental car ahead of time and was forced to get the insurance for it. Along with that cost there were hidden fees that caused my bill to double. This was especially frustrating since I travel on a tight budget. 
10695 0 Not ready for business,no parking, no service , no english, not very impress for new opening of a grocery store. 
10696 3 Wonderful experience. It's a relief to find a place that maintains such a high level out near Concord. I've been there three times so far and have never been disappointed. The service has always been great and the food it fresh, tasty, and imaginative. 
10697 4 holy. moly. the BEST vanilla latte i have ever had. these guys aren't messin' around. starbucks - eat your heart out. 
10698 3 Totally divey yet I loved it. Great strong reasonably priced drinks and a very polite/attentive waitress to boot. I'm a fan! 
10699 4 Eggs with shrimp & polenta, any pastry, yummy coffee. Could eat breakfast here everyday! 
10700 4 GREAT place to live!! I have been here for almost 3 years, and have never had any issues! Justin D 
10701 3 Food is really good! I have been here multiple times for brunch. Their eggs benedict is a little weird, scrambled with spinach instead of poached. But still really tasty! Service is always really friendly. 
10702 4 You can't go wrong with picking your own toppings on your pizza.. Staff here was wonderful and they were super busy.. They wood fire the pizza so it is hot and ready in like 5 min.. Love it 
10703 4 Cute little café with delicious food! I tried the edemame, pork dumplings, cucumber salad, and pork belly noodle soup. They all were very flavorful. Bess, the owner, is the sweetest. I definitely recommend this place if you are nearby in Brookline. 
10704 3 Great lunch special. Not very crowded, but as far as Hakka food goes in the boston area, this is one of the better options we've tried so far. 
10705 4 OUTSTANDING dog-walking for my pooches-- I've been a client for over three years, and the crew at Go Play has been consistently professional... reliable... and wonderful with my mutts. Plus, I love being able to support a local business! 
10706 0 Went here on a slow Saturday refused to play the any college game said it was the owners fault. Received poor service considering there was only 4 people in the bar. 
10707 3 Pretty good coffee and scones when there are few decent choice in the area. The staff are friendly and quick to serve. 
10708 4 Great weekend buffet. All kinds of curry, all kinds of flavors, my go-to choice when hungry from being a couch potato on a Saturday. 
10709 4 Had the passion fruit mimosas and vegetarian patacon. I really enjoyed my drinks and food. I enjoyed the atmosphere. Definitely recommend it!! 
10710 4 Excellent Cuban food! Had a groupon to try out and really enjoyed. I will be becoming a regular here 
10711 0 Probably some of the worst service I've had in a while, they over stuffed my burrito and made absolutely no attempt to fix it when I asked. Will not be giving this location my business at all from now on. 
10712 4 Best vape shop I've ever been to. The staff are so helpful, and get you any discounts you qualify for. They give honest advise on the different products which I really appreciated! 
10713 0 Horrible. Not sure who shit in the bartenders corn flakes. Below average food. Over priced. Arrived in a great mood, left wondering how this place was still in business. 
10714 4 My oxtails were so tender and delicious! Everything was well-seasoned and cooked to perfection! I will definitely be back again! 
10715 2 Cute place, ok staff. Food was average, nothing special. Tried fish tacos, pick and chips and wings. Tacos were lacking flavor, pick was ok , wings meh. Decent drink 
10716 4 The best breakfast sandwich I have ever had. I wanted another. Organic egg, delicious meat, fluffy bread. 
10717 0 food. normal prices yet small portions with small food quality drinks. ok meh, this place has changed for the worse, go elsewhere. 
10718 3 Went here a few days ago for lunch. Cute little stop, but no A/C so don't go on a super hot day. Huge piece of fish on the fish sandwich with lots of fries, I couldn't finish it all. Great place in the middle of a beach day. 
10719 4 Had an amazing blueberry muffin from here. It was soft and moist, not too sweet, and not flaky or dry at all. Randomly stopped here, and so glad we did! 
10720 4 Great pasta and sangria! Service was quick and friendly. Would come back for another date night easily! :) 
10721 2 Great food but they don't use gloves. Order breakfast and watch the cooks bare hand your bread and bacon. Just not sanitary, but no complaints on the food. 
10722 4 Best pedicure I've had. Nice atmosphere. Great people. Massage chairs are fantastic. Got the Allure pedicure, which I highly recommend. The scrub smells great and the cooling mask feels wonderful, especially with the hot towels. I'll be back. 
10723 3 I am in love with ModMarket and really happy since they started serving breakfast. Eggplant sandwich is my favorite for lunch and for breakfast the waffle is yummy. 
10724 4 Wonderful pud with 430 whiskeys! I am in heaven. Having a three flight with redbreast 15yrs. Still thinking about the next two. Cheers 
10725 3 Its small in a good way--unlike the Mega stores--(shaws, s and s, etc.) friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff. way better shopping experience that the big boxes. 
10726 3 Read my previous, more extensive review below. That review focused on the Thai dishes. This time I went back and tried the sushi offerings. Everything I had was delicious, even the salad. The happy hour prices were great. For $3, you get a substantial set of rolls! 
10727 4 Awesome pizza (and warm soup)! Lyndon was an great server/ host and he was super friendly to talk to. We ordered No. 16 (The People's Republic) and that was yummy. 非常好吃! Hope to come back to Boston and to Emma's Pizza! 
10728 4 This is a small, family owned Vietnamese/Korean taco place. It has things like chicken curry and ca fe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk), but also bulgogi beef tacos and kimchi fries. Unique and healthy. 
10729 4 Food was great service was great! Had a waiter named Gaetano who gave very professional service. The ambiance, music, view, food and dessert was all excellent! Definite repeat! 
10730 4 definitely going to be a new regular spot. I got 2 tacos for $6.50 total, the ginger ginger and the multnomah Paloma were both great drinks. The bartender Nathaniel was legit. 
10731 1 CLOSED!! http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/food/dishing/2008/12/circle_in_the_s.html?p1=Well_MostPop_Emailed5 ttyl ;( 
10732 2 The Harvard Coop is your typical university bookstore, except that it's owned by Barnes and Noble. Great selection of books. Textbooks are overpriced, but they are at every college bookstore. I like just wandering around in there and looking at the books. 
10733 1 I'm rarely one to think a server was being rude, but the guy at the register definitely was. It wasn't even busy. Food was ok. I'll hope for better if theres a next time 
10734 4 One of my favorite lunch places in Boston! Convenient location, super nice staff and delicious food. Not only is the food good but it is so reasonably priced that it is a win win. Definitely recommended! 
10735 2 Veggie cigars were five star great, but veggie tagine was artichokes, peas, and carrots in sauce. The sauce was great, but the veggies weren't substantive. This place I'm sure is better for meat eaters. 
10736 3 Free wi-fi with no password, solid tea options, live music, friendly staff, ample sitting space, though most tables are too small for two laptops and you can't use a large one if you're not a group of 4. Can't ask for too much else, can I? 
10737 4 Affordable good food fast service and a great menu for kids! See for yourself it's a great place to eat Love it 
10738 2 I really love the eggs here and the bottomless pancakes cannot be beat for the value (about $7 an order)! Since its close by our home, we go here often. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the waitresses leave a little (or a lot) to be desired! 
10739 3 Very good. It being my first time here I didn't know what to expect. I can say I am folly satisfied and stuffed. I will make this a regular lunch spot. 
10740 4 They do such a wonderful a job!! Best nail salon In giving you the desired shape you want for SNS! 
10741 2 Maybe I was in a good mood but this place seems to be seriously underrated (I had never heard of it). The food here (that I tried) was all good and the place is very cumfy and family-friendly. I wish it was in my neighborhood. 
10742 3 THE JAZZ spot in Austin, nothing else. Enjoy your music. 
10743 3 I love the special deals they have each week! You can try different flavours for a great deal! 
10744 4 I love Turners! When I go I always have to get the stuffed clams! OMG they are delicious! I then would get any of the specials or another favorite linguini and clams. To finish the night off with fallen chocolate cake soooo good! 
10745 4 I love this location! The staff is super friendly and always answer my questions. I stop here after working out for a protein shake. The lean 1 is my favorite. It's always busy but they get you in and out fast. 
10746 4 The chicken broth ramen is terrific. So thick and creamy, and the noodles are chewy The bbq meat was ok, but i was blown away by their soup. Holy, a must try. 
10747 4 Summer moon... a bit too sweet. Half moon latte - delicious. In my opinion, the best coffee in Austin. Definitely try the half moon latte! 
10748 4 Best tacos I have ever had. I come here everyday... That's how good they are. The steak tacos and Migas are my favorite. I don't have much else to say these are the best tacos in Austin Texas hands down. Well done Veracruz! 
10749 4 This is for those searching Thai massage and reflexology. Cheap prices. Very little English. Call ahead for appointments. So great! 
10750 4 I love this place. We go about once a month. I don't mind the two item minimum because beer is delicious. The only thing I would change about the place is that they get a bigger beer selection :) 
10751 0 I never would have ordered food from here based on my gut instincts. But a friend was visiting and she didn't know any better. Epicly bad food. I'd consider Panda Express to be five stars when compared to this "food" 
10752 4 I miss Momos. This was my favorite music venue in Austin - I went there since it opened. So many good bands, Warren and his bands, Suzanna Choffel, etc. Sad to see it closed... Hoping to see it open again soon. 
10753 4 Been going here for many year's. They changed owners, however the food is just as good as before. My favorite dish is the stir fry X1 with chicken or tofu. 
10754 3 A touch more expensive than the other frozen yogurt shops I have been to but a good variety of flavors,decent toppings, clean shop and prompt service. I dig this place. 
10755 2 While the food was GREAT... it was so packed, and crazy and chaotic... that it made it difficult to enjoy. 
10756 4 Great Customer Service Every Time! 
10757 3 I like Thai, but live far north. Thai Cuisine is the best option for good Thai food, good service, and a nice atmosphere. The family that owns this restaurant is great, too. As long as they keep doing what they're doing, I'm a fan. 
10758 3 One of my new favorites in Midtown. The Arroz caldoso is amazing! It is served in share size portion but I never have any trouble finishing it solo. Also great atmosphere and the service is top notch. I would highly recommended. 
10759 3 I've been here several times and its always good. Great beer selection. The 7 layer dip & the Mediterranean plate are delish. It is very casual and all seating is outside. The view of the lake is nice as well. It offers all that its name states, Relax. 
10760 0 Terribly disappointed with this place. I had the wrap for lunch and it was like dog food; mushy, steak not edible because of veins. Waste of money. 
10761 4 Still like the vibe at the victor, Kevin and Hillary committed to keeping residents happy. Construction is all around Boston, part of city living, and they are doing their best at keeping residents informed. Continue to recommend the victor, nice place to live 
10762 0 The course was in terrible shape whenwe played on Saturday, it was overbookedwith no rangers out to keep play moving. Iuse to play there twice a month but not now until they repair the course. 
10763 2 More expensive that hobby lobby. First time in a JoAnn Fabric in a long time. I think I will stick to Hobby Lobby or Michaels 
10764 4 Bulgogi is awesome. Best we have had outside of Korea itself. Great service with friendly people. 
10765 3 I tried chocolate manjari cake and almond croissant. It was uber delicious! They also have good looking paninis if you are looking for something savoury! 
10766 4 Great service with spice level tailored To your taste. So. much. food! Will be back. They also have carry out! This place is the best! 
10767 4 You get more good than you can eat. The staff are great and the food is wonderful. The only issue us finding a parking lot. 
10768 4 Kin Kaooooo soooo good :) I'd say your best bet is to order something of everything and you can't go wrong. Food is great, service also .... 
10769 3 Excellent! Antipasto had much more variety in meat and cheese than most places. Steak tips panino was great. 
10770 4 I had the 2x2 meal with burnt ends and brisket. Phenomenal. House hot sauce made it. Brisket was juicy and delicious. Burnt ends were perfect. Honestly my only complaint was they were out of ribs! :). Nice job and god bless for being closed in Sundays. 
10771 4 Fantastic, friendly service. Everything was taken care of with a smile. Make sure to bring check/ money order to pay. We just happened to have a check book in us by chance! We can now look forward to our trip to Europe with our daughters:-) 
10772 4 Great food and experience. Friendly staff. Glad we stumbled across this place! Will return again for sure. 
10773 1 They started very nice, but slipped to just less than mediocre coffee shop. I haven't tried their chocolate, but a custard croissant I had yesterday wasn't fresh at all, obviously wasn't made the same day. Shame. Won't come back. Won't recommend to others. 
10774 2 The food was delicious, though over priced for the portion size. The restaurant itself is in a beautiful location and the ambiance is wonderful. Service was great! 
10775 4 The food is wonderful. The lamb tikka masala is seasons with herbs and parsley and it's beyond delicious. The sizzling chicken tikka is served with vegetables. Must try this place out for delightful meal. 
10776 1 Good burgers but very expensive. Tasty onion rings. Nice location but not worth waiting in line for this food. Staff is friendly. I would go to 5 Guys for a fraction of the cost 
10777 4 Finally a salon that doesn't kill you with fumes and unhygienic tool cleaning!!! Never been disappointed getting nails done here. Also had an amazing facial once with 'Ivy'. I also use their lavender oils as my nightly moisturizer ... Worth the trip! 
10778 3 Very nice atmosphere and good coffee. I love their wild berry cake. 
10779 0 Sadly it turned out to be another Mexican restaurant wannabe with tasteless bland enchiladas. Even the "salsa" they served at the beginning was bland...absolutely no Pico in that gallo. 
10780 4 Such an inviting interior. Come in a sticky bun topped with candied pecans and an iced coffee! Their sandwiches are pretty bomb too! 
10781 4 The therapists here are all fantastic. I've been a member for over a year and have never been dissapointed. 
10782 2 The lunch entry is good but not worth the price. The appetizers and salads are about average. I give a three star because the server is really nice. 
10783 3 Great place for lunch, the food is consistently great, I haven't gotten anything I didn't like yet. The service is quick and the staff is attentive, great place for lunch for a very reasonable price! 
10784 2 This place has a good ambience and good food (specially sashimi), however, a little bit pricey compared to other good sushi places around the area. I might come back to this place, but probably not sooner... 
10785 4 Had a blast there with our kids while in town! Superb service from the staff! Definitely a must if in the area! 
10786 4 This place is great! Very conveniently located and the staff there are so sweet and attentive. I always get the colorful foil added onto my manicure, it's only $5 extra here, other places it's $8-$10! Would highly recommend this salon! 
10787 3 This place gets paaaaaccckkkeed super fast. We were there like 10 minutes before it opened and there was already a line for people wanting to get in. Super cute cafe, we sat inside. 
10788 4 Great workmanship, quality materials, all done on schedule as promised, by a friendly and competent crew led by Dennis. Mike was very prompt and professional throughout the whole transaction. Hope this new fence lasts awhile, but would definitely call or recommend Century Fence again. 
10789 4 I love JoyMoves! Having had private lessons with three different instructors I feel comfy recommending them to any Pilates student - new and old. Working privately with an instructor was a great way for me to ease into Pilates as a chronic pain patient. Now I'm hooked! Thanks, JoyMoves! 
10790 4 After leaving the Rex because of poor service, went to Tao and had another wonderful meal. Good food and good service. 
10791 4 What a find! Somewhat obscure location (for Boulder that means neither on Pearl Street pedestrian mall nor adjacent to campus), but amazing food. Had carnitas tacos that were the best I've ever tasted. Pleasant outdoor dining area is a real plus. 
10792 4 Super good!!! Friendly staff, atmosphere is so chill!! The food?! OMG!! Sooo much to choose from!! It's all freshly made right in front of you and they even have an array of desserts to choose from too! We will definitely be going back and next time taking friends and family! 
10793 4 The vibe, drinks, service and importantly food! Are all amazing. Get the burger, any of them are SO good. 
10794 1 I thought we had stumbled on some kind of old-time gem based on all the newsclippings inside the entrance. Boy was I wrong. It was like a mall restaurant's Greek food. I am wondering if we hit it on an off night? 
10795 3 Solid place if you a conference near the Boston WTC. Clean lodging, good restaurant, and close to public transit and close to airport. 
10796 4 Good ice cream. On vacation and stopping at all "homemade " ice cream shops. This one has so many flavors it is hard to decide. All of them sounded good. 
10797 4 Currently my favorite pizza restaurant in town. They also have a great selection of craft beer. Recently had an issue with our order and the manager was more than helpful dealing with the issue. 
10798 0 The food is pretty good, definitely not cheap, and I've seen mice there. Many times. 
10799 4 Love this place, it has a great new look and feel and my favorite stylist is just minutes away! 
10800 4 Met up with a big group on Saturday night for drinks on the outdoor patio. Fantastic setting on comfy sofas, great drink menu and the staff was terrific. They brought out the drinks incredibly fast and were available for our orders without hovering. Will definitely be back. 
10801 4 Leif rocks. I love my art and my husband got a rockin piece from him too. AND he is a heck of a nice guy. Don't tell him though :) 
10802 2 Came here for a nice dinner. The food was delicious but service was subpar. Waitress didnt check on us after food came until it was time to bring us the check. 
10803 4 We tried Thirteen Pies and were pleasantly surprised! The buckwheat pasta was amazing as well as the eggplant pizza with goat cheese, oven-dried tomato, red onion, and basil pesto. I can't wait to try other dishes that looked great on the menu. Definitely a delicious night out. 
10804 4 Good customer service. We probably eat there too often, some of the best chicken and fries we have tasted. They also do a nice chicken and waffle. 
10805 3 Finally, a "real" restaurant at ATL. Server was enthusiastic and attentive and I opted for the Kobe burger which didn't disappoint. Who knows, serving great food in airports may just catch on. 
10806 4 Just bought a super cute vintage fabric wrap dress. The employee who helped me was friendly and nice. The designer was there and was quirky and fun. Some really pretty clothes here along with great service. Not your typical L5P shop. 
10807 3 Had a sandwich at the bar sitting area at lunch. Not busy here and service was fine. Not sketchy inside right now. 
10808 4 Competent and friendly techs who really know their stuff, and they put you at ease as much as possible. Its quiet and I liked it much, much better than another center I went to. 
10809 4 HOLY CRAP GUYS. I kind of wish I didn't know about this place...the groupon deal was amazing. We got fries with two sauses (cheddar duvel and aioli--both were incredible) and two waffles--nutella and salted caramel. GET THE SALTED CARAMEL THAT THING IS CRACK. everything we had was delicious. and huge. 
10810 4 The best breakfast in Vancouver! The coffee is great and you can't go wrong with any choice. 
10811 4 Good alternative to the National chains. Everything from wings to burgers to salads. Cheap beer and the food is very reasonably priced. Would definitely go back, I'm sure food and service is a little slower during the school year, games, etc., but thats expected. Worth a try! 
10812 4 This place is now called THE SPOT. They just changed their name but as far as I can tell they are the same place. Great talented workers here, great atmosphere. They are located right next to Home Depot on 620 near Four Points. 
10813 1 Waitress wonderful personality, but service was slow. Ordered blackened mahi sandwich which had absolutely no taste the fries had more taste than fish. The other guests with me were also unhappy with their food. Nice atmosphere, but expensive for quality of food. Will not return 
10814 4 Excellent holiday meals served in the main dining room. Wonderful selections, great service and beautiful views of the Boston Common. Dining Room is exactly the way it was when it was the old ritz, beautifully appointed yet comfortable. 
10815 0 Poor service, mediocre food and beer. I have been her 4-5 times and every time it been the same. The bartenders were arrogant and opinionated. Not worth the time to stop 
10816 3 Got the General Gau's Chicken, and spring rolls. I can't complain. They were exactly what I wanted, and tasted delicious. Big servings. Rice does not come with the chicken, though... sort of a let down, but I should have known. Fast delivery. Nice driver. 
10817 3 I had the beef stew with the French bread and I don't know maybe I just really like bread but the French bread was awesome. Also they have so many more choices on the menu then pho which was refreshing to see. This place is huge. 
10818 4 The rooftop patio is super nice and their Frito Pie is amazing! Enjoyed a nice cold margarita with way too much food on the roof. Great spot for relaxing and good food and drink options. 
10819 4 Went twice during my stay in Vancouver despite long lines and not amazing service. The food is flat out excellent. We got waffles and breakfast sides (baked beans, eggs, potatoes) and were amazed. Great coffee too. 
10820 0 Got all my fluids changed here on my Subaru 2009 less than a month after my engine is blown now looking at a new car or over $7k in engine replacement work stick to Tire and Batteries here!! 
10821 3 Holy Mother!! If you think the trailer experience is great...the restaurant creations will blow your mind. Fun atmosphere, great drinks and ...just ok staff. Can't wait to go back and stuff my face again. 
10822 4 My favorite food truck that comes to my office park! I like both the salads and wraps equally, but the best choice is the Vegetarian. The portions are perfect and the ingredients are fresh. Only con is that the truck doesn't make a regular appearance. 
10823 3 Seriously good chicken shawarma! Not the best looking restaurant; take out is much better. Sadly the Falafels aren't great. 
10824 4 I love the lunch buffet. They change their selection daily so you never get the same thing twice. 
10825 4 Have been working with Trudeau's for over 12 years. They have done personal fencing and business fencing for me. Always a top notch job and would not consider anyone for my fencing! 
10826 4 After being let down by another leading eye care company I tried Visionworks on E Colonial, Orlando. The exam, customer service, and product were all 5 stars. 6 stars actually as all of my expectations were exceeded. 
10827 3 Hot chicken is very spicy. Almost too much. And I like spicy food. Chicken sandwich was wonderful. Quality breading. Fries were delicious. Pickled cucumbers were very tasty. Mac salad solid. Great open seating area with several other food places to choose from and beer options. 
10828 4 LOVE THIS SHOP...........Interesting items.......great prices......friendly dealers........ 
10829 3 I enjoy going here for some standard Chinese fare, good service and takeout. Good neighborhood joint. 
10830 4 Excellent experience. No pressure. Jordan was very helpful and found the Rav 4 I wanted and offered a fair discount off of MSRP. 
10831 3 I have lived in Miami and Tampa and enjoyed Cuban food everywhere. When I moved to Atlanta, imagine my surprise to find Papi's. I enjoy Papi's Ropa Vieja more than any dish anywhere. Papi's is the bomb 
10832 3 This place has countless kinds of subs, all kinds imaginable since its located in Boulder; from veggies to tempeh, from seafood to all kinds of meats and cheeses! 
10833 4 Really fun atmosphere. It's a small hidden gem with good food, an attentive wait staff, and lots of little unexpected quirks. I would definitely visit again! 
10834 4 This place is consistently very tasty. Drink menu is huge and I have never had bad service! Prices are a bit high but quality is there to match so it's never bothered me. If the daily pancake has pears and cinnamon then don't miss it 
10835 4 This place has the best quality in boulder! They always have the best variety of strains at the lowest prices. Best bud tenders who are always super helpful! 
10836 1 They don't call me the Taco Mac-Daddy for nothing! Just kidding, lol! but in all seriousness my wings were cold when they came and our guac was brown. The service took really long as well. Just an all around non-optimal experience. 
10837 4 Food was delicious, specifically the tagliatelle pasta dish. Service was excellent- our waitress, Missy, recommended a great bottle of wine to go with our meals. We live in the Benjamin and will definitely be back! 
10838 4 Helen is so friendly and she makes the best arrangements. I would recommend going to the Concord Flower shop for all your floral needs! 
10839 3 great beer selection, music was really loud but the sandwiches were awesome. 
10840 4 We've used Economy twice now, once for some under the sink leaks and once for a dead water heater. Prices were reasonable and service was prompt. Everyone that has come out has been very friendly and helpful, and everything they've fixed has stayed fixed. 
10841 4 Dun dun noodles are amazing and the dumplings were awesome also vet good food and very good service love this place 
10842 4 Had a great experience. Mini burger of the week was juicy and tasty. Plus they have great drink specials. 
10843 4 Very good sushi place. Excellent beef nigiri sushi... fish imported from Japan a few times a week. 
10844 1 While the amenities and flight seemed nice, this airline lost MAJOR points for putting us in the seats that didn't recline on an overnight flight, while charging us for regular cabin fare. VERY disappointing... Watch when you book and anything in row 25-26 should be avoided 
10845 4 been hunting for an izakaya like this and finally found it after 2 years in boston! super generous servings of sashimi, broiled squid, good and fresh and inexpensive sake, beer made for a fun, casual, and yummy evening. $1 valet, so you don't even have to worry about parking. 
10846 4 Delicious and imaginative cocktails. Friendly and knowledgeable bartenders. Made from scratch infused liquors, jams, syrups and more. Plus, a very warm, friendly, and fun atmosphere. All in all it was everything I could hope for from a cocktail bar. Highly recommended! 
10847 2 Food is good but the chick working today should fix her attitude. You're probably gonna lose customers. 
10848 4 So good, so friendly, gluten-free crepe options too! And that ice cream...oh my...a night with all that, in a sweet locale with good friends? Nice! And definitely will do again. 
10849 4 What an incredible lunch! Vegetarian tostada swimming in delectable roasted fresh seasonal vegetables (mushrooms, green beans, beets, brussel sprouts). The flavors melded into an amazing dish that was most satisfying and reasonably priced. My eating companions were similarly amazed with their taco choices. This restaurant is a gem! 
10850 3 The DC store is better but Atlanta has great customer service. 
10851 4 Great service from the waiters/waitresses. The gadget on the table allows you to order your own appetizers and desserts quickly. Nice feature. 
10852 3 Nice neighborhood dessert lunch place. Staff are great and helpful. Offer frozen pies too! 
10853 4 Great sushi and hot food dishes as well. The Tuna Belly was some of the best I've ever had. The atmosphere was great too. I will come back. 
10854 0 service was mediocre, menu was limited and no one in our group of six even remotely enjoyed their meal. would not recommend or ever go here again. For $30 a plate, there are much better options around the corner. 
10855 3 Have been several times. Food was great each time. We enjoyed our food best on the deck but the menu on the indoor dining is much better. 
10856 4 I am not a lover of donuts since I usually think they're too sweet, but these donuts are so damn good. I'm a huge fan of the hazelnut and berry pistachio. I told myself I'd only eat a sliver of each, and suddenly found myself devouring both. 
10857 4 OMG!! This is an amazing place to get good Hawaiian Cuisine!! The presentation is enough to make the salivary glands go crazy and the portions are very generous! We are definitely coming back to find The Big Kahuna! 
10858 4 the best coxinhas that ever entered my mouth. get the one with catupiry. and their kibe is really good too. Acai bowls out of this world. everything is delicious and fresh. love!!!!! 
10859 0 Looking to do a cleanse? Great news, this is the perfect place to get food poisoning and pass everything. Seriously, I've been here twice and my wife and I both got really sick. This place is dirty and terrible. 
10860 2 Thank you to FedEx. They refunded me for the insurance. I didn't have to go through all the paperwork. I feel much better about this company. 
10861 4 Lots of rumors that they were closing...but were just closed for a month for renovations. Phone working again, and just spoke to someone who said they're re-opening tomorrow. Great bar with good beer selection on draft (keep the Ballast point flowing), reasonable prices, and friendly staff & customers. 
10862 4 After the disappointment of eating mediocre sushi elsewhere, I was pleasantly surprised with Sashimi Sushi in Lougheed Town Centre. Their sushi tastes great and the price is good too. I love their yam and avocado rolls and the veggie bento box is delicious too, 
10863 3 One of the best sushi places I've been to! Portions are good, prices are reasonable, friendly staff..even got a free bottle of wine for the holidays! 
10864 4 The fries are the bomb, and the burgers actually make me feel younger. Not sure why, but wow. Seriously. 
10865 4 Great food - great service! They are super friendly too! Their food is fresh and tastes great. No processed food or chemical taste as with other places. 
10866 4 Such a cute little shop that serves organic coffee and treats and offers vegan ice cream!!!! The menu is beautiful and illustrates exactly what is in your drink which is so helpful to me! The barista was so kind and I loved her suggestion! Fun area of town, too 
10867 3 One of my favorite greasy food spots! I wouldn't get too adventurous with the menu though - stick to the pizza and the calzones! 
10868 4 Delicious sushi, soothing music, modern atmosphere, and adorable bartenders! What's not to love! 
10869 4 This place is addicting! I ordered from here 3x in the last 2 weeks. Chicken is perfect, potatoes are flavorful (I believe they're roasted under chicken drippings), focaccia is tasty, salad is a perfect compliment, and the red sauce is wonderful (I always order extra). 
10870 0 Very unhappy with service here!!!!!! Not so much Ned, but the other a-hole with the accent. What a jerk!!! I would never recommend this place. After going back twice to remedy a newly defective LCD cover that they installed, they told me they wouldn't replace it. NOT HAPPY!!! 
10871 4 I have attended two wine tastings and they have been fabulous! Met some neighbors I did not know and got some great wines! 
10872 3 Visited is hotel about 4 times this year .. Big and beautiful a lot going all the time.. Rooms are beautiful, room prices are not to bad The staff is not very helpful and that's why 4 stars instead of 5 
10873 3 I can't believe that I haven't been to this Jamba more often as I fly through ATL quite a bit. It's a great place to get a mango a go-go in between flights and the Jamba helps you to refresh and rejuvenate before your next flight. 
10874 4 First time I had bone marrow. Great place with awesome waitors. 
10875 4 DunDun Noodles and scallion pancakes are fantastic! Don't be fooled by the dated, gross decor. The food is great! 
10876 3 It was tasty food. Creative. Whoever I will not recommend coming to get drunk than eating there meal. Not nearly enough carbs to absorb the booze... Oi! We came for a Holiday party. It was a nice venue. I do recommend this. Great Martini and Wine selection. 
10877 4 Love this place. Awesome vibes. I never go here without ordering a bowl of the broccoli cheese soup, it's that good. They have open mic night on Thursday and that's pretty entertaining, even if you're just observing. The green haired cashier is my fave! Super nice, super chill. Great service. 
10878 0 My sandwich was awful. $10 for a tortilla, cheese, old cucumbers and sprouts. The staff was friendly, but what a waste of money. I won't be back. 
10879 4 After getting caught in the pouring rain for two hours, a couple of slices from this place really hit the spot. Sizzling hot, great ingredients. Some of the best pizza that I've had on the west coast. My wife normally hates pizza but she thought this was delicious. 
10880 0 Fake "mexican" food (again, picture me making air quotes), made by underpaid white people. It's trying to be an upscale version of taco bell. Totally gross. 
10881 4 Didn't expect much. .service pitiful. .college location..should be eh. .but oh my god. .the best falafel I had ever. .totally surprised.fries yummy and hot. .falafel crispy and most. .toppings flavorful ..will go back 
10882 0 My smoothie had far too many seeds. The cashier ignored us when we told her to have a nice day. The smoothies weren't that good either. Never again. 
10883 4 This place has a very cool feel. Kick back and relaxed. The staff and customers are fun and welcoming. 
10884 4 Again tonight pizza arrives piping hot in 20 mins!! Wow! See pic and it always has more then enough toppings. Great delivery people. 
10885 0 Last time I checked it wasn't hard to look at a list of items and place them in the damn bag. However McDonalds ALWAYS seems to mess it up. It's very frustrating. Check your bag before you leave 
10886 4 good customer service. This store is well organized and the people that work there are customer oriented. 
10887 4 Best garlic noodles and chicken wings EVER glad we had lunch here dumplings were good too 
10888 4 Great tour! We had Charlotte and Jenny as our tour guides! They were AMAZING! They were entertaining and knowledgeable! We had a great time! 
10889 2 CPK is a great place to eat at the mall (especially when given the other alternatives). The food and staff is always consistent. I have no complaints. Try the Thai crunch salad and the wild mushroom pizza. 
10890 4 Fun frozen yogurt place. Tasted rich and not like yogurt at all, We had the chocolate yogurt with peanut butter sauce and peanuts and pistachio and cream with fresh fruit Crazy amount of toppings, but most importantly peanut butter sauce! 
10891 4 Love, love, love the baristas at this location. They always make my chai latte perfectly and greet everyone with a smile. Also love to give a shout out to Khammi, an artist/barista, who created a beautiful portrait of my pup. She is amazing! 
10892 3 Lol so the service today was slightly all over the place and we got like 3 waiters, who were all very kind! Anyway the food was good, especially the refried beans wow! First time having migas and was super happy with that. Overall a solid 4 stars 
10893 1 Food was meh...over priced. Service was ok, but nothing special. Can't help but think that Man vs. Food caused this decline in service since traffic probably just gets handed to these guys. Don't plan on coming back. Lobster roll on sweet bun...why??? 
10894 4 My wife and I both enjoyed our meals. When ever my wife can say she likes a pub (meaning, she enjoyed the food), its a keeper. This is a comfortable place to come with family or friends and chat. 
10895 4 Great food! Such a cozy atmosphere. I'm obsessed with their chive & dill wedge. Num! 
10896 4 Amazing love the khao soi. So good !! Haven't been unhappy with anything I recommend on getting level two on spice ! I am really picky so it was great. I would only come here if you like training new things Plus the lettuce wraps have amazing sauces 
10897 3 The brown sugar gelato was quite tasty not my favorite place but still up there on my list 
10898 4 Such good food and great price and service. Best value in all of Vancouver. A hidden gem. 
10899 2 Its all you can eat sushi, don't expect high end sushi but its not bad if your hungry or have really hungry friends 
10900 3 They have great and fresh sushi and a wonderful space to dine in. The customer service is top-notch and they are very welcoming. Great environment Would definitely recommend. 
10901 3 We ordered the pizza and it was very good. It was a little difficult to get to, but not impossible. The pizza sauce did not have enough tomato flavor for my husband, but I really like it. There was a lot of delicious, gooey cheese. 
10902 4 Great Service! A nice place to catch your breath at the end of they day at Animal Kingdom. Menu has something for everyone. 
10903 0 I was not a happy employee when I worked here. 
10904 0 Horrible lamb, looked and tasted like lunch meat. Pricey for small gross portions. Server was not too pleasant. I will never go back here again. 
10905 3 Traveled 90 minutes just to try this out Wonderfully pleased. Will be back for sure. Loved the BBQ beans and bread pudding 
10906 4 Good cheap Chinese food. Portions are huge. 
10907 4 Did the vegan buffet. I enjoy my protein as much as the next guy but the food made a strong case for a vegan lifestyle. Everything was fresh and very filling. Owner was very hospitable. Would go back in a heartbeat. 
10908 0 Wanted to try out for dinner. Went with 45 minutes till closing and they told me all they can make we're fries. So if you are hungry and it is almost closing time don't even try. 
10909 4 Forgive me for losing the card with the name of the man who fixed our dryer- but he did a fabulous job, only charged us the minimum base rate, was super-friendly, and even wore boot covers into our home. Best we could have hoped for! 
10910 1 Queso fundido = solid, salty. Nice salsa. Enchiladas mixtas sauce has a BBQ sauce tangy quality. Three meats within very dry. Corn tortillas on flautas were soft throughout. Sauce on these also weird. Bartender solo. Overburdened. 
10911 0 Oh my god worst ramen ever. Nuff said. Taste like the ones your next door neighbor can make. Do not come here. 
10912 3 I enjoy coming here to eat a little, drink a little and work on my computer. I've been there enough that the staff knows me by name. It is truly nice to go where everybody knows your name! It's a great place to chill without having a lot of distractions. 
10913 4 The best takeout in Atlanta!!! The owner, Ronnie, is super nice. The service is great and I've recently been introduced to their pork fried rice... Oh my god. 
10914 3 Fresh, very fresh, ingredients. Good price, good food, huge servings. They close at 10 which is sometimes too early for us. Menu is limited to Mexican only. The interior is 'cold' in design so I've only done take out. 
10915 0 This store smells, the checkout lines are long, and has over all appearance of being run down 
10916 1 This place is spacious but so chaotic. They need more staff and more procedures. I like dave n busters much better! 
10917 4 Love it love it love it service is good price is good best breakfast joint ever. So glad they opened one in clermont. Ask for Mario best server ever. 
10918 4 I am always pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dishes and the variety in the menu items. I do miss the big fountain but change is good. Can never resist their baklava. Try the pizza first. It's our favorite. 
10919 4 As German as it can get in the US. Try something authentic, it's not the place to order a burger or a salad. So many great German dishes to choose from. Save room for a Vanilla Cream Puff. Sean M at the bar gave us attentive and friendly service. 
10920 4 Simply Amazing!! Salmon Eggs Benedict and Mushroom Scallop Omelet were a perfect start to our Morning! 
10921 4 Always pleasant. Professional. And speedy. Have my mailbox here too and it's a great service and package. Dont see me leaving here anytime soon 
10922 0 By far the rudest bartenders/hosts in Atlanta fine(ish) dining, I expected so much more, we decided to not even stay for dinner after our initial impression with drinks and apps at the bar. 
10923 3 Great espresso and service! More variety of food compatible with coffee drinks and more room would have made me give 5 stars. 
10924 3 I have tried many hot chocolates, but this place by far has the best. It's not too sweet, but just right. They also have very good blueberry muffins. 
10925 3 Pretty good! The delivery was on time and prices were reasonable. I got the spinach and cheese momos which were FANTASTIC. I also got the tofu curry which was just okay (a bit bland). Get the momos, you won't be sorry. 
10926 4 This place was great! We ate on the patio and had the most wonderful service. We had the mussels and they are my favorite in Atlanta now. The sausage in the sauce is to die for! The cheese and meat plate is a must! 
10927 0 I've been here before but it's gone so down hill. Paid extra for breast that was the size of a large wing It was overcooked and puny. I gave it a one because the pie was at least good 
10928 4 Definitely one of the best book stores I have ever been to the selections are huge and the prices are very good. Nothing more to say 
10929 2 The food is slightly above average as I have tried almost all of their pizzas. However, I believe its a bot overpriced if you'd like to get it delivered. I can't convince myself to give this place more than 3 stars as their service is too average too! 
10930 4 Great food and great staff. I think it was the owner who came and talked with us and welcomed us to the restaurant. He gave us a cool back story on it and even gave us a complimentary sample of their queso, which was very good. 
10931 4 This was a VERY FUN place. I ended up going here 3 times in one week due to proximity of our hotel. The belly dancers were really entertaining and the food was good. I think this place is really great to be entertained and have some fun. 
10932 3 A little slow, but it is a Friday night. Food was good (carnitas burger and yam fries). 
10933 4 I have and will go out of my way to get a flat fixed or to get used tires to replace my old ones. Been going to them for the last 5 years and no regrets. Always in and out and friendly. 
10934 4 So happy with Two Caterers!! I have used them several time on my job to cater events and meetings. They always do a great job and are very helpful. It is always stress free. 
10935 1 Egg scramblers. Rubber pancakes with hard, dry, chewy blueberries. Sausage wasn't served hot. Hash browns were ok. The syrups were horrible. The server was nice and the coffee was decent. I've been to other ihops and enjoyed my breakfast. Skip this one and hit the 50's diner nearby. 
10936 3 PHIL!!!!! He is the man and his customer service is by far the best I've ever seen! Keep him! I give 4 stars because my order got all mixed up 2 times and only revived a credit and had to drive all the way back there and wait .. 
10937 3 It's a great place to eat nice portions, great for lunch and dinner. The staff is nice and friendly. It has a nice and warm feeling. So if you're in mood for good food, I recommend you check it out. 
10938 3 It is a bar that offers it all as far as entertainment. You can sit down and listen to a live band or dance to the latest hip-hop without ever leaving. The dollar drafts aren't too bad either. 
10939 4 Amazing food and great service. Friendly owner. Original Tali service. You know it's good when half the customers are Indian. Flavors are addicting. Keeps me coming all the way from Roswell. 
10940 4 Omg best frozen yogurt ever. I was so hungry when I went here and it definitely fixed that. So fresh and fruity. Totally loved it!! 
10941 4 Bought a car last September. Worked with junior! Ver happy with our experience here. He made the process easy! Great quality car as well!! 
10942 4 I usually get the falafel wrap which is always good. I love their grab and go fruit cups and salads. The place could use a little TLC but it still good. It gets very crowded around lunch time so be prepared to wait. 
10943 3 Go to this place. I guarantee you'll like it! Have the ribs - better than a BBQ joint!! 
10944 1 Food was alright...quality was OK.. I was done eating by the time my wife got her meal..... No apology.. Was just told that kitchen lost her order and they will get it in... I know things happen... But on the second visit... Service was still lacking.... 
10945 3 This is a fun place, they have a stage in the back room where they have events and the cubby claws are awesome parmesan garlic is my best favorite 
10946 4 Jeana took care of my dog's quarterly-ish grooming for years, and did excellent work. We're sorry we moved out of her area! 
10947 4 Excellent food. One of the few places that still feels like a deli. The Matzoh Ball Soup is great! 
10948 4 Pizza Works has awesome pizza. I recently started ordering pizza from here on Friday nights. This pizza is great and staff are just as great. 
10949 1 I'm sitting in this Krystal right now, waiting for my to-go order. It has literally been 20 minutes since I ordered and the ppl who were in front of me are still waiting. TWENTY MINUTES AND COUNTING. What could possibly explain such a long wait?!?! 
10950 3 This review is long overdue. There is a bit of a wait for breakfast, so go early. The food is great, the outdoor seating is nice and they are pet friendly! The service is great and the portions are big. 
10951 4 Best Chinese in town! Have ordered take out more times then I can count on my hands! Sesame & Honey chicken are the best! 
10952 4 Thank you for being the only place/bar in town that has skeeball! My first time being at Scoot Inn was for the We Make Stuff Fashion show and loved the extra room, the area and still didn't feel like I was packed in and claustrophobic. 
10953 4 Came here after being away from home for five years, loved it!! Had a blast!! Lets start with the guy at the door, sooo sweet and friendly! The atmosphere was great! and the bartender really knows how to mix the drinks!!! Def. one of my favorite places in Vancouver now! 
10954 4 Love the frituras & gotta love that rice & beans & Carne frita check out the menu.lol 
10955 4 Damn good fried chicken. Crisp on the outside. Super moist on the inside. Lives up to its name. Warning it's got a little kick to it. Filled up for just $10. 
10956 4 Best sandwiches and customer service hands down. The staff are always super upbeat and happy. Eat here! Shop here! Do it. 
10957 4 This is the best fried chicken I've ever had. Stevie's got something special in that batter. And the waffles are out of control. Just go. Plus he has a few picnic benches so there is plenty of room to sit and get down on your tasty food. 
10958 4 Great Customer service and really understanding staff, I had to cancel my flight due to an emergency situation and even though I bought the ticket through Expedia they kindly rewarded me back with another credit towards a future flight! 
10959 4 I LOVE Jimmy. First he helped me find a impossible sized bolt to install my over the range microwave. Then he cranked and demo my new STIHL edger... and he cooks on a Big Green Egg. He's Perfect!!!! 
10960 3 Bookhouse does a good job. When it comes to Atlanta pubs. My recommendations will always be Steinbecks, The Porter, and now Bookhouse. 
10961 4 Had coffee from the self-self machine and wintermoon latte - both very good and above average coffee. Definitely will be coming back a lot. 
10962 3 Place gets busy so it's a dog eat dog when it comes to ordering. Then again what else would you expect from a busy place. Meaning popular for it's Devine pizza and craft beer selection. 
10963 2 Decent but not great Mexican. Didn't finish my chicken chimi because it was so bland and lacked seasoning. Our waitress struggled with not basic orders as her English was not strong. Will probably return because family loves it here but wouldn't recommend it. 
10964 0 Unless you are willing to wait 20-30 min for a drink, don't come here. Literally 5 people in front of me waiting for a drink and it took that long. 
10965 3 fast, good. Robert memorizes your name quickly and is friendly. The rest of staff are not really friendly but get the job done. 
10966 3 I love that this place delivers! The Tom Kha is some of the best I've ever had. I had been avoiding the pad thai becuase I found it a little bland but I decided to order it again and it was much improved! Delicious curry and very friendly service! 
10967 3 Great selection of beers, including Texas beers. The bartenders could be more engaging they kinda just stare at the wall waiting for orders and have no interest in talking or being social, something important to a top notch bar. 
10968 3 Came here for a quick dessert. I ordered the pandan waffles which was made fresh. It had good flavor and texture, I would definitely get it again. 
10969 3 Went during a busy weekday lunch. Line moved fast, pulled chicken was good, could have used a tad more seasoning. Next time will get the half chicken. Vinegar slaw was good, as was the house salad. Place was clean, well kept, and staff was friendly. I'll be back. 
10970 3 I had the vegan burger and was amazed at how delicious it was. It tastes like a real burger!! I loved the tater tots too. Onion rings were good but a little too thin. 
10971 4 Was in town for business and ordered delivery! It was delicious! And the customer service was really great!!!! Really authentic Mediterranean food :) 
10972 3 Food was dry and overpriced I didn't really enjoy eating here and I don't plan to come back again in the future ... 
10973 0 Worst customer service ever. My agent is useless. She never returns my calls and took 3 months to apply a routine discount to my policy. Such incompetence. 
10974 4 Gus's is awesome! Consistently delicious and service is always on point. A MUST if you are visiting Austin... seriously. It will change your life. No designated parking lot, so be prepared to search for street parking. Totally worth it! 
10975 3 We just had a wonderful dinner next door, but ice cream for dessert. This place is fabulous. Cartelized apple, toasted marshmallow, blood orange. Very original flavored. We will be back. Yum!!!!! 
10976 3 Nice, cozy atmosphere. Awesome customer service, and tasty food. I tried the catfish tenders and the chicken with red velvet waffles. Delicious! 
10977 4 Tried this place for the first time. They have been open for a few months and are definitely earning their place in downtown. Great affordable Korean Fusion quick and fresh made food. Yall need to check this place out and try their Bulgogi dishes. 
10978 4 Just like the other locations this place is awesome. The tacos are unique and the salsa is tasty. 
10979 4 Well, I have had really nice and really bitchy service here but the clothing selection is great. Its not too expensive and is a great alternative to al of the target clothes you see on the other kids at the park. great selection. 
10980 3 love their hookahs, the ambiance, the hummus sandwich, and the apple juice! Service is kind of slow but it's a nice little find so far! 
10981 3 Great food but expensive. It's a great place to go just to try something different but expect to drop a pretty penny. 
10982 0 Asked my server for a non-traditional Rye drink. I Was informed that they can only make manhattans and old fashions. I ordered a Manhattan. Turns out even that was too ambitious. It had dry vermouth and a lime! Could not send it back because We were ignored by wait staff. 
10983 4 Love this place! The dishes are always fresh and flavorful. Their house dressing and garlic sauce/hummus is amazing. The food is fast but gourmet. Love that it's a local place and a staple in Norwood. 
10984 3 Great place to have a drink and end your day. It's a nice place two windows. I am a fan of their happy hour because you can try quite a few of their popular appetizers for very reasonable. You can't beat the size of the apps either. 
10985 0 Regardless of the food quality, making your customers wait over 30 minutes for their food is inexcusable. You're in a central business district. Really dissapointing. 
10986 2 Not a bad place to grab coffee and a pastry late at night. It's cool that they are open late and their prices don't break the bank either, for a downtown establishment. Having said all that, they're nothing to write home about. Just another coffee and dessert kind of place. 
10987 3 Not the place to go if you're looking for vegetables or something healthy, but the fried chicken is hot, spicy, and delicious! 
10988 4 Fenomenal. Phat pearls so amaze. If I could drink this everyday I would probably look like Majin Bu from dragon ball in all his pink fat chubness 
10989 4 Best sausage sandwich ever, hands down! Skip the food inside the stadium and head for the sausage guy. There are a few other inferior purveyors of sausage nearby who want you to eat their meat, but save yourself for "Sausage Guy." 
10990 2 OK food for an OK price. If you're hungry and cheap, go here. You may stuff yourself silly, but you won't spend a fortune. For all the haters who can't handle good old fashioned American obesity and lots of kids, what else do you expect at a buffet?! 
10991 4 Everything we had was phenomenal. I had the scallops with pumpkin risotto. They were buttery and flavorful! The blood orange margarita was DELICIOUS. I have been very disappointed with almost all Disney dining options, but flying fish was well worth the trip to the boardwalk. 
10992 1 I must admit, I've never had a Cuban before, but my first experience with one at Papi's was underwhelming. The combination of meats had a weird foul taste. The waitress was nice enough to replace my Cuban with a talapia fish sandwich. It was also underwhelming. Bread,lettuce, cheese nothing special. 
10993 3 Fun, relaxed atmosphere paired with delicious food and good beer! Cozy so it's not so loud you can't talk, outdoor seating and within walking distance to downtown. Thanks for a great night! 
10994 1 The walls are too thin, so if you have a noisy neighbor, you're outta luck. Pillows are paper thin once you lay on them. Breakfast buffet is not worth the $12.99 they charge. Staff is friendly, but that's all the hotel has going for it. 
10995 4 Went Christmas Eve night - service was great. place was busy. food was great. Had reservations and were seated quickly. I had Chicken Saltimbocca, others had pizza, linguine, cioppino, bolognese and carbonara. 
10996 4 They're awesome! Very friendly, timely and organized. Had everything needed to move all of my stuff. Definitely will use them again. 
10997 1 In town for a conference during spring break. Sheraton is usually a reputable hotel brand. Unfortunately, this location missed the mark in cleanliness and comfort. Hopefully a renovation is in the near future. 
10998 4 Best patio in town! Extensive wine list, happy hour during the week and brunch on the weekends. Perfect! 
10999 4 Yesterday was my first time trying gelato, and I'm so glad it was with Honeysuckle. The vanilla bean is amazing, and I'm not too sure if I'll be able to make the switch back to ice cream anytime soon. 
11000 3 These guys were really friendly. They gave a cookie to my crying daughter ...which probably just rewarded her for whining...but you get the idea. 
11001 4 Very Good food. Service Is Excellent! We came in with a Party of 13 and our waitress was very Good. We have been going here for at least 20 years and we have never been disappointed, Always Satisfied! Thank you to the staff! 
11002 0 I called to as the price of the Satsuma body gel and scrub. The person who answered the phone was laughing and then she hung up on me. Very unprofessional and I'll go to another store downtown. At least there I know they know how to run a business. 
11003 3 Great food. Great prices. This place has become a regular for me and my family. They have several large screen tv's on the wall and a fireplace in the winter. Pizza is great, meatballs are great and I also like the chicken parm. My wife loves the lobster ravioli. 
11004 3 They are a little bit expensive but they had what I was looking for when nobody else did. They also have a lot of US made stuff which is always a plus in my book. 
11005 3 Get the curry bowl,its the best food on the menu and its more than enough,you will be stuffed 
11006 4 Such a great selection of handmade shoes from all over the world. Service is always impeccable and the ladies are very attentive when it comes to particular questions or needs. Definitely my go-to spot to shoe shop in Kits. 
11007 4 Family owned restaurant serving authentic delicious Moroccon food at a very reasonable price. Very happy with the service, very warm ambiance, will go there again. 
11008 3 Dinner and drinks were good. We sat out on the patio. Nice atmosphere. Friendly servers. 
11009 4 Get the Roasted Mellanzana wrap!! It's soooooooo tasty. Everything is delicious here - you really can't go wrong! 
11010 4 Great food Great service & staff. Better than the large chains in the area in my opinion. We will definitely be back! 
11011 4 Joe is amazing me and my two sisters are clients of his. He not only makes my eye brows perfect but he has tons of knowledge on make up and never steers me wrong. I will always continue to see Joe. 
11012 4 Top notch wedding venue! Our son and daughter-in-law's reception was flawless! Beautiful setting, delicious food, every detail was amazing! Love the bridal and groom suites! Very professional employees who made sure everything was perfect! Thanks for the wonderful day and heartfelt memories you allowed us to experience! 
11013 4 The vanilla latte was magnificent. Charlie, our server, was very attentive and has a great personality. I'll definitely be back. 
11014 3 Great spot, great selection and nice helpful staff. 
11015 3 I liked the sausages, the beer, and the vibe! Must try the humongous choux. 
11016 4 I found that it really helped me take responsibility for my life and actions. A great self reflection and positive outlook. Recommend to anyone that wants to be generally happy. 
11017 4 The best bar in Portland. Not too loud, not too packed. Great crowd, great bartenders, great drinks. Try the hot cider! I always feel comfortable here, and receive great service. 
11018 4 I took my mother here for a birthday mani/pedi today. They were so nice and did a great job. The husband and wife owners were so sweet and really take pride in their business with great attention to detail! I'll definitely go back :) 
11019 2 It's okay but just okay. Food was okay, nothing too special. I felt like it was overpriced. The service was good and the atmosphere is nice and the place is nicely decorated. 
11020 4 Very good bubble tea. Lots of choices. Fresh fruit. Great sandwiches for a low price. Very nice and kind owners! 
11021 4 It was over the moon good. Delicious! I'm addicted. What do y'all do, put crack in there? It's hard to find a place to sit but that's normal for a coffee shop. 
11022 3 On a girls weekend in Atlanta. Fabulous margaritas, nice and strong! We had steak fajitas and vegetable tacos. Both were delicious. Perhaps the ambience could have been better but after first cocktail we didn't care. Would recommend for the drinks alone. 
11023 1 Generally clean, nice staff, but there was an intense musty smell that lingered in the room and hallways. Probably would not be staying here again. The damp carpet was especially worrying, but the beds were comfortable and clean. 
11024 4 A really good breakfast and atmosphere. Pastries are awesome. Mickey was the "shiz". He made our experience enjoyable!!!! 
11025 4 Why are more people not going to this place? I have driven past dozens of times before I finally went in. They have parking. Friendly owners. Not least of all AMAZING food. I've tried several dishes and have not been disappointed. 
11026 0 Manager was apathetic and totally unwilling to accept responsibility for items missing from my order. Instead, she said I had to contact UberEATS and request a refund. I won't order from here again. 
11027 3 The best Pho in Vancouver. So so good. And if you like spring rolls, have them here, I can never not order them. Loses a star for ambiance. It could be a bit brighter and nicer inside. 
11028 1 Not really sure why a restaurant that presents itself as Pacific Northwest inspired cuisine serves Atlantic farm raised salmon. Wild salmon is available year around from different suppliers and is much better for you. Don't be ripped off by a $45.00 piece of cheap salmon. 
11029 4 Always have a great experience. Food is delish! Love the egg rolls and sesame chicken. Quick and friendly delivery. 
11030 4 Great sandwich place. The smoking sandwich and tuna melt are both abfab 
11031 3 Great place for dogs to swim. Many spots off the trail to jump in. The only downside is the parking situation. Small lot and you may need to wait in line for a spot to park. Otherwise, great experience. 
11032 4 Fantastic food through all nine courses. Equally amazing service, incredibly friendly, not at all pretentious, we learned a lot and had a great time. highly, highly recommended 
11033 3 Pretty cool interior much better than competitors on route 1! Deff underrated. The menu is a bit basic but then again i went as soon as it opened but yet it was still satisfying the drinks are very good 
11034 4 One of the friendliest and most efficient Starbucks I have ever been in. Because of the location there is a line but barely anywhere actually sitting and eating/drinking there. Mostly everyone gets "to go" so it's a good spot to work if need be. 
11035 3 fresh, delicious, cheap and friendly! can't beat it! my first visit to an Austin food truck. fun! 
11036 1 Waaaaayyyy over-priced. We went for New Year's Eve- $60 prix fix menu. Three TINY courses. I mean, hilariously small. If you have money overflowing your pockets, bring it on. Aside from that, nice atmosphere and cool Spanish-only wine list. 
11037 4 Oh man! So good! Clean, quiet and delicious! Don't let the building fool you, it's amazing. 
11038 4 Very nice selection of both fresh and saltwater fish. Tanks are set up nice and doesn't feel dark and cramped like some other fish stores. 
11039 1 Don't know why so many people gave high scores here. But for me, it is definitely not wroth that. It's even not as good as Pavement Coffee. Very few tables, bad services, and the food and coffee are just very so so. You'd better go to Thinking Cup. 
11040 4 Place was packed and the food was really good. I did take out and the food was still hot when I got home! I like their orange chicken! Great find! 
11041 4 Just go, order a burger and try their sauces. That's all. You'll walk out satisfied! So worth it and great prices. Please try their sauces! 
11042 4 We love this place, DeAngela at check in was amazing & funny. We love the pirate pool. The villas are very nice. Love having the washer & dryer, full kitchen ( in 2BR). 
11043 3 My boyfriend and I came here after spending time at Bracket Town during the NCAA Final Four Weekend here in Atlanta. It was very quiet and he atmosphere was nice and relaxing. The food came out hot. The services was great. 
11044 4 Good selection of wine and beer. Food is very different from tavern food. Delicious. 
11045 2 Could be better. Not many people inside and food too along time to get to me. Waitresses were nice. Food was OK. Being used to truck stops it is close to it. 
11046 0 Skippers has changed their breading. It now features some strange, wrong-headed, off putting spice. Won't go back. AVOID. 
11047 4 Si, si, si!!!! Everything Bullfight wishes it could be. Paella is authentic and legit...as was everything else on the menu. The garlic shrimp = perfection since they leave the heads on. Fennel sausage stuffed squid in squid ink...omg! Eat it all...you will not be disappointed. 
11048 2 3.5 stars...like the food and am usually patient but 25 minutes for eggs on a Thursday seems crazy. Service always nice though and atmosphere enjoyable. Will come back but may limit to the Mon thru Wed timeframe when hope of meal turnaround better. 
11049 4 Our favorite spot for brunch. Everything is amazing and the customer service is even better! And all the gay boys are adorable. Please come here and enjoy. It's simple amazing! 
11050 3 I've traveled all over US and UK, this is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to. The Tikka Masala and Saag Paneer are some of the best anywhere. Thank god they are local. Try it and you'll fall in love. 
11051 4 Mirch masala was divine. The service was great. Great way to finish the evening while on travel. 
11052 2 Great range of products, good prices too. Perfumes, hair products, nail products, and skin. Girl that is ALWAYS there is informed but kind of fakey friendly--just a pet peeve. She just seems burned out and bored but does answer any questions pleasantly. 
11053 4 Newton Driving School is a great driving school, with great price rates and knowledgeable instructors who know what they are doing and are with you every step of the way. If you want to drive with confidence, learn how to drive than you should go to Newton Driving School. 
11054 4 I went to Taiwan two years ago for work, for 9 days. This is easily the closest thing I have tasted in The States. The food is perfect, I was thoroughly impressed. It is so hard to get pork buns right, they nailed it. Awesome ramen as well. 
11055 4 This tour was lots of fun. Just the right amount of tour, without being cheesy. Lots of chocolate to taste at the end, all of which is fabulous. They now have wine and chocolate tasting classes, sounds fun! 
11056 3 The meatball sub sure hit the spot! Their menu is very "straight to the point". What you see is what you get - scrumptious! 
11057 4 Best Mexican food I have ever eaten by far. Absolutely delicious. Everything was authentic. The personal working we're very nice as well. Highly recommended this place. 
11058 4 I can't believe it took me this long to try this place! The service was excelling and my catfish and chips were delicious! I'd go back! 
11059 4 This place is different and the food is great. I love the decor and the staff is amazing it nice and attentive. Will definitely be back soon. 
11060 2 Generally ok experience. Check in was a little slow. But the front desk is very friendly. A little smell in the corridor and the room though. 
11061 4 The best peanut butter cupcakes. We tried Peanut Buttercup and Buckeye! Hard to pick a favorite!! 
11062 4 Man Piece of Cake and Thanksgiving. I think I am going to EXPLODE! No more words 
11063 4 What a cool place! My first time here. Fantastic happy hour food and drink specials! I sure wish it was in my home town. 
11064 4 Loved it! It was authentic as it gets! We had the best time! The margaritas were awesome! and we just had to go back the next day! 
11065 3 Great quality coffee. Pastries are good but they don't wow me. Food is also good but I don't like the seasonings they put in their eggs - they try too hard to fancy eggs up in my opinion. 
11066 4 I wish I found this place sooner. The staff is very nice, the instruments are clean, and they have fancy massage chairs. You can also upgrade to a longer foot massage. I will come back after a long day at a tradeshow. 
11067 3 All I can say is wow!!. The appetizers were excellent, and probably the best bread we've had. The main courses were very good and we had an overall enjoyable time. We will come back. 
11068 4 This little gem is worth the wait. BEST Cajun in Boulder. You gotta try their bisquits, absolutely the best. 
11069 0 The short chubby female hostess who works on Sunday's lied on the phone about availability, then was rude upon arrival. 
11070 3 Titaya's has the best shrimp spring rolls and peanut sauce! That's the extent of my Titaya's experience so I shall save, or would "savor" be more appropriate, the last star for a more in-depth analysis... 
11071 4 This no-frills, very reasonably priced establishment has real dim sum that is delicious. I feel like I am in Asia. Definitely worth a visit. The roast beef and scallion pancake was crunchy and full of flavor. 
11072 3 Nice atmosphere, good food, great wine selection and overall good service. I would definitely recommend the fiddleheads and the paella. The place is loud but the vibe is very nice and relax. Really enjoyed. 
11073 4 Don was so knowledge and thorough. He resized my wedding band. He did a great job. I'd recommend him to anyone. 
11074 4 Best fade in the game. Been trying to find a barber that could work with my fine, wispy-ass head of pseudo-hair for 20 years; I finally have. Best haircut I have ever received. 
11075 4 Excellent food. Great place for group gathering. Love the deck. Queso is to delicious. 
11076 2 Great selection of bubble tea. Taste good. Price is not bad. Just a bit slow on service. When we came place is packed and it's 9:15pm. Not enough space to sit. Great for take out. 
11077 4 Love the Super HEB in Kyle. The produce section has fresh fruit's and vegetables. One of my favorites is the bulk isle with a variety of items that allow you to purchase a little or a lot. Glad to have a Texas based grocery store near home. 
11078 3 Noor serves up great food in small and basic quarters. Great for takeout. Food is served moderately quickly. The wrap was a little too tomato heavy, but I really recommend the Hummus. 
11079 4 Never had a bad pizza here, and the staff are friendly and efficient. Sat at tables, sat alone, sat with friends, sat at the bar, and gotten takeout. All good. 
11080 3 Love this place!!! Boar, bison, elk burgers!!! OK, the service is a bit slow but the place is clean, and they still have the excellent fries with free cheese sauce. 
11081 4 Great new addition to the area. The food is fresh, the atmosphere is inviting and the employees are happily interacting with the customers. I had the gyro platter with Greek fries. Excellent taste, and a large amount of food for the money. I'll be back... 
11082 4 Love this place! The ladies here are so awesome! Griffin is the sweetest and has my skin feeling greater then it was when I walked in. I cant wait to see you next month. Thank you ladies -Dystanie 
11083 3 Solid sandwiches, especially for airport food. The prices are surprisingly reasonable as well, with most sandwiches being about $8 and a 20 oz. soda for $2. Staff is a little absent, but I'm not really complaining. 
11084 1 Food is OK but wow how slow can they be. Really 10 min to get my bill so j can get the help out of here!!! 
11085 1 Service was good but food not. Shrimp tacos had two little shrimp in each. They toasted the tortillas which made them rubbery. Also husbands blacked mahi was big but the fish was very dark inside and dry. Very little curly fries on side. Best thing to order is wings. Safe. 
11086 4 Super friendly staff, never crowded... clean and fun place. Recommend for the family. 
11087 4 You can't order anything here that won't be delicious! They have 2 happy hours, great deals, and if you like nachos, get them! 
11088 4 The food was fantastic and the service was even better!!!! The steak was the best I have ever eaten!!!! We asked for a table outside and they set it up it was beautiful 
11089 1 The Blue Moon was once something At least so I am told The look of the 50s Does the food have to taste just as old? 
11090 4 Simply wonderful. The aroma when you first walk in puts you into a dreamy and nostalgic mood. The truffles and cakes are beautiful and taste like nothing else. The tour was informative and fun. The guide was funny and very personable, making it the cherry on top of the day. 
11091 3 Came here for lunch. Food was excellent. Wait staff a little slow but we weren't in a hurry so overall a good experience. 
11092 4 pretty great product and people! Thanks for customizing my order over the phone and further in person- the level of customer service and quality of the meat will keep my attention as a loyal customer. 
11093 2 Your shrimp po'boys are heavy on the shrimp and light on the bread and sauce. Strangely the same motif for the cheesesteak, lots of meat, less cheesy greasyness that is so desired. Killer tho: sweet potato tots with the myriad bbq sauces. I could eat them shits all day. 
11094 4 very high quality food here. Way better than you would expect just looking inside. The employees are super nice and will offer samples for you to try. Overall a fantastic spot for food in Coolidge Corner! 
11095 4 Come here. Beef Iskander trumps the other dishes, which are also all great. BYOB and live music on Thursdays. 
11096 0 Manager is very rude! We asked for him to put a game on and he told us no and he does not care of we come back. I have lived here a long time and have always come here and supported this place but his attitude just changed that. 
11097 4 Love you this place! I have been going regularly to Faye the last 6 months for my acrylic nails, she rocks! All the girls here are super friendly and the owner is a young girl herself! I will keep coming back! 
11098 3 Miss the wood and the old layout and look. Going to "all metal" makes the place much less cozy, and harder to find things because there are no sections, just one continuous metal wall. Even the lighting seems less friendly. 
11099 4 Quality of food is awesome. Owner is super friendly. They were open in snowstorm last week when most businesses shut down early. The staff greets you when you walk in. The tvs are a nice touch during lunch. 
11100 3 The cannelloni here is the best in the North End in my opinion. The other dishes are very good as well. If you go here sit up stairs for your meal and then go downstaris for a few drinks. 
11101 4 Walked in today with a friend - we've been talking about getting tattooed together for 15 years and finally took the leap. Sarah did our tattoos and she was awesome! Will definitely go back to New Rose and to Sarah! 
11102 0 Bye-bye nasty, tiny, dirty, disgusting Safeway! They came and tore this mother down and are building a new one from the ground up. We looked at the specs for the new construction and it's going to be sweet. Can't wait until fall 2013 for the new Safeway to open. 
11103 0 This s**t hole sucks!!! Don't come here. The service sucks and for the money that they charge it's not worth it. 
11104 4 I come here all the time because ESB has such an extensive cocktail menu and yummy desserts. I've tried just about every martini (on different nights of course) and have yet to be disappointed. The bartenders are also great 
11105 4 This office (Westlake location) is the ultimate - in professionalism, efficiency and regimens tailor-made for my particular concerns. I highly recommend this location. 
11106 4 Always stop here on our way to Portland. Great Banh Mi ( we normally ordered #1). Strongly recommend this place, yum yump!!! 
11107 4 Love this place. Have been going here for years and I always come away feeling incredible. Excited for the next visit! 
11108 0 Love this pizza place but the owner (old lady) makes the whole thing unpleasant... Rude on the phone doesn't appreciate her customers... 
11109 4 Just a delight. Very relaxing and nice feel. The food and coffee is delicious. Good service too. Will definitely be back! 
11110 4 The food here is both good and consistent. And with the exception of the very first time I dined here, the service has always been excellent. It is on my list of regular places. 
11111 1 I hate so simply just pile on but what a terrible experience. You guys need to automate your systems better. 
11112 0 This place will bill you even if your food isn't delivered. BEWARE! Delivery guy was also super rude. Guy legit yelled at me after handing over the food. Just give me the food and walk away, seriously. It's the terrible attitude that motivated me to leave this bad review. 
11113 0 Rude owner named Chen, my clothes got ruined here, the place smells like dog feces, they don't like white people here either, one day Chen tried to take money out of my purse 
11114 4 Another visit to my favorite coffee house. Very casual and laid back. Great coffee and Sunday morning breakfast. A Destination Donut to go. Wish it was closer to where i live. Check it out. Life is good. 
11115 4 Joe McDonald is tops when it comes to advising and implementation of insurance necessary for ones needs, be it Auto, Life, or otherwise. For your family, jointly w/another or singularly, he has it. Knowing the ins and outs of insurance twists and turns, discounts and accurate coverage is his speciality. 
11116 4 I held my 21st birth party here, and it was awesome. My friends and I had so much fun. Everybody is really chill, and I'll definitely be going back. 
11117 3 I've use this place several times since discovering it and found the staff to be very efficient and courteous. I also like the fact that they will match the VBCE rates.! 
11118 3 Turkey Gruyere good Nice girl with tattoos served me Like Spring in Summer 
11119 4 Love this restaurants very clean friendly staff and the food is awesome. Prices are very reasonable. Couldn't ask for a better place to just hang out and drink a cup of coffee. I highly recommend this place. 
11120 4 Uyen did my nails and I absolutely loved it. Normally I drive all the way to the south end and I can't believe I live 3 minutes away from here and never gave it a try. I am definitely coming again!! Thank you Uyen !!! 
11121 3 For a theme park this was an excellent choice for high quality food and service. Our server knew the menu inside and out and explained everything. Nicely decorated and the cuisine matched the setting for the most part. Would dine here again. 
11122 3 Really enjoyed my meat lovers skillet. Decent service have felt forgotten a few times I've been but it happens. Only gripe is my soda isn't refillable after 1 refill. Well priced though 
11123 4 Great sushi and they delivered to us all the way in Woburn in the middle of a blizzard!! 
11124 4 One of my two favorite Indian restaurants on earth (the other being Rasika in DC). Unreal service, the best food ever, the hype is true -- come early, come often. 
11125 3 Excellent ramen here. Soup is flavor packed. Noodle texture good. Pork tender and just right. Only very slight letdown was that their eggs could be marinated longer, but all in all, the go to place for us in the Portland area. I recommend the miso version. 
11126 4 I was very impressed with the quality of the buffet food. You know with a buffet, it is usually hit or miss. But, wow. I was very impressed with the quality of the food and the authenticity of the place. And the cream puffs were to die for. 
11127 4 Ate a couple months ago, and they absolutely knocked it out of the park. We got a number of different plates to share and they ranged from very good to phenomenal. Look forward to going back. 
11128 4 Seamless experience. Clean facility and efficient staff. Took a little extra time, but worth the wait. Would definitely recommend to anyone. 5-stars. 
11129 4 Awesome food and love the ambiance of the place. Great place to go with friends! Love the veggie burger and mac and cheese skillet! 
11130 4 Food was great, but Jimmy the bartender was what made the whole experience worth it!! Love, love, LOVE him 
11131 1 A little pricey--my Aloha Bowl did not come with avocado, and the portion sizes are meager relative to the prices. 
11132 3 pretty good place. we come here whenever we make it to atlanta and want a high class burger 
11133 1 After talking to quite a few people around town and reading other negative posts about this store, my suspicions are validated. The staff is the rudest you will find. I wonder what the owner of the store is like? Maybe take inventory of your staff and review customer service!! 
11134 4 I have called few contractors in town, but when I called apex c&rg they gave me the best customer service and best price on a re-roof on my house here in Nw Portland. They were very prompt and professional. I would highly recommend them a+++++++ 
11135 3 Great izakaya to go to after work! The soba noodles omelet there is a must order. Sushi is great too. Sake bomb will make it better on weekends. 
11136 3 I came to try this place out and I'm a fan! Linda, our server was outsanding! My brother and I were surprised to see that the food looked just like the pictures on the menu and was really good too. Definitely coming back. 
11137 4 This is a Must do! Takes you back in time to the late 1700's when the colonists were about to cause some truble... it is worth the money, history lesson and going back in time! 
11138 4 This place is the best. Chris is a dedicated and sincere manager and I will make an effort to visit here every time Im in Portland. Keep up the good work man! 
11139 4 Best ice cream in Westerville 
11140 4 Best driving school in MA!!! Staff is super friendly and helpful!!! Flexible schedule and awesome instructors!!! 
11141 0 It may be the beer talking Judy, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They've got those big chewy pretzels here they're all blthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh $45 DOLLARS FOR A HAIRCUT!! GET OUTA HERE!!!! 
11142 3 This is where I always do my laundry... The owners are friendly, there are always washers available and I can stuff all my clothes (for a month) into one of their mega-washers to get over with painlessly... 
11143 2 Got the chicken enchiladas with ranchero sauce. Spicy good! Buy 1 get one free enchilada plates on Sunday an Monday. 
11144 4 Indy coffee/cafe.Very cozy atmosphere, Persian rugs. Great mushroom omelet! 
11145 3 Decent, basic pub food with excellent service. Can get crowded at the bar at times but the staff and patrons are friendly. 
11146 4 The pork fried rice is very good also a try the Orange chicken, boneless spare ribs, fried plantains and wings and fries they are very good. Only thing they doesn't have to many table and for lunch is busy time. 
11147 3 What a wonderful treat. Mark and Kim have opened a great tasting room in downtown Vancouver. There wines are fun and so are they. You need to check Burnt Bridge Cellars out. 
11148 4 South Congress Cafe was great for brunch. Got there early before the rush, service was friendly and attentive (plenty of coffee/water/tea refills without asking). Food was interesting on paper and very well prepared when it arrived, plus very tasty. Overall a really great neighborhood place. 
11149 4 Ice cold draft. Delicious rare tuna with broccoli and cucumber salad. And a variety of screens with basketball, soccer, rugby and more. Friendly staff. Women's basketball, not just men playing. 
11150 4 Was surprised to see Seabass on the brunch menu. It was a regular entrée type of dish and was Probably the best fish dish I've ever had. The carrot cake French toast was also outstanding. Some truly awesome food here! 
11151 4 This place never lets me down !! Everything is delicious!! Best honey BBQ steak tips!! Best calzones, excellent service!! 
11152 0 Cardboard crust Friends and I found a hair on one slice with a random collection of fuzz stuck to a slice of mozzerella on the other So gross save your time 
11153 4 Excellent crab legs! Shrimp was good too. Will definitely come back. Nice local business. 
11154 3 First thing I like about Thierry is their working hours! It's very hard in Vancouver to find a nice place for coffee and tea after 7PM. Pastries are good quality, and I love their rich hot-chacholate. 
11155 4 Really fun spot. Golf simulators are very cool, golf equipment is top of the line and service/food is great. Nice to have a unique spot to go in bar heavy DT Van. Perfect for a rainy day. 
11156 1 A couple issues as we sit here... Wrong price on menu so was charged extra. Service was rather unfriendly. Ordered cheese and fruit plate, no fruit. My wife pointed this out after we finished. She did not want another problem after the pricing issue. Good coffee and cheese. 
11157 2 Food is always good, but service is suspect. Waitress delivered a bubbletes and flicked the straw down onto the table like it was a dirty napkin. 
11158 3 Recommend and will use again. The men were fast and professional. The bonus is that they were careful moving our glass and breakables. Reasonable price. 
11159 4 The Baba Au Rhum is my favorite. The sponge cake soaked in rum is so soft and moist and practically melt in my mouth. The rum taste is very delightful with a little lemony flavor. The cake is so delicate and delicious!! 
11160 4 A hidden gem if I've ever seen one. Farm grown local produce and poultry. Fries made with amazing seasoning and bar-none service. Easily the best experience I've had. Prices are below what I would usuallu expect. 
11161 4 Great place. Excellent atmosphere, fantastic service, and the food is amazing. I have not had a bad thing yet. Our go to place for breakfast even if we have to drive out of our way to go. The Jack Daniel's omelet is really that good. 
11162 4 I lived in Thailand for a year and this is a great restaurant! They make regional dishes that are even rare IN Thailand! The food is as close to "real Thai" as it comes. Consistently good. 
11163 4 My husband and I's MOST favorite place to eat for those special dates! Most romantic atmosphere in Portland and NO ONE can make a steak like they can! 
11164 0 The chicken smelled funny and was tougher than shoe leather. I tried something new and will not be returning. 
11165 0 Went here last Friday. The staff pretends not to speak English. No one is really helpful in any way and the food is probably the worst Mexican food north of the border. Save your money and go to Taco Bell. 
11166 3 I'm a huge fan. It is close to the house and I love being able to get healthy options and not break the bank. I make sure to get my local, raw honey for my allergies, and tons of other things. 
11167 4 we sat in the garden on a warm sunny sunday, and began with a german lager and a hard cider. both were tasty. we shared the veggie burger, and it was delicious, served on possibly spelt bread. very satisfying. 
11168 3 Beef Negimaki, Grilled shrimp, Boston unCommon roll, Bluefin toro, green tea margarita.... Alll very good. As everyone else mentioned.... its pretty inside. Wait staff were a bit clumsy and confused. They didn't have lobster for their lobster rolls. On a Tuesday. That was a bummer. 
11169 2 Lamb laffa was ok. I think the wrap had too much going on and ended up muddying the flavors. 
11170 4 Best pizza I ever had! Their huge selection of "standard" menu pizzas are a summary of best combinations that we ever experienced. They do em justice. Nice beer & wine selection to compliment. Great job... we'll be back. 
11171 0 Awful service. Not friendly. The most over priced coffee in the world. Will never come back. Sorry! 
11172 3 This place has always great service and delicious food. Decent prices. The service is really quick, not like in others places. Nothing else compares! 
11173 1 My first time there was great, then my second time was terrible...then I try again and again. But your food quality is so inconsistent that I gave up. 
11174 3 Only good Chinese place been able to find so far in the area. I love the egg foo yung! 
11175 4 Little Skippers is a great place to go let your little ones run around! They have great coffee and also snacks/meals for your little ones. The owners are very nice and make sure to have lots of great toys to play with too. 
11176 3 This place was great. Stopped in here with my sister and brother in law for lunch, and we weren't disappointed. Wine selection was great- and so was everything from the appetizers to the entrees! I will definitely visit here again- a total gem! 
11177 4 Simply the best coffee in the Hollywood District. Need I say more? 
11178 2 The food is good overall, the sushi not so much but for the price of lunch it is worth eating there. 
11179 4 Great service and very good price to value. I brought two cars in last weekend and Regelio got them detailed to like new! 
11180 3 One of the great strip clubs with woman with Big Booty....You will have to find them..its big and dark enough...I LIKE IT..OTHER PEOPLE maybe wont....this was in 2013.. 
11181 4 Best meal I've had in Austin. Period. And I was skeptical about eating sushi in Texas given my Seattle-bias. Super good and over the top service. 
11182 4 Some of the best bread in the Portland metro region, great pastries and coffee, and a beautiful space. A great addition to Oregon City. 
11183 4 Excellent! They were very friendly and knowledgeable, and I was able to book an appointment on a Saturday and be in and out in less than an hour and a half. Take that Mothers! 
11184 4 The chicken strips are AMAZING! I loved everything about this place. Super friendly staff, great ambiance and amazing southern food. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Orlando. 
11185 4 I love all the empanadas they have! My wife and I are stuffing our faces as I type! Guava and Cream Cheese is our favorite! EVERYONE here is super nice too! 
11186 2 The pork and veggie pancake is still my favourite of anywhere I've been but all the rest of the dishes are similar quality to any other korean restaurant you would go to. Good if you are in the area and don't want to spend too much. 
11187 0 JULIE was nice but everybody else was no help. I paid for a rush order and didn't get a notification that it was ready until it was too late and completely pointless for me to have the shirt done. Never coming back. 
11188 4 Great! Stopped here for an afternoon snack it was so quick and lots of different choice from salads, wraps and pb&j to beer and mimosas coffee and smoothies! 
11189 3 This is a good place for a quick, cheap, and decent lunch. The fish tacos are good and the nachos are a big portion size. The fresh salsa is really good, and there's an avocado based salsa that's delicious! I've always found the staff to be friendly and courteous. 
11190 3 It's the new food trend in Vancouver. Must try!!! Hotdog is made by Kurabuto pork but they have other options like vegan. The hotdogs are juicy, toppings are great. Get the combo with fries. Oh, be careful of the birds- they like the hotdogs as well. 
11191 3 First experience at a hostel. For the price you can't beat the accommodations and location. Much cleaner than I had thought. Staff was great as well. 
11192 1 Booooo...drove back to work with my order only to find that neither sandwich MEALS had the chips that go with them...paid $21.00 for this! 
11193 3 First time at Gail Ann's today, had the best cream-filled doughnut yet. Cakey, with very light filling. Steady stream of people coming in for the half-hour I was sitting there. Just ate the jelly-filled that I got to-go, and it too was perfect. 
11194 0 My son hairline is SO crooked and jacked up, do NOT let Shafiq cut your hair at all!! 
11195 4 Authentic like a text book. So yummy! Sushi appetizer, pork spring rolls, Alisa enjoyed the spare ribs and lobster risotto, and me- coconut shrimp to die for, noooodles, and nirvana mac and cheese. Can't wait to come back! 
11196 3 This might be one of the best deals in Boston. Fixed prices on the salad bar make for an all out, how much can you fit in your container escapade. I love salad bars, so though this place is great in my book. 
11197 4 Been going to this amazing couple for the last couple of years and it's by far hands down THE BEST AUTHENTIC Jamaican spot in the city. Food is incredible. 
11198 4 Love the place. True it is big and it has many doctors. But that is a good thing because you can pretty much always see someone very quickly. 
11199 4 I have been looking for a deli like this ever since I moved to Orlando...finally found it! I got the Italian 12" and this thing is a meat monster! can't wait to go back and try the philly, they looked bomb on the grill. 
11200 0 Very expensive food, two dishes and rice ended up being about 45$. Masaman curry was cold when it arrived with a hot bowl, seemed like it was old. Would not recommend. 
11201 4 Favorite place for late night food or an after work cocktail. Great drinks and a better menu, this is where I go when I don't know what I want because they have everything. Cool place with nice people! 
11202 2 This place is packed after hours so I decided to try the food. Overall good food and everyone speaks Spanish. Cashier didn't speak English but he understood I wanted sauces. Greasy food but fast with lots of sauce options. 
11203 0 Bizarre no purse policy and hostile about using the bathroom even though we were going to buy drinks and snacks. Sort of stuff you see in rough neighborhoods but not this area. Won't be back. 
11204 4 I Love this place.... never had a bad meal here. I had the Maxx Burger tonight and it was insane... I could have eaten 3 of them. 
11205 4 Total Score!! These guys pulled one amazing ristretto! They had a couple of bean options for espresso the day I was in. I let them surprise me and I received the GUATEMALA LA ESPERANZA by Heart coffee Roasters. Absolutely Superb! 
11206 3 The really good: Shrimp Po Boy The average: Gumbo The weak: Service (just on this visit) 
11207 2 If you like Greek Style pizza, this is a good place to go. I personally am not a fan of this style, but I still found their pizza enjoyable. 2 slices and a can of soda for under $4 is hard to beat for a quick and inexpensive lunch. 
11208 0 Awful in every way. Friend actually sent back nachos. Horrible yellow awnings out front. Hope it goes away and they put something good in this location. Oh and maybe they could quit it with the blaring ACDC headbanger music also. Lord.... 
11209 4 We visited 34th Street Cafe a couple of weeks ago for the first time in years. Love the new Prix Fixe menu on Monday and Tuesday nights. $24 for a glass of wine and three courses. Excellent! We will definitely be back! 
11210 4 I am a pretty picky when it comes to Thais food! But this is the BEST thai restaurant in BC period! I have try many many thai restaurant and they always let me down. I love their pad thai and green curry! 
11211 3 juicy meat cooked in front of you great falafel. nice setting. 
11212 4 Last few times I been here, I have always enjoyed the lamb kebab. However today I decided the combination on rice and I'm blown away!!!!!! It's freakin delicious! I love it. No complaints! 
11213 4 Great family ride! Line goes quicker than it looks! Great interactive experience great for kids who scare easily as well. 
11214 3 Good burritos but dont know why the outside of the burritos are always cold to the touch, i guess thats how people have gotten to know them and like it that way but i find it odd 
11215 4 3rd meal here in a week. 2 dinners and a lunch. Everything has been great, but I especially enjoyed the fried oysters and the Ranch Water margaritas. Will definitely be back! 
11216 2 Food is generally good but the service... Took 25 min for the main course after we got out appetizer, server never refilled our water glasses (no other drinks ordered). It wasn't all that crowded either. 
11217 4 I dropped in to grab lunch to go. OMG..the BBQ Tempeh wrap was out of this world! It was fresh, huge and came with a salad that had the most amazing dressing. I purchased the Classic, fresh juice (carrot, apple, ginger) and added some lemon. Delish! 
11218 0 Overjocked, pretentious, snotty employees, stupidly pricey sandwiches, usual douchenozzle Back Bay snobbery clientele. No. 
11219 2 Exspensive for what it is, good options, decent food. 
11220 3 I don't think I give this place enough credit. Excellent pizza by the slice, fast service, friendly people. Plus, the slices are a great deal. When you're looking for a casual bite, go here! 
11221 4 Great competitive prices. Friendly staff & got my license plates in 10 min. No need to go to the dreadful rmv for hours. Call them for a quick quote. 
11222 2 The food is better than good. The lunch menu is tasty and reasonably priced. Dinner menu is silly overpriced. But what really kills this place is service. Maybe if you sit at the bar and order(?)... otherwise forget it. The wait is not worth the frustration. 
11223 4 We almost missed this place; so glad we didn't. We had paella, fish tacos and pork shoulder empandas. Roll me please. It was all so delicious! 
11224 4 Best waitress ever and regret I do not have her name. Food was amazing and the hush puppies are amazing! 
11225 4 Ridiculously delicious. Best almond croissants in the city. They sell out often and its disappointing when that happens. Expensive but it's quality...you can taste the butter. Cookies and other goods are beautiful and tasty. Be prepared to spend $$. 
11226 4 The food is always great. We had skinny margaritas and shared an order of nachos. The music is good, the restaurant is big and clean and the staff is nice and friendly. 
11227 4 I like this place. Kinda small, in the strip mall with the walmart. Plenty of parking, good service, clean bathrooms, friendly patrons. No patio, but oh well. 
11228 3 Much better donuts that Voodoo. These are so fresh and fruit forward they pop in your mouth. Simply outstanding 
11229 4 Great service and good food. My first time here. I really enjoyed it. They also serve beer and wine :) 
11230 4 My experience here is always excellent, I highly recommend to request a taco shell bowl when you order a burrito bowl, it doesn't cost extra and it adds a whole new dimension to your meal. The staff at this location are great and the portions are perfect. 
11231 4 The food here is amazing! The staff is very warm and welcoming and helpful. You can't go wrong with anything you order. Our favorite tapas were the "gambas ajillo" shrimp in garlic oil and the "ensaladilla rusa" potato salad. 
11232 4 My family (me, my wife, 2 kids) all got hiking boots. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. 
11233 2 Wait staff had little knowledge of the seafood and menu in general and as I am a die hard fisherman of our great NW it didn't settle well with me. Come for the happy hour specials and then split 
11234 0 The food is mediocre. The service is terrible. They messed up everyone's order. No one refilled our waters or brought out more bread, despite asking multiple people multiple times 
11235 4 This is one of my favorite sushi places. The quality and flavors are superb. They know what they're doing and how to deliver. Chorishis Fire is the bomb! 
11236 4 We love Joy Moves! We have taken classes for a year with Shoshana and Krystal- it is a great experience! 
11237 3 Solid Thai food. I like the curries and the cashew fried rice. It's always busy during dinner, but it's very quick service. I do think some of the dishes run a tad more expensive than other Thai places, but it's well worth it because of the consistency. 
11238 2 I used to like this place a lot, but recently they have gotten sloppy with consistency of food/flavor and service. I'm a frustrated customer - I will continue to go, but wish they would get their act together 
11239 4 Outstanding in every way. Food and service is superb and the garlic bread is heaven on earth. You won't get a bad meal here. 
11240 4 "This is the only pizza we eat - it is awesome! We usually have it delivered - which is fast! - but eating in the restaurant and trying the meatballs, Alfredo sauce...oh my!!" 
11241 4 I'm not from the area but every time I visit I make sure I come here. The country ham is really good. The staff here is amazing they make you feel really welcomed. 
11242 2 They use soy sauce to marinate their carne asada.... They use paper napkins... Nice atmosphere though. 
11243 4 Checked a tire that I was worried about and sent me on my way. Very impressed that they did not sell me something I didn't need. They were very crowded so this was especially appreciated. We will definitely go back to them to purchase tires. 
11244 4 Great location, service, and food. We had the price-fixe dinner and the staff was warm, professional and had answers for everything. One of our top 10 meals. 
11245 4 Splattered with chili and splinters of red cabbage, i feel ready for anything. Come here when you're at the beginning or end of an evening full of possibility, and let the warm tortillas fold you in a rich blanket of fluffy taco comfort. 
11246 4 My favourite New Restaurant!!!!!! We ordered a lot of food!!! The list is long but everything was seriously above what I expected. The service was remarkable! The food was remarkable!!! Will definitely go back again and again and again! 
11247 3 Great place for a haircut short waiting time always a good cut. Even when I travel Great Clips will be the place for a cut. 
11248 4 Really cool joint wit a damn good porchetta sandwich. The crackling was spot on and the salsa verde was flavorful and not too runny. Definitely better than the meat and bread in Seattle. Some things just are done better in Candada I suppose. 
11249 4 Great and unique flavors of coffee and the breakfast sandwiches are on point! Prices are good too! 
11250 3 You have to be in the mood to stand in line but that's just an opportunity to build some serious hunger that will not be disappointed by the flavours & decent portions. Everything on the menu is great. If ur really hungry end with a waffle; yummo 
11251 0 Probably the worst liquor store I've been to- both in terms of selection and service. 
11252 1 **updated after 4th visit* Very small bowl of average haleem for $15 !! Ridiculously expensive and there is no intimation about the price either. Customer service and quality are going hand in hand but in wrong direction. Will take time for my next visit. 
11253 3 Yes please! The only problem is which cupcake to choose which means I often end up eating two cupcakes. The lemon is always a good bet. Perhaps a little over-priced and too bad they're not open more often. 
11254 4 I love this quaint location in uptown Westerville. The food is always awesome, but you have to do breakfast which is always available...way before McDonald's. 
11255 4 Outstanding friendly service and very good prices. Today I went in because my oil looked low they brought the car right in and checked it out no problem found apparently vehicle wasn't level, the only place I will take my SUV. Date 5/12/15 
11256 4 Thank you so much for delivering the best customer service. Your flower arrangements are beautiful! Thank you again for working with me and delivering the freshest flowers! 
11257 1 Dive-y bar, not much for atmosphere, or quality of drinks, or accomodating staff. Probably only still in business due to proximity to Fenway. 
11258 1 Used to enjoy this place for a quick lunch, but it's absurd customers are forced to purchase water. This is the only restaurant in Austin I've been to that does not provide free water, especially because this place also sells alcohol. 
11259 3 Better than Wal-Mart! Decent store, good staff. 
11260 1 Fried. Cheap tasting. Very disappointed for the price. Sorry, Koy. 
11261 1 We had the steamed chicken which was good. The other dishes, broccoli with garlic sauce and pork lo mein, were below average. Slow service, but that maybe due to only one wires and she was busy. 
11262 4 Looking for something healthy? this is an excellent spot. Portion sizes are good. Imagine Chipotle but higher quality of food in terms of selection and types of seasonings used. They offer alot of gluten free items. 
11263 3 Good food, but a little pricey. They should offer free plain rice with entree, rather than forcing someone to buy something from "rice & noodles" section. 
11264 3 Wonderful flavors and presentation. Very comfortable and great service. And, loving the flights. 
11265 4 Seafood trio was good! Loved everything about it, especially the stuffed shrimp and butternut squash side. The complimentary bread also tasted good - served warm and topped with parmesan cheese. The view and location was just a plus! I enjoyed my dinner experience at McCormick & Schmick's. 
11266 4 This is a wonderful boutique for gifts and cards. The owner was super friendly and and has such a wonderful collection of unique and interesting merchandise. Will definitely be back for holiday shopping! 
11267 4 Food is always consistently delicious. Highly recommended. Chicken pad Thai is my favorite. Very cute and small but we love going there. Always fresh & hot. The staff is friendly and the place is very clean. A must try if you've never been. 
11268 4 Full bar post reno...great beer selection too! Cool music and a funky vibe...great dive bar and a nice change from 6th Street! BBQ joint attached for those so inclined. 
11269 3 Place is legit. With over 300 hundred reviews I don't think I can say anything useful other than give my nod. We went on a Friday night with over 10 people and the staff was very nice and accommodating. Food was on point. 
11270 4 Skip the post office, go to The International Office at UT! One stop for everything! They are fast and efficient! We applied for two passports and were done, start to finish, in less than 15 minutes. 
11271 3 I love this place for brreakfast. They play great reggae music. It is a chill yet packed environment. I only gave it 4 stars because I always have to wait. 
11272 4 Yes, the food is as good as everyone says it is. Very nice folks cooking and serving, too. We don't get out to the SW side of town very often (at least by choice) but this spot would be worth driving over to on the weekend for lunch. 
11273 2 Overall still very good. Steak was a lot fattier than it should have been and service was a little forgetful but otherwise good Cajun food and desserts. 3.5 stars. 
11274 4 The Pad Thai here is one best I have had in Portland. I recommend trying that and their salad rolls. This little local restaurant is a good place to go if you want some Thai food. Not expensive either. Small place so I wouldn't recommend going with a big group. 
11275 3 I went in today and had an amazing breakfast burrito it was something like I would make for myself very good size and awesome taste. I also had the new york cheese cake and its like no other I recommend trying this place. 
11276 3 Very good and many choices for the adults and kids. Walking everyday thru the Disney parks leaves you hungry and this is a good value! 
11277 3 Best wings in the city, sit in the bar; great TV placement. Good place to see Falcons game. 
11278 2 I went here yesterday after being turned away from a couple other nail places in Stoneham as a walk-in for a pedi. Nice people. Turned out decent. No hard sell, no anything as others have said. A bit more expensive than I had hoped but, overall a good experience. 
11279 4 Good Service and Good Prices...came in to get two tires replaced, I was assisted quick. I got a great quote for my tires....was in and out of there in less in 30 minutes.... ask for John! 
11280 3 Open!!!! Yay! 
11281 4 Annie is the Best !! So kind, so gentle and professional !! Her pedicures are fantastic and she does beautiful nails as well. I highly recommend her service !! Ask for Annie !! 
11282 4 Exceptional service, unbelievable food, wonderful, romantic atmosphere. A perfect setting and a perfect dinner made for a perfect evening!!! 
11283 0 This was suck. I tried the hotpot and the foods was disgusting Almost 20 bucks for the broth and 2bucks per sauce for each person. Around 16bucks for the beef which was just few slices. Overall: super expensive and the foods did not worth the price! 
11284 2 My egg sandwich was delicious, but the gravy was SO salty. They had a christian station on loud the whole time I was there, which was a little confusing. Cute place with nice cooks. 
11285 3 Nice astmosphere, very good Turkish waiter. Only had an entree dinner of chicken kabobs and dinner mate had the Salmon. Both dishes were very good and reasonable pricing for a downtown restaurant. 
11286 4 What could be better than fast, delicious pizza you can just walk up and order by the slice and eat while people watching on South Congress?!?! 
11287 3 GREAT menu for a large food selection. We had pollo chipotle and tacos el pastor and they were both delicious! As everyone has already mentioned, if you are a fan of margs, you MUST get the avocado margarita. It's creamy & you will love it! 
11288 4 Friday 5pm....avoiding traffic on the way home, stopped in for a beer! Pleasant atmosphere! Great drinks! Modern mexican feel! Thumbs up! 
11289 3 Wow, there are some very long reviews of this place, so I'll keep it simple. Great food, friendly upbeat atmosphere, reasonably priced - I'll be back for sure! 
11290 4 One of the best and most convenient farmer's markets around. Open every Tuesday June 1 - October 27, from 2:00 - 6:30 pm. 
11291 4 Great place for food or drink. Retro vibe with a great bartender - Amelia. She was outstanding. The drinks and her outgoing personality made the afternoon great. 
11292 3 Every time I come here it's so good. I love their burgers. The service is good. No complaints. I love their sweet potato fries with camp fire sauce. I always crave this place. The fries are bottomless! Today till whenever there are bottomless rootbeer floats as well. 
11293 3 Great service... smiles right back at that teenage boy server who asked me every five minutes if I needed anything else ;) Delicious food. Would go back any time I'm in Union Sq. again! 
11294 0 I left with a cut on my toe and my manicure started peeling off within ten minutes. I went because it was suggested by my regular salon which just lost their nails person. And several nails were filed unevenly. I won't be back. 
11295 1 Very bland noodle dishes...I got the noodles with two vegetables and a protein and nothing was seasoned 
11296 1 Lamest chinese buffet I've ever been too...seriously how can you call yourself a buffet? Better off going else where ugh 
11297 3 Cheap eats and friendly staff! This place isn't fancy, the decor is very tacky and None of the dishes match. HOWEVER ... Cheap good eats with friendly people is truly the root of a greasy spoon. $3.99 breakfast. Many things to choose from. Eggs to Chinese food. Try it out. 
11298 4 The two girls working were so sweet and told me multiple times to let them know if I didn't like my drink because they knew I was trying something new, fast and friendly service at this location!! 
11299 4 I really love this place! The meatballs and sausages and sauce are delicious! The Greek salad comes with great dressing. They do fresh cannoli which they fill right in front of you! So good! Reasonable prices as well! 
11300 2 We finally had the chance to drop in for dinner, we went with the all you can eat sushi we ordered 1 of each (2-3 limit at a time of each) food and freshness is not the best, service is slow but it was a good experience 
11301 4 Best vegan Chinese food in Portland! This is so good, even my carnivore friends/family love it too. Highly recommend the sweet and sour. 
11302 4 The Local is still amazing. Choose your own adventure. You can chill on weeknights for Karaoke, Trivia, or fun local times. Yeah, the weekend might get busy but you need to know how to order some drinks. Gooby Pls. 
11303 4 This place has bomb chicken fingers! I am one of the pickiest eaters there is and they are awesome! I order delivery pretty often and it has always arrived hot and correct! Definitely recommend you give it a try! 
11304 4 Excellent, fresh, always made to order- very kind staff and owners. Reasonable prices. Get a spring roll and some sweet and sour shrimp! 
11305 3 We've gotten takeout from Carmela's multiple times and it's been good each time. They had quite a bit of business this Friday evening and appear to be handling it. We appreciate their location and good food. 
11306 4 I'm a basic bitch so I get chicken tikka masala. It's dope, portions are large. Samosas are dope too. Can't go wrong. 
11307 4 Great place for lunch, try any of their subs! You can tell Larry's cares about their customers when you see what quality they bring to your table 
11308 3 If I'm going to be naughty and have a burger, this is the place I go. I like to add mushrooms. The dining space doesn't have a lot of personality, but I usually use the drive through anyway. 
11309 3 best pineapple fried rice and thai ice tea!! 
11310 4 The people who work here are very nice and friendly! The organization and selection and size and layout are much better than other locations. Highly suggested! 
11311 2 Tad overrated.. the Chocolate Crunch had a weird berry which I am not a fan of.. Good for folks who like flavors mixed up in the name of fusion but call me old fashioned.. Will stick to Pips donuts 
11312 0 I recently boarded my dog here. She has had diarrhea for 3 days since I picked her up. Now this will be an expensive vet trip for us. I also picked her up at 8am and I was charged for that entire day. Really not happy. 
11313 3 it's so hard to find a casual and laid back cafe in portland that has vegan options. this place is perfect. the only thing i wish is that they would have plain cream cheese instead of the flavored they offer. 
11314 3 Pretty decent. I was surprised. Kid out front working under the tent was super helpful! Get that dude some water! 
11315 2 Service, atmosphere were all very good. However make sure you have lots of beverages to accompany the meat - if you like salt - lots of salt - then you will love it. If you don't, stick to the salad bar 
11316 3 Great brick oven pizza. This is a small 10 table restaurant with great salads and lots of choices on pizza toppings. The wine is resonable and the atmosphere is cozy. Take note, they are not open on Sundays. 
11317 4 Friendly service, even let us in a little late. Spicy pork was my favorite dish on the bbq menu. Only thing i would of loved more is a option for spicier items. All in all pretty good!!! 
11318 3 I tried the ginger ice cream and thought it was delicious. The flavor was not overpowering, just slightly spicy. The ice cream is rich and creamy and had tiny flecks of chocolate. yummy! 
11319 4 Monica rocks. She does a great job. The beds are always clean and membership rates are very reasonable. 
11320 4 This place is the best. Moved 30 minutes away from it and will still always come here. Best prices and they do as good of a job as anybody else. Always work with u too. Forgot a coupon and he said it's fine he will honor it. They are great. 
11321 4 Good, honest mechanic shop. Took my minivan in for a persistent vibration problem. They checked it out throughly and confirmed that there wasn't anything wrong mechanically. Also helped troubleshoot what could be going on. Very nice and reasonably priced. Would use Universal Motors again. 
11322 1 the machines in the place work, so i mean i have to give it SOME credit. but i find this laundromat dirty, dingy and sketchy. not exactly where i want to be hanging out while my clothes wash. so many other options around, i opt for them before this place. 
11323 4 Out-of-towners that found this place thanks to Yelp. Hands down THE BEST grilled cheese sandwiches EVER! Get the truffle fries! Omg 
11324 4 Delicious oat milk lattes, great customer service, cool vibe and nice layout to enjoy your coffee! 
11325 4 Chad and his staff are super responsive, incredibly customer service oriented and they stay in touch. Glad to be working with them 
11326 3 One dude who makes great sandwiches. Really simple ingredients, combined in interesting ways to make some of the best sandwiches in the city. Relatively new place but became very popular very quickly. Rightfully so. 
11327 2 I only come for the buffet, but it's a great buffet as long as you get there closer to noon. 
11328 4 Great food and wine! Authentic and delicious. Nice patio out back. Friendly service. Definitely would recommend! 
11329 4 Love this place. I've been several times and the food is always amazing. Try the bbq chicken, pulled pork & mac and cheese. Best whiskey selection in town and the bartenders know their stuff. 
11330 4 Great unique flavors. Nothing else like it in Boston. One of my favorite spots. Indonesian rice is favorite dish. 
11331 0 At 7p, I walked in for a haircut, as the call ahead list was booked. The receptionist told me they weren't accepting any other patrons for the night. They don't close until 8p. Receptionist didn't offer anything except to try the downtown location, which closed at 9p. 
11332 3 Always friendly staff. Clean seating areas. Beautiful sunshine. What else could you ask for at an airport 
11333 4 When in Orlando, one must visit Wawa. Nowhere else can you get a sandwich this size and this good for $5. The free high-tech air machine normally found at Discount Tire is awesome! 
11334 1 Chill, laid back kind of Div-y bar. Staff is really nice. They have an upstairs outdoor patio and bar which is great for the summer time, when it is summer time here. I didn't get to eat here, so all i can say was drinks were good. Average price. 
11335 4 I guess this one will become one of my must-go-to lists in Austin every time when I am there. Really inspiring food, good service and vibe. I also follow their Instagram and looks like they are creating new food every day! 
11336 4 Wonderful little pub with a great atmosphere. I particularly enjoyed the veggie plate which included asparagus, fingerling potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and green beans - all roasted to perfection! 
11337 4 What Wellesley has been missing! Delicious coffee and pastries in the old train station. The sandwiches are yummy too. They have done a wonderful job renovating the station and bringing it back. Lots of seating. 
11338 2 It's a really cute place and the food I ate was average. I had potato leek soup. I should have tried a sandwich instead. 
11339 4 This place is great...and for 21 bucks a person...all you can eat...doesn't get any better. Just be sure to order small portions...you don't have to commit yourself to a full order of tongue if you don't want. 
11340 4 We had all the appetizers (Tappas) on the Menu and they were all delicious. The wine pairings are wonderful. Eat well, try all the cheeses, chicken, breads are great. 
11341 4 The cocktails are strong, the steak is cooked to perfection. It's great to go here during restaurant week, they have the best choices and a great price. 
11342 3 Affordable, tons of toppings, even have recipes posted up on the best fro yo flavors/toppings. Nice little joint. 
11343 3 I stopped here for a quick meal during a conference. Delicious food, quick service. Their chili salmon salad makes a great healthy lunch. 
11344 3 One of the best coffee shops to work from! Close to tufts and has a good atmosphere. 
11345 1 This place is a hit or miss. There are times when I have a good time and other times I have not. I think in the past year I have had more misses than hits. 
11346 2 Fine beer. Nothing special for Portland. Slow and and your typical PNW passive aggressive service. Seems hard to be courteous and give and shit in this town. 
11347 4 14 of us had a great meal. Not a singke person was not happy. 10 of us had a meal here fir the first time. Great! 
11348 4 The best Greek food ever! These are the type of businesses I like to support! Large portions and quality food. It won't will take a few minutes to create but totally worth it. I recommend the chicken kebab platter! 
11349 4 Totally amazing-visit shamu for a great show. There are loads of roller coasters etc not for the faint hearted. buy a combo ticket for this and bush gardens to save money 
11350 0 AWFUL!!!! Most of the employees have zero customer service. They were extremely rude and disrespectful. 
11351 0 Came by just now about 9:15 on a Wednesday. Posted hours on door state they close at 10 pm- just like Yelp: however their doors were locked and employees watched us try the door and stand there without letting us in. Guess they don't like having business? Won't be back. 
11352 4 This place is reasonably priced and Marlene always does a great job cutting my hair. Recommended! 
11353 3 So yum, I had the Brioche French toast and a hot chocolate. Both delicious and the marionberry jam was so good too. 
11354 3 These are the same folks as the South Boston Animal Hospital, meaning a second facility may be open if the first is closed. It's really convenient from the T at the Orient Heights stop. The staff is incredibly good with my Pug, especially Allan. 
11355 4 Great food. The pizza is phenomenal. Delivery is very fast. They are also inexpensive. Definitely will order from here a lot more!! So glad I saw the advertisement on their delivery van one day and decided to order from them. 
11356 3 Great place to order ahead and get something to go. The small interior isn't conducive to eating there. The outstanding Mediterranean Salad, and decent quality slices keep me coming back for to-go orders. 
11357 2 The #1 without pork blood and feet is my favourite! The dumplings are delicious as well. The spring rolls are perfectly crispy. Will def come here more often. 
11358 4 Ooooh, I love me some Costello's. Please, please, please don't ever change. One of the few original local holdouts in JP. Get a pitcher or two and a burger and fries. 
11359 4 Megabyte is by far the best pizza and Jo Jos. The atmosphere is fun and entertaining. Fun for the whole family. Best pizza I have ever had. I'm so glad to have great pizza back. 
11360 4 Amazing pizza! Hands down best in austin area. A little pricy but plenty of pizza for the price. We always have leftovers! Cause I need more for lunch the next day. Only one other pizza place close but not better is Austin pizza garden. 
11361 4 This was an amazing experience from booking the appointment to meeting Jo! She is extremely knowledgeable, talented, so kind and the result was amazing. I highly recommend Jo, she knows her stuff! Thank you Jo! 
11362 4 HOLY BISCUITS n GRAVY BATMAN !! I've officially found my Breakfast joint Top notch coffee & friendly service too I think I'll just sit here til Lunch time 
11363 4 This place is freakin awesome! The pork dumplings are made on site and you can definitely taste the difference....fresh! My entrée is the Xian noodles and I added a little chili oil for kick...sooooo tasty! All this for $12. The service is very friendly and quick too. Lovin this place! 
11364 4 Great food and service!! Try the Salsiccia pizza (extra crispy) was on point! Carlos at the bar is great! We will be back. 
11365 4 Hands down one of best nail salon in Boston. Friendliest staff and very professional. I never feel rushed when I am here and the price is reasonable. 
11366 0 We tried this for the time and did not like anything about it. The food was not good tasting and the service was really bad. Unless you really love Iranian food you will not t place. Not recommended. 
11367 3 Love Ipnosi for trendy dresses and cute tops. Fun selection and fantastic prices. I wouldn't say it tends to be the best quality clothes, but perfect for trendy items. Fun selection of jewelry and accessories too. 
11368 1 Pour manger vite à un prix raisonnable. Salade pas trop mauvaise. Sandwich ok. Frites ok. Un fast-food quoi.. 
11369 3 Great food. We had the brisket and it was excellent. The BB King all star band made it a fantastic experience. 
11370 4 It's a Supreme Master restaurant. If you know what I'm talking about you're probably interested. This one is particularly well executed. I had a flaky fish-like masterpiece with seaweed. It was absolutely amazing. Good service too! Always always always start by sharing a hot and sour soup. 
11371 4 Have not found anything I don't like here. The kobe burger, pork belly, sashimi are all great. Would be nice if the beer was on tap and not just bottles but that's a nit. 
11372 4 From someone that has serviced this place and ate here all I have to say is no worries. Manager is awesome, kitchen is the cleanest at all times. Love this place. Coming from a tech that has seen ever inch of this place that's huge. Good job. 
11373 3 Quick service & fun flavors. Great to grab a treat if you are in the area, but parking is hell. 
11374 4 This is my favorite Beauty Supply. I can always find what I need, but if you can't find it, the Staff is always there to assist you. And prices are definitely reasonable! Oh, did forget to mention there are stylists in the store too! 
11375 4 The spot great dogs and burgs all around just a little dirty spoon treasure chest 
11376 4 YUMMMMM. Super easy take out, vegetarian broth, and really large portions! What more could you want. 
11377 3 This place is really cute! It's a nice bakery with some seating available. I loved the interior with white walls and white tiles. I came here to try butter tarts since they are a Canadian favorite! They were delicious! 
11378 4 If you're in to history, this is the place. The Mather family is buried here, most famously Increase and Cotton Mather. Nice clean to feel the place with not a lot of crowds and a chance to enjoy the history. 
11379 2 Enough though this place looks like it hasn't changed since the day it opened, they do a great job. There was a stain on my dress that they were not able to get out so they discounted the cleaning. The employees were kind as well. I will us them again. 
11380 3 I don't get some of the reviews. Love this place...come here twice a year from New York. Great Clam Chowder, cod with fries, seafood caesar salad. Granville beers on tap for $6. Small family business. Take Bus 50 to Granville Island. A fan 
11381 4 Best food! Cheap, quick, local!!! Natick has a jem! You never see great places like this anymore a true classic. Everything is so high tech and cloned these days....not casey's this place is one of a kind. 
11382 1 I am sorry to say, it was a terrible experience. The masala was good but the chicken was dry (very very dry, like it was old). We ordered online but we were very unhappy. Not eating here again 
11383 4 My husband and I LOVE Casa Vallarta! The service is awesome, the food is so fresh & DELICIOUS! Best Mexican food around! A+++++++ 
11384 2 Orange leaf has a good selection of toppings and yogurt and everything is delicious but they are expensive. There is no AC either which is not fun on a hot summer day. Sometimes parking in salem can be a pain as well 
11385 3 This bar exemplifys Portland. Quriky, odd, pinballmachines. Its in an ardoable old storybook house c1930. dimly lit and with friendly bartenders, its a dive bar with an slightly jaunty tip to its hat. Lots ofof "regualrs" and a good selection of local and national beers. 
11386 3 Loved their slushy drinks! Happy hour food portions were awesome! Environment was chill. 
11387 4 Went there for Saturday brunch, Coffee was great (Stumptown i think). small wait to get a table but not to bad. Food was good and Local ingredients. Service was fast and friendly. 
11388 4 I think this campus is awesome reminds me of high school, mixed with the crazy hospital off Terminator 2 lol. Lots and lots of hot woman everywhere. 
11389 4 Where to begin? Locally owned, attentive & passionate ownership, great atmosphere, AND incredible wine! Highly recommend the Zinfandel. 
11390 3 5 stars for the donuts. The buttermilk old fashioned may be my favorite donut on earth. Knock them a star for the high prices, but do appreciate their focus on local, fresh ingredients. 
11391 4 Very positive and up beat crew. Very pleased with the service and my hair cut. Thank you so much. 
11392 4 Best reuben I've had in a while! The staff is super nice and as stated below - drink selection is outstanding. Also the dill popcorn...get the dill popcorn! 
11393 3 Very good food from a unique (for Columbus) menu. I think sweetbreads were on the menu. Beer is just ok. The imperial stout was good but three other variants were mediocre. 
11394 2 Great place, enjoyed the tasting menu, but our experience just was a little short of deserving 4 stars. 
11395 1 The service from waitresses in this place is terrible. They purposely avoid the tables of people of color (this has happened multiple times). I sat for over an hour without being served and counting. The only things that saves this place are the good music and talented bartenders. 
11396 4 Course to swing by on A Saturday night to fill the belly before a night out. I had the Waylon and Willie. By far the best grilled cheese I've ever had in my life. 19 years in the industry and this little gem blew my mind. 
11397 4 Turkish food at its best. Great ambiance in a good downtown location. Our waitress was particularly good. Food quality is great. Good attention to detail. Real plates and cutlery! We really enjoyed the dining experience. Highly recommend! 
11398 4 My fave Vietnamese resto in Richmond! Love their spring rolls, bun thit nuong and Pho noodles 
11399 4 I think this place is great for what it is. They have Trivia which is always fun. And the salmon sliders I had...man, they were delicious!!! I am seriously craving them again. 
11400 3 It was pretty delicious! Service was a bit slow, especially since we were the only ones in the restaurant,but the food was on point! 
11401 1 I was not impressed. I was pretty disgusted by the ambiance of the place, and should have left when I felt that way...but decided to give it a shot. I felt like I was inconveniencing the staff by being there. The food wasn't good. 
11402 4 I've had the pleasure of enjoying John's cooking for 11 years and plan on doing so again today. Keep up the great simple cooking you do and thanks to the Mrs for putting them together for all of us ! ! ! 
11403 3 Super cute spot with really yummy food. Easy to get a table mid week. Cute ambiance great for a date or family outing. Vaulted ceilings and a vintage touch. I recommend getting a mimosa and any one of their fabulous crepes. Parking is really the only issue. 
11404 4 one of my fave spots to watch a movie! amongst the many universal attractions. 
11405 3 Didn't want to spend a lot for new year eve party, every where charge an arm and a leg just for entry. Luckily, we found this place. We got the most for our bucks. It's clean, good music and the best staff. I definitely return here again. 
11406 4 Very professional done and on time. Brake job and shock absorbers for a reasonable price. 
11407 1 This place is understaffed. One poor woman is serving at the bar, all the tables and the patio. Management shouldn't put someone in that position. 
11408 4 Excellent Greek food, huge portions, good prices. Wouldn't know it was so nice inside just driving by but it's a really nice restaurant with great atmosphere. 
11409 4 Great coffee, fast service, friendly staff, nice ambiance. Get your caffeine fix and chill on the patio or grab a spot in the stylish seating area. 
11410 4 Best sushi in Orlando! Must haves: Upstream Roll and Sweet Potato Roll Server was a bit grumpy. 
11411 4 A hidden gem in hazel dell. Friendly staff, amazing food at an affordable price. Just a small hole in the wall. Never crowded. Seated immediately. You do leave smelling like a kitchen all day. Be prepared but well worth it. 
11412 4 Wonderful food and service! Will visit again and recommend. They open at 5 pm and get full fast. When I visited they said they also take rsvps. 
11413 3 Excellent morning stop for breakfast sandwiches and coffee right across the street from the North Church in Little Italy! 
11414 4 Great people serving soul comforting food from their breakfasts, sandwiches, soups, salads, and down to their teriyaki plates. This place is definitely a hidden gem ready to shine. 
11415 4 I with my friends come here yesterday,It's new in 88 food connection,Food is so fresh and delicious,good price,great location, must be come here again. 
11416 4 Loved this place. The decoration is very tasteful and the staff are friendly. We had mint-lemon smoothie and pear-lime-ginger drink; both very refreshing. Totally recommended. 
11417 4 A favorite when in that part of town. I was regular long ago, so I am biased in favor of the place, and even with staff that don't know me I feel at home. Beer prices are great, service is great and that's what matters 
11418 4 Very quick turnaround, excellent job. I tried cutting open a plum and the knife was so sharp that it cut through the pit while applying almost no pressure. 
11419 3 Damn good fish-n-chips shop. Also had hella good chowder and the server (I think she was the manager/owner) was VERY friendly. Would recommend this place to anybody. Nice, casual, fast service. If it's chilly outside and your stomach is empty, go here! 
11420 0 This place is a scam for people with bad or no credit. I wad sold a lemon and feel like such a sucker. Do not give them business, they will lie to you. 
11421 3 Always decently crowded, but the food comes out pretty quick. My favorites are the ravioli, roasted chicken, and the veal sandwich. 
11422 4 I can't say anything more than AMAZING PERFECT YUM YUM YUM. But I have to, because Yelp is making me. Try the miso broth. 
11423 4 Just got done eating the best sorbet I have ever had in my life at Fifty Licks. Passion fruit Sichuan Pepper with sweet corn dust on top - holy moly! All of the other flavors I sampled were also pretty darn fantastic. The space is super charming. 
11424 4 It's plain old gorgeous. Isabella had a rare collection of masterpieces that she left to we the people. The paintings are wonderufl, but the real art is the garden-- the flowers and the like. It's like being in an old children's book. I defy to feel miserable here! 
11425 4 Top-notch ambience, delicious food, and excellent service! What's the best number, and my husbands steak was huge. The guacamole was amazing. 
11426 0 Terrible....uverse TV was MUCH better. Better channels, not so many adult entertainment channels (I have preteens), and I didn't have to disconnect the Direct TV connection to access Netflix via WiFi on my smart TV. Suuuuuuucks! 
11427 0 Terrible food. Chicken dry, prime rib raw, fish dry, crab and lobster mushy. Asked for prime rib to be cooked a bit more and got a bowl of meat that looked like it was microwaved to death. Expensive. 
11428 4 My boyfriend and I love this place. The food is amazing! We always get the perfect breakfast with chicken fried steak and one person can't eat the entire breakfast. ..I recommend sharing. Best breakfast place in town. 
11429 4 I came across this place by pure coincidence on my way to the airport during a snow storm. Yikes! Love the food, portions and most the price. Staff was friendly and gave me a little background of the whole menu. Definitely will come back. 
11430 4 Very consistent in quality and service! It's enjoyable to go out with loved one into this kind of establishment. Pricey, but that's what make an experience memorable. 
11431 2 It is okay...I got the jasmine milk tea and asked for less sugar and less ice. I got a watered down no sugar drink. It is also cash only. For almost $4 a cup, the portions are quite small as well. 
11432 1 First time at a hooters restaurant. Customer service was good. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. The food on the other hand wasn't as good as I thought it would be. 
11433 3 Really good burgers. Really good service. A little pricey for what you get. 
11434 4 Had their cake batter ice cream for the first time tonight while watching fireworks from the bridge. Pretty damn tastey, nice portions and not too crazy expensive. Will definitely go there again. Very nice place. Employees were cool too. 
11435 4 These fresh salads and quinoa (or rice) bowls are delicious and they deliver to certain buildings. If you work downtown and your healthy options have grown exhausted, this is just the place for you. These are great for client lunches too! I hope they expand their menu soon. 
11436 2 Their pizza is just okay. But the slices are large, and after a night drinking next door at Wally's, you'll think it is the best in the Boston. 
11437 3 Don't ask for extra spicy! I can handle the heat however extra spicy was top-of-mouth scalding spice. Stick to their "mild, medium, hot" and you should be okay. Have had lots of things from here, great taste and family run. Would recommend. 
11438 3 Great ambiance and for the first time being here the food really hit the spot. Nice place, but there can be a wait, of course that's a good thing. 
11439 4 Always FABUoUS! Great atmosphere! Amazing food! This is a go to place when we want comfort food 
11440 3 Delicious food and reasonably priced considering how pricey it is to dine in Vancouver. Gets crowded at lunch but really good food and lots of veg options for those of us who don't eat meat. 
11441 4 This is my new go-to Thai place. Not only is the food delicious, no matter what I order, they are SO NICE! We've had excellent meals whether at the restaurant or take home! YUM!! 
11442 2 This is a typical Japanese steakhouse with nothing separating it from the pack. If you absolutely love Japanese steakhouses, this is your place. If you are craving true Japanese food or sushi, find another restaurant. 
11443 0 They are rude, expensive, and not really organic because i was personally told by the owner that they spray and it was dangerous to eat them too soon after, even though people were doing so. 
11444 4 This place is fantastic. Came is super late and they served food and drinks. Everything was amazing, highly recommend. 
11445 3 Took my bf on a date and we had an amazing time :) the environment was perfect! Burgers were amazing, fries delicious. Soco sweet tea I believe, is a must have summer drink! 
11446 4 Best margarita in austin! Pick your tequila and then order it original. Just your favorite tequila, triple sec and fresh squeezed lime. Perfection. Thank me later. 
11447 4 Authentic German cuisine, in a kitschy (but fun!) setting. The pretzel appetizer with cheese is EVERYTHING! 
11448 2 Tried Stella now for brunch, dinner, and late night. Late night proved the winner with reliable cocktails and a funky vibe perfect for a nothing crazy night out. Stella is a restaurant with fun background music and a casually elegant flair. 
11449 3 Good sushi with a fun experience. The food was good, the service was good and there were a lot of options to pick. The conveyor belt of sushi was a nice touch but the sushi wasn't anything special. Just a good generic sushi place. 
11450 3 They have what I need (braiding hair) - even though they don't have much. They also have a wonderful selection of cost effective nail polish by the front. They don't take cards for purchases under $5. 
11451 4 The owner is super nice, food is always very consistent and fresh. The prices are very reasonable and they always get my order correct. A must go to restaurant in SE. 
11452 4 Always friendly and delicious. I have never had a bad experience. The green sauce is worth a visit by itself. Good size, good flavor, great value! 
11453 4 Best place in Boston for Mexican food. Friendly people, amazing service, delivers till 100am. Marias is the place to go. Anna's is good but Marias is so much better 
11454 3 A regular stop to satisfy my sweet tooth. I love the flavors and wide selections of toppings. 
11455 3 Had a great menu, lots to choose from. Food was excellent. Highly recommend. Small dining area, but quaint, fast service. 
11456 2 The chicken was pretty good. I overheard a waiter saying that he didn't know how the chicken was prepared and the restaurant only cooked it. A little sketchy as far as chicken places are concerned. Also, my waitress was very stubborn about providing too much water. Little less water please. 
11457 4 They are the best dry cleaner around the area in their employees are very polite and nice in also have good customer service I did not have my 20% off coupon but Ashley applied the 20% off I was very happy I recommend customers to give them a try 
11458 1 Over priced mediocre food. Poor slow service. This is my third and last visit to this restaurant. The food was cold. One undercooked. Total rip off. 
11459 4 Very huge portion of rice. Like 3 days worth. It was crazy. Very delicious. Will go back a million times lol, egg drop soup was so good 
11460 4 Customer service and the Dr. took the time to explain my eye exam results. Staff was courteous and outgoing. 
11461 1 You couldn't ask for a better location & view. The hotel however needs stripped to the studs if not bulldozed completely. This is the first hotel I've checked into & out of within 15 minutes. 
11462 4 Like the concept Reasonable prices Good food Great environment Good customer services Clean 
11463 4 Wow. After a 5 mile morning run, nothing hits the spot like Veracruz breakfast tacos! The Reyna has egg whites and tons of grilled veggies. Just what I was craving. And the salsa is the best in town! Don't miss as this spot! 
11464 2 The assistant GM called to help me figure out the credit card situation - he was much more helpful than the first person I talked to. I appreciate the time he took and his desire to make it right. 
11465 4 Very happy with my experience here! After calling nearly 5 different business searching for a rug cleaning, I came upon Yayla. Quick turnaround, reasonable price, and my rug looks fantastic!! Definitely recommend. 
11466 3 We hit up House of Dosas on the way home from work after seeing it packed every Monday ($5.99 special). Never had one before but it was awesome, fun to eat and left you at just the right amount of "full". Will definitely go back. 
11467 3 Fun. Fun. Fun. Order the magarita of your choice or your corona with lime and enjoy. Another place great to start a night, but you may find yourself not bothering to head elsewhere. Maybe they put something in the magaritas? Oh yeah, tequila. 
11468 3 Great, fast, friendly service and an awesome burger. Just took off one star because of the price. 
11469 4 Great communication, service and pricing. They treat your car as if it was one of theirs. Prompt and courteous service. Highly recommended. 5 STARS! 
11470 3 Owners responded to my review and apologized. I advised them to try harder to keep from running out of things. Their response is a good sign. 
11471 4 Love love loved this store! Tons of kitchen gadgets and cute houseware goodies. They also have local salsa and sauces. Definitely stop in if you're in downtown Austin! 
11472 4 Highly recommend Smarter Homes Austin. They were very responsive to my request via help to set up my home wifi network. Peter, the owner did the install himself and it took less than an hour! I highly recommend contacting Smarter Homes Austin for any technology project, larger or small. 
11473 4 A group of 12 of us came in for brunch and it was a great experience. Our server Jeff was super attentive and we had amazing service. The food was just as great. Everything came out perfect and tasted delicious. Highly recommended! 
11474 4 I haven't actually been inside, I've only ordered but my food is always fresh and on time (usually early), and the presentation is lovely. I've only had positive experiences with the quality of their sushi and other dishes. 
11475 4 Love this place! They do not take appointments, only walk-ins, so be aware that depending on the day and time they may be busy. That being said, they are very efficient. I've been going here over 3 years. I see America, and she is great. 
11476 4 Amazing outdoor bbq!!! Ordered the pulled pork sandwich with baked beans and potato salad. Fast and quick service. 
11477 4 So far, so good. The facility is clean, very secure and a great staff. My daughter likes it there. She comes home happy and in a great mood. I like how I'm provided with a daily report card and have open lines off communication with the staff. 
11478 1 The most terrified I've ever been that a crazy person was actually going to cause real bodily harm was on the #1 bus. 
11479 4 Great place for a healthy lunch or dinner. Quick and friendly staff makes it a good staple to the neighborhood. 
11480 0 Terrible ...incredible view ...terrible staff...terrible food. Don't do it unless you are drunk and have no other place to go. 
11481 3 Beef pad see yew and Crispy pad thai (when it's not overly sweet) are my favorite! 
11482 0 Terrible. Did not install the check valve on my sump pump, and laid the drain pipe on an uphill slant. Bunch of idiots working for this company. 
11483 4 Metrorock is a great place to learn how to climb with a great facility! Our instructor Tatiana "Tots" was very knowledgeable and helpful. She made the experience memorable and taught us the ins and outs of rock climbing. They have everything you need there with the routes ever changing. 
11484 4 Great facility with excellent resources; can't speak to parking or the rates, but the staff lot was just fine. 
11485 4 Great burritos and great attention! We had steak burritos, the mear was delicious! We were coming escaping from hurricane, and they gave us 25% off! That is a great treat! 
11486 4 They have amazing unique flavors. I fell in love with their honey and fig ice cream. It's refreshing, creamy, and beautiful. I get it every time I'm there 
11487 4 To be honest, I've only ever had the Pho and that's probably all I'll ever have. It's the perfect meal when I'm on the mend, and it's amazing every time. 
11488 3 Great views of Austin but not much of a hike, basically just walking up a few flights of stairs. 
11489 3 King of Austin dive bars. Speaking as a musician, the venue's vibe is top notch. Rough that you've gotta bring your own crowd (it certainly isn't a late-night hotspot), but you also get to bring your own liquor. I dig it. 
11490 2 Large selection of sandwiches and salads. Decent food, but not as good as it reads. The main reason to go is the outdoor seating on Boylston. 
11491 4 Different and delicious. Love my Yumm bowl with chicken and extra avocado. I even buy the Yumm sauce, so that I can make up my own Yumm bowls at home. Fast prep, 3 great locations downtown. 
11492 4 One of the best breakfast places in all of Atlanta! They serve free coffee while you wait and it never takes long to get in. 
11493 4 They've been opened for a couple of months, I'm glad they opened because it's so good! They do the croissants on the spot so when you get them, they are warm and delicious! 
11494 3 One of the best Starbucks I've been too. Only downfall would be high customer volume. 
11495 4 Awesome service and clean rooms!! The place is like a maze though. It's huge!! But no complaints 
11496 2 Nice latin Ambience. Corner-of-the-room singer dude and other patrons were loud as hell. Service all kinds of slow. Mofongo is basically offspring of mashed potatoes and unripe bananas. Pretty good. Chimichurri with the steak lacked tang. It's alright. Probably won't take the wife there again. 
11497 4 Donuts here were really really good. Like amazingly good. The coffee, not so much, but who cares because DONUTS! 
11498 3 Great place for German food. It's a must go to place every time I'm in Columbus. The sausage goes great with beer! 
11499 1 Came last week for dinner and was extremely disappointed. The food was nowhere near good and the service was even worse. Too many other great options at this price point to visit in Orlando instead of Taverna Opa. 
11500 4 I came during a very quiet time and my friend and I were the only ones here. The salon is pretty roomy and very clean and nice. The services were great and they really take their time. All in all, a good experience. 
11501 0 Wanted to come here because of the outdoor seating listing. Been beautiful warm and sunny, and perfect for outdoor eating. However, the patio is only open "May-Sept". for shame...the dichotomy of what Portland says and what it actually is. 
11502 0 The order was wrong. They tried to substitute a cheaper item without telling us or refunding. 
11503 4 I had this company install my hardwood floors and they look great! The estimator was punctual and gave a great estimate. When all was said and done we came in under budget, so pleased! 
11504 3 Very nice place with good value. Menu offers good choices, attentive wait service and decent ambiance. I save my five stars for the truly extraordinary, but this place provides an excellent family atmosphere with reasonable prices and a well presented meal. We enjoyed ourselves. 
11505 4 This is a gem for Wakefield. We went for lunch and went with the recommended street tacos and tortilla soup. Both were delicious! The atmosphere is nice and service friendly. I really recommend the tacos! Prices are reasonable (lunch entrees $7.5-10). 
11506 2 Not the best chipotle. Something about this place seems very minimalist and not in a fun cool art way. It's ok. 
11507 1 Great until the end.... Waiting like 20 mins for our check! By the time it arrived Christ had risen... Or was that the bun dough??? 
11508 2 Just ok. Tables too close, too loud music, service was ehhh, too aggressive when getting settled, then long wait for food, which was adequate. Nothing special. 
11509 4 Great food, Uber eat deliver to my home. The food is well packaged, and is really good! 
11510 4 Delicious. The croquetas and Migas were my favorites. They accommodated my party of 7 on a Tuesday night wonderfully. Great ambience. 
11511 4 Very well plated food. Yummy Mango chicken!!! Service was remarkable attention to all of the small details which really adds up. 
11512 4 Best flower shop in the area (Harvard Square/Inman) with a wonderful selection and delightful staff. Beautiful packaging, pleasant buying experience. Highly recommended. 
11513 3 It's all about the Avocado Margarita here. Sounds like an odd combo, but the creaminess adds so much and puts this off the charts. The food was fine, but the real star is the drink! 
11514 4 Had the fish sandwich and fish tacos. They were excellent. Hand made. The staff was friendly and personable. Will certainly be back. 
11515 4 New Town Bakery has the best chicken deluxe buns. The buns are huge and freshly steamed. I always order at least a dozen when I am there. 
11516 3 My wife and daughters love this place as much as I do. Boneless wings are our favorite, but so is the honey BBQ chicken salad. It is very noisy so you can't have team meetings here. It is a favorite place to go and watch your favorite games. 
11517 4 The them this year is stranger things. They did an awesome job this year and I was extremely pleased. I didn't get the fast pass but I managed to get to more than 3 haunted houses and was able to go on all of the rides. 
11518 4 Fresh food great tacos de carne asada and guacamole!!! Good Food... And everything was delicious. 
11519 4 First time here & absolutely love our server Samantha. She was awesome and honest with us. Food was delicious. Kudos to the chef he accommodated my request of change of cheese on my salad. 
11520 4 Amazing amazing amazing. I've lived in and out of Austin for twenty years, and these may be the best tacos I've had yet - and the salsa is just as good. Go visit. 
11521 3 Really good ramen. Solid inhouse noodles and great and flavorful broth. The add ones are great. I normally don't eat ramens or Pho until winter but this is the exception. 
11522 4 Some of the best thin crust pizza around! Good lunch special - $6.50 for personal pizza and a drink. Employees are always friendly. Love the mints too. 
11523 3 Everything was cooked to hell and back but the place was so much fun I didn't care. This may become a yearly destination in conjunction with attending the Florida Tow Show. 
11524 0 They left my lights on draining my car battery which i did not notice until much later, also they drove away with my car without showing proper ID, meaning anyone could pretend to be a saftey inspector and drive away with your car and steal it! 
11525 4 I ordered take out. The food was fantastic!! I ordered the filet and fried rice. I would recommend this restaurant to all! 
11526 3 Breakfast is there forte. Get the pancakes. They taste like cake. They have a bear to take pictures with. Good clean family fun. 
11527 4 Goodfellas is really a gem and it's actually gotten better. Now with an improved bar, wine select and menu it's the best Italian restaurant within a 5-7 mile radius. The eggplant is to die for. Highly recommended from a world traveler. 
11528 4 This company is wonderful!!! I have used them on 3 houses and many windows. I will not go anywhere else. They are quick efficient and less expensive than other places.Oh and their products are beautiful! And they file the paperwork for energy rebate for you!! Great job!! 
11529 2 Didn't meet the hype for me either. Salsa is a standard measure for me on Mexican and it just wasn't that great. Overpriced to top it off. Service was ok but just not worth it. 
11530 4 Good food, fast delivery, and bang for your buck. They already give you a ton of chicken with Pad Thai--which is a bargain considering how good it is--as it is, but if you order extra chicken ($2.00) you pretty much get a piece of chicken with every bite. 
11531 4 This place was everything that we were looking for. The meat man came around frequently but was not hounding you, (the skewers were great). They also have good prices for beers and karaoke. If you plan on singing, get your request in early. Highly recommend! 
11532 3 This was a cool club. My friend knew security and we were able to skip the long line outside. The sections inside are nice. The dance floor was packed, the music was good, and the people were nice. We stayed until they closed. 
11533 4 Not sure why they have such bad reviews. Called in a panic to get to the airport. Guy was there in 3 minutes and was super friendly. 
11534 4 Excellent food and service. I came for lunch on a Friday and it wasn't too crowded. I had the Mahi Mahi sandwich and it was delicious! The staff was attentive and friendly. Would definitely come back. 
11535 4 The food was delicious and the service was excellent. I had the grilled chicken panini and it was so flavorful. The sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly!!! I will definitely return. The atmosphere is really nice, it would be a great date spot. 
11536 3 Still one of best places to eat for lunch. Food is great, service is decent and the price is reasonable. Pad Won Sen is good to try. 
11537 1 We had breakfast and it was pretty mediocre. I had the Chipotle polenta eggs benedict and my husband had the huevos rancheros. Both were lacking flavor and nothing special. Positives- coffee was strong and service was good. 
11538 1 If you're looking for a light breakfast- skip this place and go to Corner Bakery. Jamba's muffin was dry- almost inedible. It was a complete waste of money. 
11539 4 What a difference to what this place used to be. Wish I had more stars to give. The trouffled steak frit, tuna, octopus and the lamb/sweet potato empanadas were great and the service even better. Great early dinner choice before most are even open :) 
11540 2 Decent calzones. Not the best ever but if you're craving one it's not too bad. Also got delivery via the Yelp app and provided instructions which either weren't read or didn't get relayed to the driver. A little annoying but ultimately he found us. So that's a plus! 
11541 4 Great studio. Loved the class, insensity of the workout, and heat + music level. I also appreciated the instructor's (Mikel) energy. I'm originally from D.C. so I got back and signed up for the city center location. Have gone five days in a row. Thanks for a killer workout. 
11542 3 Very Good donuts, not the best, but very good! The best part is their $10 bucket of the day old ones. 
11543 4 Fantastic food, festive atmosphere. I had the three enchilada dinner and my wife had the taco salad. Both were well sized portions and came out quickly. The bar is well appointed, and they have all my favorite Mexican beers. 
11544 2 I'm not a fan of walking through cemeteries but this one was interesting. There's a lot of benches to rest on and the landscape is pretty. A lot of people seem to walk their dog around there. Probably the most prettiest cemetery I ever been to (so weird to say). 
11545 4 Super nice boss and lovely store Got a glasses for my husband here and also purchased contact lens here for myself The boss is super nice and she give us a good discount. Would definitely continue to shop here. 
11546 0 Heard that this is a very popular place in Boston. Went there on a Friday night. The bouncers were rude and racist. Not a ideal place to get inot the weekend mood. With so many places around, would recommend going to the other places around 
11547 3 Their pizza is sooooooooooo good and in my opinion their cannolis are better than Mike's Pastry. So if you don't want to wait hours in line for Mike's cannolis, please do not hesitate to stop by this little gem, it is well worth it! 
11548 4 The sweet potato enchiladas are fantastic and they have good vegan selection. Great outdoor patio too 
11549 3 Best happy hour in town. Best gluten free crust wood fired pizzas I've ever had. Located in north boulder. 
11550 4 Love Tiny Tails To You - have used them for kid's birthday parties and office parties (great morale booster). Their staff is professional and their animals are adorable. They clearly genuinely care for the animals (always know their stories, likes, dislikes). Love them and will hire them again! 
11551 4 We had an appointment with Jessica today and she was great! Very happy with the results. 
11552 3 Very friendly and efficient service with very tasty food and a bonus there is a lady who will make cute balloon animals for the little ones here (tip her kindly). We really enjoyed it and we came back more than once. Best Denny's ever! 
11553 3 Delicious! The Quinoa salad was good, would have been a bit better with a bit more pine nuts. And the linguine and swordfish were outstanding! 
11554 4 Great food and great service! I love that they had a vegetarian option that wasn't just beans and rice. Definitely will be going back! 
11555 2 Great location downtown and an awesome little refurbished warehouse feel to the bar out back. I just wish they'd had a more expansive selection for their happy hour beers. Pretty limited. The beers I had were pretty good, though. 
11556 1 We ordered this place all the time and it was decent until our roommate and I both had stomach problems after eating the chicken 
11557 0 This place is way Over Priced! $77 for an oil change and Tire rotation. I was going out of town and needed the services, won't be going here next time. 
11558 3 Not too many Chinese food restaurants near my house. This one is the better of the two. I always get the chicken and broccoli. It's been a hit 2/3 times. Flavorful. Yum 
11559 3 Friendly staff. Opens late and I think they have the best froyo compared to Qoola & Menchies. I got the chai latte without the almond slices and it tastes really good. Not much chai flavour though. 
11560 3 Would be 5 stars if they had free wifi. Great coffee, great tea, great food, great atmosphere and service. They're a little expensive, but definitely deliver on what you pay for. 
11561 4 I cannot express how good their tamales are, haven't had anything that tasty in a while! Loved them, thanks!! 
11562 4 The food is amazing! The owner is so fun and a genuine host. Such a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. I highly recommend this experience. 
11563 4 Very courteous staff. The bartender very patiently and politely helped me sample the huge variety of beers that they had on tap. The outside seating was very pleasant during the summers. Whenever I went in alone, the bartenders kept me engaged with nice conversations. 
11564 4 Excellent customer service from beginning to end of our project. The prices are extremely competitive and the quality of the material and work of installing our quartz countertops- hands down gave us an overall awesome experience! I would recommend them to everyone looking for quality with excellent pricing! 
11565 4 Probably one of my favorite places I went to while visiting Austin! They made the pizza cone right there - fresh, great texture and super tasty! The Samoan pizza cone is a must have! 
11566 4 Snooze is amazing in Denver and they have delivered the same experience to Austin. JUST EAT THERE. 
11567 3 The people were very nice and helpful. The service was good. I recommend them for the price. It was clean and the staff made you feel welcome. 
11568 3 Who doesn't like a big beer selection. Over priced? Maybe Over Kill? Yes Over It? Nahhh.. It is what it is, lots of beer and decent pub food. 
11569 4 Great burger combinations, queso served with fries and some of the best milkshakes around! 
11570 4 I was traveling in the area. Saw it. Went in and OMG. Amazing...must go!! Nice staff. The Calabrese pizza was awesome. Can't wait to go again tomorrow. Congrats 
11571 3 Good lunch spot. Have good salads such as grilled chicken, steak tips, etc. The new pizza is MUCH better than the old greek pan pizza. Crispy thin crust. 
11572 4 Very good and healthy based on what you order, of course. Very efficient with delivery and arrived before expected. Steam broccoli and steak broccoli are the best. Wings were delish as well. seafood fried rice was good but not liking the imitation crab but still good Good stuff 
11573 2 Suggestion to management: to alleviate "hogging" of tables during profitable lunch and dinner rush, which keeps steadily paying customers out, and you're providing free wi-fi, eliminate the wi-fi from 11:30 - 1:30 p.m. and 5:30 - 7:00 p.m. 
11574 3 Best place to hear EDM/House Music in Austin. One of the best club speaker systems I have ever heard in my life. Inside is actually smaller then you would think but its done well. If you're into House Music, then it's a must. 
11575 4 I was very impressed tonight by the food, atmosphere, and service. The cocktails were excellent, and the brisket tacos and chicken mole were succulent and flavorful. Highly recommended! 
11576 3 This place did a great job cutting my little dog came out just the way I wanted. Will be back when I'm around in town with the little one thanks Charles and the Blonde hair female groomer sorry didn't get her name 
11577 4 Paul at town fair couldn't have been more helpful ... needed a new tire at 5:30 in the afternoon. Was all done and out in less than an hour. My job requires travel ... am letting all my coworkers know that this is the place to go 
11578 1 Five guys is a better burger joint. The fries were not good the Lockhart burger was not good either. The onions on the burger tasted like an onion with oil. The bun was the best part of the meal and that is not saying much. 
11579 4 Tasty food and great value for money. We've had the soup, the house salad and two pastas--all was delicious. Friendly service, too. 
11580 4 I love love love The Melting Pot!!!! I come at least 2x per year! My recent trip was not as good...they took away the fiesta cheese :-( best cheese ever!! I'm hoping they bring it back! 
11581 1 Posted star rating is inaccurate. Service was exceedingly slow on a Sunday evening due to understaffing. Our server was the only one. Tea is superb. Food is unremarkable. Stir-fried broccoli had a sour tinge to it and thus remained uneaten. Noodles taste like Americanized fast-food Chinese dishes. 
11582 4 I was told by many places that I couldn't get the smoke smell out of my car. I have a honda civic (with cloth seats) and Dr. Detail got the smell out and cleaned my car meticulously! I was so happy with the service. Highly recommended and worth every penny. 
11583 4 Wow what a great experience best nails ever have already made my next appointment thanks Christina, awesome job,awesome salon,awesome people that work there. Thanks 
11584 4 Best Thai food in town. Food tastes authentic and delicious. Great customer service as well. 
11585 4 These guys run a tight ship, it was fun watching how efficient they were and loved the personal escort given to my car when it was time to leave. Shout out to the service tech Corban Fletcher and the kid in the pit named Caleb. 
11586 3 The world would be a better place with more Live Oak Markets. Killer craft beer and local snack selection. I got a turkey reuben and a grilled cheese. I'll be back for some scratch breakfast tacos. 
11587 3 Eating healthy I had the turkey burger it was great. No fries and water w lemon. #JackLimeTeam had a great time. #Anchorman2 
11588 0 I ordered dinner here last Tuesday and I'm still waiting on it. Horrible service and the kitchen staff cook at the same pace as senior citizens having sex...not fast. 
11589 4 My husband and I went there for dinner before we went to the ballet on 12/12/15 and it was awesome. The food, especially the lamb lollipops, and the wine flights were wonderful. Anthony, our server was so great and very knowledgeable about the wines. We will definitely go back! 
11590 0 Great Store.......BUT, if you don't shop there for 6 months, all your loyalty points get nuked....a pretty RAW deal. For an added bonus...no empathy whatsoever from the management there.....I'll stick with Liquor Mart.... 
11591 4 I had so much fun on this ride. You will get wet, probably soaked is their modo and you will. A friendly tour capped it off and made it a great time. 
11592 2 They finally brought back some of the old menu along with the creamy balsamic dressing. Yay! 
11593 4 Amazing ! Best vegan Caesar salad! I had a sandwich called BLShiiiiT. The price was reasonable and my boyfriend ,who is not vegan, loved the food. I came back the next day for more food. 
11594 4 This was my first time here and the food was very good. The small portion is a bit to small but probably enough for anyone who wants to fit in a desert or alchoholic beverage. 
11595 2 I would give this 3.5 stars if I could, better than average, but the hot and sour soup was corn starch heavy (and overly thick as a result). But otherwise excellent meal, good service, and a wide variety of atypical items on the menu (tea smoked duck, jellyfish, etc). 
11596 4 Favorite brow place in the city. Don't not be confused if you don't see a sign in Amsterdam Walk, go into the Beya Studios and they are the first room on the right. 
11597 4 This place is fantastic, Traditional and new age Japanese food in tapas style where you can try everything. Also very friendly staff. 
11598 4 just returned to this area again and returned to my favorite Italian restaurant. Enjoyed the super stromboli and it was still one of the best anywhere. LOOK FORWARD TO RETURNING OFTEN as we will be in the area for the next five months. BOB AND ELLEN CHAISSON 
11599 4 My favorite breakfast taco south of the river. Family run and always great food. 
11600 3 great authentic chinese food! lomein was bomb!! def will try this place again next time i'm in town 
11601 0 Horrible service every time. But its the closest and not as packed as the others. Orders take long and are usually always wrong for some reason. 
11602 3 Great food and atmosphere. My mother and I enjoyed our food and drinks and highly recommend it. A lot of food so if you are thinking of sharing do so! 
11603 3 Brown rice only, which is not as bad as it sounds. It's soft and tasty and you can't tell the difference. Prices are not great anymore. But their quality is good. So it's still a decent value. Do not go in a big group, max seating is like 18 people. 
11604 3 Pizzas not too shabby, plus you can get any 2 slices (they're huge) + a drink for $6.75... Enough to split with a person. Cheap but good... And pizza by the slice is usually that price for 1.. Waaabaaam 
11605 4 Jeongsub helped me by building the desks in my office- it was a major help to my day. He was efficient and skilled and I will probably call again to book him soon! 
11606 4 Superb! Took the family the Friday after Thanksgiving. Service was impeccable. Food was superb. Restaurant was beautiful. Won't go on too long because the other reviews say it all. Just adding my humble opinion on this wonderful establishment. 
11607 4 The wings were fantastic and the service was great! 
11608 3 They really give you your money's worth for the drinks. The plates are very small portions,even for a fancy place. Ambiance was nice, my husband loved the salmon. 
11609 1 1st half - the service has been forgettable. The mac and cheese has mayonnaise in it and the sangria had sprite. They can do better 
11610 0 If you are into bland over priced taqueria food then check it out. The quality has dropped off of a cliff. Never again. Check out Burrito Azteca instead. Sorry Cha Cha Cha. Bye, Bye. 
11611 4 Fantastic! I had been trying to get my leaking tire fixed all week and every place I went had a HUGE wait. This location was quick, nice and didn't charge me anything to patch up my tire. 
11612 4 Joe, the owner is nice! It's worth spending your money for his business. The food is delicious. Definitely a spot to eat if you miss Chicago. 
11613 4 One of my favorite ramen in Boston. I've been coming here for 3 year. Its ramen soup is so dense and full of chicken flavor！I come twice a week! 
11614 4 Top rated and very deserved. Cheapest Walmart tire for my car was $107. They took care of me for $43 and it was super fast. Sure, it was a used tire in great condition, but I don't need another 50,000 miles cuz my car won't last that long. 
11615 3 I ate lunch here today with the family. Really cool location with a great atmosphere. Lots of tv's and the dining tables were also converted into foosball tables. Service was very attentive and pleasant. Food was solid! 
11616 3 Very professional staff. Everyone was customer oriented and their waxing practices were very clean, hygienic. Miriam was a real pro. She made me feel comfortable and she did a good job. 
11617 4 Can there be more stars!?! Beer is one of the finer things in life like porn and recliners... This place is definitely in a similar category. Thanks for all the great beer and and good times. There is a reason why I moved three blocks away. NDUBS!! 
11618 0 My time at AMLI South Shore has been so ridiculous that I was compelled enough to start a blog about it so that hopefully others don't end up stuck here like I have been. You can read it here. www.lifeatamlisouthshore.tumblr.com 
11619 0 This place has the dubious honor of making me throw up every time I have consumed their food in late night desparation. I think they use ipecac in their soy sauce. Even Red House is probably better. 
11620 3 It tends to have lineups around 5:45 through 7:15. Still worth the wait, and they do serve Strongbow cider which is also awesome. 
11621 4 Awesome food and service! Friendly welcoming atmosphere, healthy very fresh food. I dont know what else to say except im really please and suprused how good this place is. 
11622 3 Great service, intimate setting, good food, and large portions. Though there are other places that are closer, this one is definitely worth the trip. Nothing too fancy, but sometimes less is more. C is for (fortune) cookie and this one is for me. 
11623 2 The crab cakes were very good. Ahi ok. Wings over cooked. Salmon very good. Creme brûlée very good. Coffee room temperature. Mixed drinks were not great. Service was pretty good. 
11624 4 I love this place and highly recommend. In a great location next to Hollywood Theatre. Excellent food and menu and the prices are very reasonable. We need restaurant s like this in our neighborhood..., thanks 
11625 4 Awesome all around. Come on Wednesdays for pho night. Haven't had anything I didn't like here. 
11626 4 Hidden gem of Little Five Points!!! Great food, service and fair prices. Highly recommend! 
11627 3 Very surprised, the food was excellent and the staff very polite. Be sure to come again with friends. 
11628 4 Found on yelp and had outstanding food and outstanding service. Building has very unique decor inside and is not very big. The waitstaff was extremely knowledgeable and the food and beer selection were diverse. 
11629 3 What's not to love about this little shop? It's incredibly convenient, the owner is one of the friendliest people you'll ever meet, and you cannot beat the lunch special. Charming, tasty, convenient, affordable-- dig it. 
11630 3 My wife and I had the business lunch special which was 6.49 with a drink. This included three different meats, rice, salad, pita and a drink. Great food, generous portions, good value. 
11631 4 I've been here twice now and I can't say better things about this shop. The owners are absolutely amazing and super accommodating no matter what! If you're looking for a new mechanic in the Boston area, THIS is the place to go. 
11632 4 I had a really good experience here. The masseuse was experienced, attentive, and made me feel comfortable. 
11633 1 Went to the carts about 7 last night. I ordered a bubble tea taro flavor. The lady used about a gallon of high fructose syrup, rotting half and half, and the drink tastes like the back side of an old washing machine 5 bucks to get a tummy ache. 
11634 4 Amazing food- creative and flavorful and delicious!! So good. The staff and service are excellent too, warm & friendly. 
11635 4 The people were very nice when we told them we had never been there before and what we should order! Loved the vibe of the place and the food was really good! I would definitely recommend getting the smaller bowl though because the large bowl was waaaaay too much food! 
11636 3 Being a fan of Dinh Ho BBQ off of Lamar, this place was the same...great! You can find the same food at both places. 
11637 4 Been about three more times since my initial review. It's starting to taste like mama's...not exactly, but great. Still sad they don't serve doro wot, but I DO find myself craving The spot often. 
11638 3 First time back since the days of Paul's. Beautiful view. Completely updated. Clean. Alene and other staff provided great service. Food quality and portions good value. Brought back many memories from the days of Paul's. Thank you. Wife and I will be back soon. Frank & Estelle 
11639 3 went here with no reservations on a tuesday and had to wait 45 minutes but was worth it. food is fresh and good and nice presentation. good service. may be a little overpriced for the portion sizes but other then that a good restaurant 
11640 4 Awesome foods, but parking is a little dicey. Strongly suggest uber. Based on a Yelp review, I had the pork tenderloin medallions and am glad I did. Definitely a repeat order. 
11641 1 Rolling bones is alright. Their beef is a lot better than their pork. Their spicy sauce is the one to get. Their potato salad is ok, not great or bad. Service is so/so as well. Overall it's an okay place to grab a quick, cheap bite. 
11642 4 This is one of the best boot camps I have attended. I definitely saw results, became stronger, and felt more confident. Bill and his staff are some of the best trainers I have met. Highly recommend then if you to feel good about yourself. 
11643 0 Warren Rader is a complete jerk and has no people skills. I am surprised he is still in business. 
11644 3 Best coffee I've had. Good down home breakfast. Early Sunday morning no crowd. Diner type seating with 8 tables. Waiter service is pleasant and quick. A neighborhood stable. 
11645 4 I attended a birthday celebration at Pristine Nail Lounge. I was thoroughly impressed. The place was clean, well decorated and staffed with friendly professionals. Everyone in my party had an exceptional time. 
11646 3 Pretty decent seafood compared to a couple in the neighborhood. I expected the soba noodle to be the cold ones but it came as hot soup soba. It wasn't bad just not what I expected. 
11647 3 Really good breakfast food. More on the expensive side. Not too bad of a wait for a Saturday morning brunch either. And the portions are huge! 
11648 4 Thses guys do a fantastic job... everytime. It's right down the street from me and when I want a burrito thats unlike anything else you can pick up quickly... Cochita Pibil (sp?) it is. Breakfast Tacos all day... That alone is worth 5 stars. 
11649 0 Shitty, shitty coffee. Ordered a mocha, but it tasted like chared toast - not sweet, not coffee, just char. 
11650 0 Terrible service from the hostess (hard to even use that title); more like a cold person. Went in to have lunch with my family and she was so rude I walked out and did not even eat. We purposely went to this location to try this restaurant. 
11651 3 Good service, great fried oysters and aguachile was great but not super spicy. I would go back it's heaven for seafood lovers. We didn't realize that they had specials and that you can build your own seafood tower which looked amazing. 
11652 3 They do a decent job with my shirts. I've had shoes re-soled here and they came back brand new. I've also had alterations done, which were done perfectly. The drive thru is a nice touch as well. 
11653 4 Interesting that a cemetary is being reviewed here! It IS indeed a beautifully maintained place and transitions well, season to season. I give it 5 stars because my grandparents, great-grandparents and lots of other relatives are there. 
11654 4 I like the freshness of their produce and I trust it more than anywhere else. A lot of organic options. Healthy kids snacks. I hope they have more choices for yogurts. 
11655 0 This place has racist policies. I was escorted out because I was cold and wore a hoddie. If I wore anything else including an item that covered my head because of religious beliefs I would have been fine. 
11656 4 Food and ambience was amazing. Wallace and James made us feel welcomed and very comfortable. Definitely a must go! 
11657 4 Dr. Brown provides excellent communication and his mobile services are unmatched in South metro-Atlanta. My four boxers and I now call Dr. Brown our primary veterinarian. Thanks again from Remus, Cassia, Seth and Fabiola! 
11658 4 Wowza! These doughnuts are absolutely delicious. Highly recommend for sweet lovers. Only downfall is that not all locations are open on Sundays. Will be a repeat customer for sure. :) 
11659 4 We go here at least once a month. Always a great time for the whole family, from young to old. 
11660 3 Get in, get out, get good coffee. I recommend the Toddy SS or the Flash brew. Really simple coffee bar with everything you could want and open good hours 
11661 1 Music is Live and awesome food is HORRIBLE. Meat under cooked and bland, fish tastes nasty everyone at my table could barely stomach eating. 
11662 4 Nice friendly atmosphere. Pizza smells good (I'm here for takeout). Great place for a small party. Got the big kahuna 18 inch pizza and wings. 
11663 4 Excellent Spanish Coffee made with Stumptown Coffee Holler Mountain Great happy hour menu as well. Highly recommend stopping by. 
11664 4 Rad beer/Cider/Mead spot! Super safe for Beer Reps as I hear.... Go hang out and say hello!!!!! 
11665 4 Noun is simply a wonderland, and I'd like to have it all delivered to my house, pronto. 
11666 4 Went to this spot on a Saturday night! It was very nice I sat at the bar ordered a few drinks I love the open rooftop awesome views! 
11667 3 Good twist on tacos, good seating and fast service. A little proud of their food in terms of price but you're paying the Domain premium, so caveat emptor. 
11668 4 Was checking out the circle c area since we are debating moving here and found this place by chance. Wonderful! Great food, amazing service. Thanks 
11669 4 Love love love this place. We come in when visiting Orlando just about every trip. Meatball calzone & white pizza. Juniors cheesecake or little beignet balls (that's not what they call them tho). The owner is a nice New Yorker - very friendly wait staff. Highly recommend! 
11670 3 Came here for a conference. The staff were friendly and helpful. Specifically, I would like to commend the housekeeping staff. They were able to accomodate our request and made sure our rooms were fresh and clean during our entire stay! 
11671 3 Ordered from here on justeat.ca. The BBQ pork salad rolls were SO yum!!! Next time I'm craving vietnamese I'm definitely going to go there and can't wait to try their other foods! 
11672 2 Good food and atmosphere. Better when not crowded, like on a weekday when everyone else is working. Gets crowded other times and can get loud. Seafood omelet options, yum. 
11673 4 best chinese... very yummy high recommended 
11674 0 I got first degree burns from a brazilian here. Not super comfy. 
11675 3 I had a great experience here! Everything taste great! Our waiter was fun and knowledgeable. I had the spicy miso ramen my friends had the level 3 spicy ramen. Beware! It's hot. I would come back 
11676 4 This place is awesome. They give you pickles in a jar as soon as your sit down. Great happy hour prices. Fire pit outside with sand. Food was good. Def will be back 
11677 2 The whitefish salad was disappointing, it tasted too much like tuna fish and was too wet and salty. Even Acme whitefish salad from the supermarket is better, with a more pronounced smoky flavor and less liquid-y. The bagels are good though. 
11678 4 Excellent location serving up Cuban and Mexican fare. The atmosphere is 5 stars, and they play awesome music, such as a Mexican rendition of cold play songs. Free chips and salsa and a large patio. 
11679 4 This place has made a fan out of so many people I know that thought they didn't like Indian food. There is no way someone couldn't enjoy the atmosphere, fancy drinks and delicious food. The chicken korma and curry mussels are our favorite. 
11680 3 We looked at a lot of interesting furniture and lamps, one ceiling lamp was made of gold wire and flat shells...made in the Philippines and done very well. 
11681 2 I went on a Saturday afternoon and they only had the buffet option which wasn't good at all. I went there before on a weekday and enjoyed my time but the buffet was not fresh, didn't have my fav dishes. 
11682 2 My family and I love love this authentic chinese restaurant! Service is fast and accurate. Our drinks are never empty which we love :) Lunch specials are excellent in price with a generous serving. Most definately will be returning. * The Brisket or Fish Hot Pot is my favorite. 
11683 4 I love this sushi place so much. Good service, and most of all, it is not always pack like other sushi cali ... 
11684 3 Love the Mad Italian. They cheesesteaks are very good and the atmosphere is very comfortable. 
11685 4 Amazing service , great food was really deliciouse. Place is spotless service is really fast and the place is kid friendly I highly recommend :) 
11686 2 Great friendly staff and a very neat facility with a lot of equipment plus a pool and basketball court. 
11687 2 I was told this was the best and honestly it's about the same at Pho Van. The service is abysmal, but that's to be expected at these Asian joints. I'm not convinced that this is the best just because I came from Philly where Pho was awesome. I'm stlil looking... 
11688 0 Worst fish and chips i have ever had. Poor service. Couple next to us also had a very poor dining experience. 
11689 4 SEE was truly fantastic. I haven't bought glasses in a very long time, and the process couldn't have been easier. Joe helped me (who was fabulous!) - I had a new pair on order in no time that I was really excited about. Highly recommended. 
11690 4 Came here before going to paramount because it was so close by. What a nice surprise!! Great food and drinks. Bartenders and waitresses were very friendly and attentive. 
11691 4 The service is fast and friendly. The portion size is plenty and you will not walk away hungry or disappointed. Everything I had was delicious and I can not wait until my next visit. 
11692 3 First time trying hot pot, great ingredients and choices. 
11693 3 Very delicious but they didnt have any vegetarian options. I wish I knew that before I took my vegetarian mother with me. Otherwise, very delicious food but the ambiance is definitely lacking, more of a hole in the wall type of place. 
11694 4 Beautiful. Be sure to visit in the fall or early spring, if you go once it is too hot you will not be staying for very long. 
11695 2 Not my favorite HEB as I prefer the one on Slaughter and Escarpment. Decent place, but could use some housekeeping. People seemed friendly enough. I think Yelp has the address wrong a bit but will check that out! 
11696 4 The best meat and the very best service in the state. They bend over backwards to make sure their customers are happy. Always a pleasure doing business with them. 
11697 4 Simple, cheap, healthy, and most of all TASTY!! After you get your bowl, mix it up for a great amalgamation. 
11698 3 Live in N Austin and have had some real good meals (mostly lunches) there. Staff is a friendly as most places. I bumped it up one star mainly 'cause of the bands that play there. Some real good quality music most every weekend. 
11699 4 Great bakery, and amazing coffee. The sun peers in to the bar and gives you a cozy Sunday afternoon vibe. Definitely recommend. 
11700 4 Loved the bibimbap! It comes put very hot so be cautious. Enjoyed with a beer. The spice was perfect. Great rice and presentation with the stoneware. 
11701 3 Such good thai food. There was a $20 minimum for delivery, so I was able to sample quite a few things. Veggie spring rolls, green curry, and sticky rice were amazing. The only drawback was that they forgot my coke, but otherwise, the food was amazing. 
11702 4 Called last minute for a large delivery! From the first phone call thru delivery service was exceptional. 
11703 2 The waffle cone shattered when I bit into it. Decent taste and consistency but not destination ice cream. If they were open earlier in the day I might try the Cuban coffee offerings 
11704 0 Not a big fan. They never seem to have the dollar drafts they advertise about. The small dance floor upstairs gets crowded fast, 
11705 3 I used to go to Ruby's every week when I lived around the corner. They really do a nice job on manicures and pedicures. I've found that their manicures last longer than most. They are very friendly and have pretty good prices. 
11706 4 It's a very friendly place to have a nice treat. I love their fresh handmade ice cream. 
11707 3 This is the best dive bar in NE Portland. The build your own burger menu is expansive, but not expensive. The food is surprisingly super good. I would have given it 5 stars except you have to order and pre-pay at the bar. 
11708 3 All southern food is NOT SOUL FOOD but this is the SPOT! Absolutely delish! This is my 2nd visit and it was consist! Get there early or be prepared to wait! The food brings the masses from all ethnicities, socioeconomic and professional backgrounds! AMEN to SOUL FOOD! 
11709 4 Bottles is great; it's very close to my house so I go here when I'm not driving (Harvest is my favorite when I am). The guys are always nice, and they have some great sales. Also they sell singles of nice, locally crafted beer, which my boyfriend really likes. 
11710 4 Top of the line service from every staff member along with amazing design and style elements make the Opus a "can't miss" visit every time...highly recommend! 
11711 4 Very friendly quick and efficient service. I definitely will come back. I would recommend the jetty punch. Needed to purchase a couple of children's size and she recommended splitting a regular size. Loved that! Thank you. 
11712 2 Dear Dennys, Your banana caramel french toast is balla! Love Always, Rosetta 
11713 4 Very relaxing environment with friendly staff. Tiffany did my mani and pedi and was great. I never had anyone educate me on what to do or not to do when caring for my nails. She was awesome will definitely be back! 
11714 4 Our favorite sushi restaurant by far! Incredible grade of tuna! Favorites are Big O, Smoked Salmon Twist! For lunch I recommend Sushi D! 
11715 4 Absolutely phenomenal. I went in knowing nothing and was amazed at how friendly, easy, and informative Katie was. This place is the definition of 5 stars. 
11716 0 Thank God Bass Pro bought them out! Horrible customer service and won't be going back there. The lady was so rude to me while I was trying to pick up my package I had ordered offline. Think I may actually cancel order and reorder from Bass Pro 
11717 4 Friendly staff. Great service. Delicious breakfast sandwiches. Love the early AM hours. Amazing coffee!! 
11718 4 Didn't see anything that I didn't like about here. Meets all the requirements for a Great coffee shop. Good Coffee Great staff Quiet environment Free WiFi Good food. 
11719 3 When in Austin I try to hit this place as much as poss. I love Pho, and everywhere I go I see what's up. And while it's not as good as Pho Ca Dao back home, it's up there. The egg rolls are boink and the pho is bing-bong, Hellllllllo! 
11720 0 Okay service, but it takes forever to get the food. I order the salad and it was more like a soup. :( It had so much ranch it was nasty. 
11721 2 same concept like its Robson location, find your own prices by surfing on their gorgeous iMacs. A lot smaller store though, so means less traffic and more attentive service. Located across the lululemon store. 
11722 3 Cheap soups & noodles & always a good choice. I love this place. Not a fancy night out, but always good. 
11723 4 SO GOOD. We got the Standard and the Corned Beef Hash. This will be a new staple. We swapped regular potatoes for sweet potatoes and it was amazing. 
11724 4 Been only once for brunch, we had: Spanish Omelette, Fish and Chips, Egg Benedict Berry Pancakes with sausage and Sunny Side Eggs, Latte,. Everything was great!!! The wait was long, which means people likes the place. But they brought pretty fast the food and the service good too. 
11725 1 I guess for Portland these donuts are good, but comparatively to bakeries in New York or Boston they really arent that impressive. Sorry, I know they have a cult following but I just wasnt impressed. 
11726 0 Don't know what all the hype about this place is about. Below average pizza and even lower service. No water offered to drink and poor service. Went there for the tandoori chicken pizza and was disappointed. 
11727 4 Favorite local diner! Gotta try the blood orange mimosas and the cheeky monkey! Soooo good. 
11728 4 Professional and competent. Some back up and took a couple of days to complete tune-up. But was done well. They really are closed on Mondays. 
11729 0 Seriously over rated. The burgers were only ok. The service was terrible. I do not understand wanting to wait in line for a burger that you could get hust as good, if not better elsewhere. So dont waste your time. 
11730 2 Not great. Decent, but I would recommend going somewhere else. Steak was chewy. Kids tacos were a little different than kids typically expect but ok. 
11731 2 The pricing of the food is reasonable; however the portions do seem a little bit small. However, the beer selection from Germany more than makes up for it! 
11732 0 Half of my order was missing, wonton barely had any filling. Sauce was tasteless. Sadly not my cup of tea and wouldn't recommend eating here 
11733 4 I was there on Wednesday while spending the day in Atlanta. I ordered oysters, and. chicken Caesar salad, both of which were fantastic. I was served by a really sweet waitress named Briana. She made my experience absolutely fantastic, and I hope I get served by her again. 
11734 0 1 hour to get chicken wings, really. Place was not that busy and a table next to us just left after 30 minutes of waiting with no service. 
11735 2 Tasty little pizza. Brought it home and enjoyed. Prefer Napoli much more. Got to have pizza once a week so checking out all 
11736 4 Great shop! Got my daughter some like new Keens for $15 bucks. Also walked out with a perfect little outfit from the dollar rack, GREAT deals. 
11737 3 Best black 'n bleu cheese burger I ever did have! Cozy too! 
11738 4 best pint in town! great music food and staff! luv it here! 
11739 1 Avoid this location - operations are a mess, you have to go to the top floor of a garage to get the car then drive it back out 
11740 0 Food is less than ok, characters don't really come around as much, and we had a cockroach crawling on our bench which is an indication of a filth. Waiter came over and killed it for us. Don't waste your money or time. 
11741 3 Love this place! Best Chinese we have food in Columbus and they deliver, huge bonus. Their servings are good sized as well, they are just a bit expensive hence the 4 stars. 
11742 3 Good stuff. Love the atmosphere. I think waiting in line is part of the fun, kind of. Food is great. Highly recommend 
11743 1 I love this Whole Foods because it is the personification of life in Boston: bitter competition with too many people for overpriced resources. Treat yourself to their parking lot - especially on the weekend - I dare you. #CursedOutByAMomInARangeRoverInFrontOfHerChild 
11744 3 BEST. FRENCH. TOAST. EVER! A friend recommended it to me when I visited from Cali last week and I loved every bite of it... 
11745 4 Has a lot of fruits and vegetables that are fresh ans nice.. much better then most northern stores ! 
11746 4 Excellent service with delicious food in a refined setting despite being in a strip mall in a commercial district near self storage places and build a sofas. 
11747 4 Rigatone and Steak. That's all I have to say!!!! This place has some of the best food I've tasted in Boston! 
11748 3 This is a great choice if you feel like something a bit more upscale, and if you go for happy hour ($2 off drinks and $4 off appetizers) it won't be as painful to your wallet. Loved the Rotisserie Chicken Flatbread and the white and fuchsia swirled Huckleberry Margarita. 
11749 0 We've missed bugaboo since they closed most of their locations but saw this one is still open and stopped in. Service was slow and inattentive and the food wasn't anywhere near as good as we remember. 
11750 2 Prices are higher in the saloon and they would not honor prices online. 35 for a 30 gel manicure is a bit pricey in my opinion. 
11751 3 Excellent Neapolitan pizzas, nice wine selection and cozy brick-and-beam interior. A Davis Square gem. 
11752 4 Always a delicious meal. Good service. Full bar. Nice ambience. Walkable area before and after dinner. Take work clients here. Love it!! 
11753 3 Great fresh squeezed orange juice and eggs Benedict. This is one of those restaurants that is best to go to on a weekday though because it usually has a long wait. Nice hometown feel that is cozy. 
11754 4 Have been going to Della Optique for years after an ex-boss of mine reccomended Dr. Chow to me. Staff are very friendly and attentive. Dr. Della Chow is so knowledgable and friendly. I've always had amazing service here and won't go anywhere else. 
11755 3 Excellent Mexican! The guacamole is very good as well as the Chili Releno and Steak Burrito. The Tres Leche Cake is the best anywhere, big enough to share. 
11756 3 Amazing flavors, easy location (walking or driving), and coffee to die for too (if that's your thing). 
11757 2 My Ethiopian friend recommends this to me. The decoration is fun. They have authentic Ethiopian food and the price is so cheap. The only complaint is that the parking is not very convenient. 
11758 4 Good/fast service. Great tasting food for a strip mall restaurant! 
11759 4 Hearth has never let us down. We normally go with the Queen of Sandy Springs and the Mom "Eat Your Veggies". The fried mozzarella is a nice appetizer as well. If you're in the mood for pizza, this is your place. 
11760 4 Absolutely, hands down, the best place to kill time at the ATL airport. Get yourself to terminal E and relax into a handcrafted cocktail, and an inventively fresh menu. Go for the Dirty South! 
11761 4 Must try the spicy Russian Ruben it is amazingly great. Amazing Rubens! All their food is cooked to order how you like it and they are very personal and friendly. Must check out even if it is out of your way! 
11762 4 Very reliable and fair prices. Nice, friendly, professional technicians. We use them for everything possible. 
11763 3 The cannoli is delicious! The coconut macaroon is delicious! The mini cheesecake wasn't special but I will definitely be back. 
11764 4 I am a CA transplant and nothing ever quite hits the mark for Mexican here in the north shore. Omg the house margarita is huge full on strong one. The food was good. The service was excellent! 
11765 4 This is my favorite dive bar in all of portland!! The service is great and the bar food is tasty as well. It's very ambient and you can come here by yourself and still have a hoot. 
11766 4 Great service especially Devin!! Love how they especially have a private parking lot ESP in the city! There's plenty of space for studying or doing work, lots of plugs for you to charge your phone or laptop as well!! 
11767 4 Hands down, my favorite Mexican place. It actually might be my favorite restaurant in Boston. The food, drinks, atmosphere, service is amazing. The muchaka meat is to die for. 
11768 0 Dry Bar never replied to me even though they told me to reach out to make it better. Bad customer service. 
11769 3 Pretty good flavors on the soups and rice plate, and I'm VERY impressed at the fact they use short grained quality rice. This is one of the few times I saw a fast-paced Asian restaurant use the more expensive rice, it makes the experience so much more better! 
11770 4 Super fresh. Super delicious. I will say that I wish they were a bit softer, but that might have been the time of day we went. Get here early or your favorites will be sold out! 
11771 4 Best sushi I've ever had.. it will be hard to go back to volcano rolls! Pricey but worth it! 
11772 4 Great work! Very detailed and great customer service. They were sensitive tony time and did an amazing job! 
11773 3 Fantastic pizza. The service was wonderful Deven did a great job. Unfortunately he was the only waiter so the pizza did arrive a little cool to my taste so hence the 4 not 5 stars. 
11774 0 Grimy place. I mean it, its dirty... Mac salad was not the best. My chicken was really fatty Friends beef was way under cooked. Probably wont come back 
11775 2 Pro: Interior decoration Good service Cozy atmosphere Con: No wifi No laptop policy The coffee and food all taste so so Good for groups to hang out, not recommend to come alone. 
11776 1 I had to pay seperate for noodle for tomyum soup and total came to 14 dollars before tax for tomyum noodle soup. Not a lot of vegetable in it either. Over priced. Will not be returning. 
11777 3 Good prices for quality produce and for finding items to make your Mexican recipes. 
11778 4 I wanted to lick the plates. Hoping for some beer variety soon--the house brewed, that is--but loved the ambiance and the food. 
11779 4 Perfect thin crust pizza. Reasonable price. All Italian wines. Be sure to try the meatball appetizer. Our server Katie and manager Rene were excellent. Stopped at Mike's bakery afterwards. We are going back here many more times. 
11780 2 Pretty overpriced for what they offer to be honest. Thankfully though, the chicken fried steak was big enough that it was reasonable to split it between two people. That made the cost a bit better. The food was good though. 
11781 0 Do not go here!!!! Super expensive and not good food. Portions are really small for the price. 
11782 4 One of the best middle eastern food in the Boston area. Period. Excellent customer service and great ambiance. We usually get the Chicken Kebab platter and the vegetarian platter and they all taste great. 
11783 4 Ordered the Laffa Schwarma with everything on it. Holy cow...this thing weighed as much as a small child. Great flavors, fresh ingredients, cordial service. 
11784 3 No more hanger steak but still the best tapas in town (outside of their sister location in Buckhead). I recently enjoyed their new mushroom, buttom mushrooms with almost a bitter sauce...not my fav. The salmon & spinach was perfectly cooked! Desserts & atmosphere...a gem in perimeter mall area. 
11785 3 Stopped by for lunch and had their cranberry & apple salad. Yummy!!! I like that they grill their chickens without extra oil - I hate when it is greasy. I am definitely going back for more! 
11786 3 Parish is a good place with a nice selection of creative (and very large sandwiches) as well as a good craft beer selection. I had "The Benny" which I thought was excellent. 
11787 4 Fantastic food!! We had the Saloon appetizer platter. The steak bites are to die for!! Great local band The Uproar! 
11788 3 Definitely a tasty surprise!!! But would definitely recommend if you happen to be in Vancouver BC and want something different.! Get ready to wait at least 30 minutes though. 
11789 4 My server was Ron Holmes. Meeting him was hands down, the beat part of my trip to Florida. He was so nice, warm & welcoming! 
11790 4 So sad to hear Ming Court is closing! A sentimental favorite for sure! Have always had delicious food and great service in a lovely setting. 
11791 4 Outstanding. The food was fresh with a great varied menu. My new favorite when I don't want to cook and want fresh healthy food. 
11792 4 I've been here 3 times & all 3 times this place has been great! The food & customer service deserves all 5 stars.... 
11793 1 Bad restaurant for such a great historical building. Food mediocre at best. But it doesn't matter because of the waaaaay too many 65" tvs. Really takes away from dinner. Not a place for date night. Yuck. 
11794 3 Awesome view...it was on my BF list to do and I have to say I'm glad we made it. Enjoyed our time on it!! 
11795 0 Be very careful with your phone here. I know of multiple that have gotten their phone stolen here. 
11796 4 Had a wonderful time here. Food was great staff was nice and on point. Pizza and lasagna great 
11797 4 Hands down the best sweet potato pie!!! I went back the next day to order a whole pie to take back to Colorado but they were out! The chicken was amazing too! 
11798 0 this company dispatched Action Road Assistance (Cary, NC) and the idiot that arrived said his name was Al Saunders, physically assaulted the female driver and left before the police arrived! 
11799 3 It's good food, nice people, just priced too high for my personal liking. Small fancy portions if that's your thing 
11800 4 Service is on point! I made a reservation at 745 for a table at 815 and walked right in to be seated. Food was delicious, salsas were so dang good and the margaritas are fantastic. 
11801 3 Good sandwhiches and a first glass beer and wine selection. Really if you are a beer geek and want a great selection of beers from around the world, you have to check this place out... 
11802 4 For vegetarians, the burrito and nachos is a good option. Food was fresh and delicious. 
11803 1 We finally tried Hounddogs because everyone talks about it. Not sure if they were having an off night but we were not impressed. The crust was very dense and hard to chew. The cheeseand sauce were alright but nothing stood out. No real flavors.Very bland. I have had much better. 
11804 3 For lobby and bar only- lovely Midcentury decor, great service and drinks at the bar. Lose the pumped in Drakkar Noir fragrance and I'll be back. 
11805 3 This location brings back memories! Love the ice cream here - the dipped or sprinkle cones are so yummy :) 
11806 4 This place is seriously amazing! The food is beyond incredible. I love everything I have ever eaten here. You will love it too. The staff is super nice too. I can't say enough good things about this place. 
11807 4 It was fun to watch my order's progress using the app. Received call within minutes to confirm order and received order within 30 minutes. 
11808 4 The food always tastes fresh. Its consistent, the servers are friendly and SO nice. I also love the decor. Thai food at its best! 
11809 0 Couldn't order a sandwich because their credit card terminals weren't working. Stupid way to lose business. 
11810 3 Lose the hipsters and this place would be 5 stars. Lose the beautiful waitresses and maybe 3 stars. Ah, I guess you can't have one without the other! Happy hour menu is good. 
11811 2 This is a super self-aware place trying extremely hard to disguise itself as a dive bar. It's not a dive bar, it's a gourmet gastropub that grew a beard and threw on skinny jeans and a meticulously chosen flannel. Once I let that go, it's A-OK for beer & pool. 
11812 2 Just cause they are open late doesn't mean they serve alcohol late. They stop super early! And you can only use cash unless you sit down. If you get water they only sell bottles 
11813 4 Great service and I love their sushi!! The bartender is always nice and very helpful at suggesting new rolls for me to try out!!! I love this place!!! 
11814 2 I had lunch here today and was just okay. The chicken was dry and underwhelming. The whole ordering system is unpleasant to watch because it looks like they are making a mess. The service is OK. I will most likely not return. 
11815 4 Best pint of Guinness I've had in forever. The curried chips (fries) were pretty damn good too. Service friendly and efficient. 
11816 3 Super cheap sushi and food! Service is also very good, my green tea was always kept full! We could not believe how reasonable and cheap the prices were! Such a bargain! We went here twice in our week vacation! 
11817 3 Great fresh tasting sushi. We tried a variety of appetizers, rolls and sashimi and enjoyed everything. The king salmon sashimi was a little on the expensive side but worth it. The sushi rolls we well prepared, fresh and delicious. Our server was wonderful, attentive and friendly. 
11818 3 Very very good! 20% off for sitting at the bar and service was great. Heavenly hash, migas, omlettee and gumbo was all super yummy. Def go here! 
11819 3 Consistently the best wings in town. Drinks may be a little expensive so ask for the specials. Lots of TVs so you won't miss the game. 
11820 2 Nice little dive bar type establishment. Nothing to fancy, but the bar was nice looking and clean inside. The tonic was completely flat in my gin and tonic but stuff happens. Heard them say they do burgers as well. 
11821 2 good service, friendly bartenders... I just expected more selection from some place called an ale house lol. at least they have arrogant bastard, but I wish they had a double or triple IPA 
11822 3 One of the margaritas on their drink menu was divine! Also had the Primetime and the Nutella and chocolate pretzel shake, Amazing! Now waiting in line for 2 hours? Not so great.. 
11823 3 Best pizza around. Woman who takes orders could be less argumentative and more pleasant. I have held off on writing this, but her attitude is a turn off. Going to look for a place where business is welcomed. 
11824 4 Perfect spot located inside our hotel. Good food, good cocktails and amazing service thanks to Spencer. Highly recommend! 
11825 3 Great southern food ! Casual and easy going. Note there is no table service you order at the counter and then carry your food to the table. The carrot cake is amazing ! Best I've ever had 
11826 2 Seems they stepped it up a bit! The ribs I just had here are really good. Tender, falling-off-the-bone, nice sauce. Baked beans (Daddy's Best BBQ Beans) were delish, too. Reeealy tender smoked BBQ HOT wings good potato salad to soothe the burn. 
11827 4 Real happy with my haircut. I got straight thick Asian hair but I always go with a simple short on the sides 2 and leave at be top a bit long. Simple straightforward and they killed it. Definitely coming back for another haircut 
11828 3 The food was amazing. Loved the desserts. This place has a good ambience but can get a little noisy coz of big groups. 
11829 4 Our doctor (Dr Valerie Hampt) was clear,conscious,professional,helpful,attentive and totally worth our trust in this clinic.As long as she is working for WD,we will return.It is refreshing to encounter doctors who actually care about their patients! 
11830 3 Good food, fun ambiance, great service. Maybe a better brunch selection would be good...but otherwise it's great! 
11831 4 Bombbbbbb food! Order the bbq jerk chicken chili plate with black rice and plantains! 
11832 3 Great pizza and awesome beer selection!! Servers were super friendly and helpful as well. We had the Gouda chicken pizza (which was suggestion by the bartender) and it was excellent. Not to mention they had Columbus Brewing CO's Bohdi on tap! I will definitely stop in again!!!! 
11833 3 ****WARNING**** Yelp lists this as a "restaurant" that's "open til 11:30". Nope. Went there at 10:15 and food operations were closed. Yelp, how about some nuance instead of sending me to the wrong place? 4 stars as it seemed fine and it's not their fault that Yelp wasted my time. 
11834 4 Vegan coooooooooooooooooookies. couches! Open until 10pm! I LIKE IT. I can come here and knit and drink coffee and tea and even get a sandwich when I'm feeling peckish. I wish Bipartisan was closer to my house. Perhaps I should move my house closer to Bipartisan! 
11835 3 I've gone here a few times. Good local sports bar with a fun crowd. The food can be a little pricey but it's usually good. 
11836 3 Love burgers but man its freezing in here. Turn on the heat. Can't beat veras cheap lol 
11837 4 YUUUUM. When I feel homesick for tacos I go here. As authentic as can get. They got you covered from vegan to the most carnivorous and their prices are very reasonable. Casual spot always a good time. 
11838 1 Friendly staff, small place. Great to get a quick lunch but you pay too much for what you get. Sandwiches are average, side dishes are ok. But I like the friendly staff very much! Go check it out! 
11839 4 Great service! Lovely atmosphere! We enjoyed the papas, the squid, the huevo, the drinks. Our server was so solicitous and helpful. 
11840 4 The best Mac n Cheese I've seen in town, with Montage coming in at a close 2nd. The quality is unreal... worth every penny. The perfect balance of crispy, creamy, and cheesy. 
11841 4 Best Mexican food in Orlando. Great Margaritas. Live Mariachi band on weekends is good fun. 
11842 4 Chris was excellent. He came out last Friday after I called. He fixed the door quickly and did an excellent job. The price was extremely reasonable. Call Alliance Overhead first! They will save you money. 
11843 4 Kevin is an awesome trainer with a great imagination for new exercises that keep you from plateauing. 
11844 3 Well, I went in and was disappointed with the dried out nachos. A very gay friendly sports bar. 
11845 2 Love the chicken panuchos, especially with the pickled onions. I am not big on the tacos as they don't have cilantro on them, and the meat is not that tender. They also are sometimes closed when their hours say they should be open. 
11846 1 Massage was just ok. And I dislike a facility that does not have a hot tub... too many other great options in Austin. 
11847 4 Dr. Murphy & The Crew are spot-on. Don't overcharge or try and recommend unnecessary treatments for Pickle the Wonderdog. 
11848 3 This is my favourite breakfast restaurant, I usually get great service with the exception of one waitress who got my order wrong a few times, but otherwise they are great and the food is so yummy! I prefer this location over all the others. 
11849 4 At last ...a New York style bacon egg and cheese on a kaiser roll! I have searched high and low and finally found one!!! Absolutely loved this place. It has a from scratch at home feel Everything we ordered was amazing and the staff was great. 
11850 4 Still amazing. Now when we go to a theater that isn't the alamo it doesn't feel right. Alamo, you've spoiled us. 
11851 4 What a wonderful and authentic experience. People come here for the food, but also to relax, to immerse in the vibe set by the low-lighting, super friendly staff, and dope music. Not for tourists, perhaps (meaning if you want the real deal, this is your best bet in Boston metro). 
11852 4 This is another great gem in Disney's Springs. This is an authentic Italian cafe that serves pizza by the slice in the afternoon and have amazing breakfast sandwiches and pastries in the morning. The Staff is friendly and attentive. I recommend it if you are in the area. 
11853 4 Love this place. Fine dining in a southern traditional atmosphere. Drinks on the porch are always a treat. Great fish and steaks. 
11854 4 At first i was looking at this dish strange and it turned it to be delicious. Next time you are in the neighborhood try the Singapore Noodles and of course have the best California Rolls 
11855 4 This is a really great Marshalls, since it's near Millenia, it's very upscale in appearance and they get the top designer items more than any other Marshalls I've visited. Don't miss the shoe section! 
11856 4 I like the haircuts that I receive from Diana L. She is very detailed and makes notes about how she cut my hair from the prior visit. She presents this to me for review before she starts at the next visit. Great professional habit! 
11857 1 The noise level inside is so loud that my boyfriend and I had to ask each other to repeat everything we said. Sit on the patio. 
11858 0 This restaurant was the worst service ever waited for 1 hour and 30 mins to just get the seat while waiting for all other people who came after us get the seat again. Never come here on Tuesday for wings. 
11859 4 The best place for rock shrimp! I drove 30 minutes to this restaurant. Laid back atmosphere and outstanding service. Rock shrimp taste like lobsters. I downed 4 dozen. Dare you to match that especially with a souvenir bug azz beer glass full of local stuff. 
11860 0 No, NO..NOOOO! I went there only once. I was seated and a roach scampered across my table. We called a waitress over and were moved to a diffrent table. Are you kidding me? Walked out, repulsed. 
11861 4 My trip to Medford best place to go for my cold cuts, breads, and salads. Love Bobs worth the hour drive.Try the pastrami also. 
11862 4 I've eater here twice and really enjoy the food and atmosphere. The brunch menu has some great options, we got the shrimp and grits as well as the crab toast. Both were excellent, not to mention bottomless mimosas! Definitely a restaurant to check out in the area. 
11863 3 This place is amazing! The perfect amount of veggies and meat. The bread is toasted on the inside but still soft on the outside. I'd definitely come back. 
11864 0 the service is deplorable. the food is sub-standard -- the girl working the desk is actually a very horrible person. never go there 
11865 4 This was one of the better pizzas I have had in a long time. You definitely need to try this place out if you are ever in this part of town. I would gladly come back here; my wife loved it. 
11866 4 Perfect views! George was a great server and the menu is nice! We had fresh grouper, lobster bisque, and prosecca, what could be better! 
11867 4 Really good tacos and corn in a cup! Very clean. Staff is really friendly. I like how it's open late. 
11868 4 Everyone loves Moe's, but I admit - I miss the blue and red chips. RIP fiesta chips. 
11869 4 Really tasty food and the servers are really nice! The food came out very quickly and the atmosphere was a very calm and controlled environment. Definitely would recommend if you're passing through downtown Austin! 
11870 4 Great atmosphere...you would never expect it looking from the outside. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and attentive. They are very detail oriented with each and every drink. It is quite entertaining to watch the bartenders! I will definitely be going back for dinner! 
11871 0 Bathrooms were disgusting. Order was wrong. Food was burnt. Over charged for the Monday special. 
11872 0 More like NEGATIVE 3 stars! Horrible service waited 45 min when we were only 2 of 5 people there and enough staff for 40! Left cancelled order 
11873 3 I've ordered from this place a couple of times from Ubereats. Thus, I can't comment on the atmosphere of the restaurant. I've had the barbecue salmon with grits and the Mexican street corn. I would recommend them. 
11874 4 I was skeptical, but this place was great. The sweet and savory combos are spot on. Fresh ingredients, local and a quaint atmosphere. We will be back! 
11875 4 Best of the best. Try the 10 course chef's menu - you will not regret it. Get brussells sprouts and ham n eggs. Our server Janna was DELIGHTFUL. Thank you for a wonderful experience in all aspects. 
11876 4 Waffle with cookie spread (not entirely sure what it is) is pretty much one of the most delicious things every created. 
11877 4 I booked the service through corporate agency and Laurie came this morning super prepared. She brought her own toys, books and these amazed both me and my 2 year old. We loved her. I'll definitely ask for her next time! 
11878 4 Reasonably priced, tasty local joint. Lots of goodies you would see at the Flying Elephants downtown as well as the original Elephant's Deli. Beers for pretty cheap compared to a typical restaurant. Food is fresh. Probably one of the best places you can get non-airport food in an airport! 
11879 3 Great place to eat German food and drink German beer, and it won't make a hole in your wallet. The only thing negative is the neighborhood. If your dinning here at night, please be aware of your surroundings. 
11880 0 Awful after a reservation at 1:45 I have been waiting for 45 minutes it's not 2:30 I will never come again to a place that does not respect costumers 
11881 4 I live by their blueberry muffins and feel no guilt for it. I am not Vegan but would much rather have something from this bakery than any major retailer. 
11882 4 Super fun tour, great guide and driver. Knocked out most of the typical tourist sightseeing activities with good trivia. Worth doing. 
11883 4 The Curry! I have never, ever in my life had such delicious savory curry. To think that I nearly did not try this dish because I was convinced that I loathed this dish! 5 stars for the existential experience that was the mango curry. 
11884 3 This has a really cute interior design. The restaurant is a bit smaller than expected, but still spacious. The food was good! I didn't think it would be totally Americanized, but still good. I would come back here again! 
11885 2 thought at first truck fed the SoWa market staff, until i read MC Slim's piece on the Phoenix. tried the panini of meatloaf, chorizo and pickles. good, tad salty. so spiked it with more pickles. solved. will def. try others on offer next sunday. 
11886 4 Very good food. Love the crab rangoons and crispy chicken pad Thai. Chicken is nice clean pieces of white meat and really delicious. 
11887 4 I love this place!! Always packed. GOOD coffee, nice dessert! Try Soy latte! 
11888 4 Best Chinese I have had in a long time. Thai Curry Chicken and Mongolian Beef are awesome!! 
11889 4 Thank you for follow up and sorry I didn't notice earlier. 
11890 4 Love it here and I can't wait to come back! As a cat lady who drinks tea, I was so happy to hang out with these beautiful cats while sipping my English breakfast tea. I love that the cats are available for adoption. Thanks again!! 
11891 3 UPDATE: Cat offered a complimentary massage because of the previous mix up. I go there for Sydney. She's very knowledgeable and gives a great massage. I'm an athlete, and so I get the deep tissue and myofascial release massage (the painful kind) which Sydney excels at. 
11892 0 The service was bad, the bouncers were dicks. There is absolutely no reason to go here, there are so many others bars in the area that are so much better 
11893 4 Seriously delicious. Reminded me of trips to Cancun. I tried several tacos and were all awesome. I can't wait to go back!! 
11894 2 3-1/2 Stars. Friendly, local vibe and staff. Sat at a tall communal table, chatting - and exchanging tastes- with our neighbors, who were regulars. Next time we'll order the mussels with sausage, which were amazing. Black pappardelle with blackened shrimp was delish! Lobster bun was tasty. Cottage fries were overrated. 
11895 3 This is a great date place. Plenty of trendy bars in the area to get your date hammered after dinner. But seriously, the food is good. Big wine list and an interested cocktail selection. 
11896 4 Really good coffee, breakfast sandwiches, baked goods and ambience. We love it here. *Good to note: winter closing time is 7pm even though website says 8pm. 
11897 4 Went to Dillard's today just looking around and walked into the lingerie department. How knowledgeable and on point ThankYou Dillard's for such great personnel. Shout out to Valarie M. 
11898 2 Foods pretty good but pricey as expected for the location. Only thing is service was bit slow when we went with group of 6. 
11899 3 Good food and great service. They keep the coffee coming. Only complaint was toast was hard. 
11900 4 Completely furnished my home office here; it is now my library. We also bought out home entertainment center at the Altamonte Springs location, with enough room for our 56 inch HDTV, Stereo components, CDs, DVDs, and, nick knacks! Fun to shop! 
11901 0 i ordered some sushi and the raw stuff was warm. Raw Sushi should never be warm. My stomach is turning and I want to hurl but can't at this moment. Will never ever go there again. Yuck! Beware of the warm Sushi that is raw and should be cold. 
11902 4 My husband and I love coming here. Service is on point the food is great and the drinks are Fabulous. 
11903 3 Quality service with a smile but far from a bargain. I highly recommend this place for its stellar service! 
11904 0 The age limit feels a bit ridiculous... I'm a teenager in the neighborhood and my friends and I were turned away (from beauty and the beast?) earlier because we "didn't have an adult"- whatever, their money to lose I guess. Galaxy highland 10 it is. 
11905 3 Ruth's Chris can be hit or miss - this one was pretty good. We eat at the bar and usually split a meal. The service was good as was all the food. I would recommend this location. As good as it is I think they are a little over priced. 
11906 1 The service was terrible. The wings were suspect. Did I mention the service was terrible? 
11907 4 New favorites are the salads. arugula, pear, blue cheese, bacon. Get it with a steak tips. What a combination of flavors : sweet salty bitter sour blue cheesy meaty. Always a good saison - farmhouse on tap. 
11908 4 I travel way out of my way to see Dr. Yan Li. She is of course skilled but is also meticulous, patient and shows care for her patients personally. I really appreciate her and recommend her highly! 
11909 4 So fucking good. I've tried about 4 of their donuts, and I'm not even a donut person. I loved them all. 
11910 3 I don't get what everyone's complaining about. I've been here a thousand times, and yeah, I've gotten 2 or 3 things I didn't like, but: 1. The salsa isn't watery at all. 2. The chilaquiles aren't bland or messed up. 3. The chips are always salted, and never stale. 
11911 2 Good sports/dive bar. Cheap prices, regular pub food. Had to lower the rating because always seems understaffed, or at least service is slow even when not busy. Often have to flag down your server if you want anything else. Fun spot for any CU games or other sports events. 
11912 3 Good parontay, great Chana Puri, wicked aalo tikki, the laasi is also delicious great place for vegetarian food 
11913 0 The most horrendous service! Better restaurants out there for Peruvian food, dirty and the quality of the food was terrible! Its a cafeteria at best with prices of a real five star restaurant. will never go back! 
11914 4 Excellent! I would reccomend this authentic burger place to anyone. Get the spicy mayo SERIOUSLY DO IT ITS BETTER THAN WATERSKIING NAKED IN HEAVEN. 
11915 4 Bolt Depot offers a array of selection for all your bolt needs. They are my goto for all my bolt needs. Quick transaction, excellent service and highly competitive pricing. Save the trip to Home Depot and Lowes - order direct from Bolt Depot. 
11916 3 Nice small nail shop. They do a pretty good job. All the employees seemed friendly & communicated nicely. Closest one to the house. I'll go back hopefully. 
11917 0 No water fountain in a sports facility? Trash cans continually over filled? Benches littered with beer cans from the night before? Welcome to Pilgrim. On the positive side the guys in the shop are friendly. I still hate going here. 
11918 4 During my Boston trip I tried a lot different restaurants and honestly this one is the best so far ! Love Asian food, love Korean food and this was a great experience. Cute decoration, AMAZING fresh food and service was really really good ! Try it ! 
11919 2 A-ok but not 4 stars. Fried oysters were small and lacked flavor. Food was good but not worthy of a four star rating. 
11920 2 Tried their salmon don and it wasnt so bad. Beef tataki was decent but overpriced for the amount served! It's a tiny place with poor sound control, but their food is pretty decent quality. The only thing about this place is that the waitresses aren't very accommodating.. 
11921 4 Easy. Laid back. Cozy. Tasty. BEER. Vegan friendly. Games in TV. Tucked in booths. This place is a winner. PS The tots are so YUM! 
11922 1 I came here twice for lunch and the food here sucks! I ordered this beef stew and it was cold, the beef was dry as if it was out of one of those Campbell soup cans This place is more of a bar than a restaurant. 
11923 1 we have had uneven experiences with this chain. the pioneer place location has had good stuff both tines my wife has gone there. today though she tried the lloyd center shop. i will let the croissant she picked up for me speak for itself... 
11924 1 +: Love me some big windows that open up during the summer! -: Everything else is forgettable so let's change restaurants and everything will be great! !: Hello indoor fireplace! ?: Second location is so awkward. 
11925 4 Delicious Lobster Roll! We got take-out and ate at the beach right across from the restaurant. It was amazing... TONS of Lobster and the brioche roll was delicious as well. The owner happens to be a super nice guy, which is what earned them the fifth star of the review. 
11926 4 Such nice people...owner personally delivered my food and was so sincere about us enjoying it. Mango fried rice and crispy basil chicken were delicious! 
11927 4 The food is delicious and service is great. We have sat both in and outdoors, they let our pup with us when we sat outside. Both times have been great and we have enjoyed ourselves. Love coming here. 
11928 4 Been ordering take outs from this place. Love their vegetarian dishes and fried rice. Great flavour and non greasy. 
11929 2 Food is excellent. Customer service is lacking. Little parking for a well known place. Avocado margarita is awesome. Shrimp cocktail is delicious. 
11930 0 If I could give it a zero I would. Everything was awful. The worst Mexican food I've ever tasted. The service was good however. 
11931 3 Visited for brunch and it was very good. Best bloody mary I've had in Atlanta. The jazz band at brunch was awesome. I liked the decor and service was friendly. I would definitely go back. 
11932 4 Delicious food and great service. They have a great beer selection too. We did the sampler and they were all great. The burgers were delicious. 
11933 4 Great coffee. One of the only places I know of that has Cuban coffee. Patio outside is very roomy and dog friendly. 
11934 4 Friendly staff. Knowledgeable staff and good physical rehab facility. They do an amazing job making you feel welcome and being invested in your health. 
11935 0 food was fresh, service was excellent. If this was cajun food, i'm santa claus. this more like thai food, which is NOT what i was expecting. unless you know what you're getting yourself into here, i would suggest choosing another restaurant. 
11936 3 Really charming interior, but can get pretty noisy when it fills up. 
11937 4 I'm familiar with the tavern Resturant and bars and this is not my first time to be at one! But I had the asiago turki burger it was a booooooooomb such a tasty mixture between spinach cream and artichoke dipping yummy 
11938 4 Absolutely amazing!!! This, combined with "Wishes" which follows it, blows Illuminations and Fantasmic out of the water. I was so impressed with the creativity, colors, music, etc. the engineers who created this are true artists. Missing this is a huge mistake! Would definitely see it again (and again) 
11939 4 A casual place to have some good Texas barbecue. Go early if you don't want to wait in a long line. 
11940 3 Ate outside, which was a lovely break from the noise inside. Had the gnocchi. Well prepared and not too heavy. Have been eating here for years, never disappointed. 
11941 0 Don't like the place. Ordered fish and chips, taste and texture was as if zapped in a microwave. I don't get it. It's supposed to be fresh fish. Instead it was soggy 
11942 4 I recommend this place to all my friends. I have gotten my phone fixed here maybe 5 or 6 times in the last couple years (oops) and it's been a 5 star experience every time. Friendly, affordable, and super fast. Thanks, Leon! 
11943 4 Great sushi with plenty of variety. The service was phenomenal. The environment was great for catching up with friends. Very clean and modern restaurant. Plenty of sitting room and comfortable. The buffet includes appetizers and desserts. I am definitely going back, 
11944 4 A good place to chill on weekends. if you live in Lake Mary - Sanford area do not wish to drive till Orlando downtown clubs on weekends this is a good place. Just that it has most of the older crowd but still fun ! 
11945 3 $5 movie Tuesdays, need I say more? The theatre is never crowded when I go, the quality of the screening doesn't falter and the bathrooms are (mostly) super clean. 
11946 4 Fantastic experience. My husband and I came in for lunch and were very impressed. Stellar service from our server Bri. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, attentive, and super pleasant and friendly. The cocktails were awesome and the food was delicious! We'll be back for sure. 
11947 4 One of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had! Dinner was delicious and dessert was phenomenal. We also had the best service thanks to our lovely waitress, Brittany. She was super helpful and just the sweetest. Will definitely be back! 
11948 0 Stay away!! One order of chicken tasted like chemicals and the other order was soaked in oil. Absolutely disgusting, and no one cared. Still got charged for both orders even though food wasn't touched. 
11949 4 Delicious lunch spot. Great, healthy options that leave you feeling full but not bloated, not stuffed. The smoky bowl is my favorite, I may be slightly addicted. Yummm 
11950 4 Fun atmosphere great sound system felt like I was at the game. Food was pretty good but I only got a pizza so interested in trying their other stuff. 
11951 2 We ate dinner here last night. The hostess was great, the waiter not so much! He was very unprofessional, awkward, and slow to attend to us when it was not very busy at all. Luckily our food was pretty good so overall our experience was okay. 
11952 4 LOVE this place! The service is great, the selection is great, I cannot say enough about it. My glasses were ordered on Saturday and they were there by Wednesday. 
11953 3 Good and tastey ! I'm not huge on the chicken 65, but the curries and dosas were a hit. And the sauces ! Chicken Britain was also good but not the top on my list of what we ordered. Eggplant and cauliflower dosas for the win 
11954 2 We had brunch there. The steak and eggs was good, a little on the chewy side but the portion was a little small. We also got the chilaquiles, it was more like brisket with yuca chip nachos. Not exactly what I expected but the meat was cooked to perfection. 
11955 4 Called them and spoke with store owner. He is a great guy - very nice and humble. If you want someone who will tell you what you you need vs selling you everything under the sun this is the store. Would definitely use again. 
11956 4 Long story short...incredible movie experience. Food was great, service was great, atmosphere was great; true definition of a five star establishment. 
11957 4 Really good food and service, had the Royal curry!! Will definitely be back again!! Small places like this are gems!!!! 
11958 3 I like the use of ingredients and combination of flavors Outdoor seating in nice EDM music was loud but I am a fan so it didn't bother me The smoke from the smoker was wonderful to me :) Will be back 
11959 4 Marie, the manager, made this experience right. Without going into messy details, Marie fixed the issue and remedied the situation immediately. I appreciate a manager who is willing to step up and make a situation right. Thank you and we will certainly be back. 
11960 0 They've doubled the price in the last year... only to cut the number of bounce houses in half. 
11961 3 This is one of the best sex shops in Portland. Although they have a limited selection of toys, they have a large selection of specialty clothing and lingerie. I'd say Spartacus ranks right up there with SheBop, and I'd recommend it before sending someone to Fantasy. 
11962 2 Came here for little steamed buns. Result, stay with steamed buns only because other stuff like soups and tofu dishes are horrible. The owner is pretty grumpy too. But it is a normal thing in Vancouver area Chinese places. 
11963 4 Great music, good food. I've only had brunch but French toast was delicious and the eggs Benedict with salsa and black bean special was my second time having eggs Benedict cause I don't like hollandaise. The salsa is a good substitute. Really sad they're closing next year. 
11964 2 I had expected a wider range of sushi lunch options, so i was a little disappointed with the menu, but the bento I got was pretty good. 
11965 3 Eating an El Cubano sandwich from Live Oak Market with a Dogfish Head Immort Ale. A highly recommended combo for flavor insanity. 
11966 4 Amazing southern food and great whiskey, bourbon and scotch selection !! The bar manager Rickey was so nice and helpful, recommending great flights, premium bourbons and food all while handling a busy bar:) great customer service!! Thank you guys and we will be back :) 
11967 4 This bakery is absolutely to die for. Everything I have had was delicious as well as high quality. I am positive the products they use in their food is unique from other bakeries and I believe the bakers created an establishing exquisite taste with their high standard caliber. 
11968 3 Had the Firecracker Shrimp appetizer as my meal. Really tasty! Good service. Party of six (4 adults 2 kids). Sat right away and Accommodated us by changing the TV to the game of our choice. Prices were in line with the caliber of food. Tavern Burger was a hit too. 
11969 4 Love love love their acai bowl! The best! It's a HUGE portion! Me and two other friends could barely finish the Large acai bowl haha. And the staff are really respectful to people. I wanna try their sit down big ass plate food next time I come! 
11970 4 Blown away by falafel platter. It's not reheated falafel. It's fried right before serving. Wow just amazing. Big portion, fresh and on a real plate. I'm glad I live close. 
11971 4 Creative offerings such as Campfire Mochas, KAhlua Lattes with Rich whole milk and my favorite creative favorite...Lavender Latte. I also frequent this Progress Ridge cafe sitting on the water for their killer breakfast sandwich. 
11972 0 Absolutely gross. I got two slices finished the first one out of pure barbaric hunger and tried to eat the second only to find a huge black hair in it. Stay away from this place. stay away 
11973 4 Was visiting in Columbus and decided to try out Scramble Marie's for breakfast. Went on a Saturday morning and it was absolutely delicious!! Would definitely go back 
11974 3 Our family loves these two dentists! So, so many "extras" for our convenience and for them to show their appreciation; our family highly recommends Dr. Mo and Dr. Rima Saleh! 
11975 4 Stayed close to Yan's--great food, everything was fresh even though I ordered fairly late on a weeknight. Very well priced--super friendly staff. A winner in my book. Large portions--ordered 3 dishes for just over 20 bucks and had my dinner for two nights. 
11976 3 I want to go back for the buffet!!! I like trying different foods, and this trip was no exception. I had the butter tea (definitely an acquired taste) and many other of their specialties. They are very friendly, and have books that you can browse about Tibet. Do it. YUM! 
11977 4 dogs dogs dogs, its all about the dogs. The burgers smell great too, but I can never bring myself to not have the hotdogs. This is paradise. 3 all round !!! 
11978 3 Been to a couple shows here...always a hoot! Be sure to bring cash for beer...adds to the amusement factor :P Visit Count: 2 
11979 0 Don't go if you have kids. We went and they refused to serve us because they had all the tables reserved in the family friendly areas and the manger was rude about it. 
11980 0 Have you seen Zootopia? The sloth? Yeah, you'll be dealing with that when checking out along with rude cashiers who hate their jobs. Dear Officemax, in a world of Amazon, online shopping, and customer-centric competitions how in the world do you stay in business?! 
11981 3 Easy going and friendly staff but professional and prompt. Had good experiences with both purchases and a bike repair. 
11982 4 Excellent food! Friendly atmosphere highly recommend the Italian Beef. Chicago dogs are great too. I thought their prices were very reasonable. 
11983 4 I cannot more strongly recommend a restaurant. Fresh, innovative food in a comfortable atmosphere. One of the best sangrias and desserts I have ever had!!!! Amazing service to boot!!!! Skip the tourist joints and take a short walk!!! You won't regret it!!! 
11984 0 Descent food but appalling service. Kimberly was very disrespectful, slow and was rude when we asked her to correct our order which came out incorrectly. The manager was equally awful. Never going to this location again. Unimpressed 
11985 4 Had to have my charging port on my iPhone replaced. They were quick. Works like a champ now. Would recommend. 
11986 4 Very friendly and inexpensive. They even had the prescription for our pet. Other places quoted us $140+ and would have to order it, Fairley's price was $30 and they had it in stock. AMAZING!! 
11987 4 I highly recommend contacting this business. Randy Kinnison has helped me tremendously. A man of integrity and very knowledgeable. For me, having confidence in people that I do business with is a must. You will not be disappointed. 
11988 0 5 cars from our group were broken into. No security cameras they said there was security staff but we saw none to speak of. Second year in a row this happened. Police say this is there normal beat on weekend mornings. Stay here at your own RISK!!! 
11989 4 great place, loads of fun. Would go there loads more times, all the shows were mindblowingly amazing. Wish i would've taken a video to show everyone. Loved it, definately reccommend it to anyone going to Orlando, Florida. 
11990 4 The quarter chicken meal with the sweet plantains is a perfect lunch or dinner meal! The combination of flavors and the white and green sauce really make this chicken, rice, and beans something special that you will crave and want again. 
11991 3 Small but interesting restaurant with loads of character. The owner is social and has many interesting stories about his heritage if you are interested. Authentic Japanese and Jamaican food on one plate. Unexpected but welcoming. 
11992 4 I have to say this place is a great dive bar. Awesome atmosphere, friendly staff and a surprisingly good draft beer selection. Make sure to check this out for the good cheap drinks and live music. 
11993 4 One of the better seafood restaurants in the city, certainly the best in the downtown core. Can get very busy so make a reservation! 
11994 3 We went for Sunday lunch and we ordered three dishes each. We were quickly served and the tapas exceeded our expectations. The calamari fritas was especially well prepared. The cheese empenadas were light and delicious. Definitely coming back.( used groupon ). 
11995 4 Mike was great ... knowledgeable and friendly. Scheduled an Appt for a tire change online, service was done ahead of schedule. Thanks guys! 
11996 4 Great place. They have two rooms which is nice, both pretty clean and not much smell. Instructors are superb. They know and they care. I went three times when I was in Boston- July, October and November. Good classes everytime. Thank you! 
11997 1 I came in during the evening there were lots of open tables and lots of staff. Staff took a long time to serve the patrons and they spent most their time talking to each other. The food was mediocre, had the calamari and salad. 
11998 2 Good pool and good food (since it came from the Sunset) in a neighbourhood filled with college types. I didn't find it too offensive or meat-market-ish despite some of the other places in the square. 
11999 4 Jay Semple in the body shop is awesome. I took my pampered Jaguar XJR there after being rear ended. The work was great. Can't tell there were any repairs. I hope I don't need body work again, but if I do, I will have Jay take care of me. 
12000 4 Stopped here for a drink. Staff could not have been nicer. Great atmosphere, great seating area outside with a view. Wasn't hungry but all he returning for food it looked great! 
12001 4 Ordered food to go.. the Clam Chowder soup was very tasty. However, I was more impressed with their services in their attention to details. To prevent spills, they wrapped the cup with Saran Wrap and reminded me where they placed soup in the bag.. Really awesome.. 
12002 4 Love love love this place! Food is so good and fresh, service is amazing and they also have a lot of plant based options for the vegan ones! 
12003 3 Busy location, but staff and baristas at this location always keeps line moving unlike the Assembly Row location. Place can be dirtier at times from the said busyness, but again, I've rarely had a bad experience here. I can't say enough about the efficiency of this location. 
12004 2 Happy hour specials were great and give you an opportunity to try a lot. Great options for someone who is a vegan or vegetarian. 
12005 3 I had higher expectations. On the other hand it helps to have a drink or two and run wild. It's a good idea for a larger group and make sure you eat before you get there. 
12006 4 This is my favorite place near the office. The food is fresh and amazing. Their guac is just the best. I love their burritos and the rice is so delicious. All around a great place to check out. Low price as well! 
12007 4 Both times I stopped by, the service was so attentive and kind. The food was fresh and tasted really, really good (New York and Ocean burger). I also walked out with information on the local areas vegan venues. Would definitely go again 
12008 0 Food amazing and service! But....Saw the bartender break a glass over ice and not clean out the bin. I couldn't see from my vantage point but i would have cleaned it out just to be safe. 
12009 4 Best Doughnuts in Portland! The staff is always friendly, and the flavours are always incredible--even when there are few. Avoid Thursdays if you're really looking to enjoy a good selection, since I've heard it's their busiest day. 
12010 0 Terrible tired store. Merchandise is out of date and they have a terrible return policy. There are much better places to spend your money and get customer service. 
12011 4 Oregons best ice cream shop! This ice cream is really good! It's worth a try if you are around the area The service is awesome Ice cream sundae is one of the best that we have had 
12012 4 I went yesterday for lunch with the wife and kids. I had an amazing omelet with a side of bacon and crispy home fries. My wife had a "Mail Man" salad that she loved. Food was very good and we have no complaints whatsoever. 
12013 4 Love coming to ginger for sushi and drinks, great happy hour specials. The symphony roll is my favorite roll of any sushi place in Boston. 
12014 4 Hands down the best breakfast place in the Portland metropolitan area.....its goooood. 
12015 3 The food was served super quickly. A great place to get in and out for lunch. Had the orange chicken (I don't know why more chinese restaurants don't serve it) and it was pretty good. Overall, I was satisfied and would return again. 
12016 2 Was a good hangout in downtown Richmond for Greek food. Now they are closing their doors forever as the owner is retiring. Last day open is June 11, 2016 
12017 4 We had a great time eating and drinking at this place! Great things to try, Greek burger, Paloma (grapefruit Margarita!) and truffle fries!!! Amazzzzze! 
12018 0 In a word... Nasty. Garbage was piled sky high on top of garbage can, and huge mess in front of soda machine. Never seen anything like this at a McDonalds and makes me wonder what is going on behind the counter. Oh yeah, and the employees are extremely rude. 
12019 4 Outstanding. Went tonight with my wife. Sat next to the kitchen. Loved it. Had the chicken dish. Wife had the pappardelle with vegetables. Excellent. Service was outstanding. Staff is friendly. This place is very good. Highly recommend. 
12020 3 The prices aren't the same online as in the store. Their lemon pepper wings are too sour, I had to use like 4 dips for a 10 piece. Relax on the seasoning my guy. They have the best fries in Orlando, they're curly fries are a tad bit too oily. 
12021 4 Great lil breakfast stop for a great sausage quiche and red currant tart. Place is high quality, legit German place. Seriously recommend this place as a good little slice of European pastries/tea heaven. 
12022 4 The best sushi in Austin. Great Saki based cocktails. Love the brussels sprouts. 
12023 4 Fire & Ice drink is AMAZING - Best brie i've ever had. Argula salad is also very fresh tasting and not too heavy on the stomach. They were also very nice to my friend on her birthday and gave her a free shooter 
12024 4 Shrimp and Grits! Amazing! Really cool place with a great selection of house made beers. Highly recommend. 
12025 3 Coming soon to Davis square, seems to be a new location of the downtown Shino express. Yippee! 
12026 1 This place has dead dogs all over the floor. Also they subject you to watching the Disney Channel at loud-enough volume, and when you walk in you can almost see clouds made of nail polish remover and acrylic dust. 
12027 2 Nothing spectacular for the high costs. Drinks were okay. Clam chowder soup was disgustingly cold with weird chunks of meats. Crab cakes were very good. For the overall high price, steer clear of this one. 
12028 4 Great for an after work treat! Relax in their living room with complimentary tea and snacks. Then a hot tub soak in their Italian grotto. Then a 50 minute massage with Jacquelina. So good and close! Right off Rt 128. 
12029 4 The chicken Alfredo is bomb & I also love the bare minimum breakfast sandwich. Great prices & you can add avocado for $1 
12030 4 you can get your cell phone, computer, or tablet repaired here. They also buy and sell electronic devices. they are your neighborhood tech team! 
12031 3 They have snorkel fins whereas Dick's across the street does not. Excellent selection of snorkel gear and water shoes. I used the Yelp checkin discount for $10 off. 
12032 4 Absolutely delicious! However, they need to turn the air cooler. Love the food though, especially their waffles! 
12033 4 This place is an absolute must when I come to Portland. The tamales are unreal, the quesadilla is mouthwatering, the drinks are strong; and it's all vegetarian! You're missing out if you haven't been here! 
12034 4 5 stars - great restaurant, quality of food, drinks, service, etc. I have lived on the North Shore my whole life and never knew about this place until a few months ago. The prices are a bit expensive but it is worth it for an excellent dining experience. Highly recommend! 
12035 4 Very good tasty food!!! Nothing more to say. I will return soon. I have eaten here 3 times the past few months and the food is the best. 
12036 3 I often pass this store coming from the street car going to the movies. I found a great little necklace there that I wear often. Lots of other nice, used things, and fun to browse. 
12037 4 I popped up shop here a couple weeks back & their brunch is on point! It was the perfect concept... a market and brunch. Try everything! 
12038 1 We are not a fan! Found the food to be boring and not a great value...decor was gross for this area, maybe in Montana. Found the portions to be small too. 
12039 4 Excellent Turkish food. I had the lentil soup appetizer and the lamb kabobs. Both were excellent, and the service was attentive and good. 
12040 4 My favorite high end sushi place in Boston. I love all the rolls. They are pricey, but in my opinion worth quality. Great romantic date spot of for special occasions. I love the ambience. 
12041 4 Free wifi, cozy atmosphere, and friendly service. Probably the best nonstarbucks coffee joint in the area. Had myself a fat peanutbutter cookie, was not dissapointed. 
12042 4 Absolutely delicious -- I recommend the tuna tartare, lobster tacos, and chop salad. For entrees, we had the sea bass and filet mignon (both were specials, not on the menu) and they were amazing! The service was spectacular 
12043 3 Good burger, good bar games, and good TV signal. 
12044 4 Bit pricy but a great experience for teens and up. Bring a camera or video recorder. Great views. 
12045 4 Wow!! This Place Rocks!! Such a New refreshing addition to the winter park food scene. Amazing Food &Outstanding quality. Drinks are crafted from scratch. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT ASAP!! 
12046 3 Good sea food. They have amazing melt-in-mouth scallion pancakes. We loved their spicy dishes. I wish the staff was more friendly. 
12047 4 High quality photography using top-shelf equipment. I was recently at an event and asked for a specially framed shot. It came out fantastic. Would definitely recommend. 
12048 3 We actually want to give a 31/2 stars but since it's unavailable, we picked 4 stars instead. Our food was delicious but service could be better. The host at the front door was a bit rude. Servers are nice. 
12049 3 Went in to grab a cup of coffee. Ordered a medium latte made by Gaby. She was so sweet, great customer service to match the great cup of coffee. Will definitely be heading back to try other menu items. 
12050 3 Not sure if any other reviewers have mentioned twitter. It is true that Dressew has no website, but they have someone amazing answering twitter questions - seemingly around the clock. @DressewSupply - seems to be working for them. 
12051 4 Il Terrazzo restores the balance on the waterfront with familiar faces! So happy to have you back on the esplanade. Great wines, great food, perfect location for an evening meal. See you soon, my friends! 
12052 3 Went here last night for a causal date night night. It wasn't too busy considering it was rainy and a Sunday night. Drinks are strong, service was pretty good, and food wasn't too bad. Their fried cheesecake is a must try. It's sooooo good! 
12053 4 I use to come here all the time even though it's about a 40 min drive away from me! One of my favourite places! I love the lights and music a lot. The owner is amazing and the hookahs never disappoint. I have brought my friends here for years!!! 
12054 0 I found the owner to be arrogant and not professional in any degree. The offices are An absolute pigsty. I would be embarrassed to bring anybody into that sort of environment. A very dismal experience. 
12055 4 Awesome. Had the ropa vieja. The restaurant came highly recommended and lived up to its reputation. 
12056 3 My husband and I stopped for lunch while out shopping. This our fist time at this location. It's much bigger than the location on Miami circle. We tried the chicken, salmon & spinach, Brussels sprout. Everything was really good. We've never had a bad meal. 
12057 0 Short.... Because this place isn't worth much. Delivery. Almost 2 hrs!!!!! Gyro was decent.... My sun chips came completely smashed. Wtf pita pit? 
12058 4 Happened to be staying down the street, and had to stop in! Tried the Mexican hot chocolate, Pb&j, and the Apple cider fritter. All were honestly amazing, but I think my favorite was the apple fritter, pretty awesome that the hard cider was from a local brewery! 
12059 3 Had dinner here at loving hut last month. They served us soup to start with(its free) and then we ordered spring rolls, sweet& sour nuggets, black bean sauce curry.Everything is just yummiest ever and its all vegan and fresh. Good service and good food. 
12060 3 No doubt about it...it's good eating! Favorite item is that delicious cornbread that's almost dessert. Go check 'em out and order the chicken and shrimp combo with the salad and cornbread. Enjoy! 
12061 4 Love this place! Great place for nails and waxing at affordable prices with friendly people. 
12062 0 WORST SERVICE EVER! I tried to buy a 30 dollar bottle, the cashier gives 10 dollars short of change, when I complain she denies it, and she refuse to check her tilt. I try to talk to other employees with no luck, they plainly stole 10 dollars in my face...... 
12063 2 The atmosphere is great for drinks but I'd say its a little overpriced for what it is. The poutine is good and worth it. I got the rabbit tacos and the rabbit was a little grainy and the tacos were basic. I think they could have been better. 
12064 4 Amazing! The fish was so fresh. The flavors in their rolls, poke bowls, and b-rittos are clean and delicious. Prices are very reasonable. I will definitely be going again. 
12065 3 This place is AWESOME. The food is good, the music is good, and the wait staffs are very friendly. Depends on which night you go, they have live music. It is loud enough to listen and not too loud that would interference with your conversation. Love this place! 
12066 4 Flowers exactly as described delivered the next day (on a Saturday). Glad to have found this local resource, the delivery fee is very reasonable, and there are flower options for a smaller budget. 
12067 4 Great coffee (delicious, balanced flavors, perfect temperature) and happy good people making it for you. What more could you ask? I don't coffee often but thus is my go to. 
12068 4 Very good coffe. Very tasty blueberry muffin. The best muffin i had. Very nice music. 
12069 4 Very good German food. Schnitzel is their specialty. I Just got back from Berlin last week, and this restaurant compares well against good restaurants in Germany. Rahmschnitzel was excellent. I had the wiener schnitzel and bratwurst combo plate and a pils. It was excellent. 
12070 4 Got a haircut from Wendy! I have been to a couple of barbers recently but she is by far amazing. I appreciated the time she spent on my hair and the detail. She is so sweet too. I will definitely be coming back to see these folks! 
12071 0 We love papa Johns. Used to come here every week for a year until we had an awful experience that they refused to acknowledge.This location is the worst, the employees are clueless. Try dominos on Airport Blvd. 
12072 3 beautiful girls not alot if fake plastic big tits like Miami it was nice to see REAL GIRLS. had a blast the drinks are weak bt the staff friendly and it was nice. 
12073 4 Delicious!! Chicken stock with pork slices. The egg was smooth and silky also. Probably my favourite ramen place in Vancouver. 
12074 4 Experimental restaurant for P. Terry franchise. Fresh ingredients. Wonderful guacamole. Pretty nice for the price. 
12075 4 Love this place but I think I already reviewed another East Street...how come there are two? huh, Yelp? 
12076 4 I decided to go on a limb and trust everyone else's reviews and I'm glad I did! Yes, the store-front could use some updating but these were really good wings. Definitely worth the stop! 
12077 3 It's true what other viewer say about wearing PJ. The place is decent and there was definitely a line on Sunday at around 11am. 1 egg, ham, home fries and toast $5. They also have oreo pancake. Coffee is decent. Omelet is huge. ~$8-10 Overall, good food and good service. 
12078 3 I'm not a fan of fusion food. But Minero's southern style mexican food is pretty good stuff. I enjoyed the hoppin' john burrito. 
12079 2 I think they can do a lot better. The laffas are served cold which was disappointing. I will stick with the bowl next time which looks easier to eat and healthier. 
12080 2 The food was good but over priced in every respect. Why do we we support snobbery. I would go to No No's Italian over this ... sans for Beautiful Katy in the Grill. Gorgeous and sweet lady from Amarillo. 
12081 4 My favorite place for a wintry day! Definitely get the short rib dinner and add the chinese traditional broth. Awesome Spicyness!!! Also good for an after-bar place! 
12082 3 I would give it four stars. The food is amazing however a bit expensive. Craft cocktails and a great atmosphere. 
12083 4 Small place but nice music and awesome staff and good crowd and awesome bar Different price for ground level and first level entry 
12084 3 This store has a large selection of quality dog and cat foods. Many brands are available that are hard to find at other area stores. If your pet requires a speciality diet there are many options available including dry, wet and raw. The owner is knowledgeable about her product. 
12085 4 First tacos in Austin and I could not have asked for a better experience. All the tacos were great and the Cowboy taco was fantastic. I loved Tacodeli so much I brought friends there for lunch the next day. 
12086 4 ice age takes me back to the Paleolithic times and truly, gives me an ice cool refreshment. 
12087 3 Great price for a nice sushi, sashimi, and kitchen menu. We had salad, shrimp tempura, several rolls, sushi and sashimi plus dessert. The total for 2 was $45. Not bad at all for the selections offered. Food was nicely presented and service was prompt and efficient. 
12088 3 Good beer, good food, good service, cool atmosphere. They didn't mind making room for a single and a kindle. 
12089 0 The rudest waitress or waiter I honestly couldn't tell. I'm adding to the many others who say the same exact thing here. The food is not good. This place is dirty. Go to Trinket instead. This place is GROSS. 
12090 4 Bacon Jam. What else do I need to say? The food was really good. The waitress and kitchen where very good With gluten free orders. The wine list was lovely and the service was really good. 
12091 2 Everyone tells me this the best pizza, but I am just not convinced. Sure, its cheap. For $2, you get a big slice. Its open really late too. But the best is really stretching it. 
12092 4 This bar was beautiful and the drinks were outstanding. Their tropical drinks are the perfect treat for any time of the day. The atmosphere as well as the service was a breathe of fresh air. Highly recommend Bar Miranda. 
12093 4 Love this place! Very consistent and not pretentious! Solid food and drink. And great staff! 
12094 4 Tacos are super yummy. Favorites are the chicken tikka masala and the paneer. The pollo was a little spicy. Unfortunately they had run out of falafel. Will be back! Highly recommend. 
12095 3 2nd time here in 3 months (i think). Their menu changes occasionally. I had the fish this time and it was great but wasn't enough to satisfy me. I meant it was small. Would've liked it better if it was bigger. 
12096 1 An ok place, staff are friendly but we were placed in an area that our server had with 2 large parties. Food came out at best warm and had to be sent back. Looks nice in presentation, fair in taste and a bit too salty. 
12097 4 Fantastic. Great cozy atmosphere, very good food. Had dinner with a client, perfect atmosphere reasonable prices. Staff was very good and provided great reccomedstions. 
12098 4 Very good. Super tasty. Cheap. Clean. Inviting ambience. Very knowledgable staff. I'll be back. 
12099 4 Great selection and excellent customer service. Our salesman, Jim Tyson, went out of his way to make sure we got what we needed. Very professional business and staff! 
12100 4 Everything about this restaurant is delightful, from the food which is wonderful to the service which is excellentc, and the ambience which is very French 
12101 4 Omg!! So good!!! The service was great! The chowder & crab cakes(broiled per server recommendation) was to die for! The jalapeños poppers were the best I've ever had & the my family loved their meals too. Very happy right now! Mmm...so good!! 
12102 4 Incredible burger, awesome service!! The burger is so juicy and cooked perfectly, the bun is soft and the toppings are tasty. The fries are yummy too! 
12103 4 What a fantastic place. Totally wheel chair accessible. It's been awhile since I've been here hope to come again this summer. 
12104 4 Yum! Sweet tater tots& entitled IPA. Fast service. Gotta try the burgers. Great location between Trader Joes and the Patriot cinema. Very convenient before a movie! 
12105 0 Stopped in for lunch and I will never again. The food was cold and the beer was warm. The service sucked. I would recommend going down the road sum place else. 
12106 4 We love this restaurant. Nice vibe, great sushi with gold leaf heheh and good service too :) 
12107 4 Absolutely love this place and yes it's a dentists office! Come and ask for Shanon, dont ask for anyone else as your higenist. Everyone here is pretty awesome from Rene and Douang at the front desk! Come see them! 
12108 4 Home cooked Gujarati food. Always tasty and great value. Verified as authentic by my Gujarati wife. We love it! 
12109 4 I ordered the Miso Ramen, it was generous, rich and incredible. Lovely dish and great service. Noodles were perfection and definitely house made. I will certainly add this location into my Ramen rotation. Well done! 
12110 4 Wife and I loved this place, pizza was FANTASTIC, thin crust made right in front of us, absolutely amazing place, great for date night. 
12111 4 Went with a friend. First time for both of us. Awesome atmosphere, live entertainment and food! 
12112 4 Same as all the other reviews. Fast, cheap, overall convenient and close to campus. Additional plus: the inspection sticker is burnt orange. They deserve 6 stars. 
12113 3 I take the family here whenever they are in town for a good breakfast. The pork chops and hashbrowns are exceptional and the coffee always hits the spot. One of the best breakfast spots in Midtown Atlanta. 
12114 4 Love their Shawarma bowls and their falafel is delicious! They do get super busy especially around lunch time, so calling ahead to place your order for pick up is the best way to go if you're stopping by during lunch 
12115 3 The salad bar and fruit are great!! So fresh and delicious! Only bad thing is I think I got some bad candy from them :p 
12116 3 Try the Korean lunchbox great way to experience a wide variety of different Korean dishes By far the beef was the best but the spicy pork was also very good 
12117 3 Right off of exit 41 on Route 128 this sandwich joint sports several tables and all around good food. Their staff is very friendly and the portions generous. If going with a friend split an order of french fries as they usually run on the large side. 
12118 3 Wow! What a selection! I took a tile that was 15 years old and they matched it!! I'll be back to do my backsplash. Nice and helpful folks!! 
12119 4 I'd have to say, I'm impressed!! I had mani-pedi with Moon. She took her time and did a fabulous job. I was very comfortable due to cleanliness and talent. I will visit here again for sure!! 
12120 3 Save room for Tres Leches. Alot of room. So good... Good food, thought the guac was ok, not best in town. The Elvis fried chicken is killer. Crispy, spicy, add some boom boom sauce. Done. They can turn tables fast, because the wait was the only thing preventing 5 stars. 
12121 4 Delicious! There was a bit of a wait but not too ridiculous. We had three different dishes, all of which were excellent. 
12122 4 Great place to go if you need sunglasses or glasses of any sort. Friendly and excellent service!! 
12123 4 The new location is: 12412 Limerick Avenue Ste 300 Austin, TX 78758 Excellent service! Anna hemmed a formal dress for me at last minute notice! Such a life saver. Plus, very competitive prices. 
12124 4 Awesome, great flavor great portions! Can't be the service!!! I love the il Greco calzone with egg plant added A treat to die for Dine in such home comfort service, delivery is beautiful hot food delivered with a smile, it was 95 degrees outside this past week. 
12125 4 Incredible beer list - theirs and others. Flights? Check. Food? Check Sit at the bar, inside or outside and you will be coming back again! Growlers? You betcha. 10 minutes from downtown hotels and well worth the trip. 
12126 4 Amazing coffe, delicious food, fantastic service. Try the nitro cold brew coffee! The cheesy tots are a must try! 
12127 4 This was one of the best restaurant experiences we've had. We did the tasting menu and were seated at the kitchen view. The food, service, and ambience were exceptional! 
12128 4 There are 2 pizza joints walking distance from my house but I go back again and again to Dedham house .best pizza around. .and the chicken wings not too bad either 
12129 4 I was skeptical about this place since most crepes left me wanting in the past. But holy smokes, it is so good. I got the machine but substituted green for banana peppers and added some remoulade sauce and it's freaking delicious. Plus the crepe is unexpectedly crispy and fresh. 
12130 3 delicious, I love, the ham and cheese, but I always get a sweet and one savory, the banana Nutella is amazing. 
12131 4 I have been coming here for years now with my family for the lunch buffet. The food is always fresh and consistent! My favorite is the coconut shrimp. The food and service here is always excellent. Will return here shortly! 
12132 4 The cusomer service and food was excellent!! I come here to get my buffalo burgers, and they are top notch burgers. This location was remodeled, so it looks real up to date in the decor department. 
12133 3 This restaurant is in a great little spot and they have excellent food! I got the shrimp teriyaki for lunch and it was heavenly! The teriyaki had the perfect spice to it and the prices were spot on as well. I can't wait I go back with my husband! 
12134 3 Love how they renovated the place! The service was very friendly and attentive, the quality and portions of the food were great, and the flan was *amazing*. We'll definitely be back! 
12135 4 Visited over the weekend and decided to give their mimosas a shot.. And all I can say is wow! Fresh pressed juice- now that's how every establishment should be making them. Sure it took a bit longer to prepare them by the pitcher for our table, but cmon, it's fresh! 
12136 4 Great potions. Legit Jewish Deli. Enjoyed breakfast and lunch here. Wish we have one in our area 
12137 3 Always good service and flavor. The owners are constantly supervising every little detail. 
12138 4 I've had nothing but positive experience with Dr. Kim and staff. Needed sinus surgery and all went well. Joseph the PA is very good and keeps follow-up moving along. 
12139 4 Salmon entree was amazing! We also tried the pulled pork lettuce wraps. Go to trivia on Monday nights with Andre. Great service and atmosphere. 
12140 3 Good food, good service! Nice little place. Friendly and clean. Consistent ly good... Try the Spicy Tuna Roll... Yum! 
12141 4 I recommend Gina to all my friends. Every person has thanked me raving about the massage and results. She is marvelous in every way. Gina penetrates energetically in a very deep way releasing tight areas bringing balance and euphoria. Plus she is a delightful person! 
12142 4 ummm if this was reviewed by um .... lets say ... someone name ... Shania Twain ...all she would say is this is a great place for slurpees and monthly bus passes ..... come ON!!!! 
12143 4 The location it's self is amazing. Loving the decor. As far as the food I don't have enough words to describe how amazing it was. I had the chicken and biscuits and couldn't get enough of it. Very large portion. 
12144 0 We came in at 9:50 and they told us they're closed and not taking orders Told her the website says you close at 10:30 she said no that's not correct!! Seemed she just wanted to be done and Go home early. Definitely Not going back. 
12145 3 Good food and even some options for vegetarians-- like the portabello arepas which are listed as appetizers but are big enough for an entrée. Service can be a bit hit and miss and they don't take reservations so not good for big groups. 
12146 4 Amazing catfish!! I have yet to have something here that I don't like.staff is amazing and they cater to a crowd that has a hard time normally ordering food (gluten free!!) keep up the great work! 
12147 3 Fried chicken is spot on! It's so juicy and tender with crispy flavorful skin/batter. The sides are okay, not the greatest. We also shared the buttermilk pie which was quite tasty. I would go back time and again for chicken breasts! 
12148 3 Good Greek style pizza. No problems. Nice staff. The salads are also good. If you want a thin crust, this place isn't for you. If you like a more hearty pizza then this is what you are looking for. 
12149 4 Flavorful, fresh, authentic, artful, delicious Greek food, served up by friendly people who are actually Greek, in a cute, sunny, homey atmosphere. Just go here, you won't be disappointed. 
12150 3 Nice guys, good service, very transparent and fair dealings. I've bought 2 cars from them and it's been a positive experience. The place has a nice family feel to it. Very satisfied. 
12151 4 The best breakfast! The line's to be seated can be long but that speaks for the food here. Awesome! 
12152 3 We stopped in here for a quick lunch. We went right as they opened and it was not busy at all. The pizza was good and satisfying. If you would like to hit a spot that is quick and filling, this spot is great. 
12153 4 So so so yummy!! Vegan food can and be amazingly delicious and these guys are proof of that. If you're vegan eat here if you're not vegan eat here. 
12154 4 My new favorite spot for a good burger, hands down. We've been here twice in the last couple of months, and I'm counting the days until we can go back again. I get the Stackhouse sliders, with onion rings and cilantro aioli. To die for. Cute space and vibe, too. 
12155 4 Great food and friendly staff. Shrimp grain bowl was delicious! They have a fun Traditional Tiki cocktail menu and the Mai Tai was really good! Will definitely be back soon! 
12156 4 Fast & Fresh! They really crank out the food. Nice to have a hot breakfast burrito that's not dried out. 
12157 3 Friendly staff, clean, cheap and quick lunch, and decorated nice. Nice crispy chips and tasty salsa, reminiscent of Chili's. I chose the shrimp nachos for a weekday lunch. The half portion was very filling. 
12158 4 Yes...I often go there drive thru. .The phillipine old lady...always remember my order..I like her smile 
12159 3 Used Sunrail for jury duty in Orange County. This station is only one block from the courthouse. So much better than driving in Orlando rush hour traffic. I highly recommend this as an alternative to driving to jury duty if you live anywhere near a Sunrail station. 
12160 4 had and awesome experience here today. Needed some supplies for my indoor winter growing and found this great spot. Matt was super knowledgeable about the products and offered help and advice for what I was trying to do. Great little shop for all your hydroponic needs 
12161 2 Tired and didn't feel like walking too far from our hotel. Stopped for dinner and we are not big on Franchise restaurants. Soup and salad with salmon. Soup was very good and salad was good. 
12162 4 I went for a groupon hair cut and found the service very professional. I would recommend Dino as he listened to what I wanted and did a great job of taming my curls. 
12163 4 Love the lean steak pho' and the chicken wings are to die for!! The staff is SO friendly here and I love the vibe.. looking forward to it being in my regular rotation. 
12164 1 $9+ sandwiches and only chips as an option for sides. Lack luster at best. I'm sure if you're drinking it is a pretty cool place to go as the bar inside is large and the indoor/outdoor bar would be nice for summer. 
12165 4 Good selection of beers. Good quality grilled cheese sandwiches. Would like to see some menu items that were less cheese and more protein, but hey, it's a grilled cheese restaurant. 
12166 4 I had "the burrito" chips with salsa and guacamole and everything was really good. Great food, great service! 
12167 3 Still a good burger, but the experience has started to slide. Lot's of signs with rules, limitations, etc. No more smiling server greeting you in line to get a drink order. 
12168 4 Ximena is amazing. She designed my tattoo to be much better than I could have imagined it and has been amazing to work with through the process. I would recommend her to anyone and everyone possible. 
12169 3 I come here often since it's close to my campus. I love the eel rice combo very much! Dining environment is also good! 
12170 3 I can't see my food in the dark.. but like the way the reflective light curls around Kate's face. The calamari app is a meal and thusly caused the global shortage of squid. 
12171 4 Very easy trail with multiple viewing spots. We went on a could day but still got some great views! A bit rocky so bring sneakers for sure. 
12172 4 Authentic hole in the wall type place. So so so good. My only complaint is the up keep of the bathroom is poor. Worth it. 
12173 2 Cool bar, great atmosphere... liked the multiple rooms with the old paint peeling off the wall and the aging mantle. No beer on tap here, only bottles. Otherwise a laid back place with cool bands. 
12174 4 Enjoyed the fried chicken and sides. Chicken had a little kick but was lightly battered and the sides were delicious, would definitely go back. 
12175 3 Above average food and good prices. I also had a peach Mojito, which was pretty good. The staff is friendly and check in often. I'll be back to try what looked like fried icecream :D 
12176 4 MOD is the best! We love their gluten-free pizza, unlimited toppings! Great staff and service. Danny is the best! Everytime we go there he remembers us, he is always positive, outgoing and super friendly! Our only go to place for pizza from now on! Thanks MOD! 
12177 4 HELPFUL. FRIENDLY. UNINTIMIDATING. FAST. I'll be back next year. 
12178 0 Only because -5 stars is not an option. These low-life's left us standing at the lot gate for over a half hour in -1 degree weather to pick up our car that was towed during Boston's worst winter storm to date. 
12179 3 Wonderfully tasty steaks and impeccable service. Au gratin potatoes weren't the best but the Lobster Mac n Cheese was phenomenal! 
12180 4 My favorite grocery store in PDX! Friendliest meat counter. Excellent food, happy and helpful staff. 
12181 4 Great coffee, nice staff. Coconut and almond milk options. No decaf option though. Good selection of pastries and breakfast sandwiches. They have a few tables out front to enjoy your coffee and people watching. Love it! 
12182 3 My husband took me there to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. And, I LOVED it. We had the ahi tuna tartare, bacon wrapped jalapeño, crab cakes, fried calamari and paella as an entree. Everything was delicious. Highly recommend! 
12183 3 I am a fan of the Döner Fries. The fries were fried fresh and topped with thinly sliced beef. The perfect size to eat with fries. Then the whole thing is topped with a cream & brown sauce. Tasted pretty good. Overall: might return if in the area. 
12184 4 Hidden gem! Pretty sure I just had the best artisan pizza without the lines. Perfect. Grab one and a beer from Scout across the way. 
12185 3 Good pho, and great location! Parking could be a pain but that's downtown Austin for ya... I used to go there for lunch all the time... 
12186 3 I had their latte. It was a flat white, so you know the baristas definitely know what they are doing, they are well trained. The smoothest, creamiest, latte...ever! I'd come all the way back for this. Not a lot of seating space however. 
12187 4 Picked up my tuxedo for a black tie event in New Hampshire. Nice, I was measured at the Boston Store and picked up in Woburn on my way to NH. Thanks guys! 
12188 4 For something completely different than the norm and yet very familiar at the same time Arapazo is fantastic. always quality. always fresh. can't wait for german village/brewery district location to open. 
12189 4 I have been coming here a lot since I like their products especially their sweets from different parts of the world and alcoholic beverages... The service is great, there is always some kind of a sale and the best part, they always have what I am looking for. 
12190 1 Being cash only makes this place a hard sell. I happened by once when I did have some cash and found the donut toppings stale and tasteless. The donut part was good, but not enough for a return visit. 
12191 4 Favorite pizza place and it's not even close. Hearth has amazing topping options and every pizza is a masterpiece, and the staff are awesome, I wish I could give more stars! 
12192 0 These guys are still rude idiots. Use the COOP for the free bathroom. Buy books through Amazon. 
12193 4 Richard had a complex AC problem diagnosed in less than 5 minutes. I was completely stumped, but he totally knew all the points of failure and we went through everything I had done and then he figured it out. Great service. Highly recommend! 
12194 0 I called over a week ago and left a message to schedule an appointment. My call has not been returned. I was looking forward to a nice treatment (per reviews here) in a convenient location but it appears I will have to look elsewhere. 
12195 3 The counter girl is always helpful. They have a decent selection of blunt wraps, but not the best. 
12196 4 If you are looking for the new amazing ramen joint then this is it. By far the best ramen in town. Less fatty than tatsu-ya and less salty than the others. Amazing broth and great staff. Also kid friendly. 
12197 4 Had the enchiladas and Chile relleno. Delicious!!! Excellent customer service, good food. Thanks Paradiso! 
12198 3 Dania....is to furniture what Toyota is to automobiles A little bit of something for everyone: Stylish but not too trendy Quality but not too expensive Nice but not top of the line Safe and comfortable but not too boring not that I drive a Toyota or anything.... 
12199 4 Definitely a great place to go for a good pizza, sandwich, or sub. Online ordering is very easy and pick-up is super quick. Great choice if you have one near you. Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza is one of the best ones I've had. 
12200 2 Average ramen noodle place. The spicy soup is not authentic; just a blob of paste in the center of dish. 
12201 4 El Leoncito is the best. We had some cuban food in South Beach and it didn't even compare. Love the chicken fajitas, palomilla, yellow rice, picadillo, etc. Margaritas are great! 
12202 4 Wow. This place was so good! The staff was very knowledgeable and polite. The chicken was amazing! I've been living in Austin 5 years and this was my first time there. We will definitely be back! Only downside is parking, but there is a parking garage close by. 
12203 4 Best Indian food ever! Everything was delicious. From pankoras, tandoori to saag paneer. Naan was flaky delicious! My new favorite Indian restaurant. 
12204 4 Simply the best food. Simple, wholesome ingredients. Also, I like that there is only one item, which can be modified slightly. It takes the guesswork out of choosing. Can't wait to come back! 
12205 2 The food was good quality and cheap prices- plus they deliver! We got the lamb vindaloo and it was tender and delicious...The service was excellent too.I'll def go again. 
12206 4 My friend recommended me to come here. I didn't know they have happy hour from 5 to 6:30. So that's a plus. All foods are great. My favorite was the jar jar duck and salmon on crispy rice. 
12207 2 Burger is decent, location is good and drinks are fine. Would get more stars is they had a more knowledgeable bar staff who were able to make drinks not featured on the set menu. 
12208 0 Do not visit this hotel during hot summer months. The pools get super packed with guests and locals and they get absolutely disgusting. You may even catch a disease. Try April, May or September but stay away during July & August. Everything else is ok, nothing extraordinary. 
12209 4 Wow! I just went to Craig for the first time and five days later, I'm still saying Wow! It's taken me a long time to find the right haircutter in Austin, but I am truly impressed by my cut. I love their bumble & bumble products, too. http://www.topazsalon.com/stylist.php?stylist_num=25#bottom 
12210 4 This was a great restaurant. My wife and I came to Austin, and wanted to try something new. It was very clean, and the food was magnificent. I would recommend the restaurant to anyone. 
12211 0 Visiting from California, walked inside with a party of 11, five of which were children. Server told us he was alone and could not serve us. Boy, business must be good. 
12212 4 For 25 years this was my favorite restaurant. Pedro knew us by name and always greeted my son.....can't say enough. They are bulldozing the building so the store closed, and there is no information about it! Where are you guys? Will you reopen? Please??? Help! 503 697 7116 
12213 4 Food is great! Drinks are great! Atmosphere is BEAUTIFUL. Try the Nutella Mocha if you're looking to satisfy a cold coffee sweet tooth craving or the Golden milk latte for a hot caffeine-free healthy vibe type drink (made with turmeric). Service is very friendly as well. 
12214 4 1st time eating here, and I was very impressed! Friendly staff and the food was delicious! Will be coming back to try more food and baked goods! 
12215 4 Went in a lil late but Sam still welcomed me and probably gave me the best hair cut I've had in awhile. Definitely recommend Sam/Freestyles! 
12216 1 Its good but the portions are tiny.. $8 for the avocado fries... 6 little pieces which amounted to literally one avocado.. 
12217 4 This was the best place we ate in Vancouver--or at least the most fun. I loved the needy decor and ample game selection. We had the potine app, BLT, and Storm Burger followed by the raspberry tart. All were excellent! 
12218 4 A fun and authentic atmosphere to enjoy Turkish dishes. We enjoyed the stuffed cabbages. The yogurt dip was amazing. 
12219 3 Loved the salmon entree & the blue cheese potato chips were excellent. Nice atmosphere & friendly service. I will return again! 
12220 0 I definitely went to Cherry Systems and was quoted an outrageous number for work they could not do properly. My yelp user name is short for my actual name, so no you haven't seen my yelp name as a customer of yours. But yes it was me. 
12221 3 Great menu, good atmosphere, lines are wayyyy too long for a burger though. 
12222 4 The Toasted Marshmellow yogurt was amazing!! I love the hidden pictures in the counter. The staff is always so nice!!! 
12223 4 Hands down the best ice cream I've ever tasted! I ordered the homemade cookies-n-cream and my wife had the cold brew coffee ice cream. What else can I say? Simply amazing! 
12224 4 A fashion find. Ever changing styles from evening attire to lounge wear to everyday must haves. Gorgeous accessories and gift items for all occasions. Looking for something uniquely you, this is the place to find it. The Staff is incredible, friendly with extensive fashion know how. 
12225 0 this is not real mexican food...watered down salsa with a buncha salt! Cheap but not good. I got tacos and they sucked. sorry but it's the truth. 
12226 3 Thank goodness for this place. There's just enough variety for each grilled cheese option that you'll be happy with no matter what what your order is. Sola AM is a great breakfast one. 
12227 4 They did a great job cleaning my kitchen tile floor. Very nice tech, too. Would use them again. 
12228 4 Zack made a great Bloody Mary today for my wife and I after we got in a few holes of golf. 
12229 0 Got a burnt bun. Wtf. The bun was also crusty and stale. It wasn't good at all, if I wanted shit food I would have gone to burger king 
12230 3 Great place to grab a quick meal. The food is pretty good, service has always been great, prices are very reasonable. I usually get the salmon bento box... Very tasty. 
12231 3 Great drinks and service, food has strong flavor profiles. The Cuban Benedict with mustard hollandaise was perfect. I wish they had Diet Coke or fresh grapefruit juice but my mimosa was tasty. We came with a party of 10 and the service was exceptional. 
12232 4 The wait is definitely long because they are very popular, but it's worth every minute! The punany wrap is addicting. Sometimes I find myself going 2/3 x a week. I always get mixed(60% spicy), I've been told that just spicy might be too much. Definitely recommend 
12233 4 Really great sandwiches, and I mean really great, and a great atmosphere. Service was pretty great too and they were slammed. Good vegetarian options too, not a ton, but pretty good. Awesome spot. 
12234 4 Best restaurant in the Boston area -- not just in Concord -- by a long shot. 
12235 1 Make sure you tally your order yourself. Last couple of visits they have charged me $3-7 dollar extra on my bill!!! I'm sure this happens a lot and it's very unfortunate especially when they write your receipt in non English format. 
12236 2 Pretty good property with a freidnly staff and large, clean rooms. Not really close to any great dining options and the ones on the property are mediocare at best. Fitness center was large, clean and well appointed. 
12237 4 Omg. I'm from New Jersey and we know pizza. I need this guy to come to jersey and show my pizza guy how to do it. The bruschetta was amazing, the pizza was spectacular. I've never had crust done to this level of perfection. Come here. 
12238 0 Came in towards the end of the lunch buffet. Couple of hours pass and I'm puking yellow goop up on the side of the road. Must have been a meat dish because my vegetarian friend is fine (he said it was good). 
12239 4 The quality of bahn mi pork and tofu always has been flavorful and consistent! The spring rolls are a must because their spicy peanut sauce is ADDICTING!!! Since it sits in the back of cheer-up Charlie's you can have a dos xx with whatever you order! 
12240 4 Great establishment. One of those places to forget what happened last night. Bad breakup? Dead dog? No problem. Hong Kong takes all your worries away. BEWARE OF CHICKEN MAN. 
12241 4 Went there with the family on a Sunday night for Lobster. Two lobster tails, plus all the "fixens" for $20.00!! Can't beat that!! Loved it... 
12242 4 This place has been absolutely flawless every time we have gone. It is incredibly delicious and I couldn't even think of a bad thing about it if I tried. Friendly staff, fast service, over the top flavor. Go now. 
12243 4 Service was great, food even better. Cute bartender also. I had steak fajitas. I will be back! 
12244 4 Love the doughnuts! They always have a great variety of specialty and normal flavors! 
12245 4 Awesome food and the people who work there are really friendly. You can eat inside at the small counter or you can order at the window. Either way it's speedy service and it's delicious. 
12246 4 I ordered some tires from TireRack and had them installed by Wheel Medic. They were able to mount them the day they were delivered. They were quick, professional, and very courteous. I would come back. 
12247 4 Super friendly barista. Turned me on to oat milk, since they didn't have skim Liked it better than soy or almond. Love their policy of pay what you can. Especially helpful when facing lots of medical bills at Florida hospital. 
12248 4 The food was delicious. I love how customizable the bowls are. My server Jennifer made sure our table was clean and did a great job checking up on us! Would eat again! 
12249 3 Very good italian food. I got the short rib pasta and it was fantastic! 
12250 2 Great staff and location...food was just ok. Highlight was the steamers, large & fresh! Naked lobster roll disappointed as the meat was very shredded, no chunks..kind of dry. 
12251 4 The Red Velvet Waffles and Buttermilk fried chicken are incredible. great spot with live band in Thursday Friday and Saturday. Check them out 
12252 3 Always good dining experience and fresh sushi. Recently had lunch there, great sushi, and speedy service during the lunch rush. Overall we've ordered sashimi, tuna kabachi, godzilla roll, katana roll, dynamite hamachi roll, and fried ice cream. 
12253 4 Empezamos dándole gracias a Sreven muy amable y con un servicio de excelencia y para que más la comida súper rica y con el mismo sabor de típico Colombia. 
12254 4 This place is super cute I know it's not in the best area but the tacos are to die for. I came here for lunch with my mom and sister for the lunch special 
12255 4 Great atmosphere, excellent appetizers, fantastic drinks and professional friendly staff. Definitely recommend!!! 
12256 3 The Silk Weaving Studio has a beautiful selection of silk products, from finished pieces to yarn. I choose two 100% silk skeins while I was there and am very excited to start knitting them. My only complaint was that it was a little pricey. 
12257 3 A little bit of a wait, but the food was well worth it! I had the pork with red beans, yellow rice, and plantains. It was amazing! My boyfriend had the same but with yuca, the sauce on the yuca was soooo good! We were too full for dessert. 
12258 4 Mr. Teslim is a great barber and now that I'm back in Atlanta, I'll be going back ASAP. 
12259 4 I love this place! I have had the bento box, both the salmon and chicken varieties, and each were excellent. But, last visit, I asked them to recreate a sushi roll I had at another restaurant, far far away, and they made it even better. Kudos kudos kudos ! 
12260 4 My favorite bar!!! If you ever get Laura as your bartender, tell her she's wonderful and have her make you a liquid marijuana shot 
12261 2 We saw a good amount of Portland, and the Segway ride was fun. But the guide gave almost no information on the city, and we just got a lot of info on segways. Book with another company. 
12262 4 Love this bank!! The staff is the best and they always take care of my needs! Second to none with great service 
12263 2 Lovely setting - the fruits de mar was outstanding the rest was ok but not spectacular. The presentation was impeccable but for the $ I would rather have spent it on something else. 
12264 4 Definitely a fun spot. Bartenders are all awesome people. It's gotten a lot better since the grand opening. Recommend the ribs and warm potato salad. Soooo good!!! 
12265 0 The ramen was way too oily. It wasn't served hot enough either. I'm rather disappointed. I love my ramen but not at this place. 
12266 4 Lunch for one! Had the tofu pad thai, medium spice. Really yummy! Spice on fleek. Paired with the house red. Yum. They start you with some veggie broth. Love it. 
12267 4 Wow. Came to get my Passport photo and I was in and out within 10 mins. Tom was extremely helpful and helped my verify my application. He says it's a great place to work and I agree!! We need more Tom's in the world. 
12268 4 This is authentic Mexican at its finest. We go there often and the food is absolutely unbelievable. It's our Mexican go to from now on, no other place compares. 5/5 
12269 4 Great food and service. The calamari is beyond amazing. I can eat that all day, everyday. The service is always good. 
12270 4 If great tasting food, genuine & friendly hospitality are what you look for in your dining experience this is the place. If ever in the Atlanta area, do yourself & taste buds a favor and eat DAT FIRE Jamaican food. Enjoy!!! 
12271 4 Great food and great place to watch sporting events. The chili cheese tots are to die for. Ask for Christian!!! 
12272 4 This is an amazing restaurant- I've had just about everything on their regular menu, and never had a bad meal. Every time we have guests from out of town, this is the first place they want to eat. Excellent service and excellent food! 
12273 3 This place is great! I wasn't sure what to expect as it's a replacement of Bar-BQ-Bar but it's still the same great place with an awesome staff, cheap drinks and good vibe! Love it! 
12274 4 Another great experience watching BYU play Portland. I think I'll make it an annual activity. I had alot of fun. 
12275 4 Food was really good and fresh! Seasoned wonderfully. I really enjoyed the courtesy that this family owned restaurant showed during my visit. The service was prompt and fast! Make sure to order naan - you won't be disappointed. 
12276 3 Irresistible almond croissant and delicious cafe au lait. 
12277 0 Been here twice before. First time with a fly in the soup base...decided to give it another shot yesterday and the waitress gave me the wrong bill. Staff aren't very friendly either :/ 
12278 2 Service wasn't the best, but the food was good. The fried shrimp was great and the coleslaw was an unexpected surprise. 
12279 2 I had dinner here tonight. Food is pretty good. The space is big and open. Good for a quick bite to eat, but not really my scene for drinking. Maybe I am not a thinking woman. 
12280 0 Gave it two chances. Slow service both times and everyone left with an upset stomach both times. 
12281 2 The food is okay and I never seem to get good service here. Most of the time our server forgets we exist-- even if there's only five tables with people. 
12282 4 Best fast casual restaurant around. Tons of food for a great price. Healthy but filling. 
12283 4 Very nice Thai restaurant in a quite neighborhood. Liked it from the beginning - they brought chilly fish sauce with the food. This is exactly how they serve food in Thailand. Food is really good - spicy and flavorful, as it should be. Very friendly staff. Definitely will come again! 
12284 3 Pretty darn good deal for inside Disney. $10 for a meat lovers pizza and caesar salad. Not a lot of meat on the pizza but it was decent. The 4 stars is based on location comparison and price. 
12285 3 Tried the red velvet chicken and waffles and strawberry stuffed French toast. Both were great and delicious. The waffle didn't taste like red velvet but, the chicken was seasoned to perfection!! I think I may have to tell my mom I found someone that makes chicken better than her! 
12286 3 They make a pretty decent New York style pizza here. Get the Classic Pizza with the one sauce I think it's the best. 
12287 4 Yup, I like it! A toasty sandwich made fresh for you with super friendly people behind the counter. Try the cookies! Co-workers keep telling me to try the chili too. 
12288 4 This store's location is extremely convenient and they have an ample selection. The staff are also very nice. 
12289 3 I've been there twice now. Great food and service in the bar area. You can watch sports in there also. 
12290 4 Amazing pasta! DIY! Service is amazing. Would definitely recommend. It is quick service, you pick what pasta you would like and 6 ingredients to go with for $9. They also cook it infront of you. The employees are very friendly. 
12291 4 I absolutely adored this place! Such a wide selection of sauces to pair with their perfectly crafted fries. The beer selection is impressive, and I hear that they make beer milkshakes in the fall! I'll be back soon! 
12292 0 Too many rules, surly staff, average beer. Felt like I was having a drink at a convent. 
12293 3 The yogurt wars continue. After trying samples, settled on the taro, cheesecake, and blueberry. Yummy stuff that will run you around five bucks. Do enjoy. 
12294 3 great kept-cold cupcakes. love the lemon blueberry, any chocolate variety , + red velvet. random mixed cereal rice krispie treats are fun, ex. the ones plus fruity pebbles. 
12295 2 Small Thai restaurant more suited for some good take-out in the Quincy area. Great service with really friendly people. Great Pad Thai. 
12296 0 I work near this restaurant location. This is by far the worst experience ever with a McDonalds. The service is always bad and the food is horrible. 
12297 3 Great, reliable spot in a convenient location. Reasonable prices and consistent service. The menu is big enough to find something whatever mood you're in and small enough to not seem intimidating. 
12298 3 Great ramen and great price! I got a level 3 spice which was way too hot! I love spicy food so be careful. But I couldn't stop eating it, it was too delicious. 
12299 4 Jesse and Ashley do an awesome job w gels and give the best pedicures. The place is just a little expensive but totally worth it. Getting a pedicure as we speak.... It's so relaxing .... zzzzzzzz :) 
12300 4 Best maple bar I've ever had. I will definitely come back. Don't go at night time, it's packed. 
12301 4 Found this place driving down Congress. We took a chance and it paid off. The food was so tasty! Black beans and rice up there with places we've been to in Florida. 
12302 2 It's ok. Pretty good flavors but they can't decideto be Thai or Vietnamese. Fusion equals we don't do any one style wrll 
12303 4 Have eaten there multiple times. Eggplant parm remains my fav. Never been disappointed with my meals. 
12304 4 We started with 4 stars because the food and service were great but the decor is very mid range ... then we had the Creme Brûlée and the rest is history A KILLER ! Make sure to have one, or two 
12305 4 Wonderful historic place. The crab cake blt and Bloody Mary was a fantastic combination. I highly recommend after walking the freedom trail. 
12306 2 Love this place! Only 3 stars because it is very casual (which was just what I was looking for). Cranking music, outside tented with picnic tables. Great food, atmosphere, and local beer. So much vacation fun! 
12307 3 A great little place with authentic Turkish food. Having grown up in Europe this place is very reminiscent of quaint restaurants in cute little towns. Love it here 
12308 1 FOOD IS GOOD SERVICE IS POOR. Walked in and ordered food. 35 min later (and 12minutes past closing time) still no food. I ask about the food and employee asked what was ordered -_- she then leaves returns with the food. No apology, no remorse, just hands the food over. 
12309 2 Pro tip: A great place to pick up unique sale items. When items are on sale here, they're really inexpensive. Also go late at night before they close and you'll avoid the pitfall of a small store packed with other customers. 
12310 4 I love the Thai food here, specially the combination beef noodle soup, yummy. It's a small place, but the foods are very reasonable price. 
12311 3 Went back for lunch. Yep, it's definitely our new lunchspot. The shio ramen with pressed sushi (mackarel) was SO FREAKIN GOOD! Oh mah gah. I love. I love. Never going back for dinner (too many people go). Only lunch. It's more than enough. 
12312 4 We just went and tried their mega meat challenge. Great pizza, but the challenge is almost impossible. Really friendly and helpful service. Will definitely be back. 
12313 4 Cowfish is one of my favorite spots to eat. Especially since I work close by. I love the bergushi and there service is amazing. Oh and they also have great burgers and sweet potato fries. 
12314 4 Never a disappointing meal here. Tons of food, super cheap, even makes my veggie friends happy. Buddha's Delight truly is one. 
12315 4 I love how they have two soups each day. It got me to try something new. I went on Sunday and grabbed the Vietnamese Turmeric Noodles Mì Qung. Yum! The soup was delicious and needed no further seasoning. And the best part was the food was not super salty! 
12316 3 My favorite fried chicken spot in Austin. Crispy, flavorful and moist chicken I've tried just about all the sides, all good! I recommend to friends and family whenever they come to town. Worth the price. 
12317 4 This is our go-to Mexican spot. Get the fajita chimichanga and then smother it in their hot red and green sauce. I'm drooling just thinking about it. 
12318 0 Great food but, when your sitting there and a cockroach comes running down the wall it makes me think of what I just was eating. 
12319 4 Why has the banana cake, my absolute fav, disappeared from the menu! 
12320 4 Like another reviewer, I am surprised at the negative reviews. I've been here twice and had a pleasant experience both times. Didn't have a long wait, salon is clean and attractive, nail techs are friendly and nails looked great. I will be back. 
12321 2 Frustrated this time.. they were out of everything. Made a special trip and ended up being a waste of time 
12322 3 Nice Korean food that you would expect only from an unknown aisle in Seoul. Great experience and very friendly staff. Will definitely go back for more authentic korean food. 
12323 2 I like this place, I do. But would come more often if: - Lighting was better (after the sun sets, plenty of natural sunshine otherwise) - Music didn't include advertisements - The iced green/black tea was made with less hot water, so that the green tea didn't get so bitter. 
12324 4 Love nick's! Best beefs in the north shore! Highly recommend thi place to anyone who has not tried it yet. You need to try a beef sandwich! 
12325 4 One of my favorite pizza restaurants.. authentic Italian pizza that has been around for decades. Super friendly atmosphere. Staff is very friendly and take care of you. Highly recommended. 
12326 3 Pizza was really really good!!!! Clam chowder was good as well. The service though was amazing!!!!!! That alone makes me want to head back. I had the fish and it was ok.. I would definitely return and order something else from their menu. 
12327 4 Found this spot as we looked for lunch near kits beach and all I can say is awesome. The pastas were perfectly cooked and full of fresh flavour. Price was more than reasonable. Recommend this spot a million times. 
12328 3 It's my first time come here and I absolutely love here! I ordered the Magic Mushroom, the sauce, cheese is so great. Not a favor of meat. 
12329 4 Love this place. Delicious comfort food, always have a great meal here. Homemade rolls and dip are a plus. New renovations really opened the place up and improved the atmosphere as well. Plus they have parking! 
12330 3 When I first moved to North Austin, I didn't know where to get my hole-in-the-wall Mexican breakfasts that I so desperately need on the weekends. Truth be told, I do miss Habenero, but I really like Los Jaliscienses for its convenient location, value, immediate seating, and gut-splitting breakfast plates. 
12331 4 The pizza was hot, fresh, and tasty and the service was awesome. Our server Gabrielle was very pleasant, informative, and gave us great suggestions. 
12332 3 I thought the pho here was pretty decent. I enjoyed their flavorful broth however, I thought the noodles were a bit overcooked. I regret not trying the fried rice since that was recommended by a couple of people who have been here. 
12333 3 My favorite Ethiopian restaurant in Atlanta. They have the best customer service and the food is not only delicious but affordable also 
12334 4 Always good! Order carry out from here regularly. Food quality consistently good, all special requests cheerfully honored, staff is very friendly and efficient. 
12335 4 I'm from Xi'an and haven't tasted anything like the real thing until I came here! Better than the one in NYC. Good job guys and continue the hard work! 
12336 4 This place always exceeds my expectations of coffee. The staff and owner are very friendly, and will always give a great recommendation if you don't know what to order. Quality coffee, quality teamwork and quality business. 5+ thanks for the great coffee! 
12337 4 My buddy and I went to watch football and it was fantastic! Our waiter was really friendly and checked up on multiple times. The wings were delicious and I was happy they had every NFL game playing on Sunday. I will be coming back! 
12338 4 I miss this place with all of my stomach. Friendly and prompt service, and AMAZING chips and salsa. I heard that it closed because of the owner's health, best wishes to the family...but I'm still hoping they will re-open in the future! 
12339 2 Oh, the Atomic Cafe. Home to funky art students, cute boys with glasses, french sodas, memories of acoustic folk/rock/funk shows and fine retro decor. It's a fun place to stop by if you're in Bev'ly. 
12340 4 Nice views of the Boston area. Make it a point to come here at least once during your stay in Boston. Go up to Top of the Hub for dinner or a drink! 
12341 0 Not a good gym! Equipment types are very limited. Staff are unfriendly. This is great place if you are over 60 years old. It is clean though! 
12342 4 Grande Pike-ohhhh!!!! Love the Japanese woman that works here. Very nice staff. 
12343 3 After a loooong wait, perfectly prepared fried chicken with tasty greens, best in class mac n cheese, delish corn muffins and above average additional sides. Lemonade not from scratch and service a little hot and cold. Would definitely return, but probably for pickup. 
12344 3 I've been visiting Rimsky-Korsakoffee for 22 years. It hasn't changed much. The service can be iffy but the atmosphere is vey "Portland" and the coffee and desserts are tasty. 
12345 1 Placed an online order. In the instruction box added that we needed ketchup, utensils and a specific dressing. They delivered with none of that. One dressing for two salads too. No ketchup for fries and no forks for our salad. Thanks -.- 
12346 1 Nice place and friendly staff, but $6.50 for an iced latte? Yikes. 
12347 2 Standard Golden Corral fare. It's a clean, very busy place to eat and the servers are good. 
12348 0 I just left store after going all the way through it without one person asking if I needed help. Of course there was an attractive lady who followed after me who received service right away. This is a customer no service store. 
12349 4 Fresh and lovely atmosphere in the heart of SoCo. The blackened tuna tacos are AMAZING. Good service, although there is usually a wait. As long as you aren't in a super hurry, just grab a drink at the bar, and enjoy the people watching. 
12350 4 Great food! I ordered my dish with white meat and it was skimpy. Meanwhile the other people st the table had portions three times the size. Otherwise all very tasty and reasonable. 
12351 3 Good breakfast for a reasonable price...clean and great service...both Columbus and Phoenix locations have treated me well! 
12352 4 Great bkfst! Try the eggs potatoes and bacon! Hmmmmm we were in Vancouver for a couple of days and so far the best meal of our visit!! So now we're off to sea Alaska here we come. 
12353 4 I love and appreciate the artistry of this gorgeous Park! 
12354 4 quick good service! owner was very accommodating with something i wasn't sure could be done :) 
12355 4 My family and I had been craving Filipino food for the longest time. I reached out to my Filipino friends for the best Filipino restaurant. They all suggested here. We were not disappointed. It had a home cooked meal feel and the food was amazing. Get the garlic rice! 
12356 3 $2.50 pints of great Oregon beers! My server helped me choose one I liked with descriptions and free samples. The gnocchi was tasty, but a little too oily. Sat with my laptop and a book for an hour and a half without being bothered. Will definitely return! 
12357 4 SO delicious!! All the cupcakes we tasted were amazing, our personal favorites were the peanut butter ( charlie brown) and the lemon doodle. Took a dozen mini cupcakes to go, and we cant wait to come back. P.s. service was fantastic as well! 
12358 4 My go to for lunch at work! I order online and pick up! Great service and food is always on point. 
12359 1 I never got into this grease fest little place. The sandwiches were ginormous but not in that awesome way that makes you want to fight the capacity of your stomach until every last bite is gone... They are just big and greasy. 
12360 3 As a barbecue aficionado it makes me happy to have a top 3 BBQ joint right around the corner from work. Service can be hit or miss, but the food is always killer. Brisket is my fave, ribs are always awesome! 
12361 4 Breakfast in the form of tacos??? Genius. I love the vibes of this place and the food. So cute and hip and delicious. 
12362 2 My friend had a birthday party here Saturday night and it had a great crowd. They have two levels and it's a standard pub with several full bars. 
12363 4 Very unique rolls and "other" meal options. Had sashimi and eel dragon roll. The sashimi was very fresh and bigger than normal cuts. The eel was some of the best I've had. Will return to try other options and suggest you check it out. 
12364 0 entered park with clear skies got to the water got kicked out due to storms in the vicinity. didn't get refunded. total time in park 15 min. just salty ig 
12365 4 Great good and drinks happy hour margaritas only 4 bucks. Very quick for lunch. Server and bartenders are great. I love to sit at the bar and enjoy drinks with chips and salsa 
12366 4 Seafood puff (crab wontons), spring rolls and shrimp Lo mein were amazing!!!! The service was great also, ordered and ate within 30 minutes of being seated. The only negative I experienced was beer selection- only Kirin, Sapporo or Bud light. Would definitely go back if I lived in Austin 
12367 4 Amazing food and service , good coffee also Get in early as the lines can be long But well worth the wait 
12368 4 Delicious coffee and a great atmosphere! I'll need to come back to sample the MANY enticing small bites so well displayed. 
12369 4 Well done you guys! The quick service deli of my dreams! My two year old even loved it! Ps. The nutty flavor in the ravioli? How lovely. 
12370 1 Total "HYPE" and overpriced! Not terrible but many on the dishes and sides dont go together well. For example: Scallop wrapped in prosciutto with kale chips and tomatoes? Kale and tomatoes seem like after thought adds nothing. Food under seasoned! 
12371 4 Hands down the best deli in Austin. Amazing food, & great service. The Sloppy Joe is so good I drive up from Slaughter Ln to get my fix at least once a month. 
12372 0 Chili is disgusting, steak is dry, nachos are gross, pulled pork is mediocre. Nuf said. 
12373 0 The bartender was a total douche, seemed annoyed and snobby, not going back to this place for sure 
12374 4 Delicious ice cream and amazing prices on Quest bars! They have a really good selection of toppings, and the free sprinkles on Saturday are great. Also, I got to talking with the owners and they are very helpful and attentive. Great little find! 
12375 4 One of my favorite places for tapas with friends! Their drink selections are great too. I really like the new Amsterdam location which has more parking. 
12376 3 Had a grisselly piece of meat and our waiter Rick took care of it, brought a perfect filet and treated me to a birthday desert. If you've never been go. This place is great get the filet and the sweet potatoes. 
12377 4 Went there for take out yesterday. Food was good, prices were good and waitress who took our order was pleasant, helpful and friendly. I liked the atmosphere inside very much. I'll eat in next time. 
12378 4 Lovely! My husband and I were in from out of town for a night and tried this out. Food was delish - lots of vegetarian and non veg choices. Good music, quaint and locals only feel. Very affordable. Beer selection was a little limited- but the Ginger Collins was nice. 
12379 4 Service was fantastic, and the food surpassed expectations. We had ceviche with one of the best scallops we've ever tasted. Sangria was not too sweet. Paella was delicious. Great place for date night! 
12380 3 Amazing time with the kids. I also jumped and felt like I lost a pound or two. 
12381 4 Every time I come in the guys are so friendly.... Have been taken great care of by James, Christian, Gabe! Everyone is great but these guys are always going above and beyond they make me keep wanting to come back with their great suggestions..... 
12382 4 The staff are lovely as is the food and service. This Restaurant does so much for the community of Mt Dora. Great atmosphere, romantic waterview dinning, music and good cheer at the friendly bar run by Mike the best bartender in mt dora. Highly recommend. 
12383 3 I'm a picky eater and this was my first time trying Tibetan food, but I loved it and have come back a few times since. I tried momo, spicy chicken masala, spicy beed shapta, and shamday. 
12384 4 Some dam good donut. It so good.. I got problem to fly to Portland to get more.. Even got a freee donut.. bonus star.. 6 stars for me.. 0_0 ****** 
12385 1 Historically a good automatic car wash, but lately the quality of the wash has gone down tremendously. The bugs on the front of my car look like I never went thru the wash when I go through it. Hope it gets better. 
12386 3 Very good ramen! Would give 5 stars if not for the cash only and the usual wait required to get a seat. However I've seen people order it out so I might have to try it! 
12387 4 We bought the Groupon awhile back and finally used it tonight. I didn't expect much but this place was amazing! Restaurant is really small but the food was amazing!! Full of flavor and real authentic. The employees were real friendly and nice. 
12388 4 I like the man's man burger. 
12389 0 I work down the street from this "restaurant" (to use the word loosely) and have tried their food 3 or 4 times. Each experience was worse than before. Unsanitary, often undercooked, strange tasting and totally unpleasant. Avoid at all costs! 
12390 4 So delicious and amazing service. Our waitress was Koko and she struck the perfect balance of personalism and professionalism. The food was incredible but it was really the service that put it over the top! Sangria Rita and any type of enchiladas are a win. 
12391 4 Fantastic traditional Puerto Rican home cooking. You have to have tast for home cookin! Love it!!! 
12392 4 Darren has been to our house 3 times to fix appliances and always does a wonderful job. He does a great job of explaining what he will be doing and why it needs to be done. He has successfully fixed our appliance problems 100% of the time. 
12393 4 Go see Rubin. Very professional service and amazing food! Second time in 15 years to visit here. I miss good service in Austin! 
12394 4 Despite being in the corner of a strip mall, this coffee spot has an inviting and exciting atmosphere that just makes me want to keep coming back. The staff was really nice and the coffee was great. 
12395 0 $110 for two tickets to a show I usually pay maybe $75 for, $20 parking, $25 pedicab ride because they make you park so far away, $10 beer, $4 water... See the theme? Austin has plenty, and much better, venues to see music. Last time I come here. 
12396 3 The food was great. We had the chorizo omelette with guacamole and salsa, the peach waffle and a cinnamon roll. Service was a little slow, but they were packed when we went. The staff were all very friendly and nice. Great place for breakfast. 
12397 4 Amazing place! Menu is very simple and the food is flavorful. The chicken and Kafta were great! Definitely coming back. 
12398 4 I really enjoyed the food here and the opportunity to speak Creole with everyone there. 
12399 2 Decent convention center. Staff was helpful, building was clean and well lit and the center itself is conveinetly located. 
12400 4 What else can I say that hasn't already been said? Good with friends and get Das Boot. 
12401 3 The food here was quite good. Got sushi to start - fresh and delicious. Pad Thai was great, as was the Kim Chi fried rice. We'll go back! 
12402 3 This place was great! Fresh fast and really tasty. They take pride in their service and food! Amazing customer service tell them Pink sent you!!# 
12403 4 Shared a table with some sweet people & my very handsome date. Menu is huge, portions are huge, everything was delish! 
12404 3 Historic, fun pub with good, hearty food as well as light salads, and good beer. Live music occasionally. A fun place to hang out and enjoy the scenery. Definitely a great place to take visiting friends or relatives. 
12405 3 I had lunch with family last weekend We order 4 different dishes including appetizers. Everything was delicious, portion of the food is so big. Good for sharing. Service was really good. Cute decor .. 
12406 4 I have been here many times. The last was the best! Ordered fabulous fish tacos. Service was quick. I thought I already left a 5 star review last week but can't find it. Haha. Anyways, it was great! 
12407 4 One of the best Chinese restaurants in Cambridge. But do note that this is Taiwanese style, which is different from Cantonese style. I guess it's a bit more bland, but still very good. Try the bean curd sheets, fish with black bean sauce, and salt and pepper pork. 
12408 2 Portions are getting smaller and prices are higher. Not worth going all the way there if you live far away. 
12409 3 Nice new restaurant, you can still smell the newness of the paint! Very fresh bowl that leaves you wanting more! 
12410 3 Despite being in a food court, the authentic Chinese food is made in front of you and always tastes fresh. My only complaint is that it does take quite some for some of the food to come. 
12411 4 My screen on the iPhone was shattered and it only took 30 minutes to replace! Extremely helpful and reasonably priced. 
12412 2 It is ok. Good customer service. Great lemon chicken. Salad roll was average and peanut sauce needs to be improved....beef noodle soup was decent. Kids enjoyed their strawberry smoothie tho. 
12413 0 Went there for dim sum on a Monday, assuming the busy weekend would clear out the stale food (classic Asian). Should've turned around as soon as I set afoot...restaurant smelled oddly musty and damp. Service was slow, and everything we ordered ranged from mediocre to spoiled. Very disappointing. 
12414 4 this was only my first visit. the cashier was nice, i love the decor. it's a quaint little place to get yummy donuts and i got a greatly made chai tea latte. they had a mocha coconut latte that i definitely want to go back again and try! 
12415 3 A decent family style chinese restaurant with good sized portions. Nice modern interior and good service. 
12416 3 Food is decent. nice menu. Good atmosphere. Attractive waitresses. Probably could use better booths to eat in. You kind of sit right next to everyone. 
12417 4 Ordered the steak tacos and they were dank. I want to cover my body in the garlic aioli cause its so good. And papa Lee is a pleasure. Very highly recommend!!!!! 
12418 3 Reasonable prices and great selection. Staff are always helpful and courteous. However, always busy and parking is a pain. The cheaper prices you pay here make up for the markets deficiencies. 
12419 4 We had an awesome meal with Milawna and her trainee, Jorge. We had the Bang Bang Chicken, The Combo, and the kids Kettle Grilled Chicken. Everything was hot and tasty and their service was awesome! Oh, we also had the giant pretzel, which was hot and tasty! 
12420 4 Delicious pho, big portions, and quick service. Very reasonably priced too. Love this place!! 
12421 4 Every single menu item displays tremendous thought and a high form of art. Love this place! Amazing value for the money. Make sure you enjoy their cocktails as well! 
12422 1 Place is ok. Food is ok. Its pretty much a bar that serves some food. Very young crowd. Lobsters are surprisingly good- and their price can't be beat. 
12423 3 OYSTERS........ DROOOOOOL.... DELICIOUS. A FAN OF BL restaurants. 
12424 3 Eeh...Just didn't enjoy so in order to not say anything Bad I'll just not elaborate further. 
12425 4 Had a great time at wahlburgers. Liz was phenomenal. Very helpful and attentive. She made recommendations and we went with the seasonal sangria and the ''tis the season burger. Everything was wonderful made. Will definitely be back. 
12426 4 The food is so simple but so delicious! I love the creamy garlic sauce! I could eat this stuff every day. The sauce is what makes it so good! 
12427 0 Horrible guac ! I got the plate and the gauc was almost frozen. It was really, really cold. Ruined my lunch basically since there's no microwaves around 
12428 4 Last minute brother/sister coffee run and my brother's coworker had suggested this place so we tried it out. 10 out of 10 stars! Great ambiance, great food, great drinks. Definitely a fun spot to try. 
12429 4 Favorite place for lunch! Parking is kind of tight so make sure you're looking around at all times! 
12430 2 I'm not impressed at all. Home slice has bigger and better slices. The space is small but really small. The price is ok. This is a good l I've been drinking and nothing is open - food." The host was nice 
12431 4 Nice ambiance, great burgers, sweet potato tots yum yum. My girlfriend had the cucumber martini. She said that it was the best martini she ever had. Oh we sat at the bar and the service was good 
12432 3 The dim sum brunch was tasty. I want to try their dinner menu. It's a bit of a random part of Washington Street, but worth the hike. 
12433 3 Visited on a Saturday noon. Wanted to eat some hot idlis but learnt there is only buffet on Weekend Lunches. So tried that. Its a little higher priced compared to other Indian resturants, but food was good. Like the chole chaat the best. Will visit again. 
12434 4 We don't get to come here enough. Great people and a fun atmosphere. Plus hockey games!! 
12435 3 Great place with very reasonable prices whether you drop off your laundry or do it yourself it is. It is never busy and they are open from 8 am till 9 or 10pm everyday. Very friendly staff. 
12436 4 Great food. Great staff. Had the short ribs, awesome. This may be my new favorite place. 
12437 4 Great university with a lot to offer. The school has something for everyone and a great place to meet some amazing friends and have some great memories. Columbus is a very up-and-coming city with a lot to offer. 
12438 4 Had the pleasure of eating there last night. Went with my girlfriends and sat up at the bar. Fire in the hole is a must try shooter! We enjoyed the frog legs appetizer for the first time and will order it the next time I come back into town 
12439 2 Jacks has some of the best pizza in town. We recently walked out after standing around ignored by the careless staff. Choose takeout. 
12440 3 Had a delicious happy hour burger and pint for a good deal. Though I don't think yelp had their hours accurate. Tasty pub fare and good service. 
12441 3 This is a great place for Indian food in JP. I personally like Ghazal Indian Cuisine a bit better. But these guys come in a close second in food. The environment is clean, staff is professional and kid friendly. Overall an very good experience. I have been here 3 times. 
12442 4 Best restaurant in town. I recommend it to anyone looking for a great French restaurant. 
12443 1 Alright bowling but rude service and gross bathrooms. I came with my family but they just didn't seem to care about us like other bowling places 
12444 1 Expensive - $160 to replace a battery? I went for a pre-purchase inspection and they barely told me what was going on - definitely not worth $95. I regret trying to go here before work and not just going to my regular mechanic. 
12445 4 Didn't make it in time for brunch, but it didn't matter the chipotle chicken quesadilla was to die for. So yummy and delicious. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting or just in Austin. 
12446 4 Simply amazing. I would put a more in depth review, but really. It's not necessary. I had vanilla dipped in black raspberry. Wife had toffee concrete. Both were so good we went back later for another round. 
12447 4 Wow and wow. First time visit. The staff is nice and it was fun picking out stuff. Happy atmosphere. Make sure to bring plenty of cash It is cash only. The is glorious stoner food. Whoever comes up with these flavor combos is a genius. Already planning a trip back. 
12448 3 Their breakfast tacos are a hidden gem for those of us who work nearby. Much less greasy than the others in the immediate area, and great bargain. Their underground dining area reminds me of Old Austin, may it live forever. 
12449 3 Veg Dumplings where very yummy and fresh Chick satay was cooked Perfect Duck curry was very flavorful Beef macadamia with ginger was good But better mixed with curry sauce from duck 
12450 4 This could be the most delicious pie I've ever had. I ordered the pecan pie and pumpkin and my guest went crazy for them. The pecan pie which I don't even like pecan pies was amazing. 
12451 4 Ask for Johnny. Did a good job with my beard trim. 
12452 4 We came in from out of town as an emergency due to pink eye, and this visit was amazing! Dr Williams was really nice, helpful, and overall, great! After this being a last minute appointment, I was really impressed with our experience overall! 
12453 4 Chicken n waffles are life changing. Pimento cheese dip is straight from your mommas fridge. Get an ice box cake at check out - I recommend the apple. I would eat here everyday if my husband and metabolism let me. 
12454 4 The carbonara is a life changer. Over easy poached egg on top of a delicious bed of pasta -- perfection on a plate. 
12455 4 One of the top massages of my life. Great deep tissue massage, therapist was fantastic. I can't wait to go back-- I'm signing-up for the monthly program, for sure. It's not a fancy spa... but it's quiet, peaceful, clean, professional and my massage was incredible. 
12456 4 The food was good, the beer selection impressive and the service par excellence. Great trifecta 
12457 3 Decent food. Very tiny restaurant. Kind of takes a long time for food to come out, but I think it's because there are only ever two people working. Maybe a husband and wife duo? Still worth a try. 
12458 3 Being from NY, this really is NY style pizza! Hard to find anywhere else in the country, but these guys do an amazing job and it's served with a smile... service was great. Wine options were limited but surprisingly good. Atmosphere is noisy and family friendly. 
12459 4 Awesome music shop. Friendly employees and the best percussion section I've seen. 
12460 1 The decor is TIRED and the food is overpriced. It was good food, but $20+ for fish and chips? And you charge for fries and ranch? No thank you. The beer was good, I'll give them that. 
12461 3 Very tasty. Love the scallion pancakes, they are light and crispy. The prices are very reasonable and they have a great variety of dishes that are fresh. The restaurant is neat and clean. You can sit in and eat, and the food comes out quickly. 
12462 3 Fantastic food and great service. There is a huge variety, including several different kinds of sushi. It's all noticeably fresh. Dishes range from chicken to seafood; there's something for everyone, including those picky eaters who don't like much in the way of Asian food. 
12463 4 Annette was very sweet and courteous and both my and my friend's Mango Fusion smoothies were delicious! Keep up the great work, Annette! 
12464 4 This place is pretty bad ass. Cool atmosphere and decor. Super nice and helpful waiters. Free coffee and amazing breakfast. I had the buttermilk biscuits with bacon gravy and some potato cakes-very subtle but very good flavors. 
12465 3 Regular pizza shop in a strip mall. Regular menu, descent ingredients and professional staff. Good option for a local bite to eat. 
12466 2 We've heard good things about H&F so my hubby and I were really looking forward to a good burger. Sadly, the burgers we got were dry. We like our burgers juicy, so we were disappointed. They were well-seasoned, though. Fries were delicious, well-seasoned and "meaty." 
12467 4 Very nice service and fast and delicious food, bisteck ranchero delicious and #1 enchiladas combo too .. Ema and Martin very friendly and professional and hospitality too and feel like home 100000 stars for Los jalapenos teams Ema and Martin 
12468 3 El Porto is my friends' go-to restaurant in Sommerville, and I'm so glad that it is. Chile Adoboda - yes. Adoboda TACOS - where have you been all of my life?!?!?!?!? The ceviche appetizer was on point, the chips were abundant, and the service was warm and welcoming. 
12469 4 Great Neighborhood Bar. Above Average Pub Food, Great History and Great Bartenders. I love the Warren Tavern. 
12470 3 Great place for a small brunch. Biscuits and gravy are killer. Grits are good too and the beignets are yummy sweet. I liked the Longmont Lucille's better, but this was still really good. 
12471 1 Expensive food, minimally presented, cooked as an afterthought. Had the burger and it had what looked like microwaveable bacon, and my GF had a salad with a rancid tasting cucumber. Also, the shake was ok, but no straw that would work with it so you could actually consume it. Disappointed. 
12472 3 Kept it simple- Full rack of baby back with sweet potato fries. ($20.99) Good as a carnivore could want. A sure good eat'n bet. Split this meal with dbl fries (+$2) and w/ no add'l plate charge. Will be back for the build a burger next time. 
12473 1 We arrived in the afternoon before first night. We decided to sit on the bar, but were consistently ignored by the bartenders... After waiting a few minutes, had to stand up and wave in order to get noticed. Two stars for the service. 
12474 3 Good Tex Mex...better than El Vaquero's. A little spicy but still good. 
12475 4 Best tortillas I've ever tasted - so fresh and flavorful. Al Pastor is rich, savory and exactly what you'd hope it would be. Guacamole is boring but the chips are great. Agua Frescas are great too 
12476 4 Update: All the ladies at Rubys that do acrylic are great and super nice! 
12477 3 I found this today at lunch. Very nice for lunch had salad very fresh. Had meatball sandwich(panni). Servers all seem to natives from Italy. Pace was good. Nice neighborhood restaurant. I would like to try other dishes before total review 
12478 3 The jackson street is usually what I get and it is usually a lot to eat. I have had the fries once and they aren't bad. Best greek food in the area, much better than Greek Express. 
12479 3 Always have a good time here, even though the employees aren't always the friendliest. The laser tag room is as close to paintball as laser tag can be 
12480 4 I eat here once a week and it's always been a pleasant experience. Staff is wonderful and food is always delish! 
12481 4 Dined with deluxe dining plan Lettuce wraps Steak and shrimp Wonton desert Better than brown derby IMO as this very filling meal was one one credit and was very unique and flavorful Paired with great service this meal was excellent 
12482 0 2 main reasons never to visit this place 1 Gun Free Zone 2 No Credit Cards I dont buy the donuts for me so when i go buy them its more of a promotion of your goods that im doing 
12483 4 picked up two grilled chicken salads and a chicken park sub. very good taste and quick service will be back again soon 
12484 3 Good Stuff Chicken Broc Alfredo is the best 
12485 4 Went into Ez Freezy frozen yogurt shop, they got good selection and the "froyo" doesn't taste like a powder and water mix that I had at a different place. Its nice they carry quality froyo over the cheap stuff. 
12486 0 Don't waste your time stopping. They don't have what they advertise, and don't answer the call button. 
12487 4 My first time visiting the Florida Mall Pandora location was great! Stephanie sent my bracelet off for cleaning as we looked at new charms. She was polite and helped me choose two new pieces (: Pandora is a great company overall. It allows me to express myself and commemorate events. 
12488 0 The vegetables are not fresh and the food seems like it's microwaved. Some of it is cold and some of it is warm and some of it is very hot all in the same dish. 
12489 3 Chocolate bomb is just that-the bomb! Very creamy and smooth and the warm hot fudge only made it that much better! Very cool vibe with 80s music playing outside 
12490 4 barista put my iced coffee in a warm cup (melted the ice) and then called me a "demon woman" and threatened my firstborn son 
12491 2 The food is great but the servers are always so rude, please hire a manager to keep your service in standard. 
12492 1 The bagel was bland, which is rare for an everything bagel. Didn't finish the coffee and washed the taste out of my mouth with a mint. Sad to give this review because I had such high hopes for this place on account of the warm atmosphere and friendly staff. 
12493 4 Yum!!!! Great for a late night grub!!! Try the shredded beef arepa with Guayanes Cheese! Delish. 
12494 4 this place is really delicious. Its a comfortable place to eat a hearty breakfast. I got the Sasquatch with a smashed potato! really nice staff, and clean place. i recommend it for that bloody merry, biscuits and gravy kind of day. 
12495 4 We have had biscotti in the best Italian bakeries in New York City as well as Italy. The biscotti here is different and extraordinary. We packed some to take back to NYC. The cannoli was freshly made to order and the best we had ever eaten. Highly recommended. 
12496 4 They did a great job on my dress. Anahit was always very particular about what I was to do, almost too firmly, but the dress came out beautifully so I'm not complaining. 
12497 4 Amazing. Nut said. 
12498 3 Good stuff. Their philly isn't so much life changing as some would have you believe as it just done perfectly. Been here a bunch and everything is good. Wings pasta lasagna philly and even their fries. Definitely worth your time. 
12499 4 Always looking for great menu selection. I like the counter service. The lagniappe is the bread and oil. They never disappoint. PS wish they had fried chicken every day instead of just Saturday. 
12500 0 Wasn't happy with the service tonight. Sorry my wife isn't drinking. No reason for ignoring us all night. The wor wonton soup was boiled to death and the shrimp was too old. Not happy here tonight. 
12501 0 Terrible food that is overpriced, and when I told the manager/owner about it, my comments were met with silence- they could've cared less what I thought. Don't waste your money. 
12502 4 clean modern office with friendly animal loving staff and soft spoken vet. will absolutely go back!! 80$ for both dogs shots. Cheapest I found in town and fantastic experience all around. Plenty of parking! 
12503 4 Fantastic overall experience. Cocktails were on point. The short rib was outstanding. The half chicken was over-salted but otherwise good. Will definitely be back! 
12504 4 One of the best Chinese restaurant in Orlando, Florida! Definitely recommend their lo mein! 
12505 4 So glad I decided to try out Les Caves on a recent night off work! The atmosphere is lovely, the wine list is fantastic, and Jeff (I believe he's one of the owners?) was the perfect combination of attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. Will definitely be back! 
12506 4 We love this place. I see other comments about it taking a little long. I never have any problem. Do some think this is a fast food restaurant? It's not fast food at all and delicious food takes time. Best burger place! 
12507 2 Hard to communicate with the staff here (language barrier). The pedicure treatment was nice but wish my server would have messaged a bit deeper in the feet and calves. No complementary wine?? Is it just because i'm from Texas? 
12508 4 Best drunken noodles in town!! The crab rangoon amazing too! Quality is always high and consistent. Have been eating here for 6 months and it is delicious every time. The staff is supper friendly and ready to serve. 100% recommend. 
12509 4 Really great experience in a rainy night in Austin while Harvey was passing through south Texas. The food was skillfully prepared and presented. We were a table of eight and received excellent service. When in Austin, we should be back. 
12510 4 We sat on the patio on a beautiful Boulder evening. The service was efficient and very friendly. Food was delivered quickly and we enjoy the casual ambience. I had the Steak Frites, which was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and was SOOO good! We'll definitely be back soon! 
12511 4 The staff and actors were great. Vey professional and had a amazing handle on the entire event! Afterwards the recap was spot on. I would highly recommend for any outing or team building event. 
12512 4 their tacos r delish n i recommend coming here to eat....its very rare that i recommend taco trailers but this one i do recommend...the cooks r nice n the guy that takes the orders is helpful...try them, u wont b disappointed.. 
12513 3 Oh we really enjoyed breakfast at Sanborn's. We came here during the week so it was nice and quiet. Our waiter was very attentive and personable. It's a family run place. Father in law was in the back cooking. German style pancakes are so good!! 
12514 4 Gumbo, Cuban, Truffle Mac and Cheese. Just do it. Oh and of course the liquid gold that is the tomato soup. 
12515 4 Love this place. Great coffee, great staff, pleasant mood. We have made this a regular stop. 
12516 4 Based on my 4years living in this apt, everything was way better compare to other locations( west campus, north campus and riverside) For students who are looking for quite, quick management availability quite-reasonable and UT shuttle bus availability , this is a good place around Far-west neighborhood and around austin. 
12517 4 They're still in business in Edmonton and their cupcakes are absolutely to die for! A dieters nightmare...lol 
12518 3 The Monkey Brains, Hawaiian Poke and rolls are all solid. I love the interesting sake menu and the great beer selection from Roscoe's. The space is clean and simply decorated, and the service is always fast and friendly. 
12519 0 I'll start off by saying we had four drinks and it cost $52 with out the tip. I received one of my drinks in a glass that was never washed. The bartenders try but the place is so poorly managed they have no chance to succeed. 
12520 4 ain't cheap but def the premium "lunchable" box. sophisticated food/snack with little treats thrown in. it's some serious stuff.. but only if you appreciate the finer cheese in life. 
12521 4 I absolutely love this place! Avocado fries, the fries & pretty much anything fried here are awesome! The only downside is that sometimes the batter can be too salty. 
12522 1 Food was as marginal as the service. Despite a bounty of available tables, we waited for 20 minutes. The burger I got was over cooked. The pizza was adequate. 
12523 4 Great establishment. Love playing pool there! 
12524 1 Pizza is pretty average. $5 for a slice is about a $1 more than other pizza places in area, so thats minus 1 star. It's got a cool name, but not much more going for it. Disappointing overall. 
12525 0 Just because I'm using Groupon does not mean you make me wait for 10 mins... Even if I got the Groupon deal, I still paid for it... And I always stop by and buy without using groupon anyway... 
12526 4 Nice bar with built-in history. Enjoyed the music and casual atmosphere. Ask for Chris! 
12527 3 My second time visiting this wine shop and again, was impressed. LOVE their charcuterie! 
12528 4 The food was absolutely delicious! Amanda was our server and she was great! Our food arrived very quickly and she even gave us tips on places to go! Highly recommend! 
12529 4 This place did a great job reupholstering our ottomans. The place is a dive but the people are nice. We felt the price was fair and we were 100% pleased by the results. 
12530 0 Ignorant, classless place run by the same kind of people. 
12531 4 stumbled into this great book store. The owners are super happy to help! Instantly found like 9 books from my varying interests that I wanted to take home with me, in the short 30 min I was there!! A must go for book nerds! Cecilia Yakin 
12532 3 Good place. Hamhe Dot's burger is AWESOME. Loved every bite of it Dark inside has a feel of club, bar and cafe. 
12533 3 The best fried shrimp,I had in a long time. The taste reminded me of Lundy's of Brooklyn .fast, polite quick service. 
12534 4 Awesome atmosphere and the waitresses were able to keep up with the guests! Spice was amazing on the carne asada. Tamarind margarita was also incredible! 
12535 4 I love this dive. Great service ice cold beer and super good bands. My favorite bar on 6th street. A must when coming to Austin not the tourist crap. 
12536 1 Absolutely chewiest Mongolian Beef and Cashew Chicken I've ever had. C. Chicken sauce also oddly cloying. General Tso's chicken was okay though. Might try soup and appetizers next time. Try Asian Taste's (less than mile away) scallion pancakes. 
12537 2 Good muffins and wide selection of pastry options make this my usual stop on a weekend morning. Lots of seating inside and outside (on a nice day), and you can spend hours there. However, my roommates were more impressed with the place when it was Carberrys. 
12538 3 clean and good selections. 
12539 4 The most delectable delicious waffle ever! 
12540 4 Worth the wait time for a table at peak lunch time. Portions are large, prices are decent, service is great, and food is delicious. Would eat here regularly if I was a local. 
12541 2 not bad for a deal and if you don't mind looking like every other asshole on the street. 
12542 4 Best roast beef sandwich hands down. The quality is always there. Tender fresh sliced beef, great sauce. You can always count on Nick's! 
12543 0 I ordered the noodle with pork & egg rolls, & Thai iced tea. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling really nauseous & threw up....it must have been food poisoning. :( 
12544 4 Amazing & FAST service, good prices with good deals, customer service is great, James is very knowledgeable and super friendly. Highly recommended 
12545 2 Very cute store with a outstanding mix of hipster friendly items! The store is tiny. The staff not friendly at all. Not a hello, not a welcome or a thanks for coming. Strange. 
12546 4 I love the vibe here. But what I love more... Homemade Chipwiches. Oh. My. God. With the chocolate syrup dipping sauce? It's a choco-gasm. 
12547 4 So excited for this spot to open! Quaint coffee shop with a relaxing sitting area. Friendly staff, Tyler and Justin, offered samples to help me make a decision. The iced Colombian is bright and refreshing.. AWESOME ice, too!! 
12548 3 Good service and very convenient. They do a good job, are always on time and I've never had a problem with them. 
12549 4 The owner / tailor here is very nice and a true tailor. Had a button come off on my dress pants and she took care of it for just $5 and did it in about 10 min 
12550 0 Arrived early and waited for their 11:00 opening time. At 11:20 and still not open, I ate at a different food cart. At 11:50 when I left, there was still no sign of life. Good luck if you go here.... Might be open, might not. 
12551 2 I found my new sns spot I love holly she take car of you. Usual nail spot though. Nothing to spectacular and they slick rude and talk that ish 
12552 4 Lovely hotel with helpful staff and clean, comfortable rooms. Also in short walking distance to the convention center where my conference was held. 
12553 4 Delicious food and great drinks! Service was a bit slow but given that they were slammed on their second or third day I think that's more than reasonable. I'll be coming back for sure. 
12554 3 First time here, food was good. Clam chowder was excellent & the value is good. Atmosphere is very fun. Server did not tell me daily specials as the other table over server did. 
12555 4 Penzey's is the bomb! We don't buy spices anywhere else once we were turned on to Penzey's. Once you've experienced their spices, you will never buy anything else! 
12556 3 Super friendly staff, and willing to help! I bank with an associated credit union, and I have never had any issues! 
12557 3 Got a mani/pedi. Sonny did my manicure and he is great! Another woman did my pedicure but she seemed to be in a hurry. Overall, I was satisfied with my experience! 
12558 2 Loved Gigi's the first and second visit. We had the Kookarella. The last time we picked up Kookarella and they changed the bread. Instead of crusty French bread, they used very soft ciabatta bread which had way less body, and it really spoiled the sandwich. It was very disappointing. 
12559 4 This place knew we needed to get back on the road quickly-it was a holiday weekend and we were visiting. Not only did they work around the clock to get it right, they added more to what they did with no added charges. 
12560 0 This place has so many cockroaches they were in the lobby, bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. We were first on the 1st floor when the roaches started appearing then we were moved to the 5th floor where the roaches continued to infest us. 
12561 3 Yum. Llano burger. Truffle fries. We have waited over an hour and for that reason we do not go there as often as I would like and why not five stars, but otherwise the burgers are great as is the service. 
12562 3 Went there for Chinese New Year's dinner. It was my third time there.. I think it's becoming our default restaurant choice for Cantonese food in Vancouver, since it's close. I like the dessert and also food! 
12563 4 Simple this is my favorite seafood restaurant. After going to legal for years Finz has made me switch 
12564 2 The dishes are not quite worth them due to the price and quality especially the pork woodong. 
12565 3 Beef brisquet, 1/4 lean, 1/4 moist, 1/4 bbq turkey, Mac n cheese, peach cobbler, famous bbq sauce. 
12566 4 Sweet Potato Hash was awesome. Definitely a well family ran chain. Everyone is very friendly and upbeat. Had to wait 20 mins to be seated but...what would you expect from an awesome place! Lots of people go! Keep doing what you're doing! I'll definitely be back for more! 
12567 4 The whole staff was amazing! I would do this again in a heartbeat. The procedure was a breeze and painless. Really wonderful experience overall. 
12568 4 Just saw Wait Until Dark at the Footlight Club in Jamaica Plain. It was great theater and a great thriller. Don't miss it! It runs Fridays and Saturdays through February 16th! 
12569 4 Great local bar! Service was amazing from the bouncer to the server!! All staff will make you feel at home as they greet you with "Nice to see you again." Even if it's your first time there. 
12570 4 I had it in ATL airport. It was the first time I have it. A lot of people waiting in the line. People are nice for serving. love the chicken sandwich！It's juicy better than kfc and McDonald's 
12571 4 Had lunch today, probably the best food(tasty) I ever had in any Indian restaurant in Austin area. Keep it up guys. Highly recommend this place. Cheers 
12572 1 The food was formulaic, reheated and mediocre. Spanish rice appeared to have only paprika for color. The service was good on our visit, has the balance swung the other way? 
12573 3 Easy to get in and get coffee, I don't eat bagels any longer, but I still like the smell as I get coffee. 
12574 4 I've gone to like six dentists in my time, and this is by far the best experience. Dr. Mo is a jovial guy and very painless and careful. He loves what he does and is great with everyone. Highly recommended for someone looking for a new local dentist. 
12575 4 Love me some Bartaco! Excellent food and great service. The guacamole is to die for and so are the fresh squeezed margaritas. Get your margarita with sugar on the rocks. Mmm 
12576 4 This is an amazing way to see all the highlights in Vancouver. Our guide, Nick, was very knowledgeable and made learning about his city very fun and interesting. The actual cycling was easy and safe with so many bicycle friendly roads. 
12577 0 Awful though we didn't eat. we were told to get a table and then no one ever can to bring menus or help us. Eventually we left and no one eve said anything - like they didn't even care. 
12578 2 I love the garlic bread but I'm very particular with my pasta , I had the tortellini alfredo it was very soupy not delicious at all didn't look like the chef took his time on it Hopefully another time is the charm 
12579 4 Just went recently for the second time for brunch. Outstanding food and service is great too. I would recommend a larger draft/ craft beer list. But other than the small beer list it was great. I look forward to going back soon!!! 
12580 0 Lets just say that I only eat here if I'm starving and this is the only place open. Sushi is mediocre and the service isn't the best, but also isn't the worst. Go here for a quick and cheap fix. 
12581 4 Best Pad Kee Mao in the Portland area! Great balance of spice and flavor. This is by far my favorite dish at Thai Orchid. Easily deserves 5 stars! 
12582 4 A little piece of heaven for a lactose intolerant person. My kids claim it's the best vanilla ice cream they have had as well. Two thumbs up! 
12583 3 Mango slush with the cubes on top is so bomb. It's a must get if you come across one of these cafes. It's a chain. I want to try the bubble waffles next time I visit Canada. 
12584 3 These guys took on a MAJOR painting project for us. We are very particular, and want things done in a professional manner from start to finish. We made the right choice choosing DGP. And well use them again in the future. Thanks guys! 
12585 0 I installed yelp and created an account and wrote this review about the time it took to get a taco...all while waiting for my taco. Terrible slow service. 
12586 3 It was nice to find a dim sum restaurant that opens at 8 am. Parking is plentiful in the public parking lot. Float validates an hour and half if you dine there. They had a good selection of food. The food came out hot. Portions were good sized. 
12587 4 Wow, really impressed. Best ice creams I have had in a WHILE. The prices are good for the quality. 
12588 4 Excellent food, excellent service... did mention excellent food ! The place is small enough to be shared with a loved one. The location is perfect to eother go shopping or sightseeing aftereards. Definitely would come eat here when I visit the Bean again. 
12589 4 PURE AWESOME! TONS of parking and used to be the old Lennox building who made heaters and a/c! 
12590 4 Meats are delish, salad bar is just enough !! Service is exceptional !! Our to go place !! 
12591 4 Had a great experience here for some wine and tapas with my mom. The owner was very welcoming and made sure that everything was to our liking. It is also very reasonably priced and the ingredients were high quality! 
12592 4 Insane amount of ciders on tap. Really nice bartenders. Get the taster trays for a fun experience with a buddy! My fav: Tepache mixed with any of the mild apple/pear ciders. Yesssssss, perfect for a hot, summer day. 
12593 1 Usually great service and fun environment. Must have just hired a new staff, because the service is all of a sudden very poor. Short and moody. Come on Jamba Juice 
12594 3 Went today - was freezing so sadly couldn't stay long. Lots of vendors selling treats... I'll do another visit some time and dress more warmly! 
12595 3 Always like to stop for good food, lots of choices, & great service. Fun sports bar with all the extras 
12596 4 My first time eating here and it was great. The wait is a bit long. I went around 1ish. The food is seasoned very well. Definitly recommend it here. 
12597 4 Great bruschettta pasta and fabulous drinks. So great to have a new place to go to in Cambridge. Can't wait to take my work team or a date! 
12598 4 Gotta say great place with totally great food. Authentic Latin flavors from Colombia, Venezuela, and Cuba. Had the Lechon Asado with white rice and black beans. Great flavors! Strongly recommend it! 
12599 1 Atmosphere was hot and walls had old food splatter on them. The guy at the counter overcharged us and was not gracious when my husband pointed it out to him. We will not be returning. Food was good but not exceptional. 
12600 3 the necessary pit stop before throwing an mit dorm party. get an adequately aged senior to escort a horde of lowerclassmen in, and the libby's staff won't bat an eyelash. as long as one person has an id to show, they're cool with anything. pretty standard liquor selection... 
12601 3 One would be amazed to see a place run on fries, waffles and some sandwiches. This place does exactly that! Perfectly fried & seasoned fries, airy sweet waffles and both accompanied by yummy dipping sauces. Jalapeno-habanero, vampire slayer, salty caramel, their home made ketchup and mayo. Must must try!! 
12602 4 5 stars for Rose!!! She was very sweet and accommodating for my girlfriends first terrarium! She was very knowledgeable about the products and helped my girlfriend with the final masterpiece. Super friendly and great attitude! This place is awesome 
12603 2 Stayed at the hotel. Breakfast was good the first day. After that and other meals left quite a bit to be desired. We would come back to the hotel, but not the "restaurant". 
12604 3 I have only been here for happy hour. Half price apps in the bar area! Samosas, mussels (yum), calamari, crab cakes and lots of other yumminess. They have a ginger infused vodka drink that I must try one of these days. 
12605 3 I dragged a large group in for a meeting and we were able to scoot some tables together near the fire, drink some amazing beer and receive great service...followed by great music. 
12606 4 Jimmy the Appliance Guy - awesome. Talk to him if possible - he knows all the tips and tricks. 
12607 4 Service is always great, wait usually moves pretty fast. The food is always good. I would recommend the gyoza and the shoyu or spicy meat. I think the prices are good for what you get too. I would recommend this to anyone. 
12608 4 The prices at Amy's Davie location is better than Party Bazaar....this is the place to go!! I got 60 balloons in one hour, fast service, great people! Check this place out! 
12609 4 Absolutely incredible. Authentic Venezuelan arepas. Love the Sofrito. Generous portions - you get a nice hunk of avocado alongside the meat. The plantains melt in your mouth. Clean and comfortable location. Quick service. Kind faces. 
12610 4 The food was delicious and the service was fantastic. I've never eaten Georgian food before but I now am a fan. Super tasty dumplings and the cheese breads amazing. 
12611 0 One star is most generous. I cannot comment on the food because it never arrived. After waiting for 45 minutes, we left. Worst. Service. Ever. There are too many other good choices in the area. STAY AWAY!!! 
12612 3 great place for a drink. stop on buy. the tender is nice. A lot of heavy drinking though later in the night. not much else to add to the other reviews. bit cramped. small area. 
12613 2 3.5 stars! I got the avocado margarita and it was delicious! Customer service was OK, but they were busy. The food was better than expected and the meat wasn't overly salty. I will definitely return!!! 
12614 3 Chiliean sea bass was excellent... Rest of meal was very good! Wait staff well trained and attentive! Nice time. 
12615 4 This is the best place to get Mexican food. It's always very busy, so plan on waiting. 
12616 3 Love this place. Never have I enjoyed just noodles this much. Also, they have happy hour 4-7 and then a reverse happy hour starting at 8:30, and it has $4 sushi, so if you come for dinner you can get pretty good cheap sushi as an appetizer. 
12617 3 I've enjoyed the food here the few times I dined here. The selection in the lunch buffet wasn't extensive and the price was a tad more than I typically like to pay. 
12618 4 Great Seating! Great Service! Great Burgers and salads! I had the Trio and Onion Rings which were all excellent! Even my little sliders were Medium cooked perfect and not dry! My friend really enjoyed the seared chicken on her salad! 
12619 4 Service is great. The place is clean. Restroom is clean. Staff have been friendly everytime I went. Noodles r authentic from a Chinese pov. 
12620 3 Great food. Beautiful atmosphere. Some staff need to work on customer service. Doesn't hurt to smile sometimes. 
12621 2 I went to Alameda Cafe with a couple friends for lunch. While the food was fine, none of us were extremely wowed by the salads or sandwiches. It would be a fine place if I lived in the neighborhood, but not a place to go for anything super tasty. 
12622 2 The waffles are pretty small. The sauces are good. The fries are rather slimy. The side salad was surprisingly good! 
12623 4 Best gas and service station I've ever worked with. George and the team are amazing and have an amazing memory for faces. 
12624 3 Great for burgers, wings and has an extensive beer selection. Mike is an awesome manager very welcoming and friendly. 
12625 4 Great food!!!! Absolutely great staff, very nice and cordial, will go out of their way to get to know you when you are a regular. Definitely feel welcome. And the food is sublime, did i mention? 
12626 0 Do not visit until the remodel is done, apparently expected to be done in March or April 2013. It is too expensive ($160/n weekdays) right now given the fact that the remodel prohibits them from offering any amenities. Stay at the Fairfield Inn just one block away for $105 
12627 3 We love the pizza and get the same thing every time a large cheese and a large 360 supreme. The staff is courteous and friendly. Highly recommend it. 
12628 4 Delicious! I had the Aka ramen, which was rich and flavourful with the right amount of chilli to complement the taste. Just delicious! 
12629 0 Selling expired milk, soda, among other goods is unacceptable. This isn't a one time thing either.. It has been multiple occasions now. 
12630 4 Literally the best smoothie experts ever! Steve and Takara amazing customer service will be back asap! 
12631 4 So much buzz about this place, and the wait was probably over an hour. Breakfast skillet was good enough, side just okay, but the waffles with dip were pretty incredible. 
12632 3 Really enjoyed their lunch buffet. Good variety of vegetarian and meat dishes, as well as variety among salads, soups, hot dishes, and light fruit desserts. I would agree with past reviewers that Tibetan food has flavors/dishes similar to Indian and Chinese (understandably) but still it's definitely distinct. 
12633 3 one of the staples in boulder. fabulous space downtown on walnut st. you need reservations! sometimes you get lucky with a seat at the bar, but don't count on it. brunch, lunch, and dinner are all great. reminds me of balthazar in nyc. 
12634 4 This IS the best bakery anywhere in MA! The pastries are high quality, fresh and loaded with fillings. My moms 98th birthday cake was strawberry with whipped cream, was the hit of the party again. Sunday morning scali bread is delicious, usually eat haft before I can get it home! 
12635 3 Great little shop, super fun to browse. Anytime I need a gift for a girlfriend, guaranteed I'll find something perfect here. Fun jewelry and cute knick knacks. And it's perfect when I need a cute new purse for myself, too. :-) Their prices are surprisingly affordable. 
12636 4 Great food, great service! Bruno is great and went out of his way to provide fantastic service. 
12637 4 Just had steak nachos. Yummy. Plenty of good steak chunks. Good guacamole and pico and sauce! Plenty portion size. 
12638 4 One of my favorite spots in Columbus. I've been a fan for 25 years! Love the Summer Walleye special. Die for the catfish, spoon read and greens.... And the deserts are fabulous. Ask for Matt! 
12639 2 i work in the area and frequent this place pretty often for the chicken noodle soup. it's generally good (not too much mystery meat) but there is an off time every once in a while. portion is huge for the price and service is pretty quick. 
12640 4 Some of the best Irish food I have ever had. Live performer with good music. I ordered the fish and chips and my husband ordered the bangers and mash. The food came out quick and hot. The waitress very attentive and we're always checking on us. 
12641 3 You really can't find better grits in Boston. The service is always great and the bloody marys are delicious. The best part of going to Johnny D's is the specials menu. Each time I go I order something different because the specials are always too delicious to turn down. 
12642 3 love this place! really good pizza and probably one of the best meatball subs you can get. i'm picky when it comes to meatball subs and this place has one of the best. 
12643 4 Absolutely, hands-down the best food in Orlando. The monthly Pig Roast a bit overrated, but every other thing I've had--food, drink, service, dessert--has been top notch! In this Orlando food desert, I rejoice every time we get a reservation! 
12644 4 This is a very well run station and they have a number of great products! It's always very clean and the bathrooms are close to immaculate. It's right in the middle buckhead so the pricing can be on the highside but thats to be expected. 
12645 3 Stopped here for brunch 2 weeks ago. The huevos rancheros were some of the best I ever had!! Unusual and very tasty. We sat at the bar, as there were no tables, and the bartender was friendly and efficient. 
12646 4 I've been to several places for acupuncture and cupping and Lucas is by far the best. He's gentle yet thorough and I get great results from his work. Trust him, he knows what he's doing! 
12647 4 I eat here every other week. its awesome. i just dont give a F and i do what i want. for some damned reason the veggie antipasto plate is ridiculously amazing and always changing, and i don't even like vegetables generally. 
12648 4 Great bar area. Good bbq. Nice bartenders. Outdoor area is good for people watching. Fun times. 
12649 0 wow why! used to be good when I was a kid, not going to get poetic or jaded either not worth my time wow why! 
12650 2 Nice selection of plants but FYI, fertilizer is cheaper at Breed & Co. Also, I found it difficult to get assistance from their staff. 
12651 4 Really like this bar/restaurant. Inventive cocktails, really good wine options and great food! If you go for brunch order the biscuit. Happy hour fries are also super good! 
12652 1 Pho was good size, broth ok. Grilled pork chop rice: they did not use broken rice, flavor was't great. Grilled shrimp vermicelli was decent. Server was very attentive. Decor better than most. 
12653 0 Horrible experience. Food takes forever and it's not even good. 
12654 4 This place has an amazing quiet ambiance just a step away from a busy street outside. It's a nice relaxing getaway from the noise. Great coffee, amazing tea, and delicious food. 
12655 4 This place is excellent even if you are not a veggie. I live for the soups on cold winter days. They have excellent frozen drinks as well. 
12656 4 We took the little ones this morning and they loved seeing a lush paradise in the middle of the city. It is such a beautiful and serene garden. We especially enjoyed the Asian gardens and simply wandering around. 
12657 3 Even though the place is small and cramped the food was good. I ordered the Homemade corn beef hash with 2 eggs and fries and it was delicious. I would definitely go there again since it was so cheap. 
12658 4 Love love love ! Dr Colon- Bengoa and his staff ! They are awesome ! Friendly and professional. You feel like part of their family when you with them ! 
12659 3 Good food. I got Chimichangas. They were really good. They do trivia too (on Thursdays I think). 
12660 4 Great atmosphere and phenomenal frozen margaritas. Chris is the best waiter ever. We've been lucky enough to have him serve us twice and he seriously always takes great care of us. I will be coming back again and again. 
12661 4 Amazing place!!!!!!!!!!! My kids love it! And at evening time you can BYOB! Personalize anything on the shelf to your liking. Be a kid all over again or make something sentimental. 
12662 4 Excellent burgers! We particularly enjoyed the turkey club and lamb burgers. Arugula and beet salad was fabulous. Topped it all off with an amazing vanilla shake to go. Memorable last meal in Austin before heading home to the land of cheesesteaks. 
12663 4 Great variety and options for gf, vegan/ vegetarian, even Paleo friendly dishes!! The air conditioning was broken, and the wait for the food was quite a while, but I'd still say we all had excellent meals. 
12664 4 Love the horseshoe! I grew up in Springfield IL where the horseshoe was created and I was so excited to find one in Austin! Great service and atmosphere for a date night or family weekend lunch! Cool outdoor area as well. 
12665 4 I love all the non dairy options and a huge selection of toppings. Such a cute spot. The decor is fun, this would be a great casual dessert date spot. 
12666 4 Excellent service - I highly recommend this for WDW. We got bottled water, breakfast foods, and wine delivered to our hotel. Worked out great. 
12667 4 Looking for the best apple fritters in MA - look no further. Great prices and warm donuts! Finally! 
12668 4 Mike with repair was unbelievably knowledgeable about my Gibson acoustic and what it needed. He fixed everything and cleaned her up while I waited. I am relieved that I found him. 
12669 1 The food lacks flavor. It's just "meh." Table's general consensus is not worth the money. 
12670 4 Great place to bring your dog. Everyone is friendly and genuinely care about the well being of your furbaby. The prices of shots and boarding are very reasonable. Highly recommend. 
12671 4 Great little neighborhood breakfast spot, friendly service, good food, just as I'd expect. I was visiting and would go back if I'm in town again 
12672 4 My favorite pizza in Austin. The only place we order from. Love the thin crust. Speedy delivery as well 
12673 4 We went after church on Sunday. There were not many people at 12:30 but it was filling up when we left. The service was excellent and the food was very, very good! We will be frequent diners and are very happy to have this addition to Oviedo!! 
12674 4 First time here and it was absolutely amazing the food and the service. Will definitely be back again 
12675 3 Missing male intact dockson dapple since 12-22-17 from Holland to. 2547217597 His name is Wally believe stolen! 
12676 3 Yes, I'm a fan. They always do good. Keep in mind that SB has a hidden menu. Ask the people and see what else they have. 
12677 2 The service is hit or miss. The food is good and the portions are generous. The tacos are big! 
12678 2 Food was delicious but portions were way way too small. So ultimately a bitter sweet dinner because the food being good makes you want more of it! Seriously wouldn't go again because we left very hungry after spending $50 a person. 
12679 3 Cool spot! Great food, drinks, and service. Would be nice if they didn't charge to park in their parking lot, however there is free parking on nearby streets. 
12680 4 Great seafood and seasoned well. We eat here once a week sometimes twice. The only negative thing is that no one ever answers the phone so you can't call ahead and order. 
12681 1 These donut sandwiches are good but they are too expensive to be on a mini donut. If you're looking to spend 10 bucks on a drink a mini donut sandwich go ahead 
12682 3 Such a cute little place to go for a chill night. Decor is so modern, and the open windows really sets the mood. I haven't had the food here yet, I've only had their drinks and i think their drinks are great and reasonably priced! 
12683 4 Lisa T is great. You would want to seek her help when purchasing or ordering. She went above and beyond. 
12684 3 Absolutly love this place. I took my wife and kids( 18, 16 & 12). Everyone loved the food and the music was awesome. I will be a regular once I move to Orlando in June. 
12685 4 I don't give out 5 stars easily, but this place deserves it. Great food, prices, and service. Will be back. 
12686 4 Always the best food. Lobster bisque is great. Can never go wrong with Texas de Brazil. About $50 bucks per person for the food. They basically bring skewers of meat to your table and cut it into your plate. 
12687 4 Bro pizza dough sprinkled with a net 2 ounce of meat and weird basil shavings was for sure worth the $20! Cheers to spartan for 4000% profit margin! That's a huge accomplishment! 
12688 4 My husband and I come here often and the pho is consistently delicious, hot, and the service is always fast! Favorite pho place in town! 
12689 3 I was very pleased with this meal. The atmosphere was good, and the waitress was very nice. As for the meal, I thoroughly enjoyed the fajitas. It was a great experience, one in which I wish to have again the next time I am in Orlando. 
12690 1 Hmmm... Not the best but not the worst. Average at best. I'm not sure what to say other than it felt like just another knock-off with OK yogurt. Props for the great location. 
12691 4 I liked almost everything, but the guacamole was blan. The rice, beans, and enchiladas are great. Guacamole this time was great. Very good service and food. 
12692 0 Very unprofessional. They did a sloppy job on my manicure. Did not bother to properly take off excess nail polish from my fingers. The manicure was rushed. The nail polish was globbly on my nails. Woman who did my nails was unpleasant. Never coming back. 
12693 2 food was good we sat at the bar I recommend sitting elsewhere if you are not a regular the bartenders ignore you. good luck getting served 
12694 4 Worth the drive to the outside of Atlanta. Get there early because it lines up out the door by noon. Mac n Cheese is a favorite and of course the Fried Chicken! 
12695 4 Food is always fresh and good, plus the owners are very friendly and great people. Tell them mike from Western Ave AutoBody sent you 
12696 2 Not the best pizza, it fell apart when i tried to pick it up. I did like the breadsticks but yeah portland has better pizza places, check them out. Staff is very nice though. 
12697 4 We just love coming here while at Animal Kingdom! Great food and pretty good service for such a busy restaurant inside Disney! 
12698 4 I'm updating to 5 stars. The mark of a great place is the consistency of the food over time. It's easy to lose passion and let things slip. Not so here, amazing food, omlettes that are perfect. Bacon cooked correctly. Great vibe! 
12699 3 Michael reached out to me to follow-up on this and while my feelings about the food didn't change, but opinion on the service and the ownership is more positive. Will try them out again. 
12700 4 Yummy Ney York style thin crust pizza. Every time I'm there the staff is super nice and helpful. Love that they have the garlic shakers on tables along with the peppers and cheese! 
12701 4 The Pescado (fish) tacos are some of the best I've had outside of Southern California. Very authentic and the staff are very friendly. 
12702 4 The best specialty food and liquor store in the area. Their knowledgable staff will help you traverse the wide selection of imported and local beers, wine, and liquors. The deli section holds fresh meats, cheeses, and preservatives. With sections ranging all prices, there is something for everyone here. 
12703 4 Great atmosphere, especially the outdoor covered patio. Food was delicious and the drinks are excellent (pretty strong)!! 
12704 4 Out on an adventure in Austin and found this cute breakfast place. We had the special omelette - chicken, mushroom, spinach and Swiss. It was delicious and the service was top notch. Don't pass this place up. 
12705 3 Really well priced, good service and good sushi! Can't say anything bad. Perfect for a quick lunch drop-in. 
12706 1 Cool atmosphere and great location, but the food is just not that good! We didn't think anything we had was good or flavorful. Hope they improve because that's the only thing holding back this place. 
12707 2 waited in line for an hr outside and another 30 mn inside nice burger but not worth 1:30 wait 
12708 4 TO DIE FOR!! So good, fresh ingredients, well made, well seasoned. Large portions, great prices, and delivery!! Worth the wait, ordered on two occasions, will order again and again! 
12709 1 Someone needs to come and fix this place up. It's in such poor condition. There is water leaking everywhere. The staff was not very helpful. I gave it two stars because the buses come by every 15 minutes and literatly right in front of the station. 
12710 2 It is just a standard hk style restaurant. However it is the best one in town compare to the others. Only thing I don't like is they charge u $0.50 for each take out box. Bring your containers for the left over next time. 
12711 4 Great quality shoes at very reasonable prices. I have purchased 4 pairs of shoes in 3 months and 1 pair of slides. 
12712 4 Dr. Chen is very friendly and thorough. I highly recommend him! 
12713 1 Everything looks good but it's dry: the bread the beef the fries. I asked for a to go bag and the guy just took the lining of the tray and stuffed it in a fry box so the sauces spread over everything rather than just boxing the burger and fries 
12714 0 Extremely slow and don't know the difference between Taro and Thai iced tea. Staff seemed to not care at all. 
12715 4 Today I went this nice place by myself, had a very nice late-night dinner and a winter rose. When I ready for checkout I figured I lost my credit card. The guy who served me said, "don't worry come back tomorrow!" Thank you! Definitely will come back! 
12716 3 My favorite dive bar. Amelia and Sherrie are great bartenders! Good drinks and decent food. 
12717 4 Authentic taste, nice menu selection and very courteous staff. The place was clean and staff made sure we were comfortable. It was a very pleasant experience. 
12718 4 Great! I really liked the service, food and beer selections are fantastic , it's worth a try if your unsure. 
12719 4 Love the quinoa veggie burger with pickled beets. Also, delicious fries and collard greens. Yum! 
12720 4 Cute little bookshop for kids!!! The clerk was very helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. It can feel a little crowded with a handful of people, but everyone was friendly. Overall a great experience, thank you!!! 
12721 3 Excellent brunch menu and beer selection. My wife also loved the Bloody Mary she got. The biscuits and gravy are phenomenal and so is the pulled pork- better than any BBQ joint in Boston. Haven't been there for dinner but will absolutely try to go back. 
12722 4 Grotto is my favorite restaurant in Boston! The atmosphere is quaint but cute and the food is delicious. I highly recommend the gnocchi with spare ribs. The price is well worth it especially since you get generous portions of both salads and entrees. You will not be disappointed. 
12723 0 I have come to conclude that all Steak and Shake restaurants are the worst Steak and Shake restaurants. 
12724 4 Been here a few times before today , would have rated this place a 3 The trick to great service and a great dining experience is to ask for Ryan to be your server 
12725 3 Best prices on quality chicken, cheeses, and most fresh produce in town. Small but great bakery goods section. The small store gets busy in late afternoons and there can be long lines with not enough staff; the only reason for a 4 not 5 star rating. 
12726 4 Healthy, fresh, flavorful combinations or make your own salads. Fresh real juice! Really friendly employees! Will be frequenting often. 
12727 2 I had the Hakata Ramen at lunchtime and found the broth to be tasty and noodles very disappointing. I expect to eat homemade noodles at an "authentic Japanese" place and these were decidedly not. I'm definitely not going to make the trek from Portland to this sub-par establishment again. 
12728 4 OMG! Wish I would have visited sooner! Everything was so delicious and fresh! And the seasoning on all meats? To die for. Yum yum yum. Get here soon!! 
12729 0 Doesn't deserve to be in the North End. Customer service is awful and food is subpar. Frozen seafood and undercooked pasta... go elsewhere. 
12730 4 Just went in here for the first time and the glass selection (all local) and price are really great. I thought the BC had a good selection, but it pales in comparison to Pipes Plus SmoCo. I highly recommend checking this place out. 
12731 2 Kudos on being one of the few places opening in the late evening to grab (limited selction of) bagels! You'll find its a bit slow, but at the end of the wait, you'll get your standard Panera Fare. Also, fresh bread is cheaper here than next door at Shaws. 
12732 4 Best seafood by far in Orlando! For the price you can get a stomach full of delish southern food :) 
12733 4 This place rules - you can feed 3 people for under 20$ I get the lamb and rice plate or the lamb pita - huge portions and it's delicious !! 
12734 4 I've had many waxes, in many states. This was the least painful I've ever experienced. And that's after not waxing for over a year. A+. I wouldn't waste time looking at other places. Try Jessica first. 
12735 4 This is one of my favorite places to eat near GSU. Good food, fast-service, friendly people. What's not to like? 
12736 4 Where's the truck?!? Where's el primo?? It has gone missing..... does anyone know its where it is? 
12737 3 Their menu is pretty big and has a variety of options. Any fast food greasy option you can think of, they have. Their slices are pretty big and their service is real quick. Great late night option if you're in the downtown area. 
12738 3 Good atmosphere and good tea/coffee. I never tried their food but the menu looks good. I would love to go back for more. It's a bit slow service so this is not for a busy grab and go cafe. 
12739 3 very clean looking place got take out though so didn't sit in. The Chicken in Garlic Sauce is OUTSTANDING!!!! has a little heat to it but the sauce is phenominal will go back for sure prices are comparable to other chinese takeout 
12740 3 This is the fried chicken you deserve. Spicy and tasty. Flavorful. The sides leave a little to be desired, but the chicken is king. 
12741 4 My go to brunch spot! Seriously everything on the menu is good. Get the orange stillman to drink. The fried cheese grits, stuffed pancake, shrimp and grits, nasty Mcallister. Make a reservation and go early enough to visit the farmers market next door. 
12742 3 Food is decent, and the location is perfect! It's right on Lake Eola, so it's great for a quick bite and drinks. 
12743 0 It was my first time & I am very disappointed. Ordered a veggie bowl with double veggie (added 2$) & for $7.50 get this. Not to mention it was served cold. Do not recommend this place. 
12744 4 they are reasonably priced and did a great job!! Plus they throw in a back massage at the end :) 
12745 3 Review based on service/drinks only. The staff was quick and friendly, pretty good beer and spirit selection. We got a house whiskey and club soda and an Allagash White beer. All in all good, was able to watch the game and see my gate while my flight was delayed. 
12746 4 Real authentic Thai flavor, the server is awesome as always, he's really the best. The prices are great at lunch, I come here are often as I could. 
12747 4 Best Chinese food in Boston! The udon noodles were so good we bought their cook book so we could make it at home 
12748 2 Tin Shed is pretty delicious. The prices are way out of my budget, so I don't eat there often. I don't really feel like I get my money's worth most of the time. For example..$4 for a side of bacon. 2 pieces of bacon. 
12749 4 Great hidden gem, definitely get the fresh spinach pie. 
12750 3 Really good food and love the ambiance. The customer service was great. I'd definetly go back. 
12751 1 Ok food, good service, nice TVs. I dunno I can't explain it, the atmosphere just kinda sucks....my boy Huy put it best "Its like the Chuck E. Cheese of sports bars" 
12752 3 Ethiopian food experience was different. The staff and service was really good. We ordered lamb, chicken, fish. And all of their flavors were spicy and savory. 
12753 4 Best tuna salad sandwich I've ever had!!Great selection of local wines and healthy snacks too. 
12754 4 The food was so delish and authentic! Service was super fast and very attentive! Great place to go on lunch break alone or with a coworker. 
12755 3 Excellent brunch - try the poached eggs or sausage and spinach omelet Outside is great but the music was terrible - no one liked it and they weren't willing to change 
12756 3 *Update* I was contacted by the owner (Paul R.) who was great. He not only apologized for the mistake, but he also appreciated the honesty in my post and took care of me to correct the issue. 
12757 0 Food was very mediocre and waitress was occupied more with talking to the other staff. The air conditioning was not on so it made the place feel very stuffy. Portions of the food was vey small for the price. 
12758 4 This place is amazing and the customer service is outstanding. I had the chicken pot pie and it was the best ever. I bought it frozen and cooked it at home. This is definitely a solid choice for both savory and dessert pies. 
12759 3 Very nice, sort of a hidden gem amongst salons in Portland. It's not swank like its "sister" salon, Dosha. However, the service is excellent and the staff is always very friendly, professional and I feel GREAT when I walk out. 
12760 4 I'm from Arizona, this place is truly amazing... Not a lot selection off beer, but who cares the sirloin tips are to die for.. The pizza has so much flavor.. The crust is crisp and yummmmy!!!! Oh and the waitress Gina is super awesome.. ;-) 
12761 3 Ali will take good care of you all for a very reasonable price. Been there twice and had a great experience each time. I've called for an appointment and they've accommodated same day each time. They also do drop in's. Definitely highly recommended! 
12762 4 Rock creek is one of those places where you just walk in and know the food is going to be epic. We had this pork and mustard cabbage that was wonderful and the polenta fries are a total must have. If you want just yummy and enjoyable food come here! 
12763 2 The burgers are ok, not great. The place itself is pretty dirty so I would not advice eating there, but take out would be ok. The only reason I went there is because I had a groupon for it; I would not go out of my way for it again. 
12764 2 Love the location- dont love the bathroom situation- have to use the lake eola public restrooms which are not usually clean at all. Food is just ok. 
12765 2 I love this store and everything they offer but hardly buy anything due to the extremely high prices. For the quality of the items the price does not match. The whole house would be bought here if their prices were lower. 
12766 3 Happy Hour was great and Jeremy was awesome. The food was delicious! Bosphorus is a little pricey, but amazing. 
12767 3 Holy Wow Cow! This place is AWESOME!!! Great atmosphere and location. The beer is fantastic, the food is tasty, the staff is super friendly and the set up is adorable. I'm waking up with last nights leftovers but I'm already plotting my return! 
12768 4 I have only done the wash and fold service for when we are feeling very lazy, and they do a good job on both (the wash and the fold). Very friendly and fair pricing ($1.50 for the service) 
12769 4 I try this spot on a whim and it turns out to be excellent. Great variety of food and the drinks I just don't even know how to describe them. If your in Orlando make this one of your stops. 
12770 4 Great broth, great deep fried spring, the large is a good size and service was great. I took a gamble as it didnt have many reviews but it worked out nicely! 
12771 4 Loved it! The food was spectacular. I got the Cajun chicken rigatoni dish, and it was phenomenal. I will definitely be back! 
12772 3 The Boyne is the perfect spot for a beer and a great meal. The chili is amazing! Great atmosphere..great staff. 
12773 3 Laurie did my hair, I am new to area and took a chance on this place. Very satisfied will definitely go back 
12774 4 I had a look at the buffet but I usually hate them and skipped it straight to the main meals. came here for dinner and ordered a steak sizzler I think it was called that. Really good food and the staff were very friendly. Highly recommend a visit. 
12775 1 Service: crappy Fries: stale and salty Burger: ok but not worth $7 I spent $28 for 3 types of burgers and 3 types of fries. Fries came out stale and salty as hell and the burgers were good but not for what they cost. I'll take farm burger, thx. 
12776 0 Um, yeahhhh, this place is scuzzy, and not in a good divy way. The bathrooms are disgusting, and the rest of the place makes me feel like I'll get Hep C just from touching anything. 
12777 4 My waitress Amanda was amazing!!! Truly made my experience as good as it gets as she was very attentive, kind, and sweet. I will definitely be back and ask specifically for her! 
12778 3 Good, consistent food and great service. Get reservations, no matter the time of day or day of week, this place is ALWAYS packed. 
12779 2 Cute bar with nice outdoor area. Huge beer and cocktail selection. Reasonable prices. Minus points for dirty ladies room- very icky. 
12780 4 Tassilis is a blessing. The spicy south of the boarder kale wrap is something I eat 2 times (sometimes more) a week since I've discovered his gem. The energy of everyone is wonderful and full of love. I recommend this place to anyone including meat eaters. 
12781 4 LOVE! They need more seating so I can come and sit all day and consume massive amounts of this delicious coffee. Made with care and so delicious. Ask them for recommendations so you get something you will like. 
12782 4 Anahit is AMAZING. I wish I could write 100 5 star reviews about her. She did an amazing job with my wedding dress and takes so much pride in her work. If you're searching for someone you trust with your dress I promise you need to go with Anahit. 
12783 4 By far the most legit Hawaiian food I've had since I've moved to Texas from Hawaii. Love love love !!! Welcoming and kind owners as well! 
12784 0 Be careful, this place pretends to be "Austin" and instead turns into Dave & Busters (on a bad day). Nobody there from Austin Nobody there has a soul And the entire place smells like urine 
12785 3 The BBQ pork and BBQ chicken was delicioso. The coleslaw and BBQ beans were better than my husband's beans. The waitress was friendly and perfect with everything we ordered. We will return next year. 
12786 3 I got the Pad Se Ew with chicken. The texture of chicken sometimes weirdos me out, but this chicken passed my test. The flavor was great. The wait staff was attentive. My boyfriend got something with white rice, veggies, and beef. 
12787 3 Beautiful and relaxing environment to match a beautiful and relaxing massage. This was my first time, and most definitely will not be my last. The massage therapist was knowledgeable and provided an excellent massage that was personal to my bodies needs. 
12788 2 Tacos a la carte were excellent!! But service was not very friendly, I am not Mexican so I asked questions, my waiter was bothered about it! (rude). For that reason I wouldn't go back!! 
12789 4 Excellent beer selection. Friendly staff that understands what they are selling. Kudos to Sam for all the great advice. 
12790 4 I've been training with Rogue since 2006 and since the opening of their 1st retail in East Austin, it's only place I buy my running gear. The retail staff is very knowledgeable and helpful and their training staff is second to none! 
12791 4 Mike was recommended by our agent and did not disappoint. He was professional, timely and very knowledgeable. I would recommend him to anyone in need of a home inspector! 
12792 4 Awesome place. Especially there space is pretty spacious. So you can bring baby strollers with you when needed. 
12793 1 I would suggest only pancakes here. Other items were average. Not worth the 45 mins wait time. 
12794 4 Love this place! You can't beat the happy hour menu! The chicken katsu is always crispy and juicy and sushi/rolls are always fresh and delicious! 
12795 0 I ordered from this place tonight. I ordered 2 Cokes and got 1, asked for bacon on half my pizza and got it on the whole thing, my pizza was borderline burnt, and my mozzarella sticks were undercooked and floppy. Very gross, and will not be ordering from here again. 
12796 4 Great place for families. Good food at great prices. The place is clean and they attend you fast. 
12797 4 great craft beer selection. buffalo chicken crepe was perfectly proportioned and spicy and delicious. 
12798 4 Yes to everything. I'm pescatarian & it's tough to find a place that serves the best SALADS & AHI TUNA & BLACKBEAN BURGER for the rest of us out here. The Bloody Mary is different, but good if you like yours spicy. Servers are super friendly, such a fun enviornment. 
12799 4 I don't know about favoritism, but I've known Derek for years, and that's something he does not practice when it comes to business. Hands down best in Everett. 
12800 1 When you come in for the 2nd part of an oil consumption test, all they have to do is check the oil level, and you STILL have to wait 1 hour?!? Really?! Very bad communication with the customers. 
12801 4 Fukami has consistently impressed me and equally continues to raise the bar. My expectation for sushi and subsequent disappointment at Portland's other, less traditional Japanese cuisine, is reinforced by Fukami's dedicated approach. 
12802 4 As far as standard punk clubs go, The Know is now my favorite! The music was sooo original and engaging. And I enjoyed the vegan nachos and jello shots immensely. 
12803 4 Awesome environment and pretty decent coffee but it's the atmosphere that drew me to this place over others. 
12804 2 The corned beef was ok. I should have gotten the german pancakes. Those looked delicious. 
12805 4 Didn't know this was so close to my work.. food was excellent.. had the vegetarian platter.. yum will definitely be back.. 
12806 4 My favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is really fresh, the staff is friendly and always remember us and it's always fast. Don't be taken aback by the appearance or location, you definitely have to try this place out! 
12807 4 Spiro is a great owner with alot of Charisma. Doesnt even touch how good the food is. Best French fries around. 
12808 4 Amazing vegan breakfast tacos. Could have gone here for breakfast each morning of our trip, and been so happy. As a huge egg lover, I was pleasantly surprised by flavor the "egg" and potato taco had. They also had great salads options to go with the food. 
12809 0 Would like to go but I won't because I'm always concerned when you can't find an online menu WITH prices! There are too many other restaurants to choose from in Atlanta! 
12810 3 Love this place. It is very specific in its support of fly fishing and shooting, but if you are looking for high quality and hard to find excellence for your outdoor hobbies this is a great place to do it! 
12811 4 Wonderful selection of South Indian items - enjoyed trying a bit of each. Fresh Masala Dosas also served to the table. There were items that the kids liked too. 
12812 4 Hands down best Vietnamese soup spot in pdx. Move past Pho they have so many options. Get their early because they run out often. Once it's gone, it's gone. 
12813 4 Excellent food. The lasagna was amazing and the Stromboli was enormous. I would like to give 4.5 because the waiter lacked a personality. The owner was great and very personable. We will be back before our week ends here. 
12814 4 These guys are amazingly fast. I was there for all of 15 minutes.. and that's starting out 3rd in line. 
12815 4 Stopped in to look at used cars left with a brand new Kia Soul that I adore! Everyone was super friendly and helpful but an extra special shout out to Jay and V for making the experience easy and awesome! 
12816 4 Great grilled pork banh mi, first time patron. Nice owners,home made food. Only $4.50 for the generous size sandwich, great deal. Will be back Also dying to try the bun bo hue, which uses the same marinated pork. Two thumbs up from a Vietnamese foodie! 
12817 4 Great atmosphere. Owners support good social causes. Delicious food and drinks. I love it here! 
12818 4 I love this place! Unlike most restaurants, the food keeps getting better and better. We had a birthday celebration for my husband yesterday and they couldn't have been nicer. Really appreciate the service as well as the terrific food! 
12819 4 These folks really know MB's and did great work. 
12820 3 A friend recommended this as an anniversary spot, and I wasn't disappointed. As an app, the crepes were fantastic, and the entrees were pretty solid. The happy hour and brunch menus looked great, so we'll be back... 
12821 2 I ordered take-out from Little duck. I had the pad tai and spring rolls. I thought that both things were just okay. Nothing that I would rush back to have. My food was ready when they said it would be, the staff was friendly, and the portions large. 
12822 4 I had soup and salad, person who was serving really knowledgeable, soup was hot and tasty, salad dressing was little too much, but salad was fresh and I enjoyed it. Friendly atmosphere, just relaxed my Saturday lunch, thanks guys 
12823 2 All I can say is the guy at the counter and making food needs a serious attitude adjustment, The food is great and predictable. That being said, you would think customer service would be a best foot forward scenario. 
12824 3 Great stay. Very clean and friendly staff. Love the tv in the bathroom mirror. The rooms are spacious, the only negative is that their hallways are not decorated. Makes it feel not fancy as the rest of the place. 
12825 3 I love all of their cocktails, and I've never had anything that wasn't delicious. I don't like the menus to fill in, but honestly, the waiters always take our order, so it's never been much of an issue. The guacamole is really yummy. 
12826 4 Great food, very welcoming fun staff. 
12827 1 Although I enjoy the atmosphere and dessert choices here, I have been so consistently dissapointed by the quality of the food that I do not go anymore. It just doesn't taste all that good. 
12828 4 This is my favorite bike shop in Portland. The staff was very helpful and they are really knowledgable. I'll definitely be going back with all of my biking needs! 
12829 4 Fantastic food, very vegetarian friendly. I got the sweet potato tacos, they were delicious. The happy hour is half off all draft beers... Amazing! Would recommend and will be back. 
12830 3 A great find on Yelp when we visited Austin last weekend! Came minutes before opening & people were pouring in when the doors opened. Great food & great service from everyone. Loved the fun atmosphere! 
12831 1 Another iconic eating establishment myth debunked. Not worth rhe hype. Neither one of the vegan or cheese pizzas did anything for us. Vegan was bland. Cheese was non descript. If you like thin crust it gets another star. I preferred mine w/o fixins. 
12832 3 Just got off the plane and came to the pizza place with the highest reviews! Fun little joint with good pie. Not to greasy but just greasy enough. Excellent selection of toppings. The garlic knots were free with yelp checkin!!!! 
12833 2 It is a really pretty place, thier sushi is ok, the sea-weed was a bit tough. I found that odd while eating. I did the brothy noodel dish that you cook at the table.. It was ok, not enough noodels, loads of veggies.. So all in all not that memorable. 
12834 3 I highly recommend El Patron. The food was excellent the service was just as good and I couldn't have been happier. I wish I lived closer that way I could go back but until then 4 stars it is! 
12835 4 A friend brought me here one night and I had the raspberry flavored chicken and I was in heaven. Would recommend over Chipotle any day 
12836 3 Great food. I had dumplings with pork and beef noodle soup. And the beef was just perfect, but broth could use little bit more spice. 
12837 3 Food and service were excellent. For ten dollars a glass of house wine, the pour should have been a little more generous 
12838 4 In and out wicked fast with a delicious, and affordable, gyro in your hand. I thought that one wouldn't fill me up, but i was clearly mistaken. Best gyro i've had/am planning to have in this city. 
12839 4 Great local BBQ spot. Wonderful sauces. Tasty craft beer. Love the brisket, pulled pork, red skin potatoes and okra. 
12840 4 Pros: Great ambiance, amazing food & wine, great service. Cons: Expensive wine list (that's probably why it was so good!) 
12841 0 I'm from TX & 4 dinner I didn't want to go out to eat, so I decided to order from May's. My friend & were so disappointed! The food has no flavor! The egg rolls don't taste like "normal egg rolls". 
12842 3 The Hot Gobbler. That's what I had on recommendation from staff. It was good, a decent size, and yes, it was spicy. Honestly, I stopped in because it is very close to class for me but I will definitely stop in again. 
12843 3 It's your standard REI. Conveniently located off highway and near other stores. Clean, organized, well stocked. 
12844 3 Paid $32 for a complete wash, and was happy with the results. I typically go to a MooMoo or some other automatic wash, but this is MUCH better because the "finishers" (guys who wipe down the car) get all the spots the machines missed. 
12845 2 AMAZING food and drinks.... waiter personalities kind of dry and ambiance could be more inviting. Service INCREDIBLY SLOW. Might come back but wouldn't bring friends again. 
12846 2 Called at 7am and was able to get an 8am appointment on July 4th! I have extensions so they charged a little extra. Would have been great to have a sit under dryer for 20 min or so. Overall great experience. Would go back again. 
12847 3 Great seafood and a great location. Outdoor dining overlooking the harbor. 
12848 3 Food is good and consistent. I have been a few times and it's always been tasty. The service is usually a little slow but never rude. Good place for a casual dinner and a beer. 
12849 4 Unreal tacos. Best migas ever. Delicious guac, homemade chips. Al pastor is wonderful. Pretty much can't go wrong here, especially for the price. Yum. 
12850 0 If I could give no stars I would. This place sucks almost as much as the snobby owner does. Matt has a hard time putting his money where his mouth is and fails to deliver basic customer service every time I come here. 
12851 3 Excellent selection of interesting, tasty beers. The tasting room is pretty small, so don't bring a group here - best to go with 2-3 others. I haven't tried the food yet, but it looks great. Give the IPA a try! 
12852 3 Great food, good prices. It's around $10 for HUGE burritos. It can get busy but waitstaff handles it graciously and does their best to expedite wait times. Staff is friendly and service is pretty quick. They also deliver which is a huge plus. 
12853 4 Best place for authentic Japanese food in town...real Ikura! They are also extremely friendly. Master Chef Atsuomi Yozen and Edward were awesome! Come here! 
12854 4 Fixed my tire issue for free an gave excellent advice. They helped me figure out an economical plan for my most recent purchase which was very awesome! So glad this is my neighborhood bike shop :) 
12855 4 Finally had a chance to eat at the new location. A little smaller dining room but the food was great, as usual. I hope they thrive here so l can keep coming back. 
12856 3 Good food but really crowded. Dimly lit which is good for dates, but not foe the rest of us. Very friendly staff. Fills up fast. 
12857 3 These guys are always friendly and helpful. They are quick and I have never had a problem with my car. The area is a bit sketch, which is why I gave it a 4. 
12858 4 Great cut from Anderson. Low cost yet he still took a lot of time and care to give me a good hair cut and beard trim. Definitely going back. 
12859 4 Best coffee joint in town. One word: pour over coffee. The salmon lox is serious too. Only thing is, be prepared to wait for a seat! 
12860 2 We live to EAT here but not necessarily like to be served here. Service has been so bad the last three times! We have continued to come back for the food but after tonite, will likely not. Spent 165 and would. Have had better service at Panera 
12861 2 A little on the pricey side, but the pizza is really good. Nice, thin crust and quality ingredients... no big greased mess here. We had delivery, so I have no idea what dine in is like. We liked it and will eat pizza from Rebellious Tomato again. 
12862 2 Went here for my friend's birthday dinner. The customer service was ON POINT, and the waiter even got someone to sing happy birthday to my friend! 5 star for customer service and ambience, but 2 stars for the food, as it wasn't great, but just okay. So, averagely, 3 stars. 
12863 0 I went with my husband & sat at the bar but the environment was weird. The bartender was rude so we paid & left. 
12864 0 world famous? never heard of gus. never again... only difference of gus fried chicken and kfc is spicy, yeah, i like spicy, but any world famous?? and beans and piece of bread, aahrrr... it's no worth a try 
12865 4 This is "my" Dunkin Donuts. I go here atleast 5 times a week. The managers in here are super nice. They always get my order right and have a smileon their face. They are all very personable. 
12866 2 Fairly par for indian buffet. If pressed I'd say a bit below average. 2 1/2 stars. 
12867 2 Every time I come into this place...I'm overwhelmed with the smell of cleaner. The cheesecake is very overrated. Very basic cheesecake you can find in any restaurant etc. 
12868 1 Not impressed. They have the overly Americanized style of Chinese food that I despise. The sauces were thick and gravy-like. Nothing had much flavor. There are much better Asian restaurants on Hawthorne (Fujin / Pho Green Papaya, Thanh Thao, Veggie Thai) 
12869 3 Great food and fast service. The charm of this place is that it's a hole in the wall and churns out terrific, flavorful dishes. My go-to dishes are the vegetable tofu pad thai and pad see ew. 
12870 4 I love this place for their sno balls. I'm from Louisiana and theirs are just as good! Fair prices for a tasty cold treat! 
12871 4 Awesome food, whether it's a sub, dinner plate, or catering. Bob is a wicked nice guy too. He always has a smile and hello for the customers. 
12872 4 Great neighborhood bar. Plenty of TVs, great staff, dart boards, cheap beer nightly. 
12873 4 Best dentist ever. So glad they moved out the old building. This place is nice and clean and staff are fantastic - not to mention awesome dentist. And I am completely afraid of dentists! 
12874 2 Great service. Ok food. I have eaten a lot of german food and i wanted it to be more flavorful. Worth a stop for sure. 
12875 4 I love Cooper's Hawk drinks and food. This place is good for intimate or group dinners. It is really hard to find a place that consistent with drinks, food and dessert. The bonus is that they make their own wine. 
12876 4 Will be recommending this office to my friends. Glad to have started treatment there. 
12877 3 My wife and I have been back a couple of times and just sat at the bar for drinks and dessert. JP is a great bartender and is great to chat with. 
12878 3 Been here many times. Other than the terrible line situation where you stand in the middle of the restaurant, the place is amazing. Some of the best food in the industry. I give it a 4 for the bad line setup. But the food is easily a 5. 
12879 1 Was a big fan of the taste but not the biggest fan to the aftermath. Was sick for 2 days after eating here and I won't go back. 
12880 4 I love this place! It's right in the middle of Assembly Row with a great atmosphere. The workers are always nice and attentive and the sundaes are delicious! I always look forward to going here 
12881 2 Over $30 for 2 burgers, 2 drinks, fries. I know it is a trendy hipster spot. The burgers are good, and I like their eco-conscious business model. However we had a less than attentive server, and just were not wowed with the overall experience. 
12882 3 Good, spicy chicken. Spicy beans. Good fried green tomatoes. Don't eat them right away, hottt. Good service, your Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken Tea cup stays filled. The only drawback(besides parking, take public transp) were the tiny tables. Hard to keep everything on the table. 
12883 0 This place was horrible. Service was absolutely terrible. Forgot my sons drink, appetizer, salad,.... People around us that got there after us had their food. Told us they lost our ticket. Just paid for the drinks and walked away. Will never be back. 
12884 1 The food was okay, but overpriced. Plus, I got charged extra for carne asada on the quesadilla, even though the menu does not indicate that it is extra. 
12885 2 Room was extremely clean!! I didn't like the hidden resort fee of $17. If I know that was added on I would have found another place 
12886 4 Alexis helped me tonight, great service. Recommended for late night. I'm right down the road and felt like ordering a late night pizza. She made it quick and easy. A+! 
12887 3 I've been to a couple of Home Depots and such. Lowe's by far has the friendliest and most helpful employees. Yay! This is where I buy all my house handy-woman stuff. 
12888 4 On vacation, one of my kids had a little blow to the head. These nurses and the doctor were awesome!! Calming her down and taking great care of us! Thank you! It was quick, clean and very friendly!!! 
12889 0 This place is awful. If you enjoy ordering a Jack and coke and being ignored for 12 minutes when the the bartender finally acknowledges you again as you request the same beverage and the response is "you can see we are busy" that's a joke. #shittyservice #attitude #terriblebar 
12890 0 Staff is overbearing and seems more interested in signing you up for a credit card than helping you select the right jewelry. It's clear that they are compensated more for these credit card sign-ups than they are for sales commission. Kay is a financing operation disguised as a jewelry store. 
12891 4 Great restaurant! Love their pizza and great prices! Cute, friendly, neighborhood find. Chopped salad is awesome and great dirty martinis. Highly recommend!! 
12892 3 My go-to place for brunch when entertaining moms and dads! Fresh food, solid flavors, and a tasty Bloody Mary. 
12893 3 Great everyday bar. A little bit of everyone shows up here, and the menu is pretty standard, everything I've eaten is great! They also sell my favorite burger here, mmm. Definitely gets crowded on weekends, but what decent bar on boylston doesn't? No complaints. 
12894 4 I had a Cuban sandwich and it was just as good as any place in Miami. My wife had the Carne Asada and it was super tasty too! La comida es riquisima! 
12895 0 I've been there a few times and each time the meat has tasted old (chicken and beef). Also I paid $1.30 for 10 chips. C'mon at least give me half a bag. I don't think I'll be back to this location again. 
12896 4 Great experience. The attendant was spot on. When I was done eating, i simply sent him a text and BAM! My car was ready. 
12897 1 Smash fries were swimming in oil. My burger was dripping oily mayo. The overall taste of the Georgia was pretty disappointing. They did use good ingredients, hence the two stars, but everything started to go downhill from there. After having Smashburger in other states, this is no bueno. 
12898 4 The food was seasoned and prepared to perfection. The service was very good, but I felt that their prices were a little on the high side for your average customer. I believe my plate was like $44. Overall, it was a really nice dining experience. 
12899 4 I have eaten here twice and each time it was amazing! The portions are massive, it is very fresh, and the flavors delicious. 
12900 4 Love this place! So healthy and fresh. The people that work there are amazing, and you have to try the cheese bread with your bowl! 
12901 2 I like how this frozen self serve yogurt has many different flavors to chose from as well as toppings. Took my family here & they have yummy smoothies as well. The actual frozen yogurts with toppings you create go sell by however many pounds it weighs which is pretty cool... 
12902 4 Always great service and even better ice cream. I go here often for my ice cream fix! 
12903 3 Seen some bad reviews on this joint but it was cool to me, had the fish tacos they were damn good. The margaritas was strong which was a good thang service good I will be back when spring hit. 
12904 4 I thought it was fabulous. Artisan pizza was very tasty. Custard Sunday was so good! Nice beer selection too. My only feedback is it's a bit noisy. They just need to install something to grab the noise. It's great to see that mall coming back around. 
12905 0 The website and front doors of this place advertise hours of operation that the business does not keep. The place is managed like shit. I can't imagine it will stay in business unless they either shape up of fire the managers and hire new ones. 
12906 3 The atmosphere is casual upscale elegance. The food is fantastic!!! Large portions and great wait staff and solo artist 
12907 3 Imbeccable service from Marcus. Citrus salad and burgers great. Deviled eggs need some work, but then again I'm comparing to my mom's. 
12908 1 Kate the bartender ruined his whole experience. It was good until I ordered a drink from her and she treated me with such disgust for no reason! Won't be back thanks to Kate! 
12909 4 Great staff! Very kind, helpful and thorough. The system is very efficient, I didn't have to wait around. I am very happy I found 512 Eye and will absolutely be recommending them to anyone looking for a new optometrist! 
12910 3 Nice authentic Mexican food. Doubled checked my food before leaving to make sure I had everything there. Good portion of carnitas and good amount of cheese on the quesadilla. Would recommend for Mexican food. It was ready promptly and would order again. 
12911 1 Poor ambience. Very flimsy furniture in a cramped room. Our furniture moved and shook each time someone at the adjacent table moved. Food was average. 
12912 4 Both Josh's helped us tonight and they gave outstanding service. Very polite, on top of things, and simply added to the great experience we had tonight! Food and service were both incredible. 
12913 4 The hour ride was well worth it and will be taking it again n again n again! Haven't eaten french toast in 50yrs, the french toast at Jac's....amazing!!!!! 
12914 3 Asian dishes are good but the sushi is what makes Blue Ginger one of our weekly stops. Without doubt one of the best places for very fresh sushi in all Columbus! 
12915 4 Excellent Big Mama enchilada and Blood Orange Margarita. Great service, too. 
12916 2 This is a decent place for delivery but the actual location is really small. The staff is always nice and the food is mostly okay. The Indonesian fried rice is good but I'm not a fan of their Thai iced tea. 
12917 2 Pad thai pretty good. Once was a little salty. Tried sweet sour pork too. Was ok. Not best or worst I've had. Crab puffs good. It's decent food. Cooked fast for delivery and pick up. 
12918 4 I took my son here once and he loved it! He had so much fun exercising and didn't even know that he was doing it! They also have an area to play dodgeball which was his favorite part. Great place to bring the kids! 
12919 4 It's a pleasure doing business with them. Very good service and hospitable staff. 
12920 3 We were in Atlanta for a week and looking for a nice place to listen to music, eat, and have a drink. We had great wings, friendly Service and the music was hip hop. 
12921 4 Owners are so nice and services are reasonably priced (& no wait!). The massage chairs are nice and well maintained and everything seemed clean. And my toes look great! 
12922 4 First time in my life to call a tow truck for help. So pleasantly surprised by the friendliness and excellent service. Driver was there within 30 minutes and saved my day. Definitely would recommend to anyone. 
12923 3 Had some amazing lobster here while attending the National Assn. of Realtor convention. A bit pricey but certainly delicious with great service. 
12924 4 Erika is the best! Very laid back and makes the experience a breeze. She always remembers my preferences and I never have to tell her anything twice. 
12925 4 Amazing food! Pho some of the best we have had! Great service, family friendly, def a family favorite! The beef pho special a must try! 
12926 3 Small place with decent food. All fresh. We stayed near it so we went. It was adequate. 
12927 4 One of the best places to get pizza in Richmond and Vancouver. It's a small little place, not much customers in this location. 
12928 4 bacon eggs bennysss!! bacon bloody marysss!! nom nom nom i love genies. so much. i could eat here everyday for the rest of my life!! 
12929 2 My favorite slices here are the Tomato Basil. But they run out quick, so be sure to ask! 
12930 2 The food was very good along with the service. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the food and Turkish traditional food. 
12931 2 Not the best place to have breakfast but the food is ok. 
12932 3 Delicious fresh sushi at a reasonable price. Waiters were courteous and attentive. Great place for a quick meal or nice date. 
12933 2 The check-in attendant had the wrong date for our return, so they failed to wash the car as we requested, but they made it somewhat right. I just prefer the other option, Airport Fast Park. 
12934 4 Love this place so much! So many options! You can buy a slice and sti down and one of their cute little booths like a face! Just wished everything was a little cheaper. 
12935 4 Nice place to grab a cold one! And a bite! Excellent atmosphere, good happy hour! I really like this place, perfect for the neighborhood ! 
12936 4 Awesome customer service! I got a lot of help when requesting an auto loan. Thank you Brenda and Preston! 
12937 3 Great small place, don't come with large crowd, it seats 20!!!! The selection of 5 oysters and a great small wine list say "come on back for more" 
12938 4 Delicious and fresh ice cream. Unique flavors. A true gem! 
12939 3 The Sablefish was delicious! Thanks to Hiro for the custom surprise order! Everything was perfect. 
12940 4 Your food is awesome, we can't wait for you to open in Hilliard so we will have a shorter drive!!! 
12941 2 We came by at midnight because their hours are supposed to be until 2am, and go figure... they are closed! What the heck! I need my pearls and what now ??? Lol 
12942 4 Family run business, yummy baked goods and great breakfast, coffee basically you won't go wrong with what you order here 
12943 3 One of our favorite burger joints. Giving it a four instead of a five because it can get pretty noisy. Always good service and love that they have a gluten free bun. 
12944 1 If you want some authentic Japanese food, don't come here! All of their dishes are not anything near authentic. On the up side, the service is great! It's the only reason this place gets a two stars from me. Overpriced and unauthentic.. Not recommending and will not come back! 
12945 3 had a very good meal while traveling though the airport. I would say give it a try. 
12946 3 Been a favorite spot for years! Plates are smaller under new ownership, but just as good! The orange chicken as well as chicken katsu are phenomenal! 
12947 4 my favorite pizza in the boston area. I've never had a problem with the service and the food has always been wonderful. 
12948 0 This is the worst brewery in Portland. The food was garbage, the beer was worse, and the service was on par with an angry McDonalds. Great outdoor seating though! 
12949 3 One of my faves in So. Austin! Great house margaritas no mixes all fresh! Food is always great. They serve fried plantains to die for! You won't be disappointed 
12950 3 Really great local moving company. Just moved us from Boston to Cambridge in about 3 hours. The crew was incredibly friendly, took good care of all of our belongings, and they came in at the low end of the quoted price. 
12951 4 Amazing amazing amazing! Great service, great food, great location, great music, great prices, short wait, great all around. Look at the pic I posted as proof! 
12952 4 Nina does an exceptional job with such great ae rice and personality. She remembers me every time and alway knows what I want. I highly recommend this place as your go-to nail salon in Medford. You won't be disappointed! 
12953 3 The food and service was great! I had the filet and it was cooked perfectly! I also had the lobster bisque and it lacked flavor which is the only reason I am giving this place four stars. It's a little pricey but is great for a nice date night 
12954 3 I like the strawberry mint hookah. The tea they serve is great as well. Parking? That can be a problem. The building is old too. Lots of bums outside. 
12955 0 Horrible! The food taste terrible. It all smells completely burned, and the waiter was extremely rude. Also the sauce put on the meat taste terrible 
12956 4 So many selections, I love! And the boba had a little hint of sweetness which was really nice. Really nice place with lots of nice windows. 
12957 3 overall a good experience. there were only two of us waiting but it took awhile for my scan.i appreciated the large waiting room. facility felt a bit old since it was in a shopping center it also felt odd..... 
12958 4 Delicious BBQ. Had the sliced beef sandwich and potato salad. Love the porch atmosphere. Hard 8 you've met your match! 
12959 1 1. Great view, especially late in the afternoon or at sunset. 2. Food was overpriced, and taste/quality were entirely underwhelming. 3. Service was OK, but not attentive, especially when not very busy. 4. Went on a Living Social coupon - without that discount, I might have rated it even lower. 
12960 4 By far my wife's favorite food truck--merited a repeat visit on way back to airport. Kabobs were flavorful without being charred (she is concerned about healthfulness of blackened meats). Sides were nice complement and service was friendly. 
12961 4 Martsa's lunch buffet is awesome and such a great deal. I'm sad that they've dropped their lunch specials, but since the remodel - it's a nice place to take someone to dinner now too. 
12962 3 We went for a farewell treat for a collegue. The ambience was nice. The food is good. Liked the starters. 
12963 4 Wow the burgers here are awesome. The service is fast and friendly. I'll definitely return to this location. 
12964 4 Dr. Walters and his staff are the best! No wait, friendly staff and easy parking. Dr. Walters is extremely knowledgeable and takes his time. I am very satisfied with my foot surgery and am now pain-free. I highly recommend him! 
12965 0 Out of Business in Oregon due to franchise going bankrupt. 
12966 3 Everything our table ordered looked fresh, well-prepared, and tasty. I heard no complaints. We all left pleased. I had the haddock and it was wonderful! 
12967 3 朋友生日时去吃的，提前订了位置和烤鸭。 餐馆依水，景致不错。 在我看来只要不是特别惊艳或难吃，手法又相似，烤鸭和全聚德就没什么差别。 凉皮很好吃哦，虾，蟹也都不错，鸡的味道一般，还吃过什么忘记了。 总体菜色味道都还挺好的。 
12968 4 This is where we buy our costumes every single year!!! Great selections and the kids are always happy with what we find!! 
12969 4 One of the best pizza restaurants in the area. The ingredients are always fresh and the heat of the pizza ovens gives a perfect slight burn to parts of the crust. The mix of standard seating and high tops provide a great atmosphere. Highly recommend! 
12970 3 I have had what they call Road Kill and this time had Cat Fish it was very good. Be careful when you bite into Cat Fish its scolding hot let it cool off first Service so far has been great. 
12971 0 Horrible service, they are never in a good mood and have their "favorites" they choose to give better service too. Sad because the food is decent. Not good enough to put up with the poor service for. 
12972 4 ROE- i cannot say enough good things about our experience at roe. every course was amazing and the service charming and super professional. this is not to be missed is portland. 
12973 3 Meat samosas were a bit dry. Malai kofta was delicious as was the lamb tikka masala. Gulab jamun was also delightful but wish it came more than two an order! 
12974 4 Knowledgeable and friendly staff - popped in for some dirt, rose spray and wandered about viewing the plants. Repeatedly received good advice from the long term employees. Recommended. 
12975 4 Fast and friendly service. I get most of our clothes cleaned here and have had great luck. Shirts come out clean and crisp with the perfect amount of starch. American Dry Cleaners clean your clothes quickly with a smile. 
12976 3 good place if you want to eat a samwitch outdoors in Union Square, especially if you value an establishment that uses local / sustainable ingredients. 
12977 3 What a great pub! The service here is amazing and food portion is pretty big and filling. The server that was helping us gave me a great drink recommendation. The seafood noodles were delicious but was too much for my tiny stomach to handle. 
12978 4 They do an excellent job! Love Denise! She's terrific! The stylists are professional and courteous and take their time in doing a great job, unlike some other places I've been that rush to get you out. Brookhaven Great Clips is the spot for a sweet cut! 
12979 3 We love our apartment! The maintenance staff has been quick to respond and the office staff is super helpful and friendly. It's beautiful, green, and quiet! 
12980 4 I went here a few years ago before I was married. I must say, this is one of the better steaks that I've had in Austin. Tender, juicy and just plain delicious. The decor is nice and the waitstaff is great. I'd hug the chef if I could. 
12981 4 This is a great nail salon. They do a fantastic job and the salon itself is very clean. Ultimately, my manicure was so well done and lasted a long time!!! 
12982 3 The neighborhood coffee shop in one of my favorite neighborhoods in Portland. Love the theme. Love the coffee. I had one of the finest lattes I've ever had yesterday, prompting this review. The niece and nephew love the hot cocoa. The crowd is very interesting. A unique Portland experience. 
12983 3 Very tasty and a lot for your money! Line was long but ice cream did not disappoint! 
12984 2 Stopped in for a quick stout while out perusing the neighborhood. 
12985 4 This is a fast, delicious, and healthy place to eat and the service is always incredible. My go-to place for lunch or dinner. A small size fills me up and is inexpensive. Not sure how authentic brazilian it is, but it sure is delicious. 
12986 3 Just American Chinese but fresh, delicious American Chinese. The combos are a pretty good deal. Sometimes Beef and Broccoli can be too stringy but this was spot on. The cook may not be the most personable guy but I keep coming back for the food. 
12987 0 Thought I'd give it one more chance. NEVER AGAIN. Crap food, crap service, lousy beer selection. Took 15 minutes just to get the check. It's an AIRPORT, PEOPLE HAVE TO CATCH A PLANE. Just should have walked off. 
12988 3 Always love za zang mien. But I find their 'Sweet and sour port' much more delicious! Love it. Will certainly go again! 
12989 2 The coconut cream bao is a nice alternative for those who want a warm not-too-sweet dessert 
12990 2 I'm feeling sad. I just got two ricotta cannoli, and neither of them were filled in the middle. It's not like it used to be. The Modern was my go-to for many, many years, but I'm not sure what I'll do now. 
12991 4 Such a great place to come to for dinner. It's located right next door to Trader Joe's and is a perfect place for date night. The menu offers delicious options for brunch, lunch and dinner. Parking is limited, but the food is worth it. 
12992 0 shower head broken Shower backed up (gross) Dirty floors Discussing elevator floors/ walls Windows VERY thin so you hear the planes taking off - airports close Pros: Potential if they just learn how to CLEAN! 
12993 4 Every time I come here I am never disappointed. The sushi is delicious, fresh and comes out quick!! The prices are very affordable and servers always attentive and kind. Definitely recommend. 
12994 4 This place was amazing! The breakfast burrito is delicious along with their weekly pie selection. Pie is randomly picked from customer submissions on Wednesday and made for the weekend. Price is right and the owners are very engaging but not overly so. I'll definitely be back! 
12995 4 Great service. Food is the best in Waterford lakes. Wine tasting and cheese pairing. Nick is a great server. 
12996 4 Great lunch, informal, freindly, good food, good price. All the staff were outgoing and exceptional. Will go again next time I'm in town 
12997 4 The best food ever, wonderful atmosphere, great bartenders, great prices, If you haven't been your missing out on a great time! 
12998 2 Place is small, and always need to wait a line. A good place to have lunch nearby, but it doesn't worth coming all the way. Better than the one in hmart 
12999 3 A terrific breakfast - enormous servings with farm-fresh ingredients. The French toast with lingonberry syrup was wonderful. Excellent coffee, beautifully poached eggs. Only downside - would not heat the syrup for pancakes. Still, would happily go back. 
13000 4 Their breakfast tacos are HUGE and only $1.95 per taco! I thought I had accidentally ordered a burrito when I first saw the chorizo, egg, and cheese taco I had ordered. The salsas are fresh made and delicious, as well!! Also try the huevos rancheros, great choice! :) 
13001 1 Ambience and decor are nice. Food is below average. Semi soggy tempura. Over-cooked filet mignon. Average service. 
13002 4 Great location for my son's wedding and reception. Outstanding staff, wedding planner, food, photographer, and ambience. If you're wondering if a wedding at Disney is worth it, the answer is yes. You get what you pay for, and you get the best...even if a small wedding. 
13003 4 By far my favorite for mexican food in the seaport district. The drinks are pretty good, could stand to be just a little stronger. The guac is SO good!! And I'm a fan of the queso. Chicken enchiladas were really good. Portion was huge. 
13004 4 Best veggie burger in town! Excellent servers, great atmosphere, and minimal noise. They also have an outdoor patio and it is pet friendly out there. We will definitely be back soon. 
13005 2 It was okay... I had asked for pineapple on my pizza and was given a delivery time of 6:30. 7:30: pizza shows up. No pineapple. No notice pizza will take over an extra hour. I will give it another try, however I will go and order there! 
13006 2 Service is not good, waiters come slowly and food comes slowly too. It's awful for hungry people to wait that long and it's not a very good experience. 
13007 4 Do you like good meat? Make the trip here! Remember to take a number though; don't be like me and stand around until someone will help you, they won't. I stood around (like a moron) for 10 min. before I realized how the system worked. 
13008 0 Does not make items not on the menu. My friend and I went to get the infamous Quesarito and employee said they knew how to make it but denied our request. 
13009 2 The frozen yogurt and smoothies are really good. I like the ambiance and the decor of the place is pretty unique. However the service was not the best... not very friendly, that's why I'm giving it only 3 stars. 
13010 3 Great menu and location in the heart of downtown Decatur. Have a sangria and enjoy the on street seating. We had the tostones, empanadas, and ceviche. My wife is Colombian and she approves Calle Latina:) 
13011 4 Wow! What an amazing experience it was to have Rachel as my photographer on my big day! I am beyond delighted! Seamless, fun, creative, and relaxed! Brilliant! Cannot wait to see our wedding pics! What a dream!!!! Thank you Rachel!!! 
13012 3 If you want to be close to the airport for an early flight, this hotel is very close to the airport and has a free shuttle to and from. There's a small but decent restaurant inside, in case it's winter and you don't want to leave to get food. 
13013 0 Overpriced food, run by an american company that clearly doesnt know what these chains need, and they cant seem to nail the service. Ive had some lovely servers, but overall, it seems like this place isnt run very well. Will never return. 
13014 4 They use new sealed instruments each time. They Always do a good job and they are very nice. Massage chairs, fish tank, etc. Are able to accommodate 6 pedicures on each side so a group of 12 is no problem. Great color selection and "packages". 
13015 4 I've had these guys over for 3 separate jobs and each time they are professional, efficient and nice. We tried a Craigslist plumber once and he was just awful. Pay a little more and go with these guys. Will call them again with our next issue (hope there's no more!). 
13016 4 Great SoCo spot to eat. Outstanding food and service. Don't miss the migas. We'll be back. 
13017 0 Stay home and eat your own poo. It will taste better and won't make you as sick. Bad even for Chinese food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You have been warned. 
13018 4 It's rare to find gluten-free food that people NOT allergic to gluten would willingly eat. Most desserts, especially, taste dry and chalky. Not Glutenus Minimus' stuff. The cookies are so delicious, I specifically look for them at Cafe Zing in Porter Square Books. 
13019 0 ZERO STARS. i placed an order for delivery that they said would take half an hour.... and they just never showed up. NEVER AGAIN 
13020 4 This experience is a definite must for any fan of the franchise. The closest you'll ever get to being in one of the movies. I highly recommend this attraction. You also get to meet the characters! 
13021 4 Great fast-casual adaptation of Mediterranean food. Combo bowl over rice or lamb shawarma over rice are my favorites. 
13022 3 Super cute place, indoor or outdoor seating with cozy feel. Cute was really good with lots of options. Nice mix of comfort food and health food options. 
13023 4 Super good! I recommend the chicken makhani it was the best Indian dish I've ever had. Service was very good as well. Definitely try it out. 
13024 4 Me and my family visiting town for the first time. Highly recommend this place to everyone- amazing food, staff , friendly environment Portions are just perfect and haven't had food like this for a very long time. Absolutely loving it ! 
13025 3 The burgers were great but the sides were nothing special. The service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere is just like any other sports bar anywhere else. 
13026 2 this place is awesome. if you know the deal, you'll bypass the stuff on the shelves and go to the back of the store where they have the home-cooked sweets and food. go for those. p.s. park in stop and shop parking lot for free and walk down tremont 
13027 2 I wanted this to be better. I love wursts and I love Texas. Just didn't work out. Wursts were pretty good, not great. 
13028 4 Yes as good as it gets. Great food. Great waitstaff. All around my favorite restaurant. 
13029 1 Overpriced. My scallops were overdone, the tortellini was undercooked and the dessert was bitter. Great presentation and ambience but short on flavor. 
13030 4 The best Shrimp and grits I've ever had I would come back to Orlando just to try another order of them 
13031 4 This joint just opened 5 days. A lot bigger & brighter than the main store in North Road. The food and service is as good as the main store. Price is quite reasonable. Really can't complain too much. But be prepare more loonies to pay for the street parking metres. 
13032 3 Stocked up on essential British Christmas items. Expensive but that's to be expected as they are all imports. A freezer at the back even has black/white pudding, haggis, meat pies and sausage rolls!!!!! 
13033 0 We bought a chocolate peanut butter pie, which was a multi-layered combo of instant pudding, store bought crust, and a strange peanut butter custard. It was a big gelatinous mush. It's one use may be to throw in people's faces... 
13034 3 I always have so much fun dancing too the cover bands! Plus the line to get in late on a weekend night is not too long and its 5 bucks to get in. 
13035 3 Food is pretty good. The place is small and they need to be more organized. Parking is also limited. 
13036 3 Had the Crispy Duck with Sweet Chili Basil and sticky rice. Loved it. 
13037 4 guys got me on the road quick and fast after hertz told me to go some place else thank you 
13038 3 Very clean! The food was delicious and the service was good as well. Lots of options to choose from. Works defienetly recommend 
13039 4 Saw your messages abouts bags. Have you seen there new reuseable bag made in Lowell, Ma. It is great. 
13040 4 Nice staff and welcoming environment with lots of parking space. Lots of plugs located underneath the high tables as well as good WiFi connection. Simple pleasures! 
13041 4 Best Sushi I've had anywhere in the Portland metro. In addition to their amazing dishes, they also serve beers from their neighbor business, Roscoe's (typically 20+ beers on tap). Always a great experience in terms of food, drink and service. Bonus that it's located in Montavilla neighborhood. 
13042 3 They have great selections of cakes, buns and soft bread here. red beans and taro are my favor. I strongly recommended their taro cake. is light and fluffy with yummy taro. It's good if you don't want anything too sweet that American bakeries are know for. 
13043 4 The only authentic Persian food that you can have in Portland. Go with Koobideh with rice seasoning with Saffron. Mast o Khiar and Salad Shirazi. 
13044 4 This is the best location that I have been to. Great service. Great food. Please don't change what you're doing. I've been to other locations and the meal was disappointing along with the service. These guys are the bomb! 
13045 3 Nice, original choices. Good taste and plenty in size. A bit on the pricier side though. Long wait times for brunch is a downside. 
13046 3 Great college bar, but just that... If that is what you are looking for, then this is definitely the place... If not, go someplace else 
13047 3 Ohhh... who doesn't like sausage! Great food and the puff pastries are to die for. Been going to this place since HS and that was a while ago. 
13048 4 My favorite Asian food in Austin! I have not had a plate that was not absolutely delicious from this place (no wonder it's always crowded.) Love the Vietnamese flank steak. Jazz bands on weekend afternoons. 
13049 4 Love my service, why can't get to my yelp Page and erase intruders' settings on my service? 
13050 4 Sam's Glass did a really good job for me in regards to my shower enclosure. He was awesome ! He did a really good job and was really organized. -Teresa 
13051 4 The totopos were such an amazing treat. Definitely recommend ordering as an appetizer. The chicken and dumplings as well as the burger were delicious as well. Will go back whenever we're in town again. 
13052 4 Great place. Authentic French Cuisine with a personal touch in a great walkable neighborhood. 
13053 3 Fun little brewery to visit, though the tasting room gets crowded. Excellent selections on tap and, if you take the tour, you can try beer fresh out of the fermenter. 
13054 4 Best hookah in Orlando.. The place is clean and the good thing about the place they care about their customers .. I highly recommend this hookah lounge 
13055 4 This is my favorite place for a drink on a Friday afternoon after work. Go upstairs to the second floor and head out to the terrace. Enjoy the view of the Capitol and Congress avenue. This bar is great for people watching and enjoying a warm evening in Texas. 
13056 4 Brought my husband here for his Birthday and it was a great experience. Our waitress was Jenny and she was awesome. She helped us through the menu because there were soo many choices. Everything we had was delicious! Thanks for the experience. 
13057 4 Fresh, fast and tasty! I think it's the best burger in Dallas and if you're watching the calories go for the baby kale salad with the veggie pattie. 
13058 4 Vibrant interior. Good service. Amazing truffle grits. 
13059 4 I go out of my way to come eat here. My favorite sandwiches, and the people are very nice and personable. Say hi to Brian and Edward next time you're there :). 
13060 4 Great food. Service can be slow because they stay pretty busy but it's worth the wait. In Portland you'd be standing in line waiting to get in and then waiting again once seated. 
13061 3 Right in Faneuil Hall Marketplace. Had a great sale section (yes, I only check out the sale section at a store!) It's a great place to grab some casual clothes! Sales reps were friendly and helpful!! Good job guys!! I got my retail therapy!!! http://www.ae.com/web/index.jsp 
13062 4 Outstanding service, knowledgeable staff and delicious food made this evening's meal one to remember. Truly authentic Mexican food is difficult to find, but that's what you get at El Patron! 
13063 4 There's a variety of candy from all around the world, it's amazing really. I felt like a kid in a candy store! Price wise it's pretty affordable and customer service is fantastic, there's a lot of positive vibes! 
13064 4 I loved their shawarma , falafel as well as their rice pudding! The people there are so friendly and it's always busy! Their prices also reasonable and the location is good. 
13065 4 This is our first visit, me and my two grandchildren absolutely loved it. Food was good signature sauce is awesome and the staff friendly and fast service! 
13066 4 I have never had a bad experience or meal at this amazing deli, you can never go wrong, But I especially like their breakfast 
13067 2 I've been going to Le's (formerly Pho Pasteur) for a few years now, and I've only ordered one dish: Chicken Bun. It's delicious, inexpensive, and I can get 2 meals out of it! 
13068 4 This place is really cool!!! went to the Orlando Eye which is a large ferris wheel with air conditioned pods with interactive screens of the attractions of Orlando. It was very cool and romantic to share it with my lady. 
13069 2 Food and drinks were really yummy. Came in for happy hour and enjoyed the bites. It was hot outside (90+ degrees) and felt about 90 degrees inside as well. Hope they fix the AC so we can go back. 
13070 3 Shanghai dumplings were delicious! Another stand out was the smoked tea duck served with steamed buns. Good food It was busy and we waited close to an hour, but the food was worth the wait. Service was also good. Will recommend and return. 
13071 4 The place is cramped and the wait can be long on certain days but the food makes up for all that. I love the mashed potatoes, fried pork chops, and the macaroni and cheese. 
13072 4 This place is amazing! Cozy setting with amazing food! I got the hot chocolate and the cajun breakfast and both were simply amazing. 
13073 4 Avenue is an awesome neighborhood joint with delicious (and cheap) burgers and a wonderful variety of craft beers. I always feel welcomed and comfortable here. 
13074 4 Such a great nail salon! Everyone was so kind and welcoming. They really take their time with what they do--I got a pedicure and a manicure and they're both perfect. Great services for an amazing price. I'll definitely be coming back. 
13075 4 I LOVE this clinic. The staff is wonderful. Dr.Fyda hung the moon as far as I am concerned. Bryan is a sweetheart and my daughters adore him. Every time I have called in the staff has always been super sweet. WONDERFUL!!!!! 
13076 4 Best omelet I've ever had! Feta, basil, and tomato cooks slightly runny with a side of yummy bread. It was on the seasonal menu and boy did it taste fresh and local. Delicious ingredients put together with thought. Worth every penny! 
13077 4 Wow! Was this place great, or what? I was doing the 4T Trail and found this place before hopping onto the MAX. Ordered the Kubideh. Just awesome! Looking forward to my next hike and stopping here. 
13078 3 Third time here and every time is been really good. Prices are fair, and portions are ok. The guy up front is nice. .handy place to eat if you can get out of your room and make the walk up there. .nice change from the hospital food. .. 
13079 0 Used to be good; now not so good. Waiters and waitresses seemed like they wanted to be anywhere else. Food was meh and overpriced. Screwed up my friend's bill and no apology. I'll go around the corner to Tip Tap Room; nicer wait staff and nicer food. 
13080 4 Very friendly! Really good- I had the Hawthorne (burger, goat cheese, bacon). Delicious! PDX fries were tasty too. 
13081 4 YUM - Titaya is the ONLY Thai food in Austin as far as I am concerned. The yellow curry with tofu is amazing and we always have to get the superior Tom Ka soup too. We always have a delicious experience and great customer service. 
13082 4 The food is excellent, but I was deeply disappointed that neither Prince, nor The Artist Formerly Known As Prince, nor even The Ghost Of The Artist Formerly Known As Prince were in either bathroom. 
13083 3 Vegan donuts rock! Even better is 24-hour donut access. Lines can be long, so be prepared to wait. Also, they tend to sell out rather quickly. 
13084 3 Lovely place for tapas. Button mushrooms with goat cheese is awesome! 
13085 4 I only gave 5 because I couldn't give em 10. great food and lots of it. They give you twice what most places give for the same price. 
13086 0 They have cute stuff, but in my many times stopping in I have never bought anything because they want too much for it. There are many furniture consignment in this 3 block radius, they need to compete with the other shops for customers. 
13087 4 Lovely workers and best ice cream in Vancouver! Although the place is small, many people just buy pint to go so you can find seats quite easily. 10/10! 
13088 3 I have been here now a few times and everything is always outstanding. The meat selection is excellent and always very flavorful. If you are into Brazilian and don't want to pay a fortune this is the place for you 
13089 4 I was amazed by the Rasputin burger - absolutely fantastic. Nice side of greens, too. I also like the woody smell of the place. (Thursday lunch.) 
13090 1 Bad food. Service was fine but food heavily negated it. Many other better restaurants around Boston to go to. Basically was a high-end Olive Garden 
13091 4 Super dank smoothies!!! The Matilda is the way to go! It's like a juice but smoothie form! There's bits of banana and dates which I love!!! Very satisfying to the taste buds! 
13092 3 The food was excellent. I went with 8 people last night whose tastes ranged from cautious to adventurous, and whose familiarity with Korean food ranged from none at all to having eaten in Seoul. Everybody loved the food. The price was excellent, too. 
13093 1 Very disappointed in the menu changes. Use to be one of my most favorite restaurants in town. Seems like they are cutting costs rather than providing great food. Not sure that we will be coming back anytime soon. 
13094 4 Authentic Taiwanese Beef Noodles. Make sure you get the Spicy Brisket and the Beef Pancakes are awesome! Very reasonable pricing and dishes are made quickly if you order take-away. 
13095 2 Close at 6pm during summer time and cash only you kidding right? But there drink is not bad I will recommend my friends to hang out there but please exert your business hours. 
13096 4 A Westwood gem! Great menu, attentive staff and an upscale Boston feel. There is something on the menu for everyone. The cuisine is cooked to order and perfect every time! 
13097 4 Wonderful, fresh, huge selection. Little Russian gem. Those who enjoy Eastern European sausage, salads, baked goods, and dessert- this is for you! 
13098 3 Fresh & Fast!! The place is very nice. But I'd recommend them having real beef, turkey and chicken not ham. 
13099 4 Excellent food and fantastic service! I will definitely come back! Best Mexican food I've had in Austin! 
13100 4 I love this place. Healthy food and friendly service. And of course, it's delicious! It's the right price for take out and you get good sized portions. Every time I walk home after class I want to stop in! 
13101 0 I ordered the clam strips, they're awful. I looked for any actual clam, and most were just breading. The fries are not good either. I genuinely feel like I wasted my money. I won't be coming back! 
13102 3 What a lovely place. Large patio so you can bring your best friend. Service was excellent and food was amazing. A little pricey! 
13103 4 Mac and Rich are amazing! Very honest and thorough. They definitely went above and beyond to make sure I got what I needed. Thanks to Mac and Rich, I am a Pep Boys customer for life! 
13104 3 Went there for happy hour. Super cheap top-notch food and beers. Our waitress was exceptional. 
13105 3 Neat, tidy, good atmosphere overall compare to other T&T's. Friendly staff and good service. Product selection is decent but prices are average. 
13106 4 Food was fresh and delicious. We had the pumpkin ravioli for dinner and the chocolate mousse for dessert, both were excellent. If we are ever in the Boston Area again, we will be sure to return! 
13107 3 Good selection overall. I do wish they had more stamps. Also, some of their prices seem kind of high. 
13108 4 Spicy, crispy, juicy fried chicken straight from the loins of Tennessee - what more is there to say, Gus's is a treasure! 
13109 3 I usually come here for coffee and sometimes a sandwich when hungry. Heard there soup is pretty good. Food is fresh of course because it isn't like frozen food like most places you eat or some canned crap. Pricing is good too. 
13110 3 Yum! We went for a light dinner. We split the margherita pizza, olive appetizer and the lamb appetizer. It was good for the price. We got soda...no alcohol. Total was about $30. We will definitely go again! 
13111 2 This place is always a decent spot for casual dining. Decent prices, service, and sushi. Nothing exceptional about this place but it'll do. 
13112 4 I am wanting a facial right now but it is Sunday. Maybe you'll have something Tuesday or Wednesday this week. Yeah! I got one for Wednesday. Thank you Maison Esthetique Christiane Bourque Spa. I'll be dreaming of it the next three nights. 
13113 4 Best meal in Orlando for my husband and I and my parents during a week long stay. Amazing fluffy home made gnocchi and great seafood pasta. Lovely service, quiet atmosphere and good wine. We couldn't ask for much more! 
13114 1 The ribeye was poor quality meat, the mushrooms and onions had no flavor, the mixed vegetables also had no flavor. The service was good. Fair price. 
13115 3 So so yummy! They have a good lunch combo and I definitely recommend the spicy eggplant. 
13116 4 This place is hands down the best in Texas! I love their ribs!!! They did short us on 1lb of meat but it was a Friday night and they were slammed. Expensive mistake but the food was still amazing 
13117 4 Just finished the lemongrass beef rice bowl and was blown away. It was outstanding! Don't let the small frontage fool you, this is a great spot. 
13118 4 Pleasant service and the ability to sample made my choice of beer for me. Wanted to drink local but the Belgium Pilsner won!! In spite of the Holiday bustle of Easton, atmosphere was nice. I will be back 
13119 4 Came here during St. Patty's Day weekend and I had a blast! If your visiting the Boston area you must come here! I'm not a big beer drinker, but who can say no to a fun day with free beer!!!! 
13120 4 Great new Indian restaurant! The menu is varied - we've only had excellent food everytime we've been. Maddy and Chef (the owners) go out of their way to make you happy. It's becoming our go-to restaurant. 
13121 0 imbibe is weak on drinks imbibe is lacking flavor imbibe is overrated 
13122 3 This place is VALUE. Portions are big and tasty. It's not gourmet. It's not surprising. It's affordable and dependable. You want this in your life. 
13123 3 Chocolate Lover's Paradise If you love chocolate, don't miss Ghirardelli in Disney Springs. Great sundaes and salted caramel hot chocolate! Go to the chocolate shop for a free caramel Ghirardelli square. 
13124 4 We had our anniversary dinner last night at la Quercia and all i can say to decribe our night was "wonderful" The food, the service, the place everything was perfect, we had the 7 course family style dinner and every single dish was delicious! 
13125 4 Exactly what I expected! The boneless chicken wings were great, the meatball sub was tasty and even the cheeseburger was good, but not great (maybe a smoky flavoring would make it better). I ordered via the Yelp app and it was delivered to my hotel in about 35 minutes! 
13126 4 This is by far the best Vietnamese food I've had in Austin. Their spring rolls were great and I can't stop craving their Pho. It's great! 
13127 3 I enjoyed this spot, would like to come back and try something else from the menu. It was nice being able to sit outside on picnic tables and people watch. Fresh fruit and flavors! 
13128 3 I really like the space, and the tapas is good and surprisingly reasonable for the city. My only complaint is that the drinks are too small. Otherwise, a good option for Tapas in Boston. 
13129 3 One of the better Walmart's! I always go in the after hours, the well known shopping cliental is better to deal with then! 
13130 2 wayyyy too sweet. The plain old fashioned one is heaven. the rest arent worth the trip. 
13131 3 Chickenwings zowel met als zonder bot. Flink aantal verschillende smaken maar ik vond ze erg aan de zoute kant. Ook de patat,hoewel lekker, erg aan de zoute kant. We hadden als dipsaus honing mosterd en die was erg lekker. Frisdrank kon je onbeperkt bijvullen. Personeel was erg vriendelijk en behulpzaam 
13132 2 Rode one of the newer planes back to Bmore that was equipped with wi-fi But did they have to make the seats smaller to do so. Not the most pleasant ride I have had on southwest. The flight attendants were pleasant. 
13133 3 Customized noodles broth and spice levels? Sign me up. Regular here be sure to grab a stamp card free gyoza and ramen after certain number of re-visits. 
13134 2 Good empanadas. That's all I had. They have a Spaniard (Spain) taste. So if you are not Hispanic you may not be used to the flavor. 
13135 3 I was visiting Boston so I was only able to eat here once and had the Shrimp Platter. Very good! You can really taste a difference in their batter and it's truly delicious. The atmosphere is lively and the service is also good. 
13136 4 Just ordered food for delivery from rice junkies. The bibimbap and beef bulgogi were excellent. Full of veggies and perfectly cooked meat. I was thrilled to get such delicious food. 
13137 2 20% restaurant added gratuity plus an "additional tip" line, which I find presumptuous and insulting. Lightweight cocktails, and no dessert or coffee. One knockout main (Arctic char), one uninspired (halibut). 
13138 4 I really liked the food here. I liked the college atmosphere and the people running it are really friendly. 
13139 4 Went here for lunch recently pretty great atmosphere and the chicken sandwich I ordered was DELICIOUS! If your hungry and want a burger or sandwich this is a really great place to stop! Also was pretty surprised by how clean the bathrooms were.. overall a good experience! 
13140 1 Good shop. Use to go in quite a bit....then I found they are owned by William David Lindholm. Google the name....A RAT !!!!!! 
13141 2 The food and service was decent. We had to wait a bit longer than necessary (about 1.5 hours) to get a table. I'd go back, but be sure it was a less busy time 
13142 3 The seating is ample, the service was speedy. I had tea and a hot water bag. It is not rocket science. I also used their wifi for about an hour to work on some projects. 
13143 2 Pizza: ok for Boston area. Go to Julianna's in Brooklyn NY, and then compare. Pro's: crust is decent (sometimes they overcook it). Parking across the street. Cons: Tired wait staff who where shorts and think it is cool to be grumpy. Dirty floors. Time to change it up. 
13144 3 I previously had not recieved good service from this store until I worked with Gavin today. He was extremely helpful and saved me lots of money. I would recommend him to any customer that enters this store 
13145 3 Well, it's a bit on the pricey side, but the quality keeps making me come back and bring out-of-town guests here. Their tuna empanadas are great. Their lemon meringue pie - it's perfection! This is why they often run out of it by late evening =( 
13146 3 Never mind the 'location' concerns expressed by the suburban hoi polloi. This place serves good food with friendly service. Don't miss the red beans and rice. 
13147 3 Just discovered this place. SO DELICIOUS. I tried the Miga's taco last visit and was instantly hooked. All the sauces are amazing especially the habanero green. Going for dinner tonight. 4 stars because I wish they sold alcohol! 
13148 1 This mall is a ghost town. Lot of shut down spaces and mostly one-off stores. The department stores and Foot Locker/House of Hoops the only things keeping this place above water. Needs a complete overhaul/remodel and probably new ownership/management. 
13149 3 The service was a bit awkward but the food was amazing! If I want thai this is the the only place I'll be going back to 
13150 4 This place is my go to for a clean car. They let me stay in car and run through outside washer. Then their amazing guys open all doors and trunk and completely get at the inside, windows and all. It's quick and totally worth 18.95 
13151 4 Amazing food and very friendly staff! It's fusion Thai. Some of the appetizers have Japanese influence. Overall all dishes have nice flavour. 
13152 4 I can't express how much I love this place. They seriously have the best egg roll, bones less spare ribs, and oh their beef teriyaki. The owners are nice and kind and always remember you. Try the beef fried rice and scallion pancakes. So good!! 
13153 2 Great shoes. Great prices on shoes. Lots of colors and styles. Not top line quality but the price is right. A step up from payless, but not quite DSW, but again, they have tons of shoes for $7, $9 and $14. Located right near Macys and Filenes in downtown crossing. 
13154 4 Exactly what Crosstown needs- Something Healthy!! Best protein smoothies and burwiches ever! You will never get bored as they have tons of menu options. Delicious guilt free food-Love it! 
13155 3 Excellent in the pub category, meaning cheap with big portions. Some interesting menu items. Semi-rowdy sports bar kind of atmosphere though. But hey, maybe you like that... "bro". 
13156 4 Just a great little French spot, nothing over complicated-- just the greats cheese, mussels, great chicken offerings, snails, whatnot. I sincerely recommend the happy hour which is festival of great small plates served by smart French-speaking bartenders. I don't drink, but the wine list looked spectacular. A high 5. 
13157 4 I come here all the time. I have a black car and I like to keep it clean.. these guys take the time to insure it always looks nice for a reasonable price. I also appreciate it is Eco friendly.. This is a good spot! 
13158 4 What can you say that has not already been said. Best burgers, chicken burgers, and even veggie burger in Portland and the northwest. We drive from Tigard because they are that perfect. 
13159 1 I love to support local minorities but I must say....the food was good but I found a hair in my food which is cool, I can git over it, but when u offer no kind of compensation nor compassion, I take offense. 
13160 3 Third time here, ordered take out. Pad See Ew was amazing! They put it in an aluminum tray and plastic lid with cardboard bottom, so it stayed warm for the journey home. Fast, easy, decent price. 
13161 3 Such a treasure! Nicely priced and good vegan choices. All 4 of us enjoyed our meals (even though the portions are a bit small) 
13162 4 Fortunato Conti!! Give this guy a raise! He created an AMA Ung evening for us! Thank you! 
13163 3 One of the better burgers in Portland, and a great happy hour. I haven't had anything less than good here and I've explored the happy hour menu fairly extensively. Great place to meet up with friends over drinks before gaming (as one does). 
13164 4 BEST pumpkin spiced latte I've ever had! Wish you were closer! Pricey (and prices aren't posted ...at least I didn't see them) but was worth it. Definitely returning when I'm in the area! 
13165 2 Not much on ambiance but a perfect little neighborhood spot to grab a bite even if you are in your sweaty workout clothes! Margarita pizza is small & good! Tricolor Insulate is yummy too! That's all I ever get. Bad wine selection, good iced tea! I like it here!! 
13166 3 It's an American diner experience. Ended up here for a brunch date and tables were packed so we got seated at the bar. The food is prepared at close quarters and that's an experience in itself. Great options on the menu, decent coffee. Will come back if in the neighborhood. 
13167 3 Food is good and fresh. service is good too even its busy sometimes! Finally have a hotpot in Malden! 
13168 3 Good, not great. A little over-priced, $3.50 for a scoupe of cookie dough. I got the M&M. Would have like a non-vegan chocolate option! 
13169 1 Note: They changed their value Chicken Sandwich. It tastes more like pastrami, I could not eat it. Sorry. 
13170 0 Why is this pizza so technically digusting maybe cause I'm from NY but this pizza something is actual wrong with the recipe it's like moist cardboard soaked in diet water....ew throw up in my mouth rather eat a hot pocket. 
13171 2 Good appetizer / wedge salad. The halibut is decent. Great service and friendly staff. 
13172 4 After bouncing around many of the newer "barbers" in town, always disappointed by the cut, I was so pleased to find Naji. Quick, affordable and perfect. No wasting time with gimmicks. I'll not go anywhere else. The last real barber shop. 
13173 0 The b team came in that night and ruined my burrito. Terrible service and no coke from the fountain machine. This place is terrible. 
13174 4 I cannot speak for the restaurant itself because I just had it carry out via Postmates, but the food was fantastic. I had the double beef, grilled chicken, and spicy pork sliders. My favorite was the chicken. I would definitely eat here again 
13175 4 All I can say is that I love these guys and their product! Eric & Ryan are so helpful and quick to reply when I need anything. They very nice and great at what they do! 
13176 3 Saw this place on Esquire's best. Really nice and classy. Nice historical treat. Food and drinks are not bad at all. I'd come back. 
13177 3 Great local ice cream place. Within walking distance of my apartment. Excellent banana splits and raspberry lime rickey's. As a former scooper of ice cream, it's a nice homely place to grab a scoop and either sit and chat or walk around. Very popular in the summertime. 
13178 4 My wife and I ordered our outfits for our wedding and loved them so much that I came back for a full wardrobe. The service here is amazing! They are incredibly helpful and have a great selection of fabrics. I would not dream of going anywhere else. 
13179 4 My Cravin' Chicken sandwich actually looked like the picture in the menu. I came during the day while it was empty and they made my order fresh. The lettuce was actually green and the tomatoes were cut fresh. Environment was clean and service was very great. 
13180 3 Delicious crab! Sometimes a long wait since the place is popular. 
13181 1 A little disappointing. The sales woman reeked of alcohol. 
13182 2 Pretty good "hero's", yup still call them that. Freshly sliced meat and cheese, but i still prefer Boars Head brand deli meats,a Long Island thing i guess, which i can get at Publix. If your in a hurry for a quick sandwhich i would stop by. 
13183 4 Tried Willow Tree today and have fallen in love. The best German food I've had since leaving NYC years back. Great food, friendly staff and excellent beer. Will definitely be back! 
13184 2 Gotta agree with Katie G. - I go because it's near home and has decent parking options. My biggest complaint is that their chicken tends to be really dry. Otherwise, the food is filling and you get a decent value for the price. 
13185 4 We love this place! Bloody Mary's and food fantastic! So glad we stumbled across this place, it is definitely our Sunday morning place when we are here visiting! 
13186 3 One of the few cool restaurants/bars in Boston. Great place. Food is delicious! 
13187 1 I went to the Barking Crab this summer with some family from out of town who saw the restaurant on food network. While the food was good, it was grossly overpriced to have picnic table-seating, where they plop you next to other parties. I won't be going back. 
13188 4 So delicious. Many different options which provide a speedy fast service stay restaurant. So many options here and you can't go wrong with choosing anything on the menu. Def worth a visit and will be a regularly visited place after we have found this sweet gem. 
13189 4 Love it here!! So cute and charming! The ice cream is amazing and the owner is adorable! 
13190 3 Next time getting a sandwich here. The salads are very good. The dessert looked delious the choc chip croissant. The avacado salad was good but the dressing too strong. Loved choc chip cheese croisant 
13191 4 Love this place! The donut desserts are amazing, and the donut sandwiches, montecristo, and burgers are excellent as well. A must for anyone who wants to try something new and delicious! 
13192 4 Good for families and couples. Great accommodations and great RV park. I'd spend a month with the time! Checks restaurant is simple. Lakeside is more gourmet. Yum! 
13193 3 Pretty delicious subs. The Roasted Eggplant was good but I wish I had known the eggplant was breaded (and possibly fried?). 
13194 0 Good pizza, terrible service. Staff acts like you are bothering them when ordering from the counter or asking for anything in general. Also, their ice machine has mold on it. Disgusting. 
13195 0 Went in there earlier, and was "helped" by some one named Preston. I say "helped" because he was a massive jerk. Needless to say, I promptly left. Never going back there again. 
13196 3 Delicious & filling! I got the burrito bowl with chicken. The hot salsa is quite spicy, and the avocado salsa is delicious!!! I'd definitely come here again - quick and friendly service, too! 
13197 4 I had a phenomenal experience at this mattress firm recently. Josh was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful to ensure we were getting just the mattress we needed. Highly recommended, ask for Josh! 
13198 3 Must stop for Vancouver. Go here for hotdogs. Recommend getting: Kurobuta pork. Misomayo. 
13199 3 Started with a blood orange martini,then the meatball pizza and a canolli for dessert,everything was amazing!! The atmosphere is really nice too,definitely the best spot in Davis! 
13200 0 Bunch of douchebags work there! They argue with you when they F up. Food sat there for 15 minutes they never call your order then they want to argue with you that they called your order several times. BS! 
13201 3 Great quick food with a couple of vegan options (and many vegetarian options). My only suggestion is adding a few more vegan items to the menu! 
13202 4 Such a cute little cafe! Very modern and great aesthetic....staff is nice. The food is mediocre but by no means bad 
13203 4 Pretty and quiet, excellent service, and very good food! We tried sushi, steamed BBQ pork buns, chicken yakitori, and shrimp with cashews and shitakes. For desert we had chocolate mousse cake. Everything was so good! Our waiter was super attentive and helpful. 
13204 3 I LOVE this place. Adorable inside, great social environment to mill around and meet people, and AWESOME food. I had the tri-tip sandwich, and also the Au Jus sandwich...both highly recommended. Also: make sure to check out Do-Over in the summers. SUCH an awesome outdoor dance party! 
13205 4 Stopped in for a wine and a bite. Absolutely loved this little gem. The polenta with goat cheese was delicious! I would eat it everyday if I could. 
13206 3 Great breakfast spot! Kind of small and you'll have to wait but the food is great. Cinnamon French toast is wonderful! Wife says the hash is to die for. And the estimated wait was right on the money. Cash only, so be aware. 
13207 0 Had the Southern Fried Chicken Salad. Wasnt very good. Menu says it has a chicken breast on it.. Ended up with just chopped chicken fingers. Very disappointing and menu is not accurate. 
13208 3 Cool sammies, decent beer taps. Would return. 
13209 4 Just went to tight tacos and WOW it's melt in your mouth good!!!! Couldn't even leave the parking lot before inhaling my carnitas. Best tortillas I've had in a long time. Great service and vibes! I think I found my new spot!!!!!! 
13210 3 Love me some Ramen. Located in the grocery store but a decent setup. If it is the only ramen in town then I am thankful for ramen. 
13211 4 Very good Brunch!!! Amazing french toast!!! Lobster bisque was delicious!!! Had to take home desserts because portions are huge!!!! Very good service!! And ask for their special mimosas!!!! 
13212 4 Best Chinese delivery in Austin! Quality food and huge portions!!! 
13213 4 Nice venue in Atlanta. We attended the irresistible Thursday , and it was fun. Great band playing , lots of drinking options and good food. Definitely going back there. 
13214 4 This place is awesome!!! Great food, huge portions, fast service, great location, creative cocktails and breakfast is served late!!!! Everything is made in house.... AMAZING!!!! Can be quite busy for weekend brunch!! But completely worth the wait!!!! Definitely recommend =) 
13215 3 Best way to get to Boston, gives me more beer money. I take a taxi home after hours. They could clean it up a bit, but it is the closest MBTA to Tufts (for now). 
13216 4 Crispy coconut shrimp, garlic shrimp scampi amazing, awesome mango slushy an ultimate margarita best times ever! Did I mention the live music Saturday night, reggaes the best! 
13217 3 We had a great time - loved the erhu playing, and authentic China style food. Great location - international drive! Spent $90 on 3 appetizers, small portions - 3 meals reasonably sized - dinner for 2. 
13218 4 i m visiting from Chicagoland area and staying in Casselberry. This meat market is perfect for me. Has everything you would need for specialty cooking. I am coming back to spend more time. I puchased ground chuck and cheese the first time. Meat was great. 
13219 4 Another success! Everything I said in the first review still stands. Service was fast and helpful. Food was amazing as all always. Just an awesome place to be. 
13220 4 This is my favorite pizza i have had in Austin. It was lip-licking good and if I wasn't eating in the company of coworkers I probably would have had at least two more slices than I ate. Our pizza was half Zeus, half pandora and all amazing. 
13221 4 AMAZING deal for quality, new boxes. More people need to know about this place! Bought four boxes today - 2 medium and 2 large - for under $7.00!! You can't beat that with a stick! Anyone buying directly from a U-haul is nuts w/ this place around! Totally impressed! 
13222 3 The hummus was a little bland so that was disappointing but the falafel was very tasty, as well as the egg plant sandwich. And the baklava was delicious! 
13223 4 I love me some tacos! And this place didn't disappoint me! Tacos are small sizes, so order a few! Each taco was tasty and we also ordered the Elote on side and it was SO GOOD! Loved the atmosphere of this midtown location and customer service was great! 
13224 4 Enjoyed a great meal here. We had the lasagna, carbonara and chicken parm. All were delicious. Service was very good. 
13225 3 Sopa de Pollo is excellent as is the Tostaguac and fajitas. Good place for lunch on nice days with a patio. Inside is dark. Service is sometimes slow, so be active in managing your requests. 
13226 0 IT TOOK FOREVER! The lady seemed very confused. She didn't really comprehend what we were saying and messed up all of our orders 
13227 3 Kujo was great for our walk in tats. We hardly had a wait and he was entertaining and very effective and efficient. We would definitely recommend him to other people in the area looking for a tattoo. Shop minimum is $60 just so you know in advance. 
13228 3 One of the friendlier and less crowded Kinko's in the chain. I'm always able to find a helping hand here when struggling with the copier and printers. The system is efficient and effective. 
13229 4 Excellent service. Manager came vy and checked on us and refilled our drinks. Enjoyed our lunch. 
13230 3 This place was great! There usually is a wait, but I do have to recommend their coffee drinks to-go and waffles with raspberry/carmel sauce. (not too sweet for breakfast, get two because they are small but delish'!) You can thank me later! 
13231 2 Food and drinks were fine, this place is loud but I think that's their thing. The only thing that I really was t into was the fact that their popcorn shrimp was probably about 5 pieces of shrimp and seasoned popcorn... Very misleading. 
13232 1 Bang for your buck: 6.5/10 Quality: 8/10 Service: 4/10 Ambiance/Location: 4/10 Overall: 6/10 
13233 3 Can't beat the empanadas here! We ordered a few at the bar for lunch and had quick, prompt service. The East Austin location has a great atmosphere and is super laid back. The domain location is a little stuffier, but we always eat outside. 
13234 4 Awesome food and friendly people. I had the shrimp po'boy and it was so good. I can't stop thinking about it! 
13235 4 An excellent addition to Portland's already thriving brewpub scene. A lovely rustic space, very warm and welcoming, in a classic Portland neighborhood setting. Great beers, excellent, helpful service and an atmosphere that seems exceptionally cordial and embracing, even by PDX standards. 
13236 3 Solid but a little inconsistent. Little things, sometimes trash left behind, sometimes under the sofa sometimes not? Overall, WE STILL HAVE AN F-ING MAID SERVICE so I'm actually embarrassed to have a single complaint!!! 
13237 3 Most definitely not the friendliest staff but if you want a gift shop that offers up trendy CU or Colorado gear, this is the place. There are a ton of shirts to pick from and other fun trinkets. 
13238 2 I stop at this location on the daily. I order the same thing. And everyday, something is wrong. This is the only chickfila location where they don't go above and beyond. Pity 
13239 4 Talk about last minute...the shop closes at 6:30p on Friday. I called at 6:29p and she offered to stay open so I could flowers for the evening. It's hard to find places willing to go the extra mile for a potential clients and repeat business...THANK YOU! 
13240 4 Loving the place and staff! Especially Britt :)) 
13241 1 Really understaffed making it hard for our waitress to serve us in timely manner and the food was not good for the high price... we only ate it because we were starving after waiting so long for it! Can not recommend unfortunately. 
13242 2 Location: parked in publix lot. In viet town. Easy to get to 5/5 Atmosphere: loud and chaotic 3/5 Service: went on the server reccomendation. Pretty good 4/5 Food: slimy tofu. Needed to use firm tofu 2\5 Value: inexpensive and huge portions 5/5 Return: yes 
13243 4 The Food is Awesome and quick. The Price is very very affordable. If ya hankern for Awesome Beef Sliders this is the Place. 
13244 4 Johnny Brooks in service is fantastic. Personable, friendly, and detail oriented. Has helped me with service needs many times and he never fails to impress. If you own a car, and it's not being serviced by Johnny, your missing out. 
13245 4 Who doesn't love ice cream?????? Surprisingly the process of ordering and getting your order is very efficient!! I was worried because it was crowded but it didn't take very long at all to order and get my ice cream and devour it. 
13246 4 Had the most amazing experience with Noah! He's beyond personable, knowledgable, sweet, and handsome! Would definitely go back and loved his advice! Really an awesome guy 
13247 4 This place is amazing!! I loved the carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. You can also decorate your own cupcakes! 
13248 4 The best tasting I have done in Portland so far. If you want an intimate atmosphere and delicious food that won't break the bank, come here. The freshness and flavors were unreal. 
13249 4 If you die before trying a peach fritter here, your life was a waste...just saying... 
13250 1 Everything is premised and repetitive after you go more then five time you have practically had it all. There are are places close by that make fresh made to order lunch and coffee. Staff is very friendly. This is in my building and I choose to go down the block. 
13251 4 This place is amazing!!! Best pizza I have had in quite a while. Bruschetta and cannoli are fantastic as well. Helen is great at helping with the menu and very accommodating as it was my first time ordering. Certainly will not be the last..5 stars 
13252 3 Service is a little slow but food was good. My main complaint is the crackers were super stale. All of them. 
13253 4 Excellent care at 2am after getting off a plane and realizing that I have conjunctivitis. The staff is quite pleasant. 
13254 1 Food was pretty crappy and service was very very slow on a night that was ~75% capacity. I understand some nights are busy but you gotta come by my table more often than every 30 mins. 
13255 4 Young man at the counter went above and beyond to ensure a pleasant experience. Highly recommended. 
13256 3 4stars for the food, 2for the place itself. Tables need to be cleand, they have unsweet teas, yes more then one, but nothing ro sweeten it wirh. So.... 
13257 4 Absolutely best Thai place for lunch takeout and delivery. The pad thai is perfect and I also love the chicken coconut soup Mmmmm 
13258 4 Really good. Tried the vegetarian sampler. The lentils and split peas were our favorite. Inexpensive wine. Great service. Free parking. 
13259 0 Overpriced, many poorly-made goods, unpleasant atmosphere. I've been to all or most of the Kitchen Corner locations and always leave empty handed. No reason to ever go back. 
13260 4 Great place to eat breakfast. Very unique selection to choose from. Expect to wait on the weekends. Wait staff was very friendly and attentive. 
13261 3 I like the coffee here and the overall vibe. Great space and nice to have the outdoor seating on the terraced patio. The service is super slow though. 
13262 1 Overpriced and small servings for Pho. This restaurant may satisfy the taste of tourists and those inexperienced with Vietnamese food. Another Steveston disappointment. There are many other options to satisfy my Pho cravings throughout Richmond. 
13263 3 Good appetizer sampler, nice beer list, really nice dining room views. Good for a low key weeknight out. 
13264 4 These are the best cakes I have every tasted. The white chocolate, caramel and strawberry cakes are the best. Yellow/chocolate icing and pound cakes are my least favorites. 
13265 0 Absolutely HORRID service. Sat at table for 15 minutes before I was even acknowledged. When asked to order, I got the "wait a minute" finger. 15 minutes later I walked out. It wasn't busy. The wait staff were milling around, Avoid unless you have no other option. 
13266 4 Got the grilled chicken sandwich wth French fries and it was so good! Also tried the spices barbecue sauce and it was the perfect sauce to add. They have a lot of cool and yummy home made sauces to choose from! 
13267 4 Go by and ask for Amy she does a great job. I have been coming here for years and will continue. I have recommended family and friends that keep coming back. Great location, prices and people. 
13268 4 Amazing food. Waitress Adrienne really knew the menu, and helped my friend and I navigate the gluten free side. Having celiacs it's hard to trust restaurants, this one has a GF kitchen! Love. Love. Love. Would definitely come again. The Melt burger was out of this world. 
13269 4 This place has really good noodles. Did not try the sushi so I can't speak to that. One of my fav places to get Chinese in Austin. 
13270 3 Good spot for old fashion meat and 3 near downtown. Yum on open face roast beef and mash potato. Bummer they were out of fried okra. 
13271 2 Super super super busy. Real busy grocery section and almost need a traffic cop for the shopping carts. Cash register was quick though and packed my eggs nice. 
13272 0 I wish I could give this place 0 stars!! Hands down the worst bbq in the world!! Yes not just in Portland but in the world!! It is clearly obvious to everyone else also because this place Is ALWAYS empty! 
13273 1 Famous for the sandwiches, which are very good. The secret is the bread. Yummy. That said, the long line ups and the latest price hike have taken this place of my recommended list. Food is good, but not good enough to compensate for the wait and the cost. 
13274 4 Excellent food. I had two tacos. One shrimp and one snapper. Chips and Salsa were good and plenty to share. 
13275 0 The bus never showed up. It was major hassle trying to get to and from the event, because we were scrambling. What make it worse is the folks I spoke to on the phone didn't seem to care. I am doubtful I will see any restitution. 
13276 3 Crazy Roll & Monkey Brain = Great I shall return. 
13277 4 Great gas station. Clean. Always open. no lines to pump gas and they sell craft beer. 
13278 3 Great NY Style Pizza, thin crust and true sauce! Tuesday Deals! 
13279 3 Pretty good chicken, but comparable to many other chicken places. I tried a two piece dark, the Mac and cheese, and beans. Just wish the small side was so small, it would've been suitable for a small child....or at least adjust the price 
13280 2 The server was friendly but it took forever for the food to show up, and when it did, it seemed to be cool the fries were cold. 
13281 0 vacation place over priced high. 4 What you geto passable 
13282 1 It is alright but they charge way too much for what you get. The sushi is not even fresh and the atmosphere and service is sort of awkward. 
13283 4 Great coffee and friendly services. The employees took time to explaining about their coffees. Will go back again 
13284 3 Very nice little place. I've been there a few times. Staff is attentive, food is good. I do recommend this restaurant 
13285 4 Always great. Try the tuna on the lunch menu, kind of a salad, nice small plate, very tasty. Best place for lunch, always quiet with available seating. 
13286 4 A great (and huge) cafe in the heart of Union Square. Good coffee, amazing salads and sandwiches. 
13287 3 First time here had a blast Service was quick our waiter was good The fried green tomatoes were excellent!!!! Prices are ok , the ladies restroom was CLEAN.. 
13288 4 Rich was awesome! He helped us with our old mice-ridden house. Looking forward to a more peaceful existence thanks to B&B. 
13289 0 rip off price!! for me and my husband to share - we ordered rock n roll and tiger rolls -- got 6 each and it's really small. too expensive!! I was still hungry after that. :( 
13290 3 This Salon is gorgeous, and I find the pricing to be very affordable! I like how there is spa services on site. Go see Lily! Best hair stylist :D 
13291 3 This noodle house is a great spot to grab a quick something to keep body and soul together. The setting makes it ideal for a date, lunch or casual dinner. If working your way through all the local eateries, this one should be on the list. 
13292 2 Not a bad bar. Stopped in for a bit just before a Janes Addition concert and had some good beer and very decent bar food. The only down side? The bathroom situation was a bit of a disaster. Long wait for everyone, not a big fan of that. 
13293 3 The soft shell crab Taiwanese buns are delicious, though a little pricy. Could be an occasional indulgence. 
13294 4 Great braleakfast and biscuits and gravy.. ice tea was brewed.. outdoor seating. Perfect! 
13295 1 there very slow in there dirty as well foundca hair in the breadsticks last time we went dont think we will go back the one in medford square much better 
13296 4 I loooooveeee this place! My favourite is the PB acai bowl. Just grab your smoothie bowl and enjoy a walk at Lake Eola! This place is all about healthy choices. 
13297 3 Casual pub with lots of TVs, open space, and tables. Two bars to belly up to. Recommended for both groups and solo drinkers. We ordered the sausage platter, BLTA, and the chicken tortilla soup and all were seasoned well. 
13298 4 Nashville Hot Chicken with Sweet Potato Pancakes are the BOMB!!!! I killed it and didn't get a chance to snap a picture...my bad ;) 
13299 2 You can't go wrong with a Papa Murphy's pizza when you want a pizza, but don't have time to wait 30-45 minutes for delivery or carry out. I've been a fan since they were Papa Aldo's! 
13300 0 Yuck. Not sure what all the craze is about, but this place was not good and was also expensive. 
13301 3 Came here for happy hour Cheap and good! They staff was great keeping our tabs organised with our party of 9 bouncing around the bar. We had drinks and appetizers and everything came out quickly. Would return to try out the food on the menu 
13302 4 We ordered the Gnocchi with butternut squash which had a savory and sweet flavor. A must have! The meatball and sweet beets with goat cheese was the perfect start. Dessert was the butter cake. Soo good!! 
13303 4 We are regulars now, since about November. Sushi is an 8/10. I've had amazing sushi all around the world...but this stuff is pretty good. Prices fair, service excellent, chill atmosphere. What is there to complain about? I love this place! 
13304 0 You guys really need to make sure you pay attention to the temperature setting of the soup. I get it that you don't want anything to grow in it, but if the customer burns their mouth even after a long walk to the office, that's not cool either 
13305 3 Kids say it was delicious. They have all the american cuban staples made with a care/effort. I am adding this to my list of regular eats. Thanks for the great food. Marina loved the plantains. 
13306 4 Not enough words to describe how good this restaurant is! Fresh and everything made out of scratch. From the sangrias to the fried calamari and chicken Marsala. Definitely my fav Italian restaurant in town. 
13307 3 I've been ordering food (pickup &delivery) since Lucky Yeehaw opened and this is now the only place in the area we order/eat oriental food! Pleasant Customer service, quick service, and their egg drop soup is super delicious! 
13308 4 Amazing and friendly! Dr. Amy Akland was so sweet and thorough and I loved her demeanor. Go. 
13309 3 Had some $4 happy hour specials. The mini shepherds pies were yummy. The wings are so so good. The mini pretzels with cheese was really fresh and delicious. The chicken fingers with spicy bbq sauce were NASTY! Cute place. Nice experience. Good prices. Good beer. 
13310 4 Great coffee selection with a cozy environment. They offer low-fat, whole, skim, soy, and hazelnut milk. Wish they offered almond or coconut milk. Will definitely be back. 
13311 1 Stella is okay -- I like brunch best -- but the dinner options are over-priced and the menu has not changed in over a year. It feels really tired! 
13312 0 Got my hair blown out and the stylist did a decent job. However the woman at the desk who claimed to be the manager was rude for no good reason. Would not go here again just due to the terrible customer service exhibited by management. 
13313 1 chips were stale and wet. margs strong. food dece. and cheap. margs expensive. if u want fajitas, go to the border cafe! kristas plankin! 
13314 4 Dance on solid wooden tables while napkins rain from the sky! Taverna OPA is like no other. Great food, music, drinks, belly dancers and one incredible atmosphere! 
13315 4 This is one of my go to places, great fresh food. They are consistent at delivering good food. All their bowls, salads and smoothies are wonderful. 
13316 4 This is excellent quality coffee, both drip & espresso, and my girlfriend loves the scones too! Early hours a plus 
13317 1 Bad experience today. I go there often and usually have good service. The person today was very rude and argumentative. She rushed and did a bad job. My polish looks horrible. Wonder if I should go back. I filed complaint with Better Business Bureau. Plan to go forward. 
13318 4 Everything has been said already. I tend to get the Pad Kee Mao (picture). It is amazing and Titaya's knows how to bring on the heat, unlike most other Thai places in Austin. Fast, friendly, and delicious. 
13319 4 Loved the tour, would definitely recommend it to others! Our tour guide Robin shared some great stories and jokes about Harvard history and culture. Particularly great value given that it was included in our Boston Duck tickets! 
13320 3 Great addition to the gunbarrel area. Finally something besides Bk and sandwiches. I like the steak tacos but my co-worker prefers chicken. I recommend this restaurant and hope it sticks around. 
13321 3 The Burren is the mullet of bars. Business in the front. Party in the back. 
13322 4 Love going here-yogurt is delish, employees friendly and patient and always so fresh! Definitely will return 
13323 3 Hands down the best Indian in Austin. Go during their lunch hours for the buffet. 
13324 4 Finally had a chance to eat at the new location. A little smaller dining room but the food was great, as usual. I hope they thrive here so l can keep coming back. 
13325 3 Great place to grab a California style burrito- reminds me of hitting the taco truck! I would give it 5starsbut they are sometimes out of carnitas. 
13326 3 Let me same you some time. Go for the corn fritter and rock shrimp. The rest you can get at captain D's - are those still open- or long john silvers. 
13327 3 Stopped by here for lunch and wasn't disappointed. I love Pho noodles. Added shrimp and loved it! Will Definitely be back here again. 
13328 4 Insanely good. Probably some of the best Mexican food I've had since moving to Orlando from Chicago. Chicago's filled with authentic Mexican restaurants so I finally get to enjoy a good Mexican meal here! I've had the flautas and the tacos and I've also had the enchiladas! All delicious 
13329 4 Great food, great ambiance, attentive servers, and good music too! Love this place. My favorite in the North End - they have a more expansive menu than most of the typical small North End places. 
13330 0 Would love to give it a zero. Poor service. Warm beer. Orders messed up. Bad food. Yelp won't let me post this as a real review unless I write more stuff so here you go words words words words words words words 
13331 4 Al and Bill at DSG did an awesome job on my E30 M3 S14B25, the car runs awesome, they are about to install an OS Giken close ration gear kit. Tuned by Matt at DSG. the car runs like million bux!! great shop great people. 
13332 4 Enat was absurdly delicious! We went with a party of four on Christmas Eve, and were greeted with strong warm coffee, sweet traditional wine, and genuine smiles. If you're with a group, definitely order the family platter! Beware: the food is deceivingly filling. In the best way. 
13333 4 There burgers here are awesome, as are the drinks! They have a decent sized space, and did are allowed in the area outside, which is great. They usually have a fire running sitting the fall and winter, which makes it even more cozy. 
13334 1 The food was decent, not worth the 20 minute wait, and then another HOUR wait for food. Overrated, and a waste of time. 
13335 4 Lovely dinner. My companion and I both had items from their prie fixe menu ...awesome options and unexpected value. Service attentive without be overwhelming. A little expensive for regular rotation but definitely keeping on the list. 
13336 4 Wow the best food all year. I never rate anything but I had to tell someone. Everything made in house, even the pickles. Wow!!!! 
13337 4 I absolutely love this place. Great atmosphere, food is on point, staff is friendly and drinks are amazing i really love the mason jar cocktails. Great place to relax after work with coworkers 
13338 4 The facility is beautiful, and Suzann was fabulous! She explained everything about micro needling very well and made me feel completely comfortable. It hasn't been long enough to see the full results, but so far, I'm very pleased with my experience. I'll definitely be back. 
13339 3 We arrived around 8 pm on a Friday and sat in the bar area. We had a total of 4 dishes, which were all very good but the service was terrible. I wouldn't sit at the counter by the window as we were completely ignored. 
13340 0 We had dinner here. The rice was not cooked -as in very hard- and looked like uncle bens. The curries were ok, nothing great. The rice !!! 
13341 1 Been a member for over a year. Tried to ignore my friend's comments about how dirty or underservice this gym is. Locker rooms always smell, however, what lead me to write a review is the fact that the water fountain has been broken for over 3 weeks. Come on. 
13342 4 The wine here is amazing and priced perfectly. You can get a "taste" of wine for half the price of a glass. Love that option. The mussel dish is delicious! Sit at the bar - the bartenders are so friendly and fun! 
13343 3 This has been my Sunday brunch place since moving here. The food is good-that side of oatmeal is fantastic. The music is great and the place is packed with Davis/Tufts/community vibe. I love doing the crossword here. 
13344 4 Love them! a second family with great live music in the bar, amazing mixologists(bar tenders) awesome food and Tommy O himself on most nights we visit! 
13345 3 Gooooooood! I have never been wrong going there. Get the original/danbo soup. Ohh classis tonkotsu, that is goood!!! Miso was so so... nothing to complain coz i like their noodle, but soup is somewhat less flavor 
13346 1 Quality of food and service very disappointing. Workers never smiled, looked at you or even acted like they cared. I ask for burger to be cooked med. he said they are too thin to cook to a degree of doneness. WHAT!!!!! I'VE BEEN THERE TWICE MY FIRST AND LAST TIME. 
13347 4 Try the grilled tips, turkey or steak. The char on them is awesome. The wings are better than average and the service is top notch. 
13348 4 Great place with very friendly and professional staff. Prices are very reasonable despite being located in an airport. Food is high quality and delicious. This is the best spot to pass some time in Terminal A. 
13349 4 I love this place, they have a wide range of sausages and fresh meat.I recently moved to NE Portland and this is my go-to meat market. Highly recommended! 
13350 3 Have dinner where Paul Revere once ate. This is nice place and convenient to the Freedom Trail in Charlestown. 
13351 4 MMMMM!!!! I went with a friend - we got Thai rice pudding and coconut saffron. Both were delicious! I also tried the toasted milk, which was delicious! I loved everything I tried! Bravo! 
13352 3 Make sure to seat yourself if no one notices you've been standing at the hostess table for 10 minutes. Other than that, great food and amazing sangria. No really, the sangria is the bomb dot com. 
13353 3 Go EARLY! These homemade donuts are really good! We arrived around 10a and most of the inventory was gone. Not your traditional donut shop. The donuts stayed fresh the entire weekend that I visited. My favourite was the twist, cream cheese filled, eclair...what the heck, they were ALL delicious! 
13354 4 AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! There is nothing more I can say. From the service to the food, I enjoyed everything. I'll be back again next time I visit ATL! 
13355 4 Fantastic German food and very cute location. No wait on a Tuesday evening. The buffet is a great deal and the desserts are amazing 
13356 3 Great food even if you are not a vegetarian. You must try the desserts they are scrumptious. 
13357 0 This is one place in town that so far I did not like at all. Service was amazing but if i could go here just for those doughnuts and coffee I think that would be good but nothing else. 
13358 0 Service was terrible. Food was cold and took 45 mins for 2 burgers. Even took 20 minutes to pay. Next time I'll take the extra 5 minutes and walk to cactus club around the corner. 
13359 4 My favourite Vancouver hotel! The rooms are clean and the beds are so comfortable. Staff are all amazing and the restaurant food is always great! 
13360 4 Food was excellent and quickly prepared. They use top quality ingredients and serve large portions for a great price. I highly recommend! 
13361 4 Healthier and smoother than ice cream! You also have the option to add different toppings like crushed pecans, caramel, whip cream, etc. 
13362 4 The best vegan taco's I've had in the area. Freshly made one by one, these guys and girls obviously care about the work. Ge these here at the original before they get big and "discovered." The great shops in the neighborhood are great to wander while they make your order. 
13363 2 Unfortunately, nothing to write home about. The food was fine, but nothing stood out, and it wasn't worth the price. To boot the waitress was rude, which doesn't help the experience. 
13364 3 First visit in a while. Food was what it used to be and the service was great. I hope this is a sign that things have taken a turn for the best again. 
13365 4 We had drinks, appetizers, and entrees and everything was excellent including the service! We had the salmon ceustini, crispy chicken schnitzel, seasonal ravioli, and the salmon dish and everything exceeded expectations. 
13366 3 Had lunch here and was extremely happy with what we had Malai chicken, cauliflower side, samosa and mango lassi. Very tasty. 
13367 4 I went with my boyfriend and we got the saag paneer and the cholley with an order of naan. Both were very flavorful and delicious. The staff was also extremely courteous and attentive. A great experience overall! 
13368 4 They are hard hard workers, I got 3 quotes in my front yard cleaning, Greenstars price is right. I hired them, they completed in 2 days. They are honest and humble. I have to use the next time. 
13369 4 I took Stella to A Dog's Best Friend for her assessment. The staff gave me a positive review of Stella. They were great with her. 
13370 4 Amazing view, great service. The menu was surprisingly varied, and the prices were surprisingly fair for a place that I expected to be somewhat of a tourist attraction. Definitely worth visiting for the view, and worth staying for the food. 
13371 3 This Sephora is much, much smaller than the Prudential location. However, it was not nearly and busy and the salespeople where much calmer and more relaxed. I enjoyed browsing around this one. Your typical Sephora supplies all this one has fewer perfumes and creams than others I've visited. 
13372 4 From the service to the water service to the food it was awesome. Sofia, our waitress was beyond attentive. She anticipated every need and was there before we asked. The entrees were served and so pretty. Perfect sizes and perfect taste. Can't wait to come back. 
13373 0 Made my reservation and was told my certificate is expired. As you can see there is no expiration date listed on the certificate but Anna told me the company has a list of expired dates. That would have been nice to share with the customers. 
13374 3 Food is overall delicious. I love the spicy conch appetizer and Kung pao chicken. However like another review said, they do not do teamwork. My water was empty for a while and other servers just walked on by and I know they saw it.. 
13375 0 BREANA is the worst at costumer service!! She always looks like she doesn't wanna be there!! I hate when I have to order from her.. She take forever and she looks mad 
13376 1 Asked for a blueberry muffin. Got a raspberry muffin. An honest mistake, but the muffin also had a big chunk of what looked like either an apple or a pear in it. Not sure as I didn't want to eat whatever it was. 
13377 4 Stainless Steals is the first place I call when I need equipment. Dale is awesome and stands by his products. He will take the time and help you make the correct decision. A fantastic selection and his prices cannot be beat. He does not sell junk. 
13378 4 Still the best pizza in Boston. Stop bitching about the snarly servers, ancient furnishing, and focused menu (and I think cash only policy...I've always paid cash) and enjoy this East Boston treasure. Seriously 
13379 3 The salted caramel milkshake was amazing.....with bits of salt adding texture and as the perfect flavor enhancer to caramel. Savory and sweet. Worth every penny of that $5.40. 
13380 4 This place is great. I'm not sure I've ever had a bad meal there. Everything on the menu is surprisingly good. Great for lunch, din, or brunch on the weekends. Great owner, great staff, great food, great beer ... Give this a try if you haven't already. 
13381 4 very patient employees we came here thinking they had pc games but they don't have pc board games but offered us some great tips 
13382 4 Fantastic italian food and pizza. A+ service 
13383 4 Awesome little divvy bar near Kendall Square! There was pool, shuffle board, and pinball to entertain us while finishing our drinks! Not too packed on a Saturday night and friendly staff even after a rather intoxicated friend dropped her glass. My only wish is more recent stuff on the jukebox! 
13384 3 Always consistent food and service. The Tonkatsu Ramen's broth is rich and full of umami. Always hits the spot! The noodles are perfectly cooked every time. 
13385 1 Very disorganized for a Starbucks. Used to a level of precision in the service at Starbucks that was seriously lacking at this location. Product quality was as expected but service was lackluster and significantly worse than I am used to here. 
13386 4 Super good I had the eggs Benedict with salmon and it was so flavourful. The hashbrowns were really crispy. Very hipster restaurant service was disappointing however the food was 6/5 most likely come back 
13387 4 Unpretentious, intimate, great Jazz, soothing green tea... Miso soup, selection of four rolls, the palate experienced culinary art. Not to be missed.. If they are busy, exercise patience and wait. Savour every morsel. 
13388 4 Although a bit out of my area, I came here today to support #BlackLivesMatter Ben and Jerrys never disappoints!! Always fresh, always clean. Thanks Ben & Jerry 
13389 4 What a fabulous place great food LeAnn was an angel would go every night if I could the food was was perfect What more can I say it was wonderful 
13390 2 Good but not great this time. Usually we are extremely happy. This time it lacked a litttle in service. 
13391 4 Great food, served quickly and with a smile. I eat breakfast or lunch here about once a week and have never been disappointed. 
13392 4 I just love this place. Great diner type service, no nonsense! Food really good and served quick. I think I have tried everything on the menu over the years and its all good! I must go whenever I am in the neighborhood! 
13393 2 Went on a first date here,made reservations. The hostess blonde female, was very rude. Our server was better though,great food. 
13394 4 I love contributing to smaller family run businesses especially when there food is really good. The arroz con pollo (rice and chicken) is delish. The rice itself has so much flavour. Highly recommend the food here 
13395 4 Awesome atmosphere. Amazing burger. Super mojito. some dude waiters sound kinda douchey. will be back! 
13396 4 Best modern sushi/ japanese restaurant in Boston. Owned by famous chef Michael Mina, who got his start in San Francisco. A must go on a special night. 
13397 3 We stopped in for lunch while walking the Freedom Trail. We had burgers and they were the outstanding!! They have a good variety on the menu and great historical atmosphere. 
13398 4 The food is amazing! There is wine on tap, which is unique and makes it more affordable. The staff are great and managing partner Dana is very hospitable! 
13399 4 Great service that reminds me of home, Los Angeles. Attentive and fast service compared to most places in Orlando. Definitely my go to place in Orlando. 
13400 4 Excellent food and very friendly atmosphere. I've tried many dishes here and all have been excellent. So glad this restaurant is just around the corner. Also, on Amazon delivery which is great. 
13401 0 If you like urine covered floors and hour long delays, you'll love the Greyhound in Orlando! 
13402 4 Massage helped address areas of discomfort. Therapist was prompt, professional, and able to focus on problem areas. Cost is affordable. 
13403 3 Friendly staff and predictable, consistent food......nothing spectacular but decent enough. More like 3.5 stars for food and and extra .5 stars for the staff. 
13404 2 This is a great breakfast spot on Hawthorne. Caryn and I were craving waffles this morning. Something we don't crave often. So, we decided to go here because we heard they have great waffles. We heard correctly. It was good stuff. The waffles were pretty awesome. 
13405 4 LOVE these guys! Really creative flavors and you definitely can't tell it's vegan. I love everything vegan but for those who don't, you'll really appreciate these goodies. The owners are awesome and I can't wait to keep trying more! xoxo 
13406 4 This is a great Applebee's Ordered baked haddock which was great and the grilled shrimp Thai salad yummy Clean great servers will visit again 
13407 4 I was so impressed with Othello from Superior Shuttle. Not only did he text me before I even departed my flight, but he walked me through exiting the airport and finding his van. He was talkative and professional - if using Superior Shuttle in Atlanta, ask for Othello! 
13408 4 1st time here was last night for a wedding reception. Love the atmosphere and great attentive staff. The bar made the best Old Fashioned I've ever had - their secret is spiced honey. Great selection of cocktails and great appys. 
13409 3 Best Chinese buffet in the Portland area. The egg fu Yung is excellent, so is the general tao's Always go when its busy... They make new food constantly. 
13410 3 Been here three times now. Always good food, friendly staff and friendly conversations with other customers. Today I had the special - pork belly hash - mmm good! 
13411 1 Shoddy service. Merely decent food. In a neighborhood of great restaurants, why would you eat here? 
13412 4 Beef rib was to die ---- Brisket was really good too but a little fatty. The tangy BBQ sauce was the best. Green beans, baked beans, mac & cheese, coleslaw, jalapeño cornbread were all solid. 
13413 4 Fabulous!!!! One of my top five places to eat in Portland. Happy Hour- duck wings, and shrimp ceviche are a must try! Dinner- Scallops are FANTASTIC!!!! 
13414 4 I am so happy to have found this place. It is a great place to have a delicious, guilt free ice cream treat. The guy working there every time I have been there is also nice. 
13415 4 This is the best Thai place in the smyrna area. Lots of spice, organic ingredients and reasonable prices. Huge pot of jasmine green tea for $2! Our favorite food dishes were the coconut soup and spicy basil fried rice. 
13416 4 This is the most authentic Taiwanese bakery in town, although it is interesting how part of the authenticity derives from how well it incorporates the westernizing trend of Taiwanese baked goods. All of the items they sell are extremely fresh and tasty. I drop by whenever I'm in the area. 
13417 2 Reasonable happy hour prices for a spendy place! I was pleasantly surprised with my sweet potato fries and frosty beer. However, you won't catch me dead in this place after happy hour, I think at that point it's full of people with jobs! 
13418 4 Good vibes. Love how these guys stock there shelves with products sourced from local business. They offer water pipes for any budget. Also, Their Kratom is the best quality I've seen. 
13419 4 Almond croissant, bacon and egg brioche, all sorts of breads and pastries... great to have a closer one outside of downtown. 
13420 3 Nice location, AMAZING bed! Hallway is somewhat warm and smells... 
13421 0 Service sucked, food always good, waiter was more interested in the tv and clearing empty table than refilling our drinks 
13422 2 Decent cheap beer, mediocre bbq. I wasn't a huge fan of the place. It's also very hard to find coming east on Ponce. A tree blocks the sign. 
13423 4 The proprietor took us as a walk-in, fixed the phone in less than 30 minutes. Very reasonable prices. 
13424 4 Great way to learn how to sail!! right down the street. considering the equipment prices are right. Beautiful views of the city and in the summer the water is nice and warm. friendly staff and members are super nice. 
13425 4 Shaun is great at what he does and was super helpful when I was in a pinch last week. Took the time to make sure I was take care of and provided excellent service. Highly recommended! 
13426 2 Cheap, Friendly. foods are ok. Be aware you need to bring cash because they don't take credit cards. 
13427 2 Beautfiul grounds. Can view all of Portland down below (this part is free). Didn't go inside. Limited time, and long line. 
13428 3 Good food. Understanding wait staff, they paid attention well. Good franchise. The tri tip was well seasoned and had great portions. 
13429 3 Wait sucks but is totally worth it!! I take everyone who visits Austin to hop doddy's and they all fall in love! Great atmosphere. Amazing food! 
13430 1 I have noticed a trend of food consistently coming out of the kitchen terribly over seasoned. Dear Greet Street; please keep trying because I want to love you. 
13431 3 We found this place comfortable good service and the pizza and the calzone was very good.Fresh not dry like some places full of flavor. We had seen the reviews and went anyway The server was prompt food was served hot and timely. Fast service Good Food,Fun Atmosphere 
13432 4 I bought a pre-owned side by side fridge. It is in great condition!! The guy working there was very nice and helpful. The delivery guy came when he said he would and installed it for us. I couldn't ask for more than that. I will be back! thanks, again. 
13433 4 Dr. Sabree was so nice! He completed a thorough eye exam, and he was able to give me a sample pair of eye contact lenses. The rest of the staff is helpful! Super fast turn around for ordering contact lenses and eyeglass lenses. 
13434 3 Good hot food and coffee. The serving are large and reasonably priced. Menu is varied and interesting. There's always a line to get in, but it's worth the wait! 
13435 3 This place to me is very good! the price is a little pricey but it is worth it to me!! I had the chicken Alfredo, it was okay but the pizza is where its at! yum yum yum... so if you like pizza you should try this place!! 
13436 4 My husband and I are regulars here! We love the service, atmosphere and the food! The wait staff is friendly and our drinks are always full. The pizza is awesome and keeps us coming back (especially on half-priced pizza Tuesdays)! Wonderful addition to our neighborhood!!! 
13437 4 Clark Balcom law settled a $150000+ debt for $10000 and I am totally relieved to have the burden lifted. 
13438 3 Line took forever, but it was worth it. The sides felt super home made, the ribs!!!!? Melted: in. Your. Mouth. And the sausage was fiiiiire !! Loved it great bbq experience in Austin 
13439 2 Not that many options for gluten free vegetarians. Great cocktails. Nice ambience. I bring my little dog and we sit outside. Staff is happy to tell you all about their very special menu. 
13440 4 I have lived in these apartment buildings for over 10 years, I've seen a lot of up-and-down but lately seen the new management and see what they're willing to do to make these apartments awesome only makes me want to live here longer 
13441 4 Everything about their fish and chips is wonderful! The batter, the fish, the YUMMY tartar, and tasty fries. We've been back several times. 
13442 0 Don't want to get good service in here The boss only want to earn more money. Why I get one more sauce , I will pay 5 dollar. You know the other hot pot restaurant is free. Don't try to eat in here. It's bad 
13443 4 Melanie really does give the best facials in the business! Not only does my skin look much better after seeing her for several months, but I always feel great afterwards. Her massages are wonderful!! She is worth the money. 
13444 4 Certainly a top 5 burger in my book, excellent quality beef and cooked to perfection! Service was excellent as well. Food: 4.5 Sporks Service: 4 Sporks Atmosphere: 4 Sporks Local Beer: 3 Sporks Value: 3 Sporks 
13445 0 The restaurant was really cold so we asked to be moved to another section that wasn't as cold. But the staff said our food would take even longer. I definitely understand that it was busy but he could have put it in a nicer way than being passive aggressive. 
13446 4 I am a Total Sandwich Snob. I adore Bunk. All of it. I've never had anything I disliked, and I'm picky. Pro tip. Buy two sandwiches... One for eating then and one for the drive later. They are worth it. 
13447 3 The Kobe in Florida is better than other Kobes that we have been to. Price is reasonable for the amount of food u get. Good variety. Will definitely come back. 
13448 4 Delicious and would come here again. Loved the Shanghai rice cakes- they were super tasty. Definitely worth the price. 
13449 4 Amazing seafood fare and will always be back for the fresh selection of oysters and little necks. The fried dough desert is probably the best fried indulgence you can find in salem! 
13450 2 Good work thank you Boston audio design very satisfied here..... 
13451 4 We started the New Year off right yesterday morning with some Migas.. Melts in your mouth, not in your hand. Muy fabuloso. 
13452 4 Bueno de paseo por Kissimme y el carro se nos daño. Esperando con la ayuda de DIOS podamos irnos a casa temprano para Miami bendiciones a todos los que trabajan hayan. 
13453 2 Chicken Kabob platter was great, but the hummus and pita bread were gross. Way too much tahini on the hummus and the pita was as hard as a rock. 
13454 0 First time trying this out. So, there was a Hair in my nachos, chicken wings were cold, beer tasted like they didn't wash the cup out so modelo tasted like blue moon. 
13455 3 Good food and service. Just a bit pricey... Alot $12 plates or above. I was also very disappointed that there's no kids menu. But good Mexican food. 
13456 4 Quite simply the best fusion Sushi ever. Delectable flavors, sensational service, beautiful ambience, awesomely unique cocktails and THE most incredible deserts I have ever sampled. Austin's best. (that was a period) Did I mention the Championship Top Chef winner Paul Qui?!?! ;) 
13457 4 If I could give 6 stars I would. There has never been pastrami this good in Boston and I don't think I've had better in NYC. The bread the mustard the half sour all were perfect. Great service and good drinks to boot. Wow! 
13458 3 What a great experience. I came for an early dinner by myself. The food was delicious and staff was friendly. I had the beet and goat cheese salad and steak frites, accompanied by their Rose sangria. What a gorgeous way to spend a spring evening! 
13459 0 Good luck cancelling here or any other LA Fitness location if you join. 
13460 4 This is probably one of the best Greek restaurants that I've been to. The food is great (especially the saganaki!), and the nice thing is that we never had to wait for a table, even on the weekends. 
13461 2 I didn't like this place at all but my friends did. I found the food to be very heavy. There was only one healthy veggie option. All the others were fired. I did not like the atmosphere at all. But my fiance said she really liked the stir fried noodles. 
13462 3 Granted, I'm a Texan and went to Boston vulnerable to tourist traps. But I don't care, I loved this place. Great atmosphere, good food, good service, good music and a great view of the water. I'll go again, without hesitation if I'm in Beantown. 
13463 4 Amazing well worth the visit; can't wait for the New Penguin area to open how exciting and what an amazing learning experience 
13464 4 Dan was absolutely amazing!!! Took such great care of me and was thorough with his communication! Great job, Dan!! 
13465 4 This is THE place in Portland to get hard-to-find art and craft supplies. It's amazing how much awesome stuff is packed into this small store! 
13466 4 I always have a great time at Jacks. I have been coming here for a while. The food is awesomely priced and delicious. Who can beat 1$ beers? 
13467 4 Great staff and food! Just found out they reopened recently! Definitely a place to try out! 
13468 4 Always a stop when we come to our Disney Condo. Great ice cream, great service and a cool location. It is in the quaint town of Celebration. 
13469 3 The dishes were executed flawlessly and they were presented beautifully. Minus a star for the seemingly rushed service. Our server breezed through the description of the dishes. All in all, it was a great dining experience. (Had the 14 course meal with pairing.) 
13470 1 Prices are good, good location. The food is just ALRIGHT. Half way through my passable burger, I found a piece of metal in my cheeseburger. Won't be ordering from this place again. 
13471 2 Beer is really good. Food, not so much. Burnside, this is not NY! No need to charge top dollar for mediocre food. Fries are terrible, portions are small, taste is bland... Step it up! 
13472 4 If you're willing to wait in a line like the rest of this city - you're in good hands. Hopdoddy has damn good burgers, cold beer, killer shakes, and happy humans runnin' the joint. Love me some Hopdoddy. Shout out to the bartenders who are always killin' it. 
13473 3 During our visit to the Capilano Bridge, we purchased our coffee here. Both the girls helping me with the coffee were super nice and helpful. Although there was a line, they didn't rush us to get our coffees. The coffee was mediocre but they explained it's locally grown. 
13474 4 Zach and Ron were very helpful, they went out of their way to help me when I wasn't even being charged. (Checked tires and worked on resetting the computer; the latter was really difficult as the owners manual directions were inaccurate). 
13475 3 Love the staff, very helpful aaaaaaaaannnnnddd friendly. Food was amazing, godfather sandwich with Mustafa sauce on the side 
13476 4 Jason and team are excellent! Their workmanship, process, responsiveness - and most of all, genuine care for the client is top notch. They installed a new HVAC system for us - seamless process- we love it! 
13477 1 Food is usually decent but if there is a problem or they get your order incorrect don't expect them to fix it or adjust your bill. Tourist trap. Lots of street trash around back. Not clean. 
13478 0 Picture an assembly line of ladies handling meat. laughing speaking in their language while they do your pedicure. You are the piece of meat !! very impersonal !! Place smells of cigarette smoke ! No thanks, theres lots of other places to choose from. 
13479 3 Good stuff, unique & tasty. One of our guys brings them into work frequently, they don't sit around long thats for sure. 
13480 4 Good food! The flavor is really authentic and with a great taste. It's sad they don't have umbrellas during the afternoon because it gets hot in there. But definitely coming back!! 
13481 4 I busted a tire and went to this place on my lunch break. They got me a brand new tire for $83 and I was in and out in 10 minutes flat. I recommend them to everyone. 
13482 4 First time experiencing Ethiopian cuisine. One word FANTASTIC. the spices were wonderful and enchanting. Our server Tre was helpful explaining what everything was and what to expect. Friday night and the place is packed. We will definitely be back!! Oh and don't forget the coffee. Delicious 
13483 3 FYI: I revisited Joe's a couple of days ago and to my surprise they changed their prices, boooooo. I paid $7.25 for a large steak and cheese. Still worth it though. 
13484 4 Amazing BBQ I have ever had and Brisket was cooked to perfection but the only thing was the side dishes were a little under cooked but Delicious BBQ Brisket and Ribs made up the difference.. 
13485 3 This is a great place for happy hour and for brunch. Little pricey for a long happy hour, but the half price apps make it a better deal. Awesome bar staff. Brunch is amazing. Buffet, some favs from the menu and some special items just for brunch. Bloody Mary bar...yum 
13486 0 This Safeway is a war zone. Avoid if possible. There is a plethora of homeless, drugged out both inside and outside. Hardly any selection and long lines with funky smells. 
13487 4 I love this place! I've lived in Belgium and this is the REAL DEAL. Great food, great staff. Love the waffles and frites and sauces. Truly a great place to go! 
13488 4 Absolutely love this place, although parking can be a little tight. The people are friendly and the atmosphere is a friendly neighborhood taco place although I"ve also tried some of their breakfast plates and lunch plates (burgers) and they were awesome The prices are great. 
13489 4 Great pastries and bakery items for Saturday breakfast at The Battery. Can't wait to come back and try their lunch menu items. 
13490 4 Delicious tuna sub! everything is so fresh you can definitely taste the difference. Clean place,friendly staff and healthy soda options coconut is a the best 
13491 1 I've been back to Jade Bistro several times since I wrote my review in 2012. I won't be going again. The quality of the food has declined giving "bland" a whole new meaning. Every dish I've had tastes the same. Oh, and did I say bland? 
13492 3 Came to celebrate Alina. Again :). The waitress is awesome. Super fast and friendly :) Great for groups and just a chill place over all. Yummy food too:) Dessert is GOOD 
13493 4 Always delicious, can't recommend this place enough. I love the Grilled Pork Banh Mi's. I try go come a few times a month. 
13494 1 Large dinner salad with added ($8 steak) and this is how it came. I have gotten this several times but this is a joke. 
13495 0 The worst BBQ sausage I ever had. It was dried out and all they gave you was a chunk of bread with 2 hot peppers. If you want good pizza go to prince pizza. No coffee no butter for the bread. What a disappointment. 
13496 4 I've been to Lockhart and I've been here. I would be hard pressed to be able to tell the difference. If you want to get the same awesome Black's BBQ without the drive, come here. 
13497 3 I love the decor and the dark lighting. That, to me, is what makes this place so great. The food is decent-- try the paella and skirtsteak salad. 
13498 4 This place is outstanding. My partner and I routinely drive the hour and a half to Boston just to have diner here. The food is amazing, the price is great and the service couldn't be better. I recommend this place to everyone I know that is going near china town. 
13499 4 This Hotel is one of the best I have ever stayed at and I have stayed at many. Highly recommended. From the modern spacious rooms to the fantastic pool area and views. It has it all plus location. 
13500 3 Smoked Turkey was surprisingly different and delicious. I sometimes get a specific craving just for that 
13501 3 Fast service and a very large variety of rolls to choose from. I wish they had more soup options thought. Overall a great chain. 
13502 4 Still a great place...coffee bean price is up a couple dollars a lb. 
13503 2 What happened to your mozzarella sticks? I don't like the new ones. Too much like Same Old Place. Please get the old ones back...please? 
13504 4 We have been going here for many years. Not only is the food great and made with care, Bruno and the staff are top notch! Our favorites are the chicken Parmesan and lasagne! 
13505 4 very happy with their service. Dr Murphy and Dr Kevork are both very kind, professional and provide a great service. My insurance was accepted here and took a chance by coming in for an eye exam for contact lenses and eye glasses. These are doctors I look forward to seeing. 
13506 4 Steak was cooked perfect service was amazing the greens were very tasting clean and friendly I order a ipa witch was amazing fun nice chill place. 
13507 4 The place was very good the server was very kind and I love this place. The food as especially delicious I love it and all people should try this place. This place is like the peak of Chinese food! 
13508 4 I got their Pillow Talk, it was amazing! They have a nice covered outdoor seating area. Exellent! 
13509 4 Fantastic atmosphere and food arrived fast and exactly how we had ordered. Our server, Desmond, was very attentive and did everything right! We will be back the next time we are in the area! 
13510 4 Awesome TACOS! Awesome Fajitas! This place was wonderful! Excellent service, great food, decent prices! Highly recommend eating here when in Salem! We loved it! Great cocktails too! 
13511 4 great food and prices. the menu is really great a lot of stuff to choose from. love it 
13512 4 We picked up a 2015 V60 from ole @ DLR Nordic and we are very happy with our purchase All questions were answered and upfront about the condition of the vehicle If you're in the market for a new to you Volvo I highly recommend you check them out 
13513 2 Cocktails are somewhat overpriced at this Back Bay / Hynes establishment but otherwise a fine place to meet for a drink. 
13514 3 Salmon to die for. Best honey mustard salad dressing in town. The specials are always excellent. 
13515 4 Large portions for a low price. Fast and lovely service. A weekly venture for me and it never lets me down! 
13516 0 Nahhh..u can give this one a miss..10x times better places around. Even though the buffet price is reasonable u can def get better stuff else where..quality of food and hygiene is very poor. Their falooda(sort of a milkshake) was tasting sad! Wont go bk :( 
13517 0 Needed my tires rotated. Not only did they not do it but the weights on my tires started falling off. Then to finish it off they lost the key to the lug nuts on my tires so now I can't get my tires off. 
13518 4 The entire staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Made myself and my dog feel comfortable. I will definitely be bringing my dog to North Kenny from here on out, and plan on bringing my new puppy here as well! 
13519 4 The best most gentle cleaning I have ever had. The team is great and so nice. I highly recommend. 
13520 4 This place is cute and a hidden gem! They even have waiter/waitress service at the sushi bar although it's really part of a food court. The sushi is fast, delicious and a great value. The service was friendly. I will be back for sure. 
13521 3 Great place... delicious tapas and very nice wine list... I didnt try any of the specialty cocktails but I'll in my next visit! 
13522 3 the meat quality definitely cannot be compared with that in Zen Shabu. However, the price is unbeatable! It is pretty good for a get-together. you can take your time, sometimes the whole afternoon, chatting and eating the buffet! definitely worth giving it a try 
13523 4 Great place the staff was friendly the food was great. Got to meet Paul from the show he was great with all his fans. Took pictures with everyone. Really had a great time. 
13524 4 Been here twice and tried 6 or 7 different items. Everything is really fantastic! Love the chips and queso! Definitely recommend calling ahead so you can avoid the potentially long wait. Really cool place. 
13525 4 Great breakfast and cheap!! They give you a ton of food and servers are great also. But place is busy we just hit it at the right time. 
13526 0 Horrible for oil change! Set up a reservation online for a fixed time, but apparently that means nothing!!! Still have to wait for more than an hour.. I went to waffle house across the street, waited in line, ate breakfast, got back and they still hadn't started on my car! 
13527 4 I order here like 3 times a week (fatty status lol). All delivery drivers are nice as they know I tip decent. Maybe 2 out of the 40 pizzas I've order have had bad quality. Easy online ordering so I recommend them 
13528 3 I get brazilians here, from Brenna. I find it relatively painless. It's so easy to schedule, and their rates are reasonable. I'm not planning to go anywhere else! 
13529 3 Its pretty good especially uf your there on a date and there at the right time to catch the sunset 
13530 0 Had the Miga Burger, no flavor. Had The Kimble cocktail, awful. This place is on the list for top places to skip in Austin. 
13531 0 Do not play the slot machines,.it. Is programmed not to hit at all. Just go to the cashier and give them your money,.stop wasting your time. I been through a lot of casino and by far, this is the worst. 
13532 4 I am so happy I found a Pure Barre closer to school! Pure Barre is not an easy workout and it WILL burn. I have never exited a class without my legs shaking. 
13533 3 My boyfriend and I love getting brunch here. We're regulars for the Sunday brunch now and love the staff. They're super friendly and good at remembering faces which always feels nice. The food is also pretty good and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the cocktails. 
13534 4 Im giving this 5 star for front desk man jerry for being so accommodating... he does above and beyond what his job entails... i know since i been to several hotels in my lifetime 
13535 4 Amazing!!! Finally got my very own custom closet. It's awesome. The installers were prompt and really on the ball. The design process was great also. I wish I could afford to do every closet in the house. It's a dream I can't say enough about this fantastic business. 
13536 4 Amazing. Great vibe, better food. The sausage patties are spicy and wonderful. $14 carafes of mimosas. Coffee is top notch and a cookie dessert. 
13537 3 Fantastic!! Service was great. Portions were huge. A great neighborhood place. You will definitely leave full. The shredded chicken and beef were extremely fresh, tender and tasty. Prices are very reasonable. 
13538 4 Our group all had the Tokyo Shoyo ramen and a couple orders of pork dumplings. It was busy but food came out quickly. Sooo good! 
13539 3 A great place to go to with friends and have a good time.. Excellent bar service with a variety of cocktails, good food, and fun atmosphere .. 
13540 4 Delmi ( massage therapy) is PHENOMENAL - have Ben going to her for atleast 3 years. So intuitive- the Best you can get- I promise 
13541 4 Try the fries with blue cheese and bacon!! 
13542 4 Oh my goodness, The garlic knots were amazing!! Patio seating was nice & clean. Chicken bruschetta & pasta were really good & will order again when in Florida. 
13543 3 Was here for the Pop Culture Expo last Sat. & liked that it was (IMO) the perfect size venue for the show. 
13544 0 I didn't like it as soon as I walked in the floor was so slippery like the mopped it with grease I slipped inside on the floor the food wasn't great either and not much choices either I'd rather eat del taco 
13545 4 As usual, Albert Moore and his crew have done a great job at a reasonable price! They just finished some tree work at one of my rentals and I'm so happy with the quality. Even as I write this review, they are blowing off the leaves and tidying up. 
13546 4 Really good. A kind of gourmet farm to table restaurant. You could tell that all of their ingredients are fresh and local. Love it. Our waiter, I think his name was Kevin, was an older gentlemen that was really smooth and excellent. Everyone should come here. 
13547 4 This place is just as good as juiceland in my opinion. It's not as busy which is nice. I also like the fact that the employees are so well dressed. It truly is a great alternative to juiceland 
13548 4 We've been going for takeout here since I can remember. Even as a little one I remember loving it! They've always been so nice and polite and very quick with service 
13549 0 The worst pizza I have ever had, doesn't even deserve 1 star. The presentation was awful it was cold, pretty much just bread with sauce & some cheese thrown on top. Nothing about this pizza was good. 
13550 4 One of the best Sushi place in town! The food is a little pricey, but definitely worth it! the service is good too, the server kept introducing and explaining their dishes. Nice guy! 
13551 4 Went back for shots. The same vet was there and was very attentive. We did not wait long at all. We waited about a half hour. It's very well worth it. I will be going back. 
13552 4 Very good Braised whole fish !!! Clear flavors and wonderful textures ! Really good! I Recommend this dish and look forward to trying others 
13553 3 Tiny place but don't be intimidated. The service is friendly and fast (at least it was at 2:00 on a Thursday in mid-November). Walk up to the counter and order a delicious wrap or kabob or grab something cold from the case. Falafel wrap is fantastic. 
13554 4 I would like to thank everyone at Fleming's for making our anniversary dinner everything that we wanted it to be. Our server, Blanca, was amazing!!! Our steaks were top notch and the house potatoes were crazy good. Thanks, again, guys... We will see you soon! 
13555 3 Great cloths and excellent very helpful staff. I went in looking for a great gift idea for my wife and the helpful staff immediately gave me all kinds of great options. Thanks lucy folks, I will definitely be back. 
13556 3 Loved the downward dog smoothie. I also love peanut butta tho. But minus one star for $15 for two small smothies. :/ 
13557 3 One of the best fish congee and wonton noodle I have tried! The wonton is basically full of shrimp. It's $6.50 a bowl Canadian. Great price for quality congee and noodle, I would recommend it. 
13558 4 It is a southie staple. Best pizza in the neighborhood. Great donuts. Great people too. They are always friendly and quick. I live around the corner, and although probably not good for my caloric intake it is just a great place to grab some take out from. Try it. 
13559 4 Took my car in for a state inspection. This was my first time using this shop. The guys were very friendly, got me right in, and on my way in about 20 minutes. I was impressed and will go back. 
13560 4 Amazing. Fun. Great people. Great menu. Rolling the dice for a drink. Sit and be alone. Sit and be with nerds. Have fun. 
13561 4 Good food and friendly staff. Makes you forget you're on the bottom of an office building in Tucker. Hot food, cold drinks. Big TV's to watch sports. Table or barside...stage for live music and dancing. Pool table in the back. I will be back when I visit. 
13562 3 This Starbucks impressed me with the Drive Thru service, spacious interior and the staff's effcient service. The music was jazzy and really nice too. 
13563 4 Awesome service. Had a slow leak and assumed it was a nail. Brought it in and they checked the health of all my tires. Rotated the tires, cleaned and plugged it. Completely stressful and hassle free! Would 100% recommend! 
13564 2 The upside: You will NEVER leave hungry after a visit to Maggiano's, and it's definitely a destination spot if you have a large party. The downside: Food is ok, but not anything special that will leave you craving it on a Saturday evening. 
13565 4 Just had another great experience with Rocky and the guys at Rag Muffler & Brake! Hopefully, they find another location, as they have to move to make way for the Milwaukie extension to the MAX. 
13566 3 Agree with the others here that De Bens is a great classic barber shop. Whenever I go in (appointment or not), I haven't had to wait or anything. TJ does a really good job cutting my hair. 
13567 4 I just found this beautiful store! Very clean and open floor plan. The staff was very helpful, knowledgeable and pleasant! I like it better than Mud Bay. I will be a regular! 
13568 4 I had a piece of metal stuck in my tire so I went over to Leal's. They patched the tire in 15 minutes for $15 and I was on my way. The service was friendly, quick, and efficient. Highly recommend! 
13569 1 Not a fan of this location and the bathrooms are nasty and the service was slow. It just wasn't the quality and standard I'm used to with tin drum. 
13570 2 What expected of the chain. Bartender was nice and friendly - they offer a 2 for 1 drink special that everyone in the bar seemed to take advantage of - it's also offered all day. 
13571 3 What a fun little spot for lunch. Great deals on their food and the service was fun. 
13572 4 Ordered delivery barely an hour before they closed. Food showed up almost exactly at the estimated delivery time and everything was hot and delicious! The miso soup was a surprise too and was also delicious 
13573 4 Amazing- fresh, flavorful fish- not too over battered, but done right. Probably the best fish and chips in town. I live in Sellwood and make the trip up to St Johns for these fish n chips. Thank you Arlo's for doing it up! 
13574 0 Terrible. Can't keep up with service even when crowds are slow. Need to shut down, fire everybody and start over. 
13575 4 Based on these reviews and photos I went last Saturday. Reviews and photos are great but even they don't do place justice. INCREDIBLE! Mixed grill is delicious but huge. I ate leftovers for 2 days! 
13576 4 If you're hungry in the morning , this is the place. Huge portions of delicious breakfast foods served by a great wait staff. 
13577 4 I ordered the beef noodle. It is really cheap however it goes with lots of beef and a big bowl of noodle. The environment inside is also great, very cozy lighting and settings. I really recommend this restaurant! 
13578 4 What a great location! In the vicinity of the new braves stadium. Next to the water fountains and other great restaurants 
13579 3 The best queso, no question. This location's cashiers are hit or miss for being really nice or really jerky. Am I bothering you so much to place a two item order?? 
13580 4 Growing up Italian I have had plenty of Italian food for many different places and this was exceptional love the ambiance the wait staff was excellent and the food was even better if I lived closer I would go here daily 
13581 4 Absolutely delicious! Awesome environment, friendly staff. Get there when it opens, because it fills FAST! Overall possibly a 9.5 out of 10! YUMMMMMM. As we tooled around downtown, many LOCALS, did t even know about this place 
13582 4 Great food. Great price. Great service. Got 5 tacos a steak bowl and chips for less than $20 on taco Tuesday. 
13583 0 Not enough staff. On person helping customers and another making the food. Line of 20 people during lunch hour. Bad staffing. 
13584 4 So glad they keep the classic Smokey's menu! The guys working here are friendly as well :) 
13585 4 I believe my stylist's name was Victoria -- she did an amazing job with my hair, and was so enjoyable to talk to. Great atmosphere as well! I will definitely be back. 
13586 3 For was actually quite tasty! Really enjoyed my tofu and veggie burrito bowl. Pleasantly surprised. 
13587 3 Super cute hipster coffee/tea shop we stopped in for a bit before meeting a friend for dinner. No complaints. 
13588 3 Good prices, good atmosphere, good location. I loved the popcorn! We all felt like the prices were pretty darn good. And it wasn't over crowded at all, which was why I had avoided it initially, I was certain it had to be crowded. Plenty of room. Go check it out! 
13589 4 Very tasty assortment of savory and sweet crepes. Reminds of chipotle if it sold crepes instead of burritos. Definitely good find for a casual foodie. 
13590 4 The girls at Moxie always does an AMAZING job. I love going there because they always make me feel pampered. 
13591 4 Great place for happy hour. Their garlic edamame and cucumber sonomono are great as well. I always get their house red and yellow tail hamachi and it's perfect every time. Ambience and service always on point. Definitely recommend. 
13592 4 I can not say enough good things about these guys. They're fast, friendly and only do inspections. I went to Terry's once and won't go anywhere but Alan's now. Love these guys! 
13593 3 Stick to the Asian dishes with the spicy symbols and add the tofu. Italian pastas ok but not as tasty. Overall, great bang for ur buck... 
13594 1 The food at this restaurant used to be very nice and delicious, but the quality and taste of food are getting worse now compared to the the time when they first opened. I would not go there anymore.... 
13595 4 I went 7.7.18 after dinner Loved it! I had a warm brownie with a scoop of vanilla bean and hot fudge! SO GOOD! 
13596 3 Such a cozy, warm spot with a great menu of offerings. Shared a pizza, salad, and app with the hubs and it was all great, including excellent service by maitre d. 
13597 2 I would eat there every week if they'd fix that fucking screechy pizza oven door. Great food. Unique attitude and set up. 
13598 4 All dishes we ordered tasted great! Fresh, flavorful food and friendly service. Will certainly come back. 
13599 4 I had my 2005 mercedes c320 serviced on 3/18 and Im not sure who worked on my car I think it was Curtis. Anyway the whole experience was very good. The technician, the other staff and the facility were all great. 
13600 4 my favorite bar in atlanta. pretty, yummy, cozy, friendly. don't be discouraged if you can't find anywhere to sit. the french fries are orgasmic. 
13601 3 We frequent The Restaurant - and receive our food exactly as ordered. We frequently recommend this venue. Adding the bar has messed with the acoustics. Our only suggestion would be to look into a sound system to lower the noise level. 
13602 4 Fantastic place! Zuni roll and bread pudding are sinfully good. Service also five star! Of similar note, the hot and cold chicken salad was equally great. We will return again when back in Boston 
13603 3 some comments on this are outrageous, who actually listens to a therapist yawning?? Get a life, and who cares who runs the place, it is a polite and professional environment, I went in for a massage and the therapist was very good. 
13604 3 Our waitress was super sweet and our food was outstanding, like someone's Grandma was in the back cooking! 
13605 0 This was a complete waste money and time, 368 dollars was our final bill and the only thing good was the lobster. Meat items were raw, non juicy, and overcooked. I would not recommend this to anyone. 
13606 3 Love this place! Eyebrow threading is amazing! My eyebrows look awesome! Very professional and always on time. Appointments are convenient and the staff is very friendly. 
13607 2 The choices, environment, and quality is all fine. They are bit pricy compared the the neighboring bars and the service really isn't good, they impatient and rude, often. 
13608 4 I love Suntique Tanning! I'm not a weekly tanner but go about a month before I travel to the Caribbean. The bulbs are always new, the girls at the desk are always smiling and polite and the rooms/beds are immaculate! I won't go anywhere else! 
13609 4 Love this place, food is made to order, always have specials that are YUMMO too! Wait staff is friendly, place is clean and if you want you can sit up at the counter and watch all of the cooks prepare the meals.. 
13610 3 Excellent food. I have eaten here several times and the food is always great. I usually order General Tso's chicken but I have tried other menu items as well and they are all delicious. My family and I frequent this location. I recommend for simple yet tasty Chinese. 
13611 4 The staff were friendly and inviting. The food was delicious! This restaurant provided an experience that was above and beyond what we expected. 
13612 4 We had Nigerian food catered for my brother's birthday party and the food was wonderful. Everyone loved it! My father was so impressed at how delicious and authentic the food was. It made him feel like he was back home. Bravo! We will definitely be ordering from here again. 
13613 3 The food is always great here. The service from both the manager as well as the staff is super. Only draw back of this restaurant is it's super loud. If you can, snag a patio table! 
13614 4 Reasonably priced, nice portions, food is fresh. Most definitely a place I will frequent while in ATL 
13615 3 I second the previous review! Anu is so easygoing & pleasant. The threading process may sting, but it's super quick & doesn't cause the redness & sensitivity to your skin that waxing does. I'll definitely be back! 
13616 4 Great drinks and bartender. Wonderful atmosphere. Awesome addition to the Malden area. 
13617 3 Adventureland is fun. Aladdin and the Pirates of the Caribbean along with Jungle Cruise are the best things here. But they are also things to learn around here. 
13618 3 I find Haru to be reliable and solid every time I go. Yes, it's not Oishi, but I don't want to pay $30 for a roll every time I want some reusable Sushi in a good atmosphere. Also: the Boston Uncommon roll. I heart you forever. And ever. Love, me. 
13619 3 Oh yummy yummy! I always get good food here and the people who work there are just lovely! 
13620 4 How do you do 6 stars? You have to try it. Every aspect of brunch here was great!!! It was a long wait but that comes with a great dining experience in a prime location. Try the strawberry pancakes! 
13621 4 Beautiful inn, well appointed room, comfortable beds, lovely fireplace, balcony, and jet tub. Phenomenal breakfast- great selection and awesome granola. Nice happy hour and treats at all hours in the lobby. The staff was helpful in providing information about local events and hiking options near Boulder. 
13622 4 Had a great little league wind-up party at Me-n-Eds. Pizza was great. Service was excellent. If you want to bring a large group, call ahead and they'll accommodate you in the back area. Very friendly environment for kids and families. A gem in the neighbourhood. 
13623 3 The noodles are tremendously tasty and have a insane amount of garlic. They don't dish the most for the price, but the quality and flavor was outstanding. 
13624 4 Love this place! Will definitely be back. The cajun shrimp pasta was amazing. I got it without the bacon and andouille. Wish they had more options without meat. Drinks were great. They do need copper cups for Moscow Mules. 
13625 3 Delicious, and the staff was super helpful in having me order for a large group and pulling everything together for me and walking it out. Definitely going back next time i'm in Austin. 
13626 3 We tried many dishes and all were perfectly cooked and full of their own unique flavors. The desserts are all one-note for my taste. The wines are very good here for being a brewery. Pork belly app, duck entree were my faves. Service and atmosphere are casual yet elegant. 
13627 3 Lovely atmosphere. Service was super - the host could have smiled a bit more. The blackboard was fun to practice our pronunciation. The food we had was superb. 
13628 4 Mo is awesome! Great quality haircuts for an affordable price. Wouldn't take my son anywhere else! 
13629 3 A very good gym with lots of equipment. As to be expected, it can get crowded after work, but not so much that you have to wait long for a machine. Except for a few missing towel hooks in the mens shower area, a well-maintained facility. 
13630 0 Are here for dinner, as recommended by reviews. Flavorless and touristy food which is overpriced. What a shame! Rice, beans were lacking any spices. Fried snapper was overdone and flavorless. Chicken a laplancha left a lot to be desired. 
13631 4 Holy Moly. This place is holy. That's all folks. Literally everything is good. No recommendations needed. Just eat. Enjoy the scenery. 
13632 0 If you're going to call yourself a sports bar put the relevant sports on, ever. It's beyond embarrassing that your customers have to tell the staff what channel to put it on. This place is an absolute joke 
13633 0 We thought we'd try this McDs again. This time we went in. We ordered 1 sausage McMuffin and a soft drink easy enough. It took 15 minutes to get it. 
13634 3 This is a delicious and quick taco place. The mole is delicious! The staff are friendly. I ate 4 tacos but could have easily ate more. I will be back 
13635 0 This place makes no effort to put out decent food. The food is dry and tastes bland. They also screw up on the ingredients and make orders incorrectly. It's worth the short drive to the Bethany TB. MUCH better food there. 
13636 4 This place is a hidden gem! The specials are a great price for two rolls, soup, and iced tea. Also a cheaper total because you order and pay at the counter right away, so as high of a tip isn't necessary. 
13637 3 Always a good selection of home goods here with rockin' prices. Good service, lots of space, and reasonably tidy, this is a convenient place to shop for seasonal items and small gifts 
13638 4 Their red velvet cake is out of this world and the rest of their cakes are great too! Definitely give it a try! 
13639 4 I love coming here for informal business meetings. The surroundings are beautiful, the coffee is great and the people I suggest this to as a meeting place love it! 
13640 3 Pretty good sandwiches I got the chili dog. Gets pretty messy. Had a bite of my friends sandwich "da dip" warning don't get to excited about the horse radish. 
13641 4 I absolutely love this place and go often. not only is the hot pot good but so is the bubble tea. Their house branded black tea is delicious. go for lunch if you want a better deal price wise plus you get a free black/green iced tea with your meal. 
13642 2 Really good breakfasts, but always a line which takes this down one star for me. If you're walking by and theirs no lineup, I would definitely jump in for brunch. It is quite good, but not good enough for a 20 min wait. 
13643 1 Took my son to get a fade with long on top. The guy cut his little sideburn in a weird round type cut. They just don't know how to do fades or work on "edges" if you need a fade, go elsewhere. 
13644 0 Rude hostess when we called on Sunday morning. She should not be working in customer service. We chose another dining option due to her unprofessionalism. 
13645 4 Great salon. Easy access. Clean. Friendly. Great price. Quick. I would recommend to a friend for sure! 
13646 4 I have been there twice. Once was pickup and another time ate in. Momo was awesome. Had the goat, lamb and chicken. The chicken chilly was great too. The people there are really nice. Free masala chai! 
13647 4 Hidden gem in SW Portland! This is real Mexican food; fresh, flavorful, delicious and interesting! Outstanding service! Try the Pink Conin cocktail, a truly delightful drink!! 
13648 4 Short but informative roundtrip. Funny guide, a lot of tasting. And for free?? Home Run. 
13649 3 Some of the best kid food in town. Great fries. Always a solid meal. 
13650 4 I go there for iced lattes and am particular about my drinks. Loreal is awesome. She is always super happy and friendly. She knows how to make my drink and goes out of her way to make sure I'm happy with it. 
13651 3 Recently went here with an old friend to cetch up. Our waitress was awesome and came to check on us regularly even though we told her we will be here awhile cause were long lost friends. Food was spectacular. 
13652 3 Great gyros, friendly family-owned place with outdoor seating. Try the "Greek donuts!" 
13653 4 I really enjoy living here. Modern apts with upgraded appliances. Easy to clean with wood floors and tile in open areas. Love the big kitchen! Lots of storage and big closets. Safe and gated. I can walk my dogs at night with no worries. 
13654 1 I was not terribly impressed with this place after reading all the good reviews. It was nearly empty the night I went. Some of the toppings are strange, like corn kernels. I did not find their ingredients particularly fresh either. And the rice was over cooked. 
13655 2 Good seafood but never been blown away. 
13656 4 Cider for the Misses and scotch for me, both were really good. Price was good. It gets a little loud but it's a bar so it's expected. It's too bad we missed the live music, maybe next time. 
13657 3 Plump asian chick with nice melons. What can be better? At least my eyes were satisfied. 
13658 1 Coffee was blah. They seem more focused on making dessert like drinks vs. any true coffee. A friend got one of their specialty new ground mocha that had no espresso flavor, only sugar. Staff was rude and impatient. 
13659 0 Got to the mini golf course tonight at 10:40 because Yelp says it closed at 11:30, but the employees were headed to their cars. The lights were out and our plans for the night were ruined. :( 
13660 4 best sushi i have found in central florida. stunning. outstanding. delicious. 
13661 4 I cannot begin to describe how amazing this place is. Such a fun vibe and some of the best French fries in Boston! With all of their different sauces it keeps the French fry game exciting and wanting me to try them all. 
13662 4 Awesome fried chicken. Spicy, crunchy and juicy. Skipped the sides but brought home a slice of pecan pie after seeing one at the next table. Bought extra chicken to have some cold tomorrow which is always a good test for great fried chicken. 
13663 4 Yummy food !! A little high price wise but worth each penny. Tried lavash bread , falafel and hummus , everything was delicious. 
13664 4 Dry helpful customer service and decent prices :). We love having them so close to home. 
13665 4 Confessions of a reluctant shopper: Timbalier is the best. Excellent service. Fun collection of gifts. Small enough that I don't get overwhelmed. Big enough that I always find the perfect present. Thank you, Timbalier! 
13666 4 Great knitting store! Free parking right in front. Friendly owner who happily answered questions and gave recommendations and didn't make me feel bad for asking for help. Maybe my new favorite knitting store in the vancouver area and definitely worth the drive from Yaletown! 
13667 3 Phó is something I purchase regularly from this place, and after trying a few places around town, this place has the best I've tasted in Vancouver. Friendly and fast service to help with my lunch break stop and go! 
13668 2 The climbing is good here - but I would say that Boston Rock Gym has a better selection of climbs. The two main advantages of Metro Rock is that it is T accesible and they will pick you up from the T and that it's slightly cheaper than BRG. 
13669 4 Donuts are to die for. Can get super crowded on the weekends but it's worth the wait. Their coffee needs help though, it was not good at all. Staff is friendly. Enjoy!!! 
13670 4 You can tell some love went into this pho broth. Don't be deceived by the exterior, the food here is Vietnamese food at its finest! Service is great, they even have my order memorized at this point. 
13671 3 A little pricey, but the food is seriously amazing. I don't know what made them decide to make sushi burgers or burger sushi, but it is delicious. The atmosphere of the area is fun, with creative and comical sushi and burger related art and decor. 
13672 3 Our favorite place in Austin... And it must be other folks' favorite as well, there is often a line waiting to get in and sample their eclectic and trendy treats. They make fabulous drinks and the food never disappoints. 
13673 4 Excellent food, service and atmosphere! Shared a bunch of plates, and it was an excellent experience. 
13674 3 First time here...time for a cocktail on the patio with tunes by DJ Loweki! I will have to go back and eat. 
13675 3 Was good. But if you are looking for traditional tacos this place is a bit more modern. 
13676 4 Diane has been cutting our dogs' hair for years, she does a great job and her charges are very reasonable. My dog is quite happy to go there so he must be having a good time. 
13677 4 Have never had a bed experience here before. Love the coffee, and how they don't overload the lattes with sugar. The service is always friendly. I do wish they had more food options, though. 
13678 1 OMG. The lobster is horrible. They used to do a good job but now the lobster not even fresh. So disappointed 
13679 0 The worst airline I have ever been on. Overcharged for ticket when changes flight, they keep you on hold for at least 40 minutes. Their website is not helpful. Very disappointed I will never fly them again. i give them 0 stars. 
13680 1 Although the food was good, it was WAY over price--27$ for piece of fish, green beans, and potatoes. And the house musician was god-awful. 
13681 4 This was our first time and we were not disappointed! The food was excellent! The service was fast & friendly! We will definitely come back. 
13682 4 they have a wonderful atmosphere. the food was great, especially the lamb shank! it was tender, melts in your! the staff was very pleasant and attentive. 
13683 4 This place is really cool. The sushi is delicious and the Bento Boxes are a great option if you are very hungry. The staff is friendly and the prices aren't bad at all. The food is fresh. I recommend the veggie sushi, it is yummy! 
13684 4 Elliot and his partner were super fast and well worth what we paid. They got in and went right to it, moving us out and into our new house in only 2 hours! They are very affordable too, much more affordable than most popular moving companies in Austin. 
13685 4 Moved to the area and tried this place out. The store itself is very clean, and the employees are friendly. Our food is ALWAYS fresh with HUGE portion. Definitely recommend!! 
13686 4 So good. Great flavours and whatnot. I would get next time a dessert, but I had to go to the game. 
13687 3 We have been here a couple of times, for dinner and a large get together! Customer service is great and the food is very good. It is not traditional pub food or atmosphere, it is a little more upscale. 
13688 4 My new favorite pizza in Boston and just overall place to hang in union. Excellent food and service. So good. 
13689 0 I found this place to be so unspecial-- expensive and a meat market. If you are looking to meat someone who will never ever call you again, be sure to check out Daisy's. 
13690 2 Dine out menu is a ripoff for $40. A signle lamb lollipop for a main entree was not enough to enjoy. That being said food quality is above average. Would definitely order off the regular menu. The lack of respect for customers was very disappointing. 
13691 0 They never answer their phone nor return any of your voicemails. After losing an item there, I reached out every day for 4 days with no response. It's a pity because I really like the place. 
13692 2 We visited on a Thursday evening. Portion was good and the food was typical. My experience wasn't bad but nothing out of this world. I would try it again with a different meal because I believe in second chances. 
13693 4 My wife introduced me to this place, 4 years ago and now we drive all the way from Houston just to have the buenos aires cafe experience. We love this place. Their empanadas and alfajores are to die for! 
13694 4 A delightfull business diner Appetizer of raw bar fried oysters and calamari excellent Blue Cod was to die for Will return in the very near future 
13695 4 Whoever "Carlo" is, he should be crowned king of Italy. Try the chicken parmesan. 
13696 4 My favorite dinner spot in Austin. Quality and aesthetics without the pomp and fuss. :) 
13697 0 My boyfriend got food poising from this location. We know it was here because this is the only thing he had to eat that I didn't. He was throwing up for 4 days and had to miss work. AVOID 
13698 3 This place offered a nice value plus the food was tasty. Got a pork dish which could have used a little sauce but still very good. Enjoyed sampling the Empanadas, didn't have one I didn't like. 
13699 2 Atendimento ruim. Serviram um café gelado e o atendente não se mostrou interessado em ajudar 
13700 4 This has to be the best Thai restaurant in Austin, others like Madam Mam's and Thai Kitchen are close but do not compare. They have great Mus a mum (?) curry. I've tried three or four dishes at the restaurant and they are all very tasty. Highly recommend. 
13701 0 Watch out!!! I ate there 9/29/16 and had my credit card information stolen and used from there. I asked them about it and they claimed they knew nothing. It happened in less than 30 minutes. 
13702 0 Pretentious and pricey. Noisy chefs bar. Couldn't hear each other or the chef. Spent a lot, left hungry. Food was good. Attention to presentation but I've had better sushi elsewhere. Valet parking was rude and ridiculous. 
13703 3 Consistently above average. I dine here regularly. The wait staff is attentive and courteous. The food is fresh and prepared properly. 
13704 4 Lovely, clean little shop. Despite some bad reviews, I found the staff very kind and the food was fast and good. Perhaps our experience was better b/c we went in for breakfast on a Sunday morning. Great place to check out if you're gluten-free! 
13705 4 I loooove Homestyle. The best Jamaican food in town. The portions are big and it never disappoints. 
13706 4 Came here on a Sunday around 10:30, waited about 20 min. Got the dirtier breakfast, it was so good! Worth the wait. Beautiful presentation, good service, kept getting my coffee refilled. Would definitely recommend brunch here if you're in the area. 
13707 4 This tour was so fun, personalized, and informative. Our guide was super helpful with those who hadn't kayaked before, and once we all mastered it, she brought us to the spots where the gators hide out. 
13708 4 I was blown away by the level of service and the quality! My nail tech was Treva. She was incredible! I definitely plan on coming back. 
13709 4 I love this place. Awesome chocolate almond croissants, gateau basque, rum balls, etc. High quality pastries, for those with a sweet tooth. 
13710 0 If your going to advertise as an Irish bar, be Irish. Wow the expensive prices are outrageous. Won't be going back. 
13711 4 nice people, nice gardens, pretty view, amazing house and overall worth the short trip there. 
13712 4 I like this dentist. He talks to you like you are an intelligent person. There are no BS extraneous services being hyped. His manner is gentle and he has high skills. Pricing is not cheap, but reasonable. What more can you ask? 
13713 4 Nice coffee place! Busy but not crowded. Clean and tidy. They sell Macaroons! The lychee ones r my favorite as well as strawberry ones. I tried the sandwiches and crossaint last time. Both of them r tasty and healthy. The decorations is good. Wooden tables and chairs. 
13714 4 I've been coming to this location for years now and always have great customer service and feel confident my car is in good hands. Definitely recommend! Also, there's a convenient coffee shop next door while you wait. 
13715 2 Friendly staff, ordered London Broil which is 8oz steak overcook outside but raw inside. 
13716 3 I've been to a good amount of pizza places in the Columbus area, and so far this is the best pizza I've had. It's always hot, cheesy and delicious. Service could be better, but I think the pizza is worth it. 
13717 2 Large, store with plenty of parking, seems to always be busy. Clean, organized, but not a lot of staff around. This store has the usual Target stuff...electronics, clothing, home, children's...and it also has food & pharmacy! 
13718 3 It was a rainy evening, and the patio was still so comfy, with blankets and heaters blasting away. I went with some girlfriends, and the happy hour menu was reasonably priced and delicious (we got mussels, ceviche, lobster poutine, salmon carpaccio, and grilled jumbo oysters). Good drink specials too. 
13719 0 This was the most expensive oil change I've ever had AND I was told that multiple parts needed to be replaced when they didn't. Beware!!! 
13720 4 Great experience all around from the customer service to the food. I absolutely love this place! 
13721 4 They did a fantastic job and the service was great! Brian Anderson and Carl Francis were very helpful! Coming back here airways 
13722 1 Lots of choices and specials Theres interesting yet scary things in the menu, like lychee and peach pork... There's too much sauce for little food 
13723 3 When here for my birthday! If you like seafood then this the place! I had oyster shooter for appetizer an amazing seafood soup and house salad plus key lime pie for dessert. Staff was very friendly and accommodating even got me a birthday candle in my pie. Definitely coming back! 
13724 4 Good good good good good good good milkshake types, including Oreo. Also good is the cinnabon FRENCH TOAST! They somehow acquired the REAL CINNABON FROSTING! I would marry this place and take it to Brazil with me to enhance my politicla career. 
13725 4 Claudete Rizzotto is a fabulous stylist and a delightful person. She is Brazilian and brings that wonderful culture to her work. She has been cutting my hair for about a decade and always does a super job! 
13726 0 Maybe the food is great, I wouldn't know. They decided to start just closing early for whatever reason, a special surprise for my wife, which I live in round rock and made the trip down here turned out to be a huge waste of time. Thanks for nothing. 
13727 4 One of my favorites!! Great margaritas (La Flaca). and tacos al pastor are to die for!!! 
13728 4 Love the location, selection and ease of access. Great place for a relaxing night cap. 
13729 3 Relaxed atmosphere, always good food. Workers look happy and actually talk with people. There's a short young man who is very outgoing and treats us well whenever we go. Short haired blonde girl is new I think but very sweet. Floors are sort of TOO slippery to walk properly sometimes 
13730 3 Terrific place for drinks, oysters, and/or dinner. 
13731 4 great location, great service, great food. One of my favorite places to go in Yaletown. 
13732 4 This has got the best Ramen I've had here in the States. Excellent food. The staff is friendly and the place is comfortable. Having eaten Ramen in Japan, this definitely hits pretty close to it, if not right on the head. 
13733 4 Great evening with my wife celebrating our 20th anniversary. The food was great. Everything was prepared perfectly. Service was excellent. 
13734 4 One of the best bars in Buckhead! Great live music, atmosphere and service! The bartenders and staff are awesome. 
13735 0 Worst tin drum I've ever been to. Under staged and the little staff they had was terrible. Ran out of many food options. 
13736 4 Really impressed with the food! Jazz was a fabulous waitress. Had a lot going on, but took care of us and checked on our table frequently. Judd the manager is really awesome and asked us how our meal was twice. Very pleased, will be back again! 
13737 4 Ordered delivery yesterday and it was fantastic! Had the lobster ceviche and the Cajun shrimp pasta. Soooooo good. Good portion sizes and it was seasoned really well. I saved the other half and ate it today. Even better as leftovers. I can't wait to visit the restaurant in person! 
13738 1 Was not as impressed as what was being offered( soft serve ice cream ) still like their other product served in the Salt and Straw 
13739 1 Waited 10 minutes before server acknowledged us. Ordered queso which was decent. Got the bill before our entree after waiting 15 minutes for it and entree had cheese on it when we asked for it on the side. OK tacos. Won't be back. 
13740 4 A straight forward barber shop with a great staff that is just as friendly the first time as they are your 20th time. You will get a good haircut here, no question about it. 
13741 4 Eat at Petrones at least once a week! The greek salad with chicken and dressing is best in town, highly recommend! The guys are friendly and really learn your orders after a couple trips in! 
13742 4 Yum! We tried both savory and sweet waffle combinations. However, I would go with the sweet combinations. The waffle was a bit sweet for what my savory option was. But it was still amazing! I would recommend trying their lemonades yum yum yum! 
13743 3 這是一間現已為數不多仍然是推車仔賣奌心的茶樓，真系好鬼懐舊，我朋友叫左虾餃，燒賣同埋魚蓉腸粉，我就叫左牛肉球同埋潮州粉果，熱辣辣糸架車仔度攞出嚟，真糸好过㽼！其中有个高高瘦瘦靚靚嘅經理好鬼热情，服务又体贴。值得一去！ 
13744 4 That rooftop view, that hop-skip-jump distance to the boardwalk, that location, location, location. When I was apartment hunting, that's why Amli South Shore stood out. Now that I'm here I'm smitten with the enclosed dog park, the accessible management team, and the location, location, location! 
13745 4 I love this place. Everyone is so nice. I can't remember the guy's name who helped me out, but he has helped me multiple times with all my dumb questions. Thanks dude. 
13746 3 Great service, great food, the restaurant was clean as could be. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the restaurants fault but the corporation itself, the prices are a bit high but pizza has become a delicacy anymore so it's to be expected. 
13747 4 Amazing, Beer is never disappointing. I like the size of the space too being small but accessible to all. The staff are always on top of their game. I look forward to my pint or two there soon 
13748 4 I order from JJ pretty frequently. They deliver when they say they will, my order is always perfect, and I have no no no no complaints. Nicest bunch of stoners in the world! 
13749 4 I love boloco. It is cheap and really good quality food. If you are looking for something healthy they have it too(Brown rice, whole wheat wraps etc.). Good shakes and smoothies. I especially recomend the teryaki wrap with chicken... mmmm... 
13750 0 Girls are so rude when you try and sell back they were short with me and acted like I was bothering them. I think the oldest girl working there was maybe 21? They need someone a little older to manage them! Also, the place has a distinct musk. 
13751 4 Wow. Food was absolutely incredible and service was even better. Tess took care of us on a Saturday and we had a wonderful experience. Quiet. I recommend using Lyft to get here, parking is annoying. Awesome spot. 
13752 4 I was in Austin on a business trip and my stone in my engagement ring fell out. Originals was able to not only repair my ring but tighten all my stones and make it look like new! Great service and a beautiful selection! 
13753 0 They say they r open until 1am but they really close at 1215. You've been warned. Total crap. 
13754 4 We visited for my daughters 17th birthday party, and we had a great time. We did the alien abduction, and the puzzles were a lot of fun. We will definitely be back. 
13755 4 Amazing food. Amazing spot. Amazing people. Very vegan friendly. They are open to substituting ingredients for you within reason. Hit it up. 
13756 3 One of the best brunches in ATL. The food and entertainment is great. I've been a few times for both brunch and dinner and I will continue to come back! Planning a birthday party here soon! 
13757 4 Having frequented almost all of the other Cambridge and Somerville coffee shops, I feel very happy to now call True Grounds my digs. The staff are awesome! (Amy remembered me and my order after my very first visit) The hang is relaxing, the food is good, and the coffee delish. 
13758 4 I love this place!!!! From the margaritas to the guacamole to the yummy yummy fish tacos and the amazing deserts!!!! Service also, very personal- surprisingly refreshing. Can't wait to go again and try the salsa dancing. Great Job Papagayos, keep up the great work!!! 
13759 4 Convenient location. Super friendly staff. Walk-ins welcome. My previous optometrist over-corrected me and wearing glasses made me dizzy, but Dr. Sabree got me the correct prescription and is very knowledgeable and gentle. Highly recommend! 
13760 4 Great restaurant good food at inexpensive prices. They had the best lamb and chicken combo with rice and salad and their homemade sauce...too bad they closed for good...gonna miss this place! 
13761 4 A scrumptious sunny breakfast spot! Started with a creamy got chocolate and then Eggs Benedict. It was superb! A perfect balance of fresh housemade hollandaise sauce, smoked Canadian bacon and perfectly poached eggs served alongside delicious home style potatoes. A perfect start to my day. Thanks Bridges. Will be back 
13762 4 This place is gorgeous and well-maintained. A great park to bring your family or to have a romantic date. I've been to many events at The Springhouse and it's always lovely in there. 
13763 4 Love this place! Manis/pedis/shellac/acrylic/nail art it's all great! Thanks TRISH for my amazing mani! 
13764 4 This is real Lebanese food, fresh and authentic. Very nice owner, friendly and place is very clean. 
13765 4 I know it sounds weird, but this place served me the best burger I've ever had in my life - the Chorizo burger! 
13766 4 Great atmosphere and service. Good happy hour for drinks! Duck poutine was good and huge. Love the squid! 
13767 4 Fabulous!! We had dinner delivered, a gift for travelers!!! The food was incredible!! And the price was very reasonable! Thanks! And the service, the delivery man, SO nice!! The wait, was long, but worth it!!! 
13768 0 For a grocery that advertises as a farmer's market, their produce section is sure disappointing. Not so fresh, limited selection and way over priced. I wonder how they keep their doors open. 
13769 2 Not sure why Tex mex is so hard to pull off? My enchiladas were exceptional, the rest of the table was mixed reviews, the margaritas were terribly uninspiring & I tried 3...their "top shelf", a "scratch", and the tamarindo which only smelled tasty. 
13770 1 Bar has gone downhill. Service was slow tonight. Not a big crowd. Ordered Mexican martinis. Sent both back. They were made with a premix that was awful. The bar needs to go back to "pouring" a real drink. 
13771 4 Eco-friendly cleaner! If you care your health and environment, I would recommend this place. Very friendly and great quality. 
13772 3 Great service and the food was out quickly and... it was delicious! Definitely worth a stop if your in the neighborhood. Also, they have cool specials for blazer games. 
13773 4 I always love coming to desta when I'm home. I usually go on Mondays for the chicken tibs specials. Also there are a lot of vegetarian options. Probably the best Ethiopian food in ATL. 
13774 3 Delicious take out! Highly recommend the wings (all are good), lovers honeymoon, & the banana dessert. 4 stars bc it's a little pricey. 
13775 2 I'll say it: it's not what it used to be. New menus, new prices,... less exceptional food? 
13776 2 I've never ate the food here, mostly due to price and people telling me it is not worth the cost for what you get, but I can tell you there is the best bartender in town there! Delicious drinks, somewhat reasonably priced, and good conversation! 
13777 2 Service was excellent. Spinach dip was dry and served with kettle chips (not a good pairing). The wine was excellent. :) 
13778 4 Marlon was awesome my friend had her birthday dinner there and he gave us the A 1 service i would recommend everyone to go and ask for marlon. 
13779 3 I Loved The Meat.... Looking forward to going back and trying the Gyro Pizza. Missing 1 star cause it um.... Needed to be bigger :) 
13780 0 If I didn't have a cart full of things I needed and took an hour to gather ...... I would have walked out! Three lines open with more than 6 customers per line. Ridiculous. Customer service sucks at this location!!!!! 
13781 3 only reason I'm not giving this lovely establishment a 5 star is because of the shrimp I had to peel my self and I'm a huge fan of shrimp. But this place is awesome!! lovely ambiance, lovely price, large portions! this is a gem! really hope this place stays true 
13782 4 A must do if you have family. A must do if you like shows and don't like virtual rides in Universal or have motion sickness issues. The animals are well maintained and their philosophy is well meaning. 
13783 2 Haven't been there..but wanted to go...went to their home page and that has to be the dumbest home page I have ever seen. No idea what the place has except for you guys and your reviews...so thanks!!!! 
13784 4 LOVE! Super moist, massive, and superrr-tasty burgers. Fries, awesome as well. The whole set-up is really unique & fresh. Totally dig! 
13785 1 I got food poisoning from the food I ate there yesterday. Don't eat their gross over-priced food. 
13786 2 I was excited to eat here, and the food was tasty, but there was only one tiny sliver of tofu in the vegetarian noodle bowl. The red noodle bowl was quite tasty, too. Also, we'd have preferred more veggies in our selections. Good selection of tap beers. 
13787 4 Love this place. So many awesome items it's hard to make a decision! 
13788 4 Excellent massage and customer service! Went for couples massage, very relaxing afternoon. 
13789 4 The Southwest wrap is my favorite and kale said they even give complimentary alkaline water lol( just a cup ) but oh well it's the thought that counts! 
13790 3 Great Ramen!!! The bowls are huge! Long wait though 
13791 4 This is the 2015 pizza challenge winner it has goat cheese spinach pesto onions basil walnuts see pics Best pizza in Vancouver italian style 5/5 excellent 
13792 4 Best hot dogs in the area. Great burgers. Amazing prices. Great atmosphere. Nothing says old school like Casey's. 
13793 3 Cool spot with good food and good customer service. The wife and I were able split a California Roll, Thai Spring Rolls, and Beef Pad Se Ew, she said it was a little salty but overall still enjoyed the flavor of the dishes. 
13794 3 Decent enough. Liked the firm bed. Stayed on the 2nd floor. Quiet stay, small pool and hot tub. Better than other options around the airport 
13795 4 Wonderful place! Great customer service! It's not exactly authentic Japanese, but the food is still delicious and the staff is great! 
13796 3 Last night we went in for late night drinks & snacks. To my surprise, it was really delicious. I highly recommend the appetizer that's basically a fried Ruben sandwich. WOW! I can't remember the name of it but it's absolute perfection! 
13797 4 Really great waffles, I love the liege batter. Also, tasty coffee. It can get really busy here. Sometimes there is a lineup. Everything is prepared with care and elegance. The staff is caring and attentive. It's a good place to bring friends for brunch. Will be back soon. 
13798 4 Best sushi in Portland. Best time to go is daytime during the week. I ordered the sashimi and sushi and it was spectacular. Hesitant to recommend for fear it will get crowded but seriously, extremely good sushi and at a great price. 
13799 0 I sat in the drive thru at this location on a Saturday morning from 11:00-11:38 am. That is just ridiculous to sit in a drive thru. Apparently they were training, but the should probably consider another time to do that. Don't know if I'll ever be visiting that location again. 
13800 4 Very cute new place. Everyone is very friendly, and the waffles are tasty and come in big servings. Decoration is nice, and it's a good addition to the neighborhood. 
13801 4 Love People's pharmacy so much. They carry the natural products I use. Their staff is so helpful. They approach health from all aspects which is what makes people thrive. Its so nice to have businesses like this. I hope they stick around forever. 
13802 3 First lobster roll I ever had and it was delicious. Connecticut Style was great. I will definitely return!! 
13803 2 Holy S*%@! They have a statue commemorating the Confederacy!!! AAAAAK!!!! THAT IS NOT NORMAL!!!! Texas is considered a weird state by any self-respecting Northerner and my visit to the Capitol Building confirmed this suspicion. 
13804 3 Taste the Italian roots of Todd English, who also owns Olives, with his signature thin crusted pizza topped with figs and proscuitto. It's the perfect balance of sweetness and saltiness. 
13805 2 I like this place a lot but the last time I went had a bad service and the fries weren't that good like they usually are. Every time I come to this place I have the feeling that they want me out as soon I sit down to eat. 
13806 2 Holiday weekend. Crowded. Noisy. Not a bad atmosphere. I was a little surprised at the price of a lobster roll. Shame on me for not fully realizing the market price. Good service for a busy day. 
13807 4 James is a rockstar in this business. You are foolish to look anywhere else. He works on kitchen and laundry appliances. He is responsive, on time, fair, and just a darn good person. 
13808 0 Make my appointment online, come to Mr tire, but Manager said no email about my appointment and couldn't help with my oil change. No problem Mr. Tire, I will never back. Just BAD customer service. 
13809 3 We happened upon this for brunch and it was really nice. Food was executed well. Staff was great. I have this on my list of places to try for dinner. 
13810 4 Found this place with a Yelp search. I was a little skeptical with so few reviews, but the rating is on point. Super friendly and attentive staff. The Boulder Omelet with Hollandaise 
13811 4 Comfortable, friendly, delicious. The portobello sandwich was amazing. Great coffee too! 
13812 4 Steak so good you can't stop eating and dreaming about it. Get some so you can sleep better at night! 
13813 2 The food is ok, but the service is horrible. Waited forever to get drinks and then twice as long to get the check. 
13814 3 Really good burritos and tostadas I really wish they had a location closer in so I could visit more. But this place is definately worth the trip into outer east portland. 
13815 0 Do not order the pasta dinners from this place. If you're looking for good Italian pasta dinners I highly suggest you look elsewhere. The marsala here was more disappointing than the 3-1 lead the warriors blew in the NBA finals. 
13816 4 Love this place. The antithesis of every crappy bar in downtown Orlando which is all of them. Great staff, great beer, great atmosphere. About twenty really good rotating taps. 
13817 4 Really enjoyed brunch here. Fantastic omlettes, local cheeses, unreal bloody Mary's great service! 
13818 2 First time visiting here, my date and I had the salmon, it was a tad tough though. Not the best but then again this is a tex-mex maybe not the brightest idea to go with the salmon. I shall try something else next time. 
13819 4 "This cafe is so different from all the others! In another places all the food is deep fried + hot dogs. In Hillcrest my kids can eat fresh healthy food and freshly squeezed juices. Couldn't wish better!" 
13820 4 Dropped a package off here this morning. No line, easy and quick. Got a receipt for my tracking and was on my way a few minutes after getting inside. The gentleman behind the counter was friendly and helpful. 
13821 2 It looks spectacular but you have to be affiliated with the school in order to use it. What a shame. 
13822 4 We were in the mood for a burger, passed this place that said "burger" and we stopped on a whim. Great burgers, great stockyard fries, fairly nice service. Single complaint was the avocado on my friends burger was not ripe enough to eat. Delicious, will defintely be back. 
13823 3 Been here more than a dozen of times, very friendly bartender, food was good and drinks are good. Prices are right, not too far from my house. I love it, will return again soon! 
13824 4 We loved this, it was amazing food, delivered fast. We had the chicken lo-mein and the mixed meats lo mein 
13825 3 Tried it because it was close to the hotel. Pretty solid cheese over the toppings style pizza. Take out and delivery only. 
13826 4 Amazing as always. Pizza wonderful A true must try!!! Anyone giving less than 5stars has zero concept of good food 
13827 4 The sliders are amazing! My favorite is the Sellwood. Also the truffle fries are great. Very good food. Will go back. 
13828 4 This place is great. Stopped here after the parks one day and the menu is top notch. Prices are on point and the food is delicious. Definitely stop here if your in the mood for anything Latin. 
13829 3 Awesome deal 20$ for just ten... I love Mexican food, and this is a nice little location in Union Square for those looking for authentic mexican. The salsa is to die.. 
13830 4 Their food is extremely filling and not as spicy as Indian food -- in many ways, it reminds me of Indian food with the spices dialed down. I love their Momos (dumplings), both vegetarian and beef. Their tea is also excellent. 
13831 4 Rivals the Thai food I ate in Asia. Definitely the best Thai I have eaten in the States. This place is great! The ambience is amazing and the service is top-notch. The food is beautifully presented, flavorful and generously served. A must-go whenever I am in Portland--can't get enough!! 
13832 4 Been ordering delivery for the past 5 years. Excellent food, great service and no MSG! All white chicken meat and fresh veggies. I highly recommend Hot Plate! 
13833 4 This is just a great place for sandwiches, pies and a coffee. Friendly service and nice atmosphere. Only small seating area but worth the wait. 
13834 3 I've been missing Pietro's Pizza since moving out of Southern Oregon. Great Pizza, lots of games for the kids. 
13835 1 Ate here for my brother's birthday. Food was awful. Had the bolognese like the reviews recommended it was terrible. The caesar salad was pretty bad too. The calamari was good and the pizza was nothing special. Ambiance and service were nice though. Overall I would never go back here. 
13836 0 Waited in drive thru for nearly 5 minutes this morning and nothing. Called and no answer. WTH? 
13837 3 Very nice little place. I truly enjoyed the food. But it was busy for only one server. The Cuban bread it's really good 
13838 1 They did not have a lot of variety and i felt the prices were high for a thrift store. You can get bran new clothes for what they are charging. Not worth going. 
13839 2 I've tried leaving this place because they're not so clean, but I always end up coming back. Why? I don't know, all I know is that they're the ONLY ones that never mistreat me. 
13840 4 You can't go wrong at Union Square Donuts: the coffee is great, the tea is great, and the donuts are spectacular, the best I've ever had hands down. 
13841 4 Great cafe. The staff that work here are so nice and each dish is prepared with love. 
13842 4 Great place. Very nice waitress. I wish I had gotten her name so I could share it! Food was perfect. 2 of us shared the meatball appetizer and then the Polpette pizza at the suggestion of the waitress - excellent choice! Highly recommended. 
13843 4 This replaced Madras Pavilion, which featured vegetarian South Indian food. The new owners offer south and north cuisine plus chicken and lamb dishes. No longer strictly vegetarian, which disappointed me. it the food and service were both still excellent. 
13844 3 This complex has the fastest work order turnout and I greatly appreciate that. Previous apartment complexes would take up to 2 weeks to get anything fixed. And John always does an awesome job. 
13845 2 Does satisfy your Pho craving, and it was quick. Service was good, and the price was reasonable. 
13846 1 how the hell this place stays in business is beyond me. out of all of the places in the neighborhood, this one is a headscratcher. While the food isn't awful, it's mediocre, and WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY overpriced. Don't get it. I really don't. Do you? 
13847 4 Delicious flavor! Friendly and quick service. Close to work. Visa/MasterCard accepted. I love their wide menu options. They make my lunch experience YUMMY! Thank you! 
13848 1 This place is barely average at best. Service was pretty mediocre and prices were way off the charts for what was being served. Absolutely not worth the price of admission. Try Scutra instead if you are set on staying in Arlington. 
13849 4 We went here on a Sunday night,Chicken parm over flowing and delicious. Calamari top notch.The service was great 
13850 4 These guys were great! We had them help us load a ReloCube. Even though we requested help at the last minute, they showed up on time and were super efficient, friendly, and professional. Thanks. 
13851 4 Got the curry chicken ($10) and the oxtail dish ($16), both of these dishes were SO good, I cleaned my plate! Service was great, staffs were really kind. I can't wait to come again and try other dishes! There's a large parking lot and very casual environment. 
13852 4 Got take out from here a while ago. I had the aloo gobi which is cauliflower and potatoes stewed in a tomatoey sauce. OMG it was so good. I've tried aloo gobi at a few other places but so far none have measured up to this place! 
13853 4 Best haircut experience ever. Outstanding attention to detail. Get exactly what you ask for. Perfect blends. Great customer service. Overall quality of haircut is excellent can't find any other barber who does hair in this professional experience! Will always come back for the perfect haircut. 
13854 1 Food is good but it's way too loud and the wait is often way too long. :( 
13855 4 Amazing food. Fish and chips, blackened chicken alfredo, burgers are great! Have been 5 times now and had nothing bad. We eat in the dining room, there is hardly a wait. Parking lot is almost always full, but most people seem to be in the bar. 
13856 3 Wow! When our family walked in, we were greeted so warmly and walked through the menu and ordering process like it was the best decision we've ever made. The gentleman that helped us could be an inspirational speaker and seems 100% genuine. Thank you for running a great, family-friendly company! 
13857 4 One of the best breakfast restaurants I've eaten at anywhere in the world. Outstanding coffee, real Belgian waffles, and original gourmet "skillet" served breakfasts. My taste buds are in heaven... 6 Stars ;) 
13858 4 Quik Trip is the gold standard for gas/convenience stores. Staff are energetic and pleasant. Bathrooms are clean. Great offerings. I have one minor complaint. They never have pencils with the lottery tickets. I bring my own now. 
13859 2 One amazing thing is that they have duck tongues here and that dish is delicious. In addition, the dumplings and buns are just fair. They open to 3:00am which satisfies my late night appetite. The food is not fantastic, but is still acceptable. 
13860 4 Great bar! Food is good and service is great! Here on a Saturday night and they have a great band! This place is definitely gonna get busy once the WORD gets out! We will be back! 
13861 3 Excellent food and service had a great time. We had a group of nine and we sat down right away. The lobsters were awesome. More food than you can imagine, we would recommend this to anyone. 
13862 1 Don't know whats so good about this place. It has like 4 tables maybe? Had to sit with some strangers, and food wasn't great. It was a lot for the price though, so if you want quantity over quality, this is your place to go to for cheap. 
13863 3 Great location. Just near the sea side. Their fire grilled lobster with two sides are really good. Don't need to order the clam chowder. Because it's pretty similar with others. The oyster is fresh. 
13864 4 Who knew that pureed everything would be so delicious? Finally, a restaurant I can leave my dentures at home for and not get any cross-eyed looks for eating with my hands! Oh, and holy tons of veggie options!!! 
13865 4 Everything on the menu is delicious. I have never ordered something that I did not like. Tortilla soup, steak and a French 75 to drink is usually my usual order! The outdoor sitting is very peaceful during this time of year, and indoors is always quite pleasant. 
13866 3 Just happened into this place and loved it! The Thai curry soup was delicious and the tomato and cucumber salad was refreshing! I would definitely recommend. 
13867 4 Love this place for breakfast! Me and my husband go there a lot and they don't dissappoint, we only do breakfast there and havent tried their lunch menu 
13868 4 Amazing food. Everything from the salad to entree to dessert and drinks was top notch. A bit on the expensive side but totally worth it. 
13869 2 We stopped here for a quick bite in Ponce Street Market. My companion had a burger and I had pie. They have both a take out area and counter service. We were there right at lunchtime and the service could have been a bit better but it wasn't awful. 
13870 4 Seriously this place is AMAZING. gyros, hummus, grape leaves, baklava, all awesome! My favorite is the hummus though. The guy who always serves us, is always happy to see everyone and his prices rock. I hope this guy never leaves! 
13871 4 Really good locally owned coffee shop. Great customer service, love the guy Lyle that's there most afternoons. Pastries and cookies super good too. Free wifi. Cozy place to hang out. 
13872 4 Everything was amazing. Service was excellent. Well worth it. A book of just drink choices. Meat cooked perfectly. The salad bar with so many choices. You cannot leave there and not be satisfied. Desert was amazing too. Creme Brûlée and Brazilian cheesecake was out of this world! 
13873 4 Love Genies Cafe!...the best Bloody Mary selection in town...several infused vodkas provide a custom tailored level of kick!...the service and food are awesome!! 
13874 4 Our favorite treat for breakfast! Huge portions and super-friendly service. Bring your appetite for sure! I usually ask for a to-go box right away so I'm not intimidated by the omelettes, I easily get two meals out of it, sometimes three! Cash only, well worth the wait. 
13875 3 I like this place! Beer is good! Outside seating is awesome! The servers and bar tenders are so nice. 
13876 3 Great brunch spot! A unique mix of moroccan and traditional eggs and waffles. Be aware its ALWAYS busy! 
13877 1 It was just mediocre. I tried them twice and I hate to say it, but that pizza sitting in the rotating warmer at the gas station might be better. 
13878 4 Excellent pizza and the best greek salad with grilled chicken under ten bucks! I come here every week with my family. The front staff is extremely helpful and wonderful. The meat lover's pizza is to die for. Bill's is tops for Newton and Boston! 
13879 0 Found a long black hair in my veggie wrap. They gave me attitude when I pointed it out to them. Do not eat here. 
13880 4 Another great night with friendly servers and delicious food. There is something to be said for the service here. Always quick and the food is excellent, not to mention huge. I can't ever finish a meal. There are always leftovers! Such a wonderful salem hot spot! 
13881 2 Basic Irish pub bar food. I ordered a Reubin sammy & it was super dry. I think the bar would be fun with a group, but I was here for lunch, so no drinks! 
13882 3 We love this place even though we can't afford it. The help is great and the stuff really lasts. We wish that we could shop here more. 
13883 4 Fantastic, sustainably-raised, local beef and pork from their very own farm. It tastes amazing, and the cook prepares it incredibly well. A carnivore's delight, and great deserts from Mio's as well! A perfect place to stop before heading to Hollywood Theatre. 
13884 3 Small, new Indian spot in Coolidge Corner. Perfect place for takeout: tasty food, good prices, parking availability, quick service. Great for a mid-week quick fix. If you ask for it "extra spicy," they won't disappoint. 
13885 2 Great burgers, but wayyy to high on prices i spent 15 on a burger and shake! I will go back if someone else pays lol 
13886 3 This place is well kept and clean. Trucks are too. Good people. Friendly place. Dogs are welcome. Don't go during Halloween due to the haunted house next door you won't find parking. 
13887 2 Not bad, a decent little Italian restaurant on the ground floor of the Park Plaza Hotel. Generous portion sizes. 
13888 0 Worst car rental company ever. Dirty cars, rude customer service, and watch out for Sun Pass traps. They charge you 5 dollars extra per toll if you ever take the Florida Turnpike by mistake without a sun pass. 
13889 4 Everything was amazing! This was our first time at the Beechwold Diner and we loved it! We usually have leftovers, but not this time. George and the staff were super welcoming, personal and pleasant. Our server Stacy was the best!! The caramel apple nut pie ahhhhh 
13890 0 Can I give it less stars? How can a restaurant NOT have a washroom? And then ..order yourself? U ot stay home and cook then? We left and won't go back! 
13891 3 Exelent flavors & friendly helpful people. More busy on Sunday morning than when we went on Saturday. Do not hurry at this place you need time for fresh food.Will go back & Will recommended to others. :) 
13892 3 Must get the Bento Box! A perfect variety of 6 different little entrees. The drinks are good. They're shrimp appetizer was just okay. Was expecting better. But still overall a wonderful place. I go at least 2 times a month and will continue. 
13893 3 The lobster rolls are generously sized and the buns are buttered and toasted nicely. It's a great choice for takeout, and the women behind the counter were super friendly. The kids said that their French fries were better than most and they were happy with their chicken tenders too. 
13894 4 One of our favorite breakfast stops! Tried the original in Jacksonville and was amazed. Delighted to find a location near my home! The breakfast menu is fantastic, but I ALWAYS go with one of the daily specials. 
13895 4 really friendly staff and the spicy chicken sandwich was great. not too pricey which was nice. 10/10 would come here again. 
13896 4 My wife and I have been going here for years. The food is great. Ask for Peter as your waiter. Best waiter in the World. Great Sushi ñ!! 
13897 4 Best tacos in Austin - and that's a tall order given that they're our official cuisine (along with BBQ). Berto is a maestro of the highest order! Cash only. 
13898 4 My favorite new coffee shop. I love to be a customer of a new local business. Great coffee, nice environment and awesome people! The iced vanilla latte is the best! 
13899 4 Where else can you find true Turkish cuisine in winter park? No where. Bosphorous is amazing! They have this unique original bread puff they give out for free that is always hot and tasty. Don't even get me started with the hummus! Great service. 5 star hands down! 
13900 4 Requested services for makeup for my engagement photos. Although there was a slight mixup with their scheduling system, make up artist shaun did a wonderful job! Definitely recommend for future use! 
13901 4 Love this new buffet place, such a great deal for the price for the food that's offer!!! Only about $13 for dinner , what else can u ask for? Decent sushi seafood oysters clams ! Shrimp !! Yummy!! Tapanyaki is not bad either! 
13902 4 Wonderful breakfast spot!! Discovered Bijou Cafe on a recent trip to Portland and ended up eating there twice. Best homemade biscuits ever!! 
13903 3 Nearly as good as Kelly's and half the price! You don't get that buttered, delicious bun, but the beef is good and the BBQ is spectacular. 
13904 1 Very disorganized , poor service Not enough servers Servers are sassy Would not come back unless forced 
13905 4 Wow, what a treat of a restaurant. The dumplings are amazing. The bubble tea is great for being so far outside the city. Overall the staff are friendly and helpful. Plenty of options for any type of eater. Would definitely recommend to a friend and would go again. 
13906 4 Great place to drink some coffee and chill. The drinks were great. Atmosphere is coffee shop like. A lot of college students studying. 
13907 4 Best place ever , I just came in as a walking in for a quick pedicure and was the best ever. Chin is the best guy ever. Awesome & unexpected foot mesage Very clean and professional. 
13908 4 My favourite delivery pizza. Ingredients are fresh, pizzas are not greasy, and they have a great website that let's you order on the fly. Winning Pizzas: Mediterranean, Deluxe Hawaiian 
13909 0 Just drove over to this location to get a balance and pedicure. It was 6:45 on my cell phone. Employees were in the parking lot and asked me what service I wanted. I told them and they said, "come back tomorrow!" What?? You post your hours as closing at 7?!? 
13910 0 Closed at 1230 on a Saturday just because - honor your hours. This is embarrassing and I will Never come back 
13911 4 We started with the crispy shrimp and steamed dumplings which came in small portions but were delicious. The pad Thai was excellent and not to heavy as some Thai food can be. 
13912 4 Excellent food. Exceptional service. Will definitely return again. Kyle was fantastic as well as chef Penek! We really enjoyed our time at Marlow's tavern. 
13913 3 Quality of the food was outstanding, but portions are incredibly small. This may work for you but need to duly note. 
13914 4 Nice friendly staff, food is great pretty busy there. Good varieties of breakfast, they even let me change of the side too 
13915 4 The food is amazing. The atmosphere is lively and friendly. The bartender knows his stuff. The portions are huge. I had the chicken fajitas and my sister had a fajita burrito so yummy and the service was quick. 
13916 4 Perfect Austin experience. Spring Dale farms is magical. Food is extremely fresh & delicious Service is impeccable We love the Chef = very welcoming. Overall we had a great night. 
13917 4 Fast service, great food. We went here during 6:30 on Labor Day and got seated within 2 min. Food came out fast and was great quality. 
13918 0 This is probably the worst Waffle House service ever. Waited for 30 minutes with only three others tables only to hear that it would be 30 more minutes until they would start cooking our food. 
13919 4 Perfect neighborhood stop. If you are sick of Big Box coffee....this is your place. I love the sandwiches too. I can skip a pickle & some chips in exchange for service with a smile. 
13920 3 This place was deceivingly great! From the exterior it looks unremarkable but in the backyard of it there's a large amount of space pretty good music and the bar service is quick and efficient. I was also pleased with the liquor selection. 
13921 3 Ordered antique old fashioned. It was a smooth cocktail made of rotten house rye. Nice ambience, great place to have a drink with your friend or meet interesting people 
13922 4 Great hptel. No complaints except the large bottle of water in the room that is NOT complementary. Everything else was nice. They will even let you borrow work out clothes if you did not bring any. 
13923 4 We discovered BDT via postmates bc we were super lazy on a Saturday afternoon and they had a short delivery time. OMG what an amazingly great surprise. The tacos are bang bang banging!! Great flavor. Different tastes. Not your average boring tacos. We will go back tomorrow 
13924 4 Simple delicious pizza. They have a cute outdoor patio to hang out too. all their pizza is made fresh with local market ingredients. the planet cafe is also right next door and there is a little cute coffee place. 
13925 3 Great pizza for a good price. Service was a little lacking but nothing horrendous. The sausage and garlic was amazing, I'd recommend that if you go. Voted best of Boston by Boston magazine 
13926 4 Was seated immediately at lunch time on a Tuesday, all employees were very kind, after we ordered it wasn't 5 minutes until the food came out. Blueberry muffin were great and fresh! 
13927 4 No doubts it's the best buffet for that price. I'm satisfied for great food decent service 
13928 0 Worst customer service. Service and management staff needs retraining. Consider alternate location, really...really. Pay an extra $ it will be worth it 
13929 4 The food here is soooooo gooooood!!!! Cheap and Cheerful!! Been going here for 10 years! 
13930 4 Came in for a flat tire, pricing was definitely fair, service is great. Not a fancy place, but that doesn't really matter when it comes to whether or not a service is high quality. 
13931 4 I love this place, I am obsessed with the lamb plate and my husband always gets the pepperoni pizza (he's a picky eater). One of my favorite places nearby. I have also gotten the lamb gyro but prefer the plate as you also get dolmas. 
13932 4 I just loved everything I tried from mushrooms to fried buns to beef noodle soup! Delicious foods, indeed, excellent taste.. I am a fan of the sesame oil.. 
13933 4 We walked in the door with only YouTube knowledge and Mark REALLY helped round out our expectations. He took the time to explain the process in detail for us and give us some tips and tricks for the best results. Would recommend to anyone, pro or civilian! Great store! 
13934 4 Favourite Starbucks. I love the staff here. The best. So fun, energetic, and do their job with such pizzazz in what could be a tough environment at times. Also this Starbucks opens early. Best staff :) much love 
13935 3 Brush up on your spanish and hit this East Austin gem. Excellent breakfast tacos. I haven't eaten lunch there yet but I'm looking forward to trying it. 
13936 4 This has got to be the "BEST" Pizza Hut I have EVER ate at. Food was quick, Hot and Fresh and tasted awesome. And the service was on point. Highly Recommend! 
13937 3 Place was great fun. Bar was lovely and packed- the service was 5 star. Staff very nice and knowledgable about all the dishes. Food was tasty and fun to share with my group. It's definitely the new hot spot in Boston ! 
13938 4 I appreciate that you make salads aside from the traditional rice plate! I've been twice already and have enjoyed my meals each time. Thank you for the delicious food :) 
13939 2 Normal coffee prices. Parking lot. Easy in. Easy out. Ample seating if you want to hang around. Staff aren't the best conversationalists, but in the morning all I really want is coffee anyways. 
13940 4 Haven't been to Waterford Lakes in a minute,especially to eat, but Finally a really good restaurant in Waterford Lakes ,from the atmosphere,the food, to the service,everything was phenomenal,spectacular wine list on top of it all, 6stars!!!! 
13941 4 Family owned business; heart warming food. Can't go wrong ! Sometimes the wait can be slightly longer; but totally worth it ! Friendly people! 
13942 4 I just loving going to TT's to see my buddy Kevin playing for the Raging Teens. Can't be the cheap PBR's, great music and diverse crowd. Always a great time and loads of good bands... 
13943 3 Surprised at the lower reviews. This place has a decent variety of slices and great portion sizes. Boston is pretty much junk for pizza but this spot is def worth a shot. 
13944 2 Food here is good, and in small portion. I love the poori here, it is fried perfectly. I went there on Friday night around 6pm and we were the first customer, so no need to wait, which is very good. 
13945 4 My second time visiting and it did not disappoint. My favorite taco is the Shrimp but the carne asada and fish tacos were also great! Shrimp Tostada was amazing and so was the carnitas quesadilla. Don't forget to try out their homemade sauces. 
13946 4 i love this place. My favorite is the roast lamb. I used to come here a lot with my friend Michael. I find the portions to be very good and the flavour is really good/right. They are also very nice there and very professional. My favorite greek restaurant in Burnaby. 
13947 3 Love the energy and Friday night fun here! The menu is only "okay" for vegan/vegetarians, but they made a terrific hummus and veggie wrap tonight. I'll order that again! 
13948 2 Sandwiches are pretty good, but I think the prices are a little high for what they are selling. Definitely go to try some frozen yogurt! 
13949 2 The atmosphere was awesome as well as the service we got. The chicken fingers were a little dry but the sides were really good. Loved the baked beans and Mac & cheese 
13950 4 great food... buffet well worth the price .............. glad to see a great place for buffet or takeout p.s 
13951 1 The food was really good but my spicy chicken wings... SOME WERE NOT FULLY COOKED!!!!! 
13952 4 Excellent selection. Food is great. Service was good and I like to the outdoor seating area. 
13953 3 I actually really like Tim's coffee. It's really good and cheap for no frills for $2. This location is busy but not as busy as the other ones. Customer service has always been good. 
13954 4 Reserving a space here was extremely fast and easy. Samantha was really helpful and super kind. She explained the rates which match what was online. I would definitely use this space again. 
13955 3 Rachel is always lovely. Happy hour is fun and bustling filled with some of my all time favorites. Ham and cheese crepes, chicken liver pate, the baby burger and oysters! Love the Bras. My favorite upscale comfort food spot in Boulder. 
13956 4 Great food and slot of it. Very fresh and piping hot. The chips and salsa were great tasting. The waiter could have been more attentive, but overall a great place if you love Mexican food. 
13957 3 Get the steak tacos!! My barbacoa one was pretty much all fat/fatty pieces and no real meat but I'll forgive them beause that steak taco was amazing! Wanted to try chicken but they were out... I'll definitely come back. 
13958 4 Charming little family-owned Shanghainese restaurant at the end of Chinatown. I liked the food here so much, I ate here twice in one day!! Some famous Shanghainese eats are steamed pork buns, braised pork shoulder, minced meat served with toasted sesame bread, fried rice cake and shanghai thick noodles. 
13959 1 Good food but terrible service. Don't clean the tables, used dishes everywhere. Asked twice for cleanup and was told we will clean up soon, never happened. If you are understaffed, fix it. It's most unappetizing to see used plates all around you. 
13960 4 Favourite breakfast place. Only downside is long lines. Love the flank steak and always have to get a waffle. 
13961 4 Very affordable and all about serving delicious, traditional, Ethiopian cuisine! 
13962 4 This place was so helpful in replacing my iPhone 5c screen last minute. Took just about an hour! They also have a lifetime warranty for shattered iPhone screens :) Thanks Scott! 
13963 3 Sapporo used to be 5 star on my book, but recent trip made me think they have lost some touch. They are still good, but something is missing. In bean town this is a gem and I still go back there, especially in cold winter days. 
13964 4 Lovely place for coffee. We got to sit in comfortable chairs and the cappuccinos were bought to our table. It was delicious coffee. Food was available too if you were hungry. Loved the fact they had a bowl of water outside for the dogs. 
13965 4 Great place to grab a beer and relax. Nice size covered patio and friendly service. Order a "Gose all the way" and enjoy the people watching! 
13966 3 Only buy our vehicles here because of the no-hassle pricing. Still takes too long to complete a transaction though 
13967 4 Service can be a bit slow during lunch, but let's be fair, it's lunch time so it's expected. Food is outstanding! Spicy, if you like.......the bowls are my favourite! 
13968 2 We found this place rather boring. Uninteresting sushi and the noodle dish was bland. 
13969 4 Just had my first Roxy's Grilled Cheese. A-mazing! Absolutely loved it, great idea & great food! 
13970 2 Great food, could be a little bigger portions for the price. The chicken and waffle were served hot, the chicken crispy! Eggs, bacon, andoullie sausage and grits were wonderful, plus the bacon jam n biscuit! Clean and organized, convenient parking in the back off the street. I would come back. 
13971 3 Great pizza, very speedy and good for gluten free! All my friends liked the gluten free crust better than regular. Their Montreal pizza is to die for! We order pizza from this location all the time. 
13972 1 Food is mediocre at best. Service was horrible (20 minute wait for drinks). Definitely not worth the price considering all the great places in the North End. 
13973 2 I tried two Arepas and they both disappointed. The meat, sauce, and fillings were all good but the Arepa was too thick and wasn't crisp 
13974 4 Chae is amazing! Moved from SF and have been looking for a place to get eyelash extensions that last, look good and are a reasonable price. This place is it! She is quick and they look beautiful. I am now a regular. Highly recommend. 
13975 4 Really nice restaurant with great food, great staff loved the place. We ordered the Pad Thai, fish cakes and a curry dish. Everything tasted so good. 
13976 3 deputy mary was awesome and a great team building exercise. She was very helpful in guiding us but not giving the answer. 
13977 3 Good Thai curry, especially red with duck and yellow with pork. Tempura was cooked perfectly. The spider roll was delicious and desserts (coconut custard and sticky rice with mango) were amazing. Service was less than superb, but got the job done. Over all a great place. 
13978 3 Great pancakes! Random spot but old school dinner food is fantastic! Staff is friendly and the food is yummy! 
13979 4 First time coming to Mattress Firm and Ted was very helpful from the moment I walked into the store. He was very knowledgeable and helped us pick a mattress that pleased both my girlfriend and I. 
13980 0 Food took two hours with no explanation. The waitress snapped at us. I've never been somewhere that has treated poorly served customers with such disrespect and inconsiderate manners. 
13981 4 Excellent choice. + Focus on fresh ingredients + Use of local organic as much as possible + Breadth of menu + Clean, comfortable + Taste, temperature - Service adequate but should be better (one visit for lunch and not busy) + Parking 
13982 3 It's okay. Just like every other Panera I've graced the drive through of. But sometimes consistency is good when you just want an unsweetened pink fruity tea. 
13983 4 Friendly and gentle staff, great new building, has always been running on schedule for my appointments. 
13984 3 My husband loves the chicken sandwich. I recently had the mac n cheese which had a thin cheese sauce. Disappointed in the taste and plate appeal. Service has always been good and nice employees. 
13985 4 Stopped here after finding it on Yelp. Great food, great price and super friendly people. The French toast is amazing! Great prices too. 
13986 4 Good is excellent. I had chili dog and fries. Also shrimp poboy so yummy. Service was good customer service. A little slow but worth the wait. I would definitely go back. 
13987 2 This place is nice and all but not my type. It is a fancy place, great for going out when you wanna dress up and look posh. Pros: Good food, Cons: Can be pricey, 
13988 4 Great spot! Great service and amazing Pho! Real college feel since its in the middle of GSU but in a good way. They know what they are doing. Great downstairs seating area as well! 
13989 0 Amanda was so extremely rude. Never returning here again and I am going to tell everyone I know to go elsewhere. 
13990 4 Beautiful ombré dip by Taylor. Only my second time trying the SNS nails but I've been here on multiple occasions for gel nails and pedicures. The staff here is always so friendly and I've never had to wait very long. 
13991 3 UFood is really good!! We grabbed dinner here prior to going to the movies. The UnFries are great... and I love the bison burger. For 2 of us to have dinner complete with sides and a beverage, it was $14.95 -- yes, less than $15 -- WOW!! 
13992 4 Best fish and chips around. They have super fresh fish and their batter is perfect. Everything there is very good, but the fish and chips keeps me coming back. 
13993 4 This place lives up to all the hype and definitely worth the hour wait! Not just delicious brunch but best coffee in Vancouver 
13994 4 Had an awesome dinner on Tuesday night at this place. It's in the new Doubletree Hotel here in Dunwoody ! Great music, outstanding atmosphere and best chicken and waffles I have ever eaten!! This place is going to be the next big thing - I'll definitely be back! 
13995 4 It was a rough time in the airport due to weather delays but adjusting my rental car needs with each change of flight was easy. When we finally got to Orlando, Karlos Torres went out of his way to cheer us up and get us on our way quickly. 
13996 1 Beware of the sizing! Much smaller than expected... Ted wouldn't be cool with his name on that baby bison burger! 
13997 4 Food was amazing. So much flavor and the sides were outstanding. The restaurant was clean and very industrial modern. Loved the ordering process and the staff was very nice. Definitely recommend the Venezuelan empanadas and the sandwiches. Don't forget the plantains on the side. We will definitely be back! 
13998 4 My wife and I got the poke, it was perfect. The flavors were so balanced and tuna was very good. For sure a new favorite! 
13999 4 Everyone will always suggest VooDoo but. Blue Star is so much better. Hand crafted unique flavors and tons of atmosphere. No way to go wrong with this is where I enjoy donughts! 
14000 4 Super great tacos with an amazing couple that runs it. We were super happy with the way they catered our friends birthday party. No complaints at all. 
14001 2 Food is pretty good. Service isn't bad. Can be really busy so plan ahead when you go. I would rather eat here than Denny's or Ihop. you can leave those places hungry. 
14002 3 Had a business meeting here, and it was a great location. We met late afternoon, and the sound level was great for conversation. Staff was extremely helpful and attentive. We sat for over 1.5 hours and never felt neglected or harassed. Had 2 appetizers and both were delicious. 
14003 4 Our go-to breakfast spot. Awesome wait staff, great food and specials. Always leave thrilled with our experience. Love Jered&Paul too... Not as much as the mushroom and sausage gravy but they are up there. 
14004 3 It a cute place in seaport looking over the water. I came here for a bday with a party of 8. Pros: Great with groups, good atmosphere, lots of seafood selection Cons: Portions run small 
14005 4 Simply THE BEST! Not overpriced and super fresh. Great service and the best sushi masters. 
14006 2 Good for a quick lunch! Usually get 4, they are not overly filling so expect to be hungry in a few hours. I would come here if I had a taco craving for sure or if I was walking way. Basically the same consistency at both locations. 
14007 3 Yes Lawd. Come through with the banging soul food! We ordered mac n cheese, collard greens and fried chicken. Everything tasted great. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's a bit tight and crowded. Other than that, I loved it 
14008 4 Quinn and Kyle have a great team of artists that will turn any uncreative individual like myself into the next Picasso. The paintings make great gifts for friends and family members. You can never have too many. 
14009 0 We drove miles to have a family dinner just find them closed at 7 PM for no good reason. A big waste of time. 
14010 2 This place is ok, however I rarely visit venues at night due to crowds as to wait times for drinks, food, or bowling. Nice place to go but again be aware of the time you go which will dictate your service. 
14011 3 Veg spring rolls are great. Stuffed eggplant also really good. 
14012 0 This place is pretty bad. Expect to be waiting an hour after your appointment time before you see the doctor. 
14013 4 I had never been to a school to get a haircut before and was a bit hesitant. Lucas was super friendly and hillarious and gave me an awesome haircut. The massage and hot towel treatment were rad too. I went back and the next do was even better. 
14014 4 DELICIOUS. The chicken adana kebab and doner kebab are to die for. If you have room for desert, get the pistachio ice cream. 
14015 4 Burgers heaven! period! Go,eat and be happy and full! 
14016 4 Great food. Love the choices. Great service. Saw what we wanted right away -chicken cordon bleu sandwich &amp; a Grilled Portabella Sandwich. Yum!!! 
14017 2 The usual chipotle. This one seems a little busier than some. Perhaps a little dirtier... The lines are long but it goes by pretty fast. 
14018 3 Great southern food with "home cooked " this is a large dining room. The staff is friendly and courteous. The food is very good southern food. Good sized portions and very tasty. 
14019 4 Loved it, great time. Hate being served from behind at a bar though! Man behind the bar was a pro and sensed my discomfort and made up for it very well with great drink selections. Wonderful tasting menu. Will be back next time in Austin!! 
14020 3 We needed a virtual reality head set and some hard boiled eggs on our way to Melbourne Beach. Lucky for us we found both here! Restrooms were very clean! Coffee was not great... and their cup lids made sipping difficult. 
14021 4 Incredibly helpful and knowledgable staff and stocked with all kinds of plumbing supplies not available at Home Depot or Lowe's. 
14022 4 Great Local restaurant. We almost missed it because it was so small in a mini-mall - next door to Carrabbas. Food was delicious & very reasonably priced. Street Tacos "Mexico City" were amazing - steak very good! 
14023 4 Big fan of the Dashi Bowl and the teriyaki rolls. Great people work there and the atmosphere is fun. If you're trying to find something fast and tasty without consuming too many calories , it's a good option. However if you need the calories, Starbucks is always next door. 
14024 2 Service was slow. Asked for our steak "rare" and all 3 of us had well done steak. The kids meal was good. The maki roll was good. Just disappointed the steak was over-cooked. 
14025 4 Came here for brunch with the GF last weekend. Buffett and bloody marys with a good bar setup, what else can i ask for? The buffet food was awesome and server was great, a younger girl with dark hair. Will def be back in a couple weekends 
14026 1 Hour and a half wait , okay food If you want to see dogs and eat , might I suggest the vending machine at the Humane society 
14027 4 Used them for service and they are very professional, friendly and accommodating. Great dealership and great people! 
14028 4 Catherine and her entire team have been extremely helpful and supportive during this difficult time. They all offered great advice and guidance. 
14029 3 Great staff great drinks and food say hello to Conan the Irish bartender. 
14030 4 Phenomenal donuts! We got there early and beat the rush so we were in and out within 15 minutes. The cashier recommended we try lemon poppyseed and he wasn't wrong. It was so fresh and just the perfect level of lemony. Great donuts! 
14031 4 All I gotta say is "food paradise" brought me here! Awesome sandwiches, I tried the Sean meatloaf So good and my friend had the meatball she loves hers as well. Will be coming back soon to try the fruit spritzer 
14032 3 Great place for a 30th birthday celebration! Maykold was a wonderful waiter with a strong knowledge of the menu and suggestions. One entree came out a tad off but the manager went beyond with personal attention and extras ;) as the head chef addressed the issue 
14033 2 Good draft selection and service was solid. We just wanted a little snack and beer before dinner tonight. Cheese fries use liquid cheese on bottom layers and was not that pleasant. 
14034 4 Love their combo B... Crab legs, shrimp, blue crab, corn & andouille sausage. Get the garlic butter medium!! So yummy!! 
14035 3 Great place to hang out, they have a small amount of outside seating when the weather is nice. The sandwiches that I have had have been great. The smoothies are very good. Free wireless internet. Only problem is that it is sometimes very crowded. 
14036 4 I love this White Spot just as much as I love every White Spot...too much! I could eat a Legendary burger with the veggie patty 3 times a day every day of my life and never get tired of it! Keep on keepin' on White Spot! 
14037 4 First time here today. Had Mothers Day lunch. They did not disappoint. Our reserved table by the window was lovely. Our server was great! My favorite was the ham and egg fried rice that came with a hearty pork chop. Can't wait to come back and try out something else. 
14038 1 This is not a good example of a Days Inn. Very uncomfortable bed, small room, fan in bathroom run by an airplane motor and linked to light. Bed was the worst! Room not as clean as we would like. Never again! 
14039 4 The food was awesome and the service was fast. The servers were all hospitable and extremely friendly. I'm sure I will revisit before I leave Monday and truly recommend! 
14040 1 I should add that I think the Brunswick stew that I mentioned in my review below must have been a fluke, because I have not seen it again at Whole Foods anywhere. Oh, well. 
14041 1 Food is good but not amazing by any means. When they mess up your order they get upset and blame you. NOT COOL. Maybe listen to your customers when they order. 
14042 3 Large selection of plants, flowers, pottery, etc. I can't comment on the price as I don't visit nursery's very often. Friendly staff that helped this novice pick out some flowers for my son's school project. 
14043 4 Best church in the world! I have been attending Buckhead/Northpoint for 15 years. Great location, awesome praise and worship. Messages are real world stuff that you can apply everyday whether you are a Christian or not. 
14044 1 Ultimately the food was good. We enjoyed the live music too. But it was not worth the wait, service and price. The decor seems outdated and overall our experience was just soured by how slow it was there! 
14045 1 the central square cvs is dirty, disorganized, and employs sketchy security guards who hit on customers. that said, i miss cvs--the name cvs, that is--in this land of walgreens, longs, and rite-aid, we could use a little 'care value service' if it came down to that... 
14046 4 Fast & Delicious Friendly chill environment. Like the open seating and high ceilings. Salmon Mousse Bagel & Chicken Calzones were yummy. Definitely coming back. 
14047 4 Had to sell several items of jewelry and Michele's made it a pleasant experience! 
14048 4 The beef and shrimp pastas is the best! Small place, call ahead if bringing large group 
14049 4 I order online and have it delivered! Food always on point and don't have any complaints. 
14050 4 This was the best ramen I have had and ramen at 11pm is a beautiful thing. Great presentation, rich and spicy broth, perfectly cooked noodles. Really high quality ingredients. The host/waiter was young, smart, engaging, energetic and obviously loved the food. 
14051 4 Great place to play some loud music, without worrying about your neighbors. 
14052 3 Delicious tacos! Wonderful hand made drinks and great atmosphere but the tacos are small 
14053 3 Such a romantic spot to enjoy a wonderful meal. Absolutely would recommend going to grotto. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. I am 100% adding Grotto to my list of favorite resturants in Boston. 
14054 4 Will definitely be back. Her website made it absolutely simple to make a reservation...even for my first visit. I entered my insurance info and there was zero paperwork to fill out when I arrived. Massage was great...she worked with me on a couple problem areas. Already feeling better. 
14055 4 Great selection. Rotate taps often. Three seating option - indoors, heated enclosed patio, open patio. Parking is street only. Servers seem efficient. 
14056 2 Ive eaten here a few times and it's pretty consistent. The sauce on the pizza is great! Toppings are less than desirable. Sausage tastes funny and forget putting garlic on anything because you will get huge chunks of it. I wish they had apps... 
14057 2 Small portions but damn their pad Thai is the best in town. Food is delicious here but prices are ridiculous for what you get. Unfortunately had to take two stars off for poor value.? 
14058 3 I'm not a huge burger fan, but I did have the turkey burger which was pretty good (and their fries are yummy too). But what's really amazing is their nutella chocolate pretzel shake. Has basically ruined all other milkshakes for me, forever. 
14059 3 Went here this week, I got a shack family got cones and cups. I would get a cone next time as its cheaper. Also the shack is mostly milk and if you are going to pay that high a price might as well get moré then a bunch not milk. 
14060 0 Warm beer. The pork sandwich was awful. Supermarket bag french fries. First and last time I go. 
14061 4 Great variety of salad dressings, definitely the healthiest fast food around! I love the chile lime vinaigrette and sometimes in the summer they have a great fruit salad they offer. The southwest wrap with tofu comes highly recommended. 
14062 3 Great service. Dined at 3:30pm, so not very busy. The "burnin love" burger was very good. Bottomless salad or fries is nice. Cod was good. I will return. 
14063 3 Service is good, food was delicious. I was leery after reading some of the reviews and it turned out great. 
14064 4 Dr Besser and his staff are wonderful. I see him for mid back and neck adjustments, and have had great success. I'd highly recommend him to anyone looking for a quality chiropractor. 
14065 4 Perfect lunch spot. Perfect rotating craft/rare beer selection. Perfect selection of lessner known but high rated/reasonably priced wines. Red or white wines! New owner who extremely friendly and knows his beers and wines. Excellent chef and compliments the wine menu. Friendly, the best dog friendly as well, on Park Ave. 
14066 4 Best mcflurry i've ever had in my whole life + she told me to have a wonderful day 5 stars 
14067 4 Can't recommend this place enough. German pancakes done to an art form. Dave is the greatest server ever! Sooooo good. 
14068 4 Dined here for Restaurant Week: Portions were good and the food choices were extensive for the RW menu. Loved the atmosphere and our server Amelia - very nice, attentive and personable. Food was delicious and I plan to return again. 
14069 4 I love everything about this new CRG! It just opened at the beginning of the month. Although classes are limited, it'll start to pick up as they build this community. This gym has top rope, lead climbing, bouldering, yoga, and a sick weight room (perfect for powerlifters). 
14070 2 Good place for drinks with colleagues or friends Food is ok nothing to brag about Good for large groups 
14071 1 I have been sitting in the drive through 10 minutes and literally not one vehicle has moved... I'm behind one car. Ughhh 
14072 3 I enjoyed my visit. The facility is quite impressive and the exhibits are well done. The history is a bit sanitized, as it barely mentions any of his failures or personal flaws. Nonetheless, it's his museum and it's likely the way he'd want to be remembered. It's worth a visit. 
14073 4 Amazing cocktails, love the raw bar, and the food is incredible! Always love coming to Trident 
14074 4 Excellent dinner. Huge list of fine wines. Had jumbo shrimp with candied walnuts and pineapple. Very good. Service good also. 
14075 4 Stopped in this morning after driving by for the past couple weeks and so happy I did! Got a samoa cookie iced coffee and I had finished it before I got to my car. Egg and cheese BLT didn't disappoint either. Will be back for sure 
14076 0 I ordered late night delivery. I'm pretty sure they sent me the donuts they were going to throw away. All stale and tasted similar surprisingly. Probably won't go back. 
14077 1 Prepare to wait almost an hour for your food and a very loud atmosphere. Service wasnt good but the food is amazing! (Unless your on a diet) 
14078 4 This hotel was amazing! We enjoyed our stay immensely. It was designed thoughtfully with both single adults and families with children in mind. The proximity to attractions made the location perfect and the amenities were phenomenal. 
14079 4 Friendly helpful staff. Great values and excellent selections. Best staff in this area 
14080 4 Got a pretty bad smell in my car and I had no idea what was causing it. Anyway, the guys did a great job with an interior detailing and the smell is gone now. Extra points for a very fast response. Definitely recommended. 
14081 2 Fast food place, all vegetarian, always seats available, pretty cheap. 
14082 4 Donuts are absolutely heavenly. Sadly just expensive AF. Out of all the ones I tried, vanilla bean and blueberry jam were probably my favorites. Strawberry definitely was the least fav. 
14083 4 If you get there right when it opens, go to the houses in the back of the park first and work your way to the front. Everyone stops at the first house and the line is long. OR go to Walking Dead first. It is the longest wait but awesome! 
14084 4 Restaurant is packed since they opened so we called ahead and did take out. Love their pizza and stromboli! They also have dessert. 
14085 3 Definitely one of my favorites! I usually order tex mex. However, today I wanted to try something different so I went with fiesta wrap. It was pretty good. Wish it's not too pricey though 
14086 4 I adore this bar. It is in the beach club, never too crowded, and is perfect for down time during the day or a post park drink. Ask for the secret menu and get the chowder and chips for lunch. You won't be dissapointed. 
14087 1 Both Zip lines were broken when we went; a fact they kept to themselves until after we had paid and gotten harnessed in. and they don't make it clear at all that there is a 60 minute time limit. 
14088 3 Great theater but they really need to invest some money in making more bathrooms for women. The line lasts all of intermission and it's just crazy. Adding another women's room would really go the extra mile. 
14089 3 Love the food filet. The only thing is they don't tell you they weight their steaks so you have to tell them not to. It just takes longer to cook because it's so thick. Manager there in Plaistow was very helpful so now I know what to ask for. 
14090 3 Neal was professional, timely, and very solution-oriented. I hope to never be locked out of my car again, but if it happens, I'm calling Neal. 
14091 0 I just wanted to make a simple tutu and the staff was incredibly rude. One team member told me "If your question is quick I'll answer it, I'm busy". Ended up leaving with nothing because no one would help me find the items I needed. Heading to Micheal's instead. 
14092 4 uber eats is life with these people! Best nachos I've had hands down and their wings are DELICIOUS 
14093 4 Did this as a work event (holiday party/team building). We all had a great time. Zombie adventure was challenging and exciting and both Stan and Corinne did an amazing job. 
14094 4 I stopped in for the first opening day. Beautiful decor and excellent service. Will definitely be back. This is a great addition to Dublin and Bridge Park. 
14095 3 Ordered delivery to the Hampton Inn hotel on the north side of Boulder. Pizza was delivered quickly and was cooked well. Plenty of toppings and tasted good. Pizza was above average, would order from here again next time I am in town. 
14096 4 Best bang for your buck sushi place in Vancouver. The staff is very friendly and the food tastes great. Try the sashimi, one order gives you massive slabs of fresh fish. Great specials as well, I love it there. 
14097 2 Expensive, but it is in Newton, so what do you expect. Very narrow course, not ideal for beginners, must call ahead for tee times. Very convenient to Boston. Staff was nice enough. Fast greens. 
14098 4 Loved the Mills/50 sandwich. Basically a Bahn Mi, but the chicken put it over the top. Very juicy and flavorful and I like that it was two whole pieces instead of little bits. Everything looked delicious, I'll be back when I'm back in town! 
14099 4 Excellent authentic food and service. Would highly recommend it! Loved the mariachi band! 
14100 4 What amazing food I had combination platter what blast in mouth beer crisp to touch light. Serve amazing. Waitress was very friendly 
14101 4 Love this place for chinese cuisine in Boston. It is my favorite place. Spicy fish with pickled veggies. Spicy chicken. All delicious!!! 
14102 2 Aweful food here, no idea what the previous reviewr is thinking but its pub grub at its worst. After trying Devlin's I was really disappointed in the quality. Lots of BC kids during the school year and the crowd could be much better than a typical meat market. 
14103 4 This location is newly opened and I casually drop in. Great value for your money! Had a really good relaxing massage and foot reflexology. The place is clean and tidy. The lady at the front desk is very kind and accommodating. Will definitely go back again. 
14104 4 Love this place! Greatness does not just happen. Greatness is created with great ingredients, staff, ownership. Thanks for coming to the Columbia Point Peninsula, we needed it! 
14105 4 Fantastic restaurant with unique, comfortable atmosphere. Rick and his wife (owners) will delightfully great you, seat you and Giovanni and staff will prepare wonderful meals to your liking. One of my top 5 restaurants in the world! 
14106 4 Excellent food, great presentation, fresh ingredients. Service was good and food came out first, didn't wait long at all. Will come back next time I am in Portland 
14107 2 Nice pub with decent beer selection and pretty good food. I had the pancakes and my wife had the burger. Not bad. Would go back as a hang out spot more than for the food. Read the wings were good so maybe we'll try next time. 
14108 3 Pretty good stuff. Had cold udon for the first time and it was awesome! Very small place, I been at UT for two years and I never saw this place on the drag. It is a must check out!! 
14109 3 Friendly and happy to help me since I'm not the tech head. 
14110 4 Visiting Portland - so happy to find this delicious BBQ TRUCK! Delicious sandwiches and awesome sides. Will be back on our next trip up! 
14111 4 We had a peanut butter cookie and a whoopie pie for dessert! And we got a lemon cupcake and carrot cupcake for later. The food is delicious! 
14112 0 Sorry, I really wanted to write a good review but our service was just do bad that it tainted the entire experience. 
14113 4 AMAZING!!! everything is gluten free (a rarity for someone with celiac). Super delicious and unique food. 
14114 3 I purchased 11 items for about $10.50! What a steal! There are 5 for 5 racks near the back (lots of variety and whole grain options), and if you spend 10 bucks you get one loaf free! 
14115 4 So excited that Paramount Lebanese Kitchen is now near UCF, best Mediterranean, healthy food. I am addicted to the tabbouli with shish tawouk on top. I am going at least once a week now and the staff is extremely friendly and great food. Love it and recommend it highly 
14116 3 Excellent atmosphere (with livemusic) and super friendly staff. Very clean food - no complaints related to quality at all. Oysters were decent, as well as the crab bowl and lobster. Only complaint is the price points - $63 for a 2 lb lobster plate?? 
14117 3 So very busy but for good reason. Buffett is the best deal of you want to sample it all. Good sausages, especially the hot, and the cream puffs will keep you coming back. 
14118 0 tried multiple times to book an appt--phone is always busy or mail box is full. DO NOT USE 
14119 2 Edit. Went here again and it was much better Terrible, slow service. Subpar food. Fake atmosphere. I love mellow mushrooms but this location is awful. If you're planning on going here skip it and go to the Brookhaven location 10 min up the road. 
14120 4 Excellent bakery!! Ive been multiple times but the only thing I can vouch for is their amazing fruit eclair. It is absolutely amazing! The best eclair I've ever had. Probably too in love to try anything else! 
14121 1 Ate lunch here yesterday with a group of 8. It took over 2 hours! Wait staff very slow and forgetful. Food was so-so. 
14122 0 I wish nail salons would bother getting the proper training or just a quick know how for all their employees when it comes to doing gel sculpture don't offer a service you don't know how to properly perform! 
14123 4 This place is so good. I have yet to try anything that I didn't think was an a plus. The staff is super friendly as well. 
14124 4 Best Mexican food ever ! Order food from them at least once or twice a week Always amazing!Highly Recomend 
14125 4 Bright and cheery! Great food. Way to much food per order, but we can share. Love this place. Most friendly staff. 
14126 3 try their cupcakes YUM YUM and the service on the phone was great - all in all, very good exprience 
14127 4 Absolutely 100% LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! We drive over 45mins away to eat here!!! Their portions are great and the prices are just right. One of the best BBQ places I've ever been to! 
14128 4 Love this place! I would highly recommend the ultra spicy ramen and honey miso ramen. I think the flavors here are better and richer than Jinya. Definitely worth a try if you've never been here! 
14129 3 Fanoos popped my persian cherry! First time I ate persian food was there and it was magnifique! The pita bread is made fresh, to order. Hummus is zesty and the buffet is the best time to eat there! 
14130 0 Lunch buffet wasn't good they don't have a big selection of dishes, the food was cold and not to spicy i didn't feel like im eating indian food, the service was just fine. 
14131 4 Wow! Great food, great service and great atmosphere at an in airport restaurant? These guys are totally getting it right! 
14132 2 Underwhelmed and feeling unlucky after reading the great reviews. Everything was just OK. The service the clenlinece the music the ambiance. 
14133 2 Eye mart has the best prices Walked in got help, didn't wait. Got my glasses 2 pair of 3 line progressive lens $200.00. People if the frames or lens are to expensive just go to the dollar buy 5 pairs and you will be fine 
14134 4 Fast internet & many plugs, spacious place, tasty coffee and sandwich. Perfect for working. 
14135 2 6March16 @ Noon quick friendly service. not busy. Music could be turned down a bit. Big mama enchilada and bowl of Pozole Rojo de Puerto. Pozole was bland. Big mama enchilada was large and tasty with a nice sauce. prices are a bit high and we will probably not return. 
14136 4 Fantastic pizza!!!! Truly the best I've had. I've never once had a bad experience here. Garlic knots are top notch as well. 
14137 4 5 stars for the Biddy Mary. It's a lighter tasting BM with a sour kick but man it is refreshing. Not super spicy. Will definitely come back for the bottomless. 
14138 1 I used to love this place. Then the carb to protein portion got to me so I stopped for a while. I craved the green curry chicken today so I decided to give it a shot. I got a couple pieces of chicken and the rice was under-done. Very disappointing. 
14139 0 Waiters were good but that's where it ends. Found hair in our food and if that's not upsetting enough they tried to bill a part of the "sorry we messed up " desert on the check. Do not waste your money here. 
14140 3 This place has such an awesome setting. Food was absolutely delicious. Warm feta was unique and delicious. I'd definitely get it again. Salt cod fritters are a must! The slabtown area is fixing up to be one of portland's best, and this restaurant is absolutely part of that! 
14141 4 Tots are tots but McMennamin on the Columbia in Vancouver have some of the best tots amongst all the McMennamins. Say hello to Deon the Brewer 
14142 3 The sides are weird, but that is the only bad thing I can say about this delicious little gem! Buffalo chicken and s'mores were crazy good! 
14143 3 Now, the chicken kabob is good, but the kubideh? That's something to KILL for. The portion sizes are rather moderate, but the food is delicious. The salad is good, so is the rice. Have not tried the pita. I would definitely recommend this place and will likely go again. 
14144 3 Nice place to eat from a wide variety of options and enjoy the theme park scenery. Staff was awesome - Ledin really cared we had a good experience! Good choice in Islands of Adventure. 
14145 3 Great food, and really nice folks! I work in the area, and Sancho's in a favorite. The tacos are great, and the burritos are huge and delicious! I'm a regular! 
14146 4 Sushi here is great. I really like the spicy lobster roll. When I have sushi cravings this place hits the spot for me. 
14147 4 This is probably my favorite bar on 6th street... Huge variety of drinks, perfect for a hot summer day! Will definitely be back. 
14148 4 Great food! My French teacher recommended it to me when I lived in Ohio and I've wanted to eat their food ever since. I'm glad I finally got the chance to! I got their lobster quiche, poutine, and some macarons. I would definitely recommend all of those! 
14149 0 Worst service ever. Waiter complained about having to bring us food. Told us we didn't order things and wasn't sure what kind of enchiladas he brought out. Thought it was a prank. Do not go in here to eat. 
14150 4 Love this place! I live in the neighborhood and love coming to work and hangout. Breakfast tacos are the best. 
14151 4 Best place to walk your dog. But be warned. Construction expected for the next few months. Love the dog beach. 
14152 3 Evan is fantastic! I go back to him month after month, he is exceptional. Be sure to book him out, his calendar fills up fast. 
14153 4 Traci is not only an amazing artist but a treat to spend time with. Tattoo's are not painless but her light hand and speed plus good conversation allow me to continue my tattoo obsession. I'm ready for my next one and I won't go to anyone else. 
14154 3 Roosters Is a great place to hang out, watch a game, and eat some food. No matter where you sit, you will have a view of a tv. There is a nice selection of beer and the wings are pretty good. I like that the tables are big and comfortable! 
14155 4 This place is amazing! The ahi poke is delicious. We drive from San Antonio almost every Saturday for lunch. The owners are awesome people! 
14156 4 Looking forward to a happy and healthy pregnancy with caring staff. 
14157 4 I don't love the remodel- they've completely ruined the queue and made it look like a crowded cafeteria. But the food is still amazing and the crew are phenomenal. Whoever redesigned the place just needs a damn good whacking. 
14158 4 I've been going to Dr. Mennell for over 4 years. He's seen me thru 2 pregnancies and in between. He's the absolute best and I wouldn't trust anyone else. 
14159 3 Was just here yesterday and they now accept Restaurant.Com certificates for Dim Sum Buffet! 
14160 4 Very good experience! Clean and bright restaurant! Food was deeeelicious! We were a group, so we ordered six dishes and shared. Definitely recommend! 
14161 4 Stunning!!!! Austin needed some new flavors. Hot little place. True professionals with amazing food. You will love it. So many new things to try 
14162 4 An awesome classic style barbershop. The owner Dustin provides a great environment and even after 2 times remembered my cut. Will be a loyal client there! 
14163 4 This is my favorite local mid-priced burrito place. Don't miss the habanero sauce. It is the best, and nobody else has anything like it. It goes perfectly with the tofu burrito. I eat there all the time, and it is always good. 
14164 3 Love the Yuppie burger and the frappes are great! Good for a quick bite before catching a movie. 
14165 2 Was okay, but not great. Everything is very a la carte, and the service was subpar. Food was okay, but weird interpretation of "BBQ." Very small with not a lot is seating. 
14166 4 I've been to the NW Roaring Fork a couple of times now and I love it. The drinks are wonderful and the food is delicious. The atmosphere & the staff are both very nice. I can't wait to go back again. 
14167 4 The customer service was great and the music was fantastic. We got our donuts to go and really enjoyed them the next morning before we left for the airport. 
14168 4 Great burgers! We don't eat burgers very often, however, these were some of the best we've ever eaten. Great flavor, toppings and burgers were juicy. Also, parmesan fries were the best. Highly recommend! 
14169 3 So far have only tried the crispy Brussels Sprouts... And they were delicious! Get them, you will not regret it. 
14170 4 Very friendly staff and delicious coffee in a cozy setting. And the sausage/egg/cheese on an everything bagel... nommmm 
14171 3 I love this place. It is carnivore heaven! I have been to this location three times and loved it every time. The one in downtown Chicago is great too. 
14172 4 Delicious! This place was PACKED. Go expecting to wait for at least 15 minutes on a busy day. 
14173 3 Kind of pricey for the amount you get, but the quality is there. It's not often that I am served chicken that's still really juicy. 
14174 3 Checked out the gym while visiting Portland. Compared to the LA Fitness gyms in Southern California, this one is a little more dated, but much less crowded. All the dumbbells were racked in their correct places! Lots of parking. 
14175 4 Valentina is the best! I have gone to her for hemming shirts, fixing zippers, and soon my wedding dress alterations. She is reliable, reasonably priced, and her and her team are so nice! Wouldn't go to any other tailor in town. 
14176 4 Everything here is good-- the burgers, the fries (especially the truffle fries), the milkshakes, and the atmosphere. This is a great place to go with friends, and don't be intimidated by the line that snakes out the door -- there is great people watching to be done on South Congress! 
14177 4 This restaurant is awesome ! We like stopping in when nearby You can always count on good food great service and a great atmosphere! The rock shrimp very tasty! 
14178 4 Good food, music, great service. Me and my boyfriend come to eat real Mexican food. Fun place to come on weekend to have some food and drinks. 
14179 0 Service was terrible and the kitchen "forgot" my order, everybody from my table Finnish all the food but my food doesn't come We won't be back. 
14180 3 Great food but could work on their service. Good customer service is not customary in the BVL area and this is no exception. 
14181 3 The Orlando Eye is pretty cool, I went on it with my wife and kids. Overall, it was fun seeing the sights when you get all the way to the top, but if you're not a fan of heights, I would not recommend it. 
14182 3 I was in Clackamas and another stop yesterday after a movie with my Grandchildren to grab a pizza!'' Quick, fast and gone!" Their pizza's are pretty average as far as pizza's go? But tasty and long on convenience !'' 4 stars****! ''Thank you'' 
14183 4 Beautiful resort. Monorail transportation to Magic Kingdom and EPCOT. The pool area is great for kids. Unique upscale restaurants. Great to visit during the Holidays when the huge Christmas tree and real life size gingerbread house are in the lobby. 
14184 2 The lunch buffet is the best part. Decent food for a good price and a friendly wait staff. The dining room doesn't have the highest capacity though. 
14185 3 Oops. We forgot saloons on Monday night in downtown means lots of adult bevs being consumed and not really a place to taste fun foods or beers. But it is Portland. The nacho app 3 star the NW Red ale by bout 5 stars. 
14186 0 BBQ pork (char Siew) is terrible...probably the worst in the region. But groceries are great! 
14187 4 Sells Weird NJ magazine in Massachusetts. 'Nuff said. 
14188 4 They come in glass jars??? Talk about hooking me with the packaging. I had a nice drink that I can't remember the name of but had kale, pineapple, cucumber, and ginger. Delicious! Not a terrible price either. 
14189 4 Tandoori chicken, naan, goat masala, veg noodles and chicken biryani was very good. Been to this place a few times and was never disappointed. Best Indian in the North west coast 
14190 4 We went on Saturday for lunch. The service was so friendly and so fast. I had the wonton soup which was delicious. Boyfriend has the house pho and he loved it. Good prices and good portions. Will definitely return! 
14191 3 Shaking crab food are spicy to eat. Service is fast and friendly bring my friends here next time. 
14192 3 I liked it and the presentation was cool too. But honestly I had tastier rolls. I ordered 5 rolls and A few of them all tasted alike. Server was lovely. Prices are very affordable for lunch as well. Good spot 
14193 4 What a charming place! From the moment we walked in, we were treated like family. The food was delicious and the service was heartwarming. Having spent time in Italy, I felt like I was back there again tonight! They took great care of us and we had a wonderful meal. 
14194 3 Super friendly bartender! pork belly over waffles a must and the best sweet potato "fries"! We were there on a Sunday before the ACL music festival, watched some football, great local beers! 
14195 4 Really like the hills. Great staff, comfortable environment, and wonderful amenities. Full court basketball court is nearly always open, which is nice. 5 stars 
14196 4 Best Vietnamese food in Brevard County and most of Central Florida. Great place for a Nice dinner. Great selection on wine and liquors. Very friendly staff, and willing to help you if you have any questions. Great place overall. 
14197 4 What is there left to say? They take a burger to a whole, previously non-existent, new level. Try them, try them all. Your mind will love you, your waist line will hate you. Good thing I live 12 miles away. 
14198 4 This is my go to place. The cashiers smile, the bakery is amazing, & the meat guys always get the pounds right. Plus their veggies, fruits, breads, & meats are always fresh Authentic as it gets here! 
14199 4 Best cocktails in the city hands down!! Antonio is meticulous about his method and the result is pure perfection!! We will be back and its a great tucked away secret spot! 
14200 4 Best food and service EVER! I loved the place. Great for dinner, drinks and birthday celebration. Jamie took care of us and made all the difference in our night. 
14201 3 I just had the Pollo Encebollado for the first time. It was great, the chicken was seasoned just right. It was not over powering, nor lacking in flavor. Rice and sweet plantains where also very delicious. very good experience. 
14202 4 Chicken wings are really good, try medium or hot. We loved their sautéed mushrooms, onion rings,and cheese toast - amazing. Owners and waitresses are very friendly. 
14203 2 When shopping at Fubon it's a nice stop in here to get a hot pot of food. The bibimbap is okay. I don't think the food here is very memorable but it isn't terrible either. 
14204 4 What's not to love about this place? Great indoor bouldering gym and accessible by bike. 
14205 3 So glad to see others describe this place as "charming" because that's exactly what it is! I would have loved to spend more time here exploring their selection of books on Salem. Good balance of books, new and used AND quirky knick knacks. Loved it! 
14206 4 Great place to grab brunch! The set up was super modern and neat, and the whole staff was very friendly. 
14207 4 Excellent food and ambiance. I went with my boyfriend and it's super romantic, but they also had huge groups there so it fit both styles. Everything we got was excellent: seafood risotto, pork Milanese, the pecan with gelato and chocolate mousse were delicious 
14208 0 If I could zero stars I would. Asked for pizza extra well done. Raw mushrooms. Raw onions and no sauce. Would have rather eaten a baby hippos diaper after a day in the river. Little Caesar's is gourmet compared to this. 
14209 4 Brandon was our server today and he rocked!! Super nice, very attentative, and was awesome! Thank you for being super sweet! 
14210 4 This place is amazing!! I am from San Diego and have been looking for a decent Mexican food restaurant, and this place is BOMB!!!! Great prices and the burritos are huge. GO! 
14211 4 We absolutely LOVE our countertops. Kevin did an amazing job helping us identify the type of countertops we wanted, and also installed them beautifully. We couldn't be happier! We are already using him for additional house projects. Great communication, very positive demeanor and beautiful work. Thanks, Austin's Custom Tops! 
14212 3 If you're in Cambridge, you need to visit the COOP. It has a great selection of books and Harvard branded stuff. 
14213 0 This place is gross. My 4 year old niece can make better pancakes than this shithole. 
14214 4 XLB's are on par with Din Tai Fung. Spicy string beans and cucumbers were excellent. Look forward to trying the beef noodle soup. Looked good. 
14215 2 Service can be slow since this place is so big. The food is not the greatest (is any on international drive?) but its not bad; our items were fine. Prices are affordable. 
14216 4 These guys are underrated. They make really solid brews in classic styles. Their Last Place Stout is one of my favorite imperial stouts. They are friendly, and it's very enjoyable dropping in their taproom. 
14217 3 Beautiful view, dog friendly, not difficult to climb/hike and there's stair access for those who can't walk on such unsteady, rocky terrain. It's free, there's free parking and it's a good place for a date or family outing :). 
14218 4 Love the food, drinks, atmosphere and overall vibe of this place! My favorite joint for tapas in Boston for sure. 
14219 2 What a good Mexican place. It is huge so there we never wait long for a table. The food is pretty good! Some of the best Mexican in the city and the prices aren't bad. 
14220 4 I visited this location a few months ago and was not a fan. However, today I decided to try again and really enjoyed my "skinny" Carmel macchiato. The coffee shop is apparently under new management. 
14221 2 Fast but definitely not worth it for small jobs. It cost me $7 to scan 5 pages to USB... 
14222 2 The space is setup awkward which makes the whole flow strange and cumbersome the food is so so. 
14223 3 Great food and even better sitting outside on the pation on a nice day and people watching. Great place to hang out and the sangria was a suprise on a hot day! Good time. 
14224 4 Bang for your buck: 10/10 Quality: 8/10 Service: 8/10 Ambiance/Location: 10/10 Overall: 9/10 Best seamstress in town!!! 
14225 4 Great breakfast place! Great tasting food, incredible portions, quick service. Lines can be kind of long, but that just shows that people know that the food is good. Always a great place to eat. Mike 
14226 1 Well I must say this was an interesting experience. The service was great. But the food! Well the medium NY Strip steak was tough, grits of shrimp and grits where milky, chocolate Martin tasted spoiled, the Creme Brielle was burnt, but the water was so good. 
14227 3 Did you know the place is haunted? It's supposed to be a male individual that had worked there decades ago. He's sometimes seen in the kitchen. 
14228 4 Our tour Erik was amazing he was hilarious and entertaining. He gave us 3 free beers to try from and almost like a show at the same time with all the funny jokes he was cracking. Great atmosphere great beer highly recommend 
14229 0 It took almost an hour and a half to deliver ten minutes away in Somerville...came with no rice...greasy and bland...and they got the order wrong! Expensive. 
14230 2 The movie theater staff was super nice and helpful with the menu. Plus the seats were comfortable and the sound in the theater was very excellent! 
14231 4 Stop your search now. Miles and his crew helped make our wedding night unforgettable and I can't see how you could do any better. For us, attention to detail was important and they delivered with flying colors. 
14232 2 I used to love this place (2003-2015?) until they changed owners/cooks. It's just not the same anymore but I heard they just opened up a new place near by. 
14233 1 Very cool building and design, decent service mid-day, but food quality and tap selections well below average. Will not return unless forced to. 
14234 4 If you don't like it at Nancy's you're just downright un-American. This is everything I love about diners and breakfast foods in one place that feels like home. If you have to stand around & wait--do it, it's worth it. Really, really hungry? Ask about the Rocky Balboa. 
14235 4 I got Lee and she is so pleasant! This place is sooo clean and very relaxing.. I am so g glad I went on Yelp! I was greeted and treated like a star!! I would recommend this place highly.. I 
14236 0 I just had the worst fish and chips I've ever had in my life first of all the French fries should be steak fries and everything was way over cooked 
14237 4 Excelente lugar , buen ambiente, Atención de primera, y la comidas realmente espectacular !!! 
14238 4 Great gem in the airport. Fantastic menu options. The sushi rolls are huge and very good. You have to try the spicy tuna roll. Loved the cocktail and beer options. Meatloaf sand which was from heaven. This is a must, if you have the time. 
14239 4 Love getting my bars and supplements here. Sanjana-the owner-is very knowledgeable and a super sweetheart! 
14240 1 Great Location Drip coffee is too weak Music is too loud 50/50 on friendly staff Open 24 hours 
14241 3 Came here the other night with wifey and cousin. Had very fresh Poke dish. Very tasty and fresh. The picked cucumbers and rice were really good too. My mind went straight to Maui when I tried it. Very good! 
14242 4 Bunch of talent from upscale restaurants, who wanted a more personal gig. Incredible beers, friendly clientele, two great locations in Boston to suit your mood, with nearby options for exploring after a great meal and some hops. 
14243 0 Came in and orders food waited 1.5 hours and never got served. Questioned why we never got served and we were told that it was on its way. What a joke! I will nver come to this fast food establishment again! 
14244 4 the folks there were very helpful - my car was in and out for an oil change and 60k checkup within about a half hour. Was able to get work done in the waiting area. 
14245 3 The burgers here are excellent. Same with the appetizers. The reason I gave four stars and not five is because the initial wait to get seated was a little long because this place gets packed on Friday nights. Other than that great customer service and food. Definitely coming back. 
14246 0 Terrible place would recommend steering clear. Very rude and inhospitable employees that are an atrocious mix of dirty hippies and pretentious hipsters. Would not recommend anyone go here and support these rude employees. Coffees okay though. Get the Venetian cream 
14247 3 Good sammiches and good customer service. I love that they have Maine root soda too! I suggest the curry chicken salad sandwich mmm...just a bit pricey for sandwiches. 
14248 4 Whatever project you have going- large or small - they will be very helpful here. If you're a novice feel free to ask questions - they are superstars here! 
14249 4 This firm is matching (tripling?) Central Texas Food Bank donations. Thank you! 
14250 3 It is so funny such a small park has so many reviews. I sometimes go to this park to have my drink or sweety which I buy from Davie street while watching playing dogs. 
14251 3 My fave sports bar to hit while in Boston. Huge draft selection and geat food, which is so uncommon among sports bars. I travel extensively and they have some of the best sports bar food I've had anywhere. 
14252 3 Awesome buffet food. Good variety and genuine Indian cuisine taste. Interiors are good and comfortable. A must go place for enjoying authentic Indian food. People are friendly as well. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone. 
14253 1 Hotel was just ok. Way outdated and old. The fire alarm went off at 4 am and the people at the front desk had no idea what to do. Stay somewhere else 
14254 3 cute cute stuff, as if you haven't already heard this. I saw some awesome earrings, necklaces, and bags. So even if you're looking for accessories to go with an outfit you already have..check it out. The clothes were reasonably priced too. And different which I loved. 
14255 4 love this place, one of my fave spots in Orlando! 
14256 4 Cappy's is great. They have incredibly fast delivery time as well as unbelievable ice cream. Their pizza is awesome and the service is top notch. Highly recommended for anyone in Boston! 
14257 4 This place is great, always great service, friendly environment and great breakfast food! Will not disappoint :) 
14258 2 I would call this papi's Puerto Rican rather than Cuban. bland, blah, nothing special, I won't go back. 
14259 4 First, the staff here is seriously amazing. They are genuine and super helpful. Then, the FOOD. Wow. The mushroom steak medallions were awesome. My boyfriend had some kind of salmon and he was very impressed as well! Recommended!! 
14260 2 Confusing to find right building and specialist and they are always running late. Arrive early so that you can find a free parking spot around the hospital perimeter. Construction makes things even worse 
14261 1 Although the place looks nice, the service is not so nice. the waitress was kind of reluctant to serve, and the food was tasteless. 
14262 4 Awesome beer selection including Oregon choices, AMAZING fries, and delicious chicken wrap with moist grilled chicken. Good service and vibe too. Highly recommended! 
14263 4 It's good to be back in the ATL. Papi's was one of my favorites before and it's always a favorite to return to it was awesome. 
14264 4 Car was ready with keys in the gold members lot. Drove it out and got the contract at the gate. Returning the car was easy and they took via shuttle to cruise terminal. Excellent service. Recommended. 
14265 4 I come here for one thing on the menu although ive tried other options I am hooked on their grilled lemongrass chicken. Service is always fast and friendly Quality of food is never dissapointing Prices and portion size are satisfying 
14266 3 Finally checked out the new Yeti store. Cool spot. All your Yeti essentials. The outdoor bar looks nice for a warm day (which is almost every day here). Beer and wine in cans, cold brew coffee, olé ! They have WiFi and are dog friendly. 
14267 0 management...please tell Sandra at the front that if she wants that $15 an hour, she should at least try and put a smile on her face. super rude and obnoxious! 
14268 4 Oh,I can alway's feel Maria Bamford's presence when I shop at Target.This one's nice and big(what was reviewing again?) I love that.Close to Home good's so worth the trip.And it's neat and well staffed ,never had to wait.Um-Um,Shocantelle. 
14269 2 The food is good. I don't think my stomach agrees. I had the pokè bowl. The fish may not be as fresh as it could be. I've eaten here twice with the same result. I want to rate it higher because it does actually taste good. But... 
14270 4 The food is so amazing. I just moved here and i am going to keep coming back. There is no other place like it so far. 
14271 4 Quick and easy! Best tire service I've ever experienced. I had a flat and they found the issue, patched it up, and replaced it on my car within 15 minutes for no fee!! 
14272 0 Slowwwwww :) Yelp wants more details so... I don't see anyone working here that seems motivated by lines... 
14273 4 Great food & service! The waiters were friendly and the ambiance is amazing. Definitely great for gatherings! Josh B was the best!!!!!!! 
14274 0 If you love day old donuts and blaring heavy metal, this is your place. The donuts look amazing but aren't better than Donut Palace or Shipley's. 
14275 4 They came out on a Sunday last minute. Was professional and did good work. My tenants who worked with him on location and details also had good things to say. I will be calling them again if needed. 
14276 3 Every cupcake we've ever had from here has been great. It's probably not the best cupcake I've ever had, but it's still good. Where else are you going to get a cupcake after 5pm? 
14277 4 Best Breakfest in town! They make cinnamon rolls, English muffins and biscuits from scratch. Coffee is good and the company is great. Its a little small and packs up fast, so hit it early. 
14278 4 Breakfast was exactly like I would want. They didn't have flavored syrups for pancake at first but were able to find a raspberry syrup which tasted great. 
14279 2 It was good but not great. My egg dish was too salty for my tastes and came out lukewarm. The waffle was not fresh either. I don't get the hype. I would not wait outside in a lineup to eat here. 
14280 4 These guys are always eager to help. I own a music school and gc south austin goes out of their way to give my students and parents a great experience. 
14281 4 Amazing service and great price! My car looks amazing without paying $200 for it to be detailed. 
14282 4 This place is THE BOMB! Try the corn bread, it's unbelievable. Great service, Matt and Alex are the best and they'll hook you up with some 25 cent wings! Also great music and good vibes all around. 
14283 2 Great place to get some quick Asian cuisine. Whether you are sitting in or taking out, you will not be disappointed. The prices are great and the customer service is good as well. 
14284 4 Can't get lost around here! Plenty of people to direct you right off the cruise and you can look for shuttles, taxis and buses right off the street. It's connected to a hotel and Starbucks. The place is huge and everyone was friendly. 
14285 3 Interesting plates that combine for a awesome dining experience. Not traditional dinner or lunch but plenty of food to fill you with. Choose one extra plate and you won't be disappointed. 
14286 2 Its a "meh" Irish pub thing with mediocre food and a weak beer menu. We were just there for the band. 
14287 4 I really love this tunnel!! The instructors and staff are incredibly awesome! I did some coaching with Mike Cumming and it really enhanced my flying skills. The instructors are very professional and know how to coach! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Florida! Thank you IFly! 
14288 3 Awesome food good service, we went a little early to beat the crowd and it was a good thing we did. It became crowded and service started to suffer. We ordered additional food and it took a while to get it. A bit pricey but I would recommend it. 
14289 3 Go for the Brussels sprouts. We ordered a bunch of dishes, but those Brussels sprouts really stood out. You won't be disappointed. 
14290 4 This is the largest HObby Lobby I've ever been to. Love just spending time in there looking down each aisle. Great prices too! 
14291 2 It's ok. The owner is super nice, but the food is nothing special. It's good for an "I don't want to cook the family dinner" take away. I probably wouldn't eat here if it wasn't so close to my house. 
14292 4 This place is awesome! It's great that they have so many gluten free options. The staff are also extremely friendly. 
14293 4 Best nails place in town! Very professional and did a great job of fixing my daughters nails from another nail place mess up. We will only be coming here from now on. Love this place! 
14294 4 Love this place. It's very quaint and the wait staff is very eccentric. (that's it's charm) And, don't forget to use the bathroom -- it's hilarious. 
14295 3 Awesome patio seating and the food was delicious. Had the DBar sandwich and onion rings. Excellent. 
14296 1 Good: Lettuce Wraps. Bad: Service, Singapore St Noodles. Everything tasted too sour!! 
14297 1 The service here left much to be desired. There was only one person working the entire restaurant (others cooking in the back) when we came for a late brunch around 1:30pm. Unfortunately, that one person was not at all friendly or helpful. We were not impressed by the food either. 
14298 3 Excellent French food, amazing coffee, and heavenly desserts. Food so good, you may faint. I would give it 5 stars but the lighting is a bit too dim inside. Oh, and the service is top-notch. 
14299 4 Wow what a great place! I've went past going to the grocery store & finally stopped. And so glad I did it was the best food ever & the drink was perfect. 
14300 0 Based on the customer service of their store manager, I recommend going elsewhere for your home/garden supplies. I try to support local/small business as much as possible, but unfortunately there is anything but a "customer first" mentality here. There are a few other similar stores nearby that I'd highly recommend 
14301 4 I had the Hot Chicken sandwich. It was delicious, the chicken was tender. The chicken wasn't dry the buffalo sauce was perfect i would recommend this restaurant to anyone. 
14302 3 Love it and not just because its in the hood. Busy for a reason, but the line-up always moves fast. 
14303 2 Great comfort food, Decent beer list. Always REALLY smokey. You don't have to ban smoking, but how about an exhaust fan or something? 
14304 3 The food was very tasty. We got a veggie platter that was nicely seasoned and had lots of flavors. We had a very nice beef dish also. You eat with your fingers and the bread which was fun. We left feeling stuffed but felt that we ate healthy. 
14305 4 Fantastic in all respects - menu has great choices, the price fixe deal delivers great value, the food was exceptional, the service was impeccable- highly recommend Grotto, particularly for 2, not more than 4 
14306 3 Food was really good, nice sport bar with a great beer selection 
14307 0 I tried the hamburger. I'm not sure it was even real beef. It tasted more like a sour and beef combo. The service was horrible and the prices are outrageous. 
14308 4 Looks can be deceiving! From the outside it didn't look like much, but once we tasted their food we were pleasantly surprised! 
14309 1 Definitely not the best philly I've had. Their sandwiches are missing quality steak meat. They've got a good location, but have to learn to make a great cheesesteak. Weeyums here I come. 
14310 3 It's not a five star hotel but it is decent since most of the time is spent at the park. The rooms could really be updated (the carpet). The workers are nice and ordering food is a breeze. I would stay there again. 
14311 4 My iPhone 5s screen showed many horizontal lines and stopped working. They replaced a new screen for me in 30min and now it's working perfectly. Cost: $99+tax&tip 
14312 4 Went there again and still amazing. The staff is always kind and cool tracks on the jukebox. 
14313 4 Wonderful menu, lots of good vegetarian options. I adore Half Fast Subs. 
14314 4 Great wine, food, atmosphere. Nice place to enjoy a conversation and kick back. Patio is a plus if you need fresh air or with kids. 
14315 4 yummy food, gold sauce wings are amazing highly recommended 
14316 4 Great local, small restaurant--- great service, owner/chef is very committed. The food is $/$ excellent value both Thai & Pho's are excellent. Nice variety of lunch specials. 
14317 4 Had a great time in the bar! The bartenders seem to really care about your experience and are always in a great mood! Finally found my hang out spot! 
14318 0 It's infested with ants our room was disgusting, we had a hard time getting our money back! We were in room 75. Staff is rude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
14319 4 Great service and fun! The opening acts and emcee were great as well - sometimes better than the main show! 
14320 4 Came here to meet a friend and what an amazing place! It's a little hard to find but so worth spending the time to find it! Amazing food, we sampled ten items and loved all of them! Thank you for such a great experience! :) 
14321 4 Just as good as the last time I had it! Maybe even better?? :) The staff are friendly and professional, food is out of this world and the ambience is superb. I wish there was a Hopdoddy where I live!! 
14322 1 Not completely terrible but not authentic flavors. Some items tasted microwaved (they had that rubber feel) and the empanada had a bitter taste, like when you re-use oil to deep fry something. The place is cute the servers are pleasant. $50+ for 3 entrees. Bottom line, I won't be back. 
14323 4 If you like fried avocado, you can't miss the Roaring Fork version of it. Simply Divine! 
14324 0 This place is disgusting. It's actually dirty in there. I was appalled when I went into the waxing room. It should be spotless and sanitized in rooms like that. All they care about is your business. The girl butchered my eye brows. Just awful. 
14325 0 Order through uber eats. Short handed at work and couldn't leave for lunch break. This place is right down the street. Food came cold. Burgers burned. Reached out to uber eats and no help. We spent $28 on awful food. Last time! 
14326 3 Delicious food. The location is pretty hard to get to though because parking in that area is a nightmare. Also, they blare the music so it's impossible for me to eat inside and I always have to get my food to go. 
14327 2 Service was good the food is ok but the place is dirty could somebody please vacuum the carpet. 
14328 4 I've had a few items here and really enjoyed them all. Singapore Mei Fun has probably been my favorite. Great prices and very friendly service. 
14329 4 The service USED to be terrible. On the past dozen visits, I've had the best service that I've ever had at Hounddog's. STILL THE BEST PIZZA EVER. 
14330 3 Great Customer Service! The hotel is in a good location and offers great amenities. I enjoy staying here for business and pleasure. My room was very clean and the staff was helpful. 
14331 4 Hands down always going to have delicious food with Flavia. I love the freshness of the ingredients and I appreciate the hard work and preparation put into her reasonably priced food! 
14332 3 It was a fun place to just chill on a Saturday night! The atmosphere was nice and the drinks were pretty good. 
14333 1 Long wait (50 minutes) for mediocre, sloppy looking sushi. Although the server was polite, it would have been considerate for them to warn customers how long the wait would be. 
14334 4 Great food. Great service. Kind of slow but an amazing lunch. 
14335 4 Just as good as odd duck, really they are almost the same restaurant. I would give 10 stars if I could. Do yourself a favor and just order one of everything. Most importantly do not skip dessert. 
14336 4 Excellent tacos with fresh ingredients. Highly recommended! 
14337 4 Poke - portions are verrrrrry generous. I couldn't even finish mine and my friend had to help me. The poke comes with ahi tuna, cole slaw salad and rice. It was $12 with a decent amount so I wouldn't say it was overpriced for what I got. 
14338 4 They just opened Monday. Staff is nice and helpful. Pizza is hot and delicious. I tried the BBQ chicken; salty, sweet, smokey goodness. Atmosphere is clean and much less cluttered. They have actual adults working here, not high schoolers. Check it out! 
14339 2 The ceviche was really, really good - but I wasn't 'wowed' by the other dishes, so if you're coming just for the a light snack that's fine, but otherwise I would head to Mochikas for my Peruvian cravings. 
14340 4 Delicious tacos. Even more delicious-er tortas. And super-mega delicious bowls. Dare I say, best Mexican in Portland? Yes, I dare. Favorites: cochinita pibil torta, huaraches, carnitas tacos. If you can't decide, go with the Diego Bolo, it's got a bit of everything! 
14341 3 Well, for just making pitas, this place does a great job. Im giving it high marks relative to understanding this is not a fancy restaurant. But they make good pitas. And the service has been excellent in the 2 locations ive been to. 
14342 4 I stayed there for a half marathon the next day. All staff members were friendly. I had a great room with a Keurig coffee maker. Love it! The computer for guests to use is a Mac which made me very happy too. 
14343 1 One of the worst locations ever. They never have any fruit how are customers supposed to get icecream made that's pretty pathetic oh well I better stop going to this location I have family members who own marble slab in Toronto. IT IS A REQUIREMENT.. 
14344 4 AMAZING.. Where did this fantastic restaurant come from? Excellent service, delicious meals, great beer and a HAPPY OWNER.... What more could one ask? Definitely will return... 
14345 4 Delicious, cheap, fast. The pepperoni and mushroom one is a great snack while walking up and down South Congress! 
14346 3 ordered delivery, fast delivery, decent pie a tad pricy but i will order again! 
14347 4 This place is amazing. I usually get the chickens tibs dish with potato stew as a side, but recently tried with salmon and STILL was great. It is definitely worth a drive from whichever direction you're coming from. 
14348 3 Great local vibe.. Quite Decent brew. No bullshit attitude Felt like I was living on the edge as covert Wolverine fan in my UCD attire. Getting great service by Lisbeth Salander. Thought about getting a shirt but it was just too mean 
14349 4 Our rental property had a handful of items that needed to get repaired prior to listing the house for sale. The handyman was able to make the main entry door look good again after years of abuse from the prior renter. I will use them again in the future. 
14350 3 The burgers at Hopdoddy are worth suffering through the confusing system, long wait, high prices and difficult parking. The big ass local beers help, too. That is all. 
14351 4 I always get the hot stone pedicure...the staff does such a great job. Enjoy a glass of wine and sit back and relax while being pampered and listen to the zen music! It all makes for a great combination!! 
14352 4 Excellent staff, and great selection for glasses. WE were very pleased and will be going back for our future exams. 
14353 4 This place rocks my socks. Best Ramen in town! Delicious! No msg, no cutting corners on ingredients. They make all of their broth fresh and you can tell! A lot of different options. Sushi, rice dishes, etc. 
14354 4 I had a birthday lunch here and was treated like royalty. And the waiter recommended the most delicious bass ceviche, followed by salad with grilled scallops. And their incredible molten chocolate cake for dessert. When I want seafood I go to Turners, even though I live in Cambridge. 
14355 3 Cute atmosphere and staff is very friendly. The biscuits are huge and awesome and the Cajun breakfast was delish! The fresh squeezed orange juice in the mimosa was pretty good too!! 
14356 1 Excellent breakfast tacos and selection of grocery products. Probably the most UNFRIENDLY staff in the city though. I've been here a few times and its been that way every time. The tacos and coffee have me reluctantly going back. 
14357 4 Beautiful, well maintained, clean, quiet, and so close to the city. One of my favorite spots in town. 
14358 2 This location is not that big in space, however, I came here to have some tea and to do some homework as I needed a sense of different scenery around me. I had a tea with hot water, hard to mess up. Very good customer service. 
14359 4 This place is a hidden gem! Run do not walk to get the best Korean chicken in ATX! The kimchi fries are also pretty amazing and the atmosphere is fun and friendly. 
14360 4 Surprise find for us. Nice patio dining, very good food. Service was attentive and responsive. Manager came by a couple of times to check on us. Really like the Pointe Orlando development. 
14361 4 Everything here was amazing! We tried several meat and vegetarian options and they did not disappoint! Plus the live music was a bonus! I can't wait to come back! :) 
14362 4 Just had a massage with Linda and she did an amazing job! I've had a lot of disappointing massages but this one made me feel fantastic. Hot towels, great service, relaxing environment, and Linda is clearly very skilled at what she does. I'll definitely be back! 
14363 4 What a great business! I only had the Granola & Fruit waffle, but it was so enjoyable. Payed $7 for the full plate and a delicious americano, too. If you're looking for a way to start off your morning, come here! 
14364 4 Authentic Chinese food! My only comment on Yelp, simply because this is too good! 
14365 4 Updated this bad boy to 5 stars. Outstanding staff, know me by name and by drink. Best pie on earth. I wish I could live next to this place. 
14366 4 My move went very smoothly. The team was responsive, respectful, punctual, and hard-working. The price was very fair. Thanks! 
14367 4 Excellent food and empanadas in particular. Wine and entertainment are great also. We got a great glimpse of tango too. Will definitely go there again! 
14368 1 They forget the salmon on my to go salad every single time!!!!!!!!! But certainly still charge me for it. Argh. 
14369 4 Get ambiance, great food! A must stop when in the Mission Hill area of Boston. Great menu with really fresh options. I will definitely stop in the next time I am in town. 
14370 4 My new favorite place. The cuisine is exceptionally well crafted. Every dish is a little culinary experience. For a special night out, and pricey, but you know that going in. I left satiated but not full. Will definitely go again! Seaweed salad is made from fresh seaweed, sooooooo good! 
14371 3 I had the curry goat and chicken spinach, on tomato rice. They gave me a healthy portion of each. The meats were tender and the sauces were mild to medium in spice level. It also comes with half a piece of naan bread. 
14372 4 Great ride for seeing the sights of Tomorrowland. Ride at night too to enjoy the neon. Calm ride that's suitable for everyone 
14373 4 Wonderful service and great entree food. I had the steak with asparagus and it was delicious. FYI: Portions are on the lighter side. 
14374 4 La comida es buena y las micheladas mmmm.... Deliciosas .. Se los recomiendo.. Los mejores tacos del area.. 
14375 3 Had the 3 tuna roll lunch, was fresh and tasty. Came with either soup or salad. I had salad, was loaded with ginger dressing and very cold, yuOnly $10, what a deal! 
14376 0 Memorial Day ... and only 2 cashiers open - who also work at a snails pace with an attitude. They like to not look their customers in the eye and really enjoy chatting with each other. I won't be back! 
14377 2 We had a good time. The crowd was vibing and had a good flow of drunks. The shots and adult capri suns were good. Bathrooms could be kept better. 
14378 4 Excellent! I came here and Gill did everything I asked for. Definitely recommend this place. A little pricey for a simple fade but the quality was great. 
14379 1 Service was good. Food was definitely lacking. Garlic knots were served without a dipping / red sauce. Pasta tasted like they went across the street to publix and bought a box of store brand and the sauce was extremely watery and bland I won't be back. 
14380 3 Its a nice room. Very hard to find the ironing board. Tip: check the secret door in the bathroom. I love the location. Makes me feel like I'm surrounded by smart people. Probably cause I am. Kendall is next door. Go check it out. 
14381 4 I absolutely love this store. They have a wide array of vintage artifacts from small animal taxidermy to cool relic furniture! 
14382 3 Tirando o nosso querido e velho Aki, Sushi Katana apresenta uma variedade e deliciosa da culinária japonesa. Tirando a demora no atendimento estão de parabéns. 
14383 3 The service was really good-friendly servers, etc. The food was really good. My wife liked it, so that's all that matters! 
14384 4 Specializing in German pancakes (Dutch babies), this place does not disappoint. Select from sweet or savory. All delicious! Great service. Friendly place. 
14385 4 Excellent customer service and a great facility. I definitely recommend this facility. 
14386 3 Underrated Mexican fare. Feels more like a family home that opened up a restaurant, but don't let the little loud music fool you, the cook knows how to make a decent fish taco and the home made salsa is excellent. 
14387 3 Got the roast duck, roast pig, beef chow funn, and soft shell crab. All came out super fast and tasted great, especially the seasoning on the soft shell crab.. Service was excellent as well. 
14388 4 Out of every sushi place I've ever been to (that's a long list not gonna lie) this is by far my favorite. 
14389 4 Good taco. You can build your own. Nice staff too. Always full of people. I prefer it at day time because at night it is so overwhelming. 
14390 3 Good meal and good service. We have the soup dumplings. They are okay. Enjoyed the spicy pig ears. Order the beef stew noodles and enjoyed the noodles. The beef was good. The broth was a little thin on flavor. Would like more depth in the soup. Overall a decent meal. 
14391 4 Have used these folks twice and have been quite satisfied. Friendly, competent mechanics come to your house and fix your car quickly and at a reasonable price. Today they purchased what they needed prior to arrival and then replaced my car's radiator and hoses in under two hours. Highly recommended! 
14392 3 I like the atmosphere and the food is decent. The staff are okay in friendliness and quality of service. I like all the natural light. I want this to be a great spot. 
14393 3 One of the best places for lunch in the back Bay Area of Boston. They have a great selection of sandwiches and I have had at least 8 of them and never have been disappointed. 
14394 4 I can't say it's the most reasonably priced pie in town, but it's always delicious and they deliver to my house for a minimal charge. Fresh ingredients, but wish they used more without having to order "extra." 
14395 4 mm...raspberry margarita for happy hour - $6.50, 1000 calories that you can't remember? - priceless :) 
14396 4 It might not look like much from the outside, but it's the food that counts right? They serve huge quantities of delicious fried Korean food. Do yourself a favor and give this little family run place a shot. 
14397 2 We sat at the bar for dinner and drinks. An impressive beer menu and very nice bartenders. The food was pretty generic, so I will not be returning for that. Even the waitstaff was eating pizza from All-star pizza bar next door. 
14398 4 Came into the Verizon store on 122 and Halsey. The person that help named Oscar was very helpful I will be coming back again. 
14399 4 Spent New Year's at Trifecta. We had booked it before reading reviews and were a little hesitant. No need. Staff was AWESOME! So accommodating and fun. Nick (bartender) rocks! 
14400 4 I had a great dinner sitting in the bar. The service was fast and the food was good. No complaints! 
14401 3 Very good food and service. Great bar and vibrant scene. Quite expensive though. 
14402 0 This place is total CRAP. The venison is poorly cooked. Service is neutral at best. 2 meal credits is total cabash. Not a single good thing. No ice water. Dessert is even boring. A true African meal of sticks and meal worms has to be better. 
14403 4 Absolutely delicious! Came here for my sisters birthday and Denise was our waitress and she was amazing, very friendly and sweet! The chicken kabob was very good and the baklava very yummy! Great food will definitely return! 
14404 2 Food good. Didn't really care for the menu or the self service beverage situation. Waitress was super friendly though. Probably wouldn't go back. 
14405 4 This is the vegetarian Chinese restaurant I've been looking for since I moved to Portland 5.5 years ago. We ordered Sesame Chicken and Kung Pao Beef. I might ask for a few more veggies on the Kung Pao next time, but everything was appropriately spicy, delicious, and generous. 
14406 4 Beautiful cafe in downtown Boston. The venue has a warm rustic feel with the exposed brick wall and fireplace. Many gluten free options available too! I tried their summer fruits tea which was delicious. Great spot for grabbing coffee with a friend, or just to do homework. 
14407 3 Still good. But they really should buy a second till/interac machine for checking more than one person out at a time. The line can get clogged and the sandwiches colder and soggier by the time you pay. :) 
14408 4 I had the lamb burger and it was amazing. I had sweet potatoe tots with a marshmallow whipped dipping sauce that was scrumptious... The service was impeccable thanks to our server Carla..I will be back. 
14409 3 Excellent food we tried one of each empanadas. Roast pork and lomo Saltado were cooked well and had lots of flavor. They were out of tres leche cake but were offered guava and cheese nuggets, which were tasty. Definitely coming back next time in Orlando. 
14410 4 Loves the food and the romance of the restaurant. The food was absolutely amazing!! From the fresh seafood to the French fries!!!the fried clams are unbelievable!! 
14411 4 I enjoy getting chemical peels here. I was hoping it would clear up my acne but it hasn't yet. It has improved the texture of my skin however. Next stop dermatologist. 
14412 0 I've always loved this place. Until today. :( There was hair in my food. And it wasn't mine. 
14413 3 Love the concept. And the food was good. I got the Zuni and my mom got the special. Big portions - we could've shared. It was quaint and worth a stop if you're hungry. Staff was also friendly. 
14414 4 Excellent ambience and perfectly crafted foods. The selection of foods is small yet diverse. The various tapas compliment each other well and the service is friendly and welcoming. 
14415 4 The sundae is probably the best thing ever! Nothing beats the happy hour price too. Perfect amount of hot fudge along with candied nuts topped off a delicious vanilla custard soft serve. Soooo bomb. I'd prefer this over the regular salt & straw any day. 
14416 3 Service was quick and friendly. Lobster bisque was excellent. Next time I plan to get a full meal. This place was open later than other restaurants in the terminal 
14417 3 Outstanding quick service.... Good fresh food Great Bartenders Nice ambiance too 
14418 4 Romantic bar with fabulous selection of craft beer and wine. Huge bar seating area. The occasional food truck outside is always an added bonus. Soft lighting and warm woods. I love you, Thirsty Topher. Never change. 
14419 4 Came here last week with the whole family. My wife, myself and our three young kids. Everyone loved their food choices! Our servers were friendly and on top of it. Absolutely love this place. We'll be back on a regular basis! 
14420 4 Delicious!! Hubby and I were staying at Emory Midtown Hospital after the birth of our little one. Had our dinner delivered and it was very Yummy! Super quick delivery. Will definitely eat at Mediterranean Grill again in the future!! 
14421 2 The place is nice, people are friendly and the drinks are good. But whatever that annoying, super loud beeping noise is completely ruins the ambience and ability to concentrate on whatever you are doing. 
14422 3 The food was great. Catfish had a lot of flavor & shrimp was good as well. Hush puppies sucked but rest was good. The interior of the place could use some fixing up. Great takeout spot though. 
14423 3 Intimate. Lots of props! Good visiting teacher. I would have liked to meet the owner. Would visit again. I'm from out-of-town. 
14424 4 The buttermilk old-fashioned is to die for. Seriously, if I died while eating one of these, it would be totally rad, because I'd already be in heaven anyway. 
14425 3 Brand new location. Very small with limited seating. I was lucky to score something. I just had the basic cheesecake. It was my well deserved cheat day. Good customer service and fair prices matching the other locations. 
14426 0 Probably very good coffee. I wouldn't know though since they refuse to divulge what the 7(!) mystery ingredients are in their "milk." No thanks. 
14427 4 WOW... lots of recent limited and/or one star reviews. Honestly, I am questioning these reviews. My wife and I have visited Keldara Salon many time and each experience has been excellent. If you are using Yelp to review please look at the user's profile. 
14428 4 Great place!! I am a history fan, and this olde tavern was wonderful!! The beer and food were a plus!!! 
14429 2 Standard neighboorhood pizza delivery. Much better in Portland available - but in a pinch this will do. 
14430 4 I've been here twice, both times with a Groupon. I always order Palak Paneer and garlic naan. The highest spicy level isn't that spicy, but it still tastes great. The staff is very friendly as well. Even when the Groupon goes away, I will continue to come back 
14431 4 The potatoes. The potatoes. The potatoes. Honestly, everything I've tried from the Medi Grill has been on point. Prices and portions are awesome too. The Business Lunch combo is a super deal. I love it and so does everyone in my office. 
14432 4 Great service from my waiter Adam drink never stayed empty. The sriracha fried rice was amazing. Fun atmosphere good crowd. 
14433 0 NOT a good experience. Asked for a trim, and got 2 inches cut off. The women talked amongst themselves and even cursed to each other, totally ignoring me as their customer. I do not recommend this place. 
14434 3 Surprisingly good deals and finds. We found some out of production Samsonite luggage at an incredible price (I don't think the owner realized how much these are going for on eBay). 
14435 4 Love this place. Food is great, service is on point. Waffles are yummy! If you're going just for the waffles, just order to go. Save yourself an hour + wait. 
14436 4 Jamie to the rescue! She did such an amazing job on my hair! Can't thank her enough! I walked in with terrible brassy blonde hair and she made it look BEAUTIFUL! Will definitely be recommending her friends!!! Thanks again Jamie! 
14437 4 I've been here about six times over the past year, and it never disappoints. They have many plates at reasonable prices and a nice variety of dishes. Samurai Shrimp, Malibu Ribeye, Crab Cake Sandwich, all delicious! 
14438 3 Great local bar with a good menu. The chicken wings here are very good. Big and meaty and are comparable to Roosters wings. The fries taste fresh cut. O'Nellys has great live entertainment and have plenty of T.V.'s to watch your favorite team. 
14439 4 Great service and food. The bottomless mimosas on Sunday's are great and for only $12! I would definitely go there again. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. 
14440 3 Great service, always excellent food, and a surprisingly good beer selection. Love the special bowl/burrito variety and quality. 
14441 4 The Huevos rancheros was amazinggg. A little lighter than a normal Huevos rancheros which i appreciate because they can be so heavy sometimes. My boyfriend got the duck confit eggs Benedict special - also amazing. Great service, reasonable prices and they have fresh squeezed grapefruit and orange juice - sold. 
14442 4 they are overpriced but i dont care. they are pretty, and pretty things make me happy. if i had a million dollars.... 
14443 4 Excellent food! Love that they cook it up fresh to order. I had the Chicago style with asada and the flavor was very good. My hubby had the chicken tacos and he said they were very flavorful. We will go again for sure! 
14444 4 I love this place! Very friendly bartenders (Brad, Sarah, Michael, JJ, Crissy, John and more), great small plates and appetizers and the cozy atmosphere will leave you wanting to come back for more! Finally Northwest Austin has its own friendly wine bar! 
14445 4 The best Indian food I've ever had and a great atmosphere. Service was exceptional! As a solo diner, I was disappointed I couldn't get the full menu at the bar, but that's understandable. Will definitely be back on my next trip to Austin!!! 
14446 4 Delicious! Burger (double stack) was cooked perfectly, milkshake was amazing and the selection for everything leaves you with tons of choices (all good ones!) Emily was our waitress- so sweet, attentive and got everything just right :) would definitely return. 
14447 4 Fresh quality food and fast friendly service, great location and tables to sit on the back. Definitely coming back ! Highly recommended ! 
14448 0 Zero stars if I could. Terribly rude. Puts you on hold without even saying hello. "Everett Taxi, hold on" 
14449 3 If your going for a high end sushi but don't want to spend too much money, this is the place. Aburi sushi was the highlight and a must try! 
14450 3 Delicious original gyro. Service is fast and pleasant. I'd come back. YUM. This is for the food truck! 
14451 3 Excellent subs at a reasonable price. A huge variety too for those picky eaters that can't decide on what to settle for. Come with an empty stomach and enjoy a great turkey and ranch or one of their other 100 subs! 
14452 4 Love this place! The service is quick, and the chicken is delicious. It tastes fresh, and is cooked to order. Also, Peter is the man. I highly recommend eating here! 
14453 4 Great burgers, beer & shakes! Try the Diablo burger, BeerRita and share a caramel salt shake for dessert!! 
14454 0 I'm from Connecticut... the Chili's at this location is definitely not up to Connecticut standards... The food was atrocious the service was nonexistent the table sticky and I still left a 15% tip avoid this place at all cost! 
14455 4 Awesome bar! Great ambiance and good drinks! Staff is very nice and knowledgeable about cocktails. 
14456 4 Super friendly staff, no frill dining experience, amazing food, large portions, reasonable prices! Will definitely recommend to others. Tried the Linguine con Frutti di Mare (spicey tomato sauce with seafood) and it was really good! 
14457 4 I love 4 Rivers. The food is great! I love the bbq sauce there. It's the best! John Rivers is the best at what he does and I will always support him. Good Man. Great food and awesome Kissimmee location! 
14458 3 The Diet "Surf!" flavor (mint-colored labeling, Hibiscus Mint flavor) is really good! Tastes much better than some of the past flavors. It's refreshing and gives me non-jittery energy when I really need to focus and get stuff done at work. 
14459 3 2 beers, 2 shots, a Voss water, vodka martini, and amarrouto sour cost us $44 at late night happy hour. A very chill atmosphere with a touch of some western class made for an enjoyable night. 
14460 3 Good Jamaican Food Reminds Me Of Back Home! Its A Bit Of An American Taste But It Comes With The Territory Of Having A Jamaican Restaurant In America But Nonetheless Very Authentic! Service Could Be Better But I Don't Expect It To Get Better For Personal Reasons! 
14461 3 Contemporary design. Bright. Clean. Enthusiastic. Comfy. Tasty. Choices... Like: Delicious food, service, free parkings Dislike: Prices, not accept credit cards 
14462 1 This place can accommodate large groups. The service needs help and the food is decent. The lunch entrees aren't cheap which is likely why the restaurant is never full. 
14463 4 Left this place with a beautiful haircut! My hair felt super silky and smooth after and stayed that way for a good couple of days! My favorite place to go from now on. The service here is great and they are very attentive to detail. 
14464 0 Dirtiest, filthiest, nastiest walmart I have EVEzr been to. No carts. No lid to the sanitary wipes. The isles were full of boxes, couldn't get through the isles with the cart. There were 9 employees outside sitting on the curb, some smoking. No carts!!! Will not be back EVER! 
14465 4 A new option for pizza, gyros, falafel and some great Indian dishes in SE. Great flavors and friendly service in a family run setting- prices are very reasonable too. 
14466 2 Average experience. Kinda small inside but nice and bright. This place Can get crowded and there isn't much xtra room once that happens. Service was cool. Really wanted this place. Been years... 
14467 4 I visited MacLeod's Books on the suggestion of an antiquarian book collector friend. He got it right. The place is absolutely overflowing with books, and is worth the trip merely to soak in the sights and smells. Be sure to check out the basement for even more full-on bibliophilism. 
14468 4 Love this cafe, especially during the summertime because of the outdoor seating. Very peaceful and relaxing cafe to get homework or work done. They have really tasty sandwiches. Cant wait for the warm weather to get here so I can start going back! 
14469 4 Love these donuts!!!!! Super soft fluffy dough. Great prices for the dozen and good variety! Move over Krispy Kreme I've found a new spot that stole my taste buds 
14470 3 The service is fair but I must say the cooks are what makes the place what it is. The food is GREAT... Omelettes are excellent as well as the pancakes. Expect a wait time.... 
14471 4 Came here on a gift card, you order your food right at the register and pay then sit down, no table service. Food was amazing, we ordered one of almost every slider and the steak fries. My favorite was the corn beef slider! Yum! We will be going back 
14472 3 This fairly new restaurant in the Beachwald area. It is very clean and the service is good. The food is good. Many times they are busy and have trouble getting a table 
14473 2 I"ve been here twice and both times were for a small party bash. I have nothing but nice thing to say, but not enough data to write about. Good drinks, good appetizers, and good services. 
14474 1 The food and service were very good. But 4 Corner Tavern has no character at all! Boring, empty and almost a abandoned feeling! Not really a Tavern feeling or a place to go and have drinks and fun with friends. SORRY 
14475 4 The best donuts around. Great staff amazing food made fresh and reasonably priced. 
14476 4 Can't say enough about the meatball subs. I'm hooked! Glad this place is only around the corner from me as I frequent often. Friendly staff. 
14477 3 Very good coffe, so many options, friendly service, clean place, free wifi, clean restrooms, parking lot. 
14478 4 Delicious! I've only had the new turkey so far but I will be stopping in when I go to Boulder and try more! They have a turkey sub with mashed potatoes and gravy..... Enough said! 
14479 4 This is the best Cantonese food here in town! I've been to this place several times. Their BBQ pork and ducks are awesome! A must try. It's also not too expensive. Their porridge is good taste, several different styles. Pretty busy for lunch on weekends. 
14480 1 If you plan on moving in don't let em put you in an apartment facing the Forsyth Fabric parking lot - you won't get any sleep! The bros gather there and party all night...loud, real loud!!!! 
14481 3 This place is HUGE, has tons of stuff, and is pretty well organized as far as Forever 21 stores go. I wasn't able to spend a proper amount of time last time I was here so I have grand plans to visit here again and do some damage :) 
14482 3 This place can get very busy on the weekends. Great little restaurant. I like the 'healthy start' breakfast. 
14483 2 I really wanted to like this place b/c it's cheap, but the Singapore noodles I got were only so-so--greasy and not half as flavorful as at Tamarind House. Good-sized portion, but still a portion of meh. 
14484 3 I like it, kinda wish them sell taiwanese food snack too. 
14485 4 I have been coming to Cedar market since I was a little kid, and it's gotten even better since then when they changed over to To Beirut... Highly suggest the swarma here, I will be back week after week 
14486 4 Nice beer selection, great prices, tasty food, generous portions, excellent bar tender, fun music, multiple sports games on, small and comfortable atmosphere. I will be coming back for sure. 
14487 0 Waited for an hour even with appointment! Doctor was kind of rude and unprofessional. Never suggest this place for eye exam or prescriptions 
14488 0 Very loud place which is shame cuz the band is nice and the place is great to dance but too loud 
14489 4 The food at this restaurant is simply delicious. The guacamole was really fresh and amazing. Fajita's were served piping hot and were seasoned perfectly. Restaurant is a very friendly and staff pays attention to every detail. Our waiter URI was extremely friendly and professional. Will dine here again soon 
14490 3 Probably the best pizza in Wellesley/Needham. I really like the "Farm Fresh" pizza--potatoes, cherry tomatoes, olives, arugula, etc. 
14491 0 Yuck. Dough was too sweet, sauce was too sweet. We got a pepperoni and black olive pie, and the only good part was the pepperoni. Not good. 
14492 4 I eat here twice a week usually, always pick up. They have never messed up an order of mine, everything is so delicious and fresh, and the staff is amazing. 10/10 
14493 2 Good tuna salad sandwich but the sandwich maker doesn't wear gloves when prepping food. Places needs a good cleaning. 
14494 3 Just tired this place. It was very good. Ordered Larp Chicken, which was not on the menu and they made it for me. 
14495 4 This has to be one of the Best Deli's in Colorado. There bread is very fresh, the prime rib is slow turned and perfectly tender. If you are ever in the area go get one. It will change your outlook on life. 
14496 4 Fav place to rent kayaks. Staff is always so helpful and nice. To do list this year: Try out paddle boarding and see if my dog likes kayaking. 
14497 4 Best seats out of any Alamo! Will come here just for the seats! 
14498 2 Took my son here while on vacation at Disney for a sinus infection. Waited 2 hours and he fell asleep in the waiting room. They do have an attached pharmacy but for me the wait was too long Doctor seemed very competitent and caring. 
14499 0 All I can say is a smile goes along way, I think the bartender was Caitlin. Look a bit more excited on game day girl 
14500 3 Love it. Close, Affordable and the scenery is awesome. Sadly, no gripes about this one....well maybe my terrible golf game. 
14501 3 Always good food always consistently fast friendly service... Probably best Chinese food in the Vancouver area... Great hot and sour soup which is my way of determining if a Asian restaurant is worth a second visit! 
14502 3 Can be a little backed up at times, but this place is great. The Coppola add cheddar! So good! The almond pesto aioli is super good. The sourdough bread is a great pick too miam miam 
14503 1 Overpriced and unfortunately, not very yummy. Good thing about this place is that they won't kick you out. We each ordered something and stayed to play cards. 
14504 3 The oysters were good! We also tried the house ceviche, but I would pass on that and get more oysters if I went again. 
14505 4 Found this place by chance tonight and excited to have. Great spot, friendly staff, and chef Miguel can cook a steak, scallops and risotto perfectly. Very impressed. Excited to go back again. A Spot I thought Gunbarrel was missing! 
14506 3 Buffalo chicken wrap and jambalaya are awesome! 
14507 0 Slow to seat (despite ample seating available) Slow to serve (despite not being very busy). A poorly managed restaurant. There are better options in the area. 
14508 4 I love coming here for the chicken ramen with extra egg. Jennifer was amazing! She recommended a few appetizers but my favorite were the brussels sprouts!!! 
14509 4 I love this place! Good coffee! Good service! Fat cinnamon rolls!!! The waffles from waffle window!! Yeah!!! 
14510 4 Very professional and passionate about their work. Great communication and responds very quickly. 
14511 4 Great restaurant! Phenomenal food! Must try the Nashville Hot Chicken-- a perfect balance of spice and sweetness. The sweet potato pancakes and honey sauce served with the chicken are out of this world! Great service, though kinda busy on a weekend evening. Will definitely be returning soon. 
14512 0 Their name should be 3 month blinds. They first didn't properly measure my windows and after ordering and reordering my blinds they're still not installed. Given the cost, you'll be far better off ordering window treatments online and hiring someone independent to install them. 
14513 2 This place is BRAZILIAN!!! Like some people mentioned it looks like a high school cafeteria, LOL. If you want to eat healthy, and cheap food, you should go there, the food is decent, but is not a place to take a date... 
14514 2 Decided to get takeout after a long day and found this place great because it delivers Indian food. Ordered chicken tikka masala and butter chicken. Both were excellent but the portions are very small. The dishes were mainly sauce. 
14515 4 Good good good. LOVE their cannoli. I'm definitely a Modern Pastry fan over the, well, other guys. The shell is nice and crispy. Not too thick and slightly flaky. But the filling is just sooooooo good. 
14516 4 I am no coffee expert but I really liked this place. My latte was as smooth as silk. I had to do some work and the large communal table was perfect. I love that I had lots of space without bothering anyone. I'll be back! 
14517 4 The Sun dial rotating bar 360 degree at the top is a must visit. Need no reservation. Great bar foods, and cocktails. Friendly staff. Totally awesome! Price is very reasonable. Highly recommended! 
14518 4 These guys rock. Really appreciate that they make you feel at home. Can't say enough about how their smiles warmed up my day. Give yourself a latte =) 
14519 2 I love love love that dark meat. But most sides are hella salty. Good place when you're desperate for decent food 
14520 4 Our regular weekly eating spot. Plenty of great food and good service. One of three Great places to hangout, drink & watch the game or just BS. Your neighbors will be there too. 
14521 4 Loved this place. Cute set-up with an area in the middle that resembles an actual bar. It's large and open and not too busy. Their cappuccino was on POINT. 
14522 0 Disgusting food! The pork dumplings and the fried chicken were terrible. The ribs and the rice were pretty good though. The mai tai was ok. It is so expensive here don't waste your money. It was my last night in Boston and I was disappointed. 
14523 4 I received a beautiful flower arrangement from my husband for our anniversary. The flowers were gorgeous. Bloomin Across Texas did an amazing job! 
14524 1 Took forever to order a drink only to find out that the bar "ran out of red wine." Pretty ridiculous. Also, bring back the large Jenga board. 
14525 4 5 stars based solely on their white mochas, iced or hot. They use Ghirardelli white chocolate syrup; and to someone from SF, there is NO better! 
14526 2 Food pretty good but service is slow. Even when you order and pickup. Don't say 10 mins when it's not ready after 20 mins Cheese dip good and tacos 
14527 0 The worst McDonald's on the planet. By far the slowest service and worst experience everytime I go no matter what time of the day it is. I have literally fallen asleep in the drive thru waiting on food before. HORRIBLEEEEEEEE get your shit together for real. 
14528 4 This place will never fail. There are no words for how delicious everything on their menu is. Waitstaff is always friendly and nice. Hands down one of Boston's best establishments. 
14529 3 Even though this place is a zoo to be in the make your own sticky rice roll is delish. You can choose from 5 different fillings and they prepare it in front of you. I always choose the purple rice. 
14530 4 First time here! GOOD LORD! Best breakfast ever! The Bella Bella eggs benedict was beyond yummy. Your waitress must be Rikki. Attentive, funny, personable, and full of energy! A really terrific experience all the way around! We'll be back! 
14531 4 Went here for my anniversary dinner. The hostess was world class, pleasant and pro , the scallops were fresh n buttery, steak was great, lobster mac n cheese....etc couple with a downtown feel. Overall, an excellent evening 5 stars !!! 
14532 4 Nothing but the finest in automotive diagnostics & repair. Specializing in Custom Exhaust, Domestic & Foreign vehicle diagnosis & repair and Automotive HVAC Systems. Great people & great prices! 
14533 1 Food was bland. Atmosphere was dingy and old. Very dark. Smelled like a cross between BO and mold. Their bragging rights about being around for so long are no longer any good because they need a make over! 
14534 3 Ate here last night and was pleasantly surprised! Food was delicious but could have used just a bit more meat in the sandwich! I got the torta de Milanesa! I will def be coming again! It was cooked fresh and quickly! Bread was perfect! 
14535 4 Clean, large, friendly staff, I've been a few times and the store is always changing. Pretty different from an ordinary thrift store. Looks like they're under new management - and they hired an in-store artist. 
14536 4 EVERYTHING on their menu is fabulous!! Fresh veggies and spices. Very flavorful and I get their take out all the time. Prices are good too! 
14537 4 The first nice day after many salt covered roads and the lines were long. Really hard workers for such a long line and many impatient customers The crew was friendly and patient. The car looked great 
14538 4 Ive always like SHANE'S RIBSHACK ! Been going for 4 years now since they opened. Great Georgian BBQ Located just in Front of COSCO at Polaris 5 MEOOOWS !!! .... Look at my other Reviews :) 
14539 4 Have been traveling in West Coast for the past few weeks and this is one of the place with the best mocha. Really love the beans and the ambience is great! Gonna come here again! :) 
14540 3 Still think this is a great place for a cold beer! The food is good and the service is great! Pricing is very good too! 
14541 4 The have done so many upgrades to this park over the years and I love it. There is plenty of room and plenty of shade. The basketball courts are clean and they even have benches court side. 
14542 4 Well what can I say. Got a Stromboli and a Greek salad. Top 3 best 'bolis I've had to date! See if they can hold the 5 stars the next time I go and get one of their pizzas. 
14543 4 Very good food. Im sure it was loaded with a gazillion calories, but it was very much worth it! 
14544 4 This place is amazing. Great for dine in and take out. The service is very enjoyable, everyone is friendly and great to talk to. Believe the sign outside-- the lasagna is amazing!!! Definitely recommended. 
14545 4 I had a delightful porcini mushroom soup, scallops over risotto, and a pear tart for dessert. Also, a fabulous pinot noir. A wonderful experience! 
14546 4 I love this place!!! Jonette is so friendly, creative and easy to work with. It's refreshing to send a simple request and receive it back better than I could have asked for. And EVERY TIME the cupcakes and cookies have been unbelievably tasty! Thank you for quick and delicious service! 
14547 4 Andrea is the best. I hope I spelled her name right. I had an awesome experience and will be back as soon as this protective style is down. Very informative, patient and didn't cut off all my hair. Free education is always a plus. Thank you so much. 
14548 0 Worst pad Thai of my life. Gross gross gross.Worst pad Thai of my life. Gross gross gross.Worst pad Thai of my life. Gross gross gross.Worst pad Thai of my life. Gross gross gross.Worst pad Thai of my life. Gross gross gross. 
14549 3 Came here for a post gym lunch and it was great. I had the spring rolls and the Bloody Mary. Both were on point and the staff was great. 
14550 4 Pleasant surprise to find this place. Very busy part of Salem with great pubs and other restaurants in the area. We both had the clam chowder. Wife had Ceasars salad, I the calamari. All very good. 
14551 3 I tried make-my-own bowl and their signature bowl. My bowl I made tasted so so lol. Their signature poke was tasty and save time to think of what combination I need to make my bowl tasty. The Wasabi Basil dressing was great. 
14552 0 Ruined post-May 2011. Once a dive with character is now nothing more than another crappy Allston bar. The awkward silence in there wasn't even worth a full beer, which I drank as quickly as possible before leaving. Basically an atrocity 
14553 4 Probably one of my favorite sushi places of all times (besides uchi). Everything you get here is going to taste delicious, hands down! I highly suggest you go here! The guy that owns both Uchiko and Uchi won Top Chef, so that makes it even better! :) 
14554 3 Great for a Chinese buffet. Very clean and neat. Men's room spotless and well stocked. The buffet is hot and fresh. From the soups to the salads everything was very tasty and well presented. 
14555 4 I'm a terrible driver, and find myself grateful for the service these kind folks provide. My ghetto bumper transformed lickety-split. The work is impeccable and far more efficient than a typical body shop. 
14556 4 The service was impeccable. When my mussels dish was delayed they comp it and gave us an extra dish. The wait staff and management staff were wonderful. The food was perfect tapas just the right amount. Have to remember to save room for dessert next time. We will be back. 
14557 0 Long term customer - 90 minutes and no food. 'Steve' claims to be the manager then admits he's not had no explanation why we don't have food at 9:35 pm. 8:02 order, 30-45 min delivery, 9:35 no food, canceled order. 
14558 1 Don't get me wrong, the pizza is good. There are just NO gluten-free pizza, pasta options. If you cannot have gluten then I do not recommend going there. The local pizza shops would be much better. You can eat a salad and maybe one appetizer if you eat there. 
14559 4 Loved our meal at Lechon, our server was extremely attentive and the food was very good. The portions are small-medium, good for sharing with friends. 
14560 4 Best Sunday brunch. The presentation at the table is lovely the weight service is wonderful and the food is splendid. I would definitely go again. 
14561 3 I was so happy to discover a yarn shop so close to my home! I love taking classes here and find the staff very helpful! There is a great selection of yarn too. They have everything that I need to complete my projects! 
14562 4 Food was fantastic!!! Ordered jerk chick, bbq jerk, fries, rice and plantains and all was superb! Great staff, fresh food and generous portions, what more can you ask for! 
14563 4 Kind of like Uchi's really attractive little brother that lives up north (central). Always busy, always delicious, and always great service. The kobe beef hot rock melts in your mouth, and NEVER leave there without ordering at least one of the fish specials. It's not allowed. 
14564 3 Great burger but need to clean the place more often. Most tables left a mess and bathroom is just not clean. Every time I go feels like they just got slammed with a crowd. Also beware outside tables are loose. Still a good burger.. 
14565 4 Sooo good! Definitely a must have when in Portland. I'd recommend their Horchata flavored donut. Enjoy! 
14566 4 I love St. Ignatius! With a welcoming congregation, beautiful music and compelling sermons I've felt right at home since I've started attending! 
14567 4 Very helpful. Another shop sold me bad equipment and they got me straight away. Great supplies and variety of stuff 
14568 4 Love everything about this place.. It is even great if you don't eat mean! 
14569 4 Best Chinese food I have found in Portland Metro area. Szechuan beef is amazing. Cooked to perfect crispiness with perfect amount of zing in the sauce. The servers are fun and friendly and aim to please. 
14570 0 Terrible customer service. Employees behave like indentured servants. "Uniforms unkempt" would be complimentary. Machines in poor repair. Went to 8 redemption machines before I got one that worked. Low expectations for food were not even half met. Toy prize fell apart within seconds of opening. Boo... 
14571 0 Bartender today was a complete jerk. He was so arrogant and rude I will not return. The girl working yesterday was lovely but this guy was super rude. Ugh. I used to love this place.... 
14572 4 My son went in to get his glasses fixed after being sat on and bent. Valerie was exceptional and his glasses were fixed with no charge. Will definitely come back. 
14573 1 The only good thing about this place is the somewhat decent beer selection. My turkey tips were cold and dry and some pieces were burnt. Green beans were wilted. Pretty sad. I've had this entree in Lowell and Burlington locations and it was good. 
14574 3 30% off everything on Mondays and Thursdays. Darts and pool. This is not a dive bar. It's a dive lounge, and I love it. 
14575 4 Excellent. Had a Caesar salad and the gnocchi and I'm stuffed but oh so happy. It was delicious. 
14576 3 This is a nice hotel, but I expected more for the price. I stayed there about a year ago and barely remember the room. That must mean it was just typical. But very clean, which is always a plus! 
14577 3 Wonderful property, we have stayed here many times considering it to be our home away from home. Really close to WDW. Great staff, beautiful amenities, villas are beautiful inside, spacious and fully stocked. My family loves this property! 
14578 3 I live closeby, so the location is perfect for me. All of the breakfast tacos are pretty good, and I think their coffee is very solid as well. The underground area is pretty nice for eating or hanging out. Careful with the tacos though, they're very hot at first. 
14579 0 Who knew you could wait 45 minutes at lunch in an empty bar for a hotdog and 12 oysters on the half shell. We left before the food arrived, avoid if you don't have an hour to wait!!! 
14580 4 I'm impressed. Had a flat tire and needed my car towed down the street. They arrived faster than their quoted time and were completely professional and friendly. I will recommend them to anyone needing a tow! 
14581 4 This is the best brisket I ever tasted. Moist and really the tenderest. New definition of what the ideal Texas brisket should aspire to! 
14582 3 Best juice place there is but prices itself out of being an everyday place. Unless they're being charged double what other smoothie joints are for their fruit or their labor is paid twice as much, be prepared to drop 12$ on a cup of juice. 
14583 4 This place rocks! Customer service is above and beyond! Need I say more? Oh yeah, this is also one ginormous place as it is a convention center. Stay here, you won't regret it 
14584 4 This restaurant is Outstanding. From the great bread that comes in the beginning from an outstanding employee to their outstanding service that brings the mealGreat team Service where the coffee cups are always full. Just a fantastic meal and service 
14585 3 Loved our experience here! Quiet, wonderful/friendly staff, and excellent, fresh food. 
14586 4 Great atmosphere outstanding service and the food was top notch, I had the Lamb Kabab over Greek Salad...Perfect! This will be a definite "go to" place for me 
14587 4 Only six stars? If you are looking for good sliders, this is the place you want to go. I recommend everyone in your party trying at least two different sliders. You won't be disappointed 
14588 4 Great food, great service, great atmosphere: a great place to eat! I recommend The Three Guidos. Prices are good for what you get. A great place to bring the family or meet with friends. 
14589 3 the Snug is good food, good beers, and great entertainment. The food is fresh and delecious. I've never had a problem there. The beer is ice cold. It can get loud but nothing outrageous overall it's a great place 
14590 0 If I had a choice this place would have zero stars!! The food is so awful and so bland. It is way overpriced for what you get and not even worth it. 
14591 4 Hillarry was extremely easy to talk to and professional. We received our photos in about a week and they are AMAZING! We would absolutely recommend her services and will be sure to use her again! Thanks Hillarry! 
14592 4 I can't believe my meal had zero calories :-). Actually vegan and gluten free food was nicely prepared. We had the combo, soup, pizza and dessert. Great service 
14593 4 I met up with a few friends last night at Javelina's for the first time. I really liked the cozy atmosphere. I loved the Prairie in house drink specialty (had the ice crystals on top, yum). Hope to go back soon. 
14594 4 Don't think I've ever given a 5. However this place just earned one. The badass bacon and eggs are amazing, with the smoky salsa and a great hash brown casserole. If I lived here I'd be back every weekend! Great atmosphere and nice people, great service! 
14595 1 Good beer. Shitty food. Cover charge. A plethora of college dudes in white hats and North Face fleece vests (or equivalent). Cover bands. Lots and lots of cover bands. Overrated. 
14596 3 Looking for the latest pair of designer jeans? By George has a great selection of designer jeans and trendy button down shirts for a night on the town or for looking your best at work. Men's department is at the right hand side of the store. 
14597 4 The Wine Bistro is a fantastic place! Filled with great wine selections, an eclectic menu of delicious food, and a friendly and courteous staff. We have been regulars there for a long time (even in it's previous incarnation) and enjoy it every time. 
14598 3 Had a great evening with our server Caleb. Food was good and Caleb provided outstanding customer service. Would recommend the pretzel bites and ahi tuna flatbread. Dirty martinis with blue cheese olives are the best! 
14599 4 Love this PF location! It's very bright, open, and clean. Staff is very friendly and helpful. This location also seems to have more equipment and "training areas" than other locations in Columbus. Open 24/7 is really nice too! 
14600 4 Best SUP! Love, love, love this place and all the smiling faces who work here! You can tell they love what they do! 
14601 3 This was an interesting find. The food was very good and the service was friendly. Small place but seemed to be a pretty popular place. I will stop here when I come to Austin again. 
14602 4 My very favorite place in Austin to have Crab Cakes! Happy Hour is great and service has always been upscale even though this is a 'Trendy Dining' restaurant! Love it! 
14603 4 Historical space, awesome ambiance, delicious drinks, and friendly, knowledgeable bartenders. The best bar in town! 
14604 4 Great beer and food options.tasted the IPA and a Pale and was great. Loved the Hummus plate, will be coming back. 
14605 0 Old, dirty and run down. Plastic covers on mattress-and still paid $94 after fees and taxes. Stay anywhere else. 
14606 0 Place smelled like ding dong. Never coming back here. I told the cashier to have a good day on my way out and she completely ignored me. 
14607 3 The staff accommodated my request to check in early, which I appreciated, and they got me into a less expensive room, which I really appreciated. I still felt the price was high, but overall the hotel was great. 
14608 3 All I have to say is maple bacon donut will change your world. On the weekends, the line can get extremely long and it's cash only. 
14609 4 BEST SALSAS IN TOWN !!!!!!! love their enchiladas, rice, beans. real mexican food, it is like eating at mama's house :) small place, order at front, no waitress service on table at all, but, nice service at front ordering. 
14610 4 Great tour guide, great tour, great beer! A truly unique brewery tour that's fun and you get to drink the beer at the end. 
14611 4 Tara on the bar is the best Always have a craving for some Changs Spicy Chicken when visiting Boston-the drinks are always on point, and I love how they constantly are changing them as well as their food menus to keep guests enticed to try something new. Love you Changs 
14612 4 Possibly the BEST restaurant in Austin. Definitely the best I've tried here. From the Rotisserie Chicken Flatbread to the Iceberg BLT Salad to the Roasted Chicken to their Steaks (& Chili Mac n Cheese) this place is absolutely amazing from ambience to service to quality. 
14613 0 Staff regularly not at the front desk and when they do finally come to check you in they are more often than not very grumpy. Clean facility, expensive and very unfriendly employees. 
14614 4 We love Austin Animal Center!! Great cause and great customer service. We will be rescuing another dog soon and we will be going here to get our next pup. 
14615 4 Discovered "To Beirut" tonight and the food was delicious! Had the lamb kabob plate and it was awesome! 
14616 4 The owner Greg and his staff are heartwarming folks as you can guess from the vibe from the Austintonians* not sure if that's what the natives like to be called here! Great food at a great price! Cozy local spots with live entertainment in the evening. 
14617 4 The pizza was super good and the atmosphere was cute and cozy. Service was also exceptional and the staff seemed very friendly. It is a bit pricy, but the pizza was definitely well worth it! 
14618 4 Wonderful little St. John's bar! The corned beef hash is homemade and absolutely delicious. They serve breakfast/brunch, lunch, and dinner. Good service, good drinks, good food, and not overcrowded during Portland weekend brunch hours. What more could you want? 
14619 4 Schedule the same day as the service and the job was completed efficiently and completely without any issues. I'd use them again if/when I have a plumbing issue to resolve asap. 
14620 4 I really appreciate good people, and Shaun, knowing my broken window was turning my old house into an arctic tundra, referred me to his own dad to get the job done, same-day. I absolutely recommend All Service Glass, and I'm glad that there are still fantastic people in this city. 
14621 2 It's trying to be a chick-fil-a you don't feel bad eating at. Everything is fine but not as good. I've eaten here twice and will eat here again if I'm in the area. It's good but for the prices/idea you would think they could beat the veggie tales crew. 
14622 1 I've had better. The tortillas are not fresh. I had the Picadillo and the al pastor. The al pastor is WAY too spicy-- and I can handle spicy food. The Picadillo had a gritty consistency. Taco Bell tacos are better. I would not recommend. 
14623 4 Excellent staff, offered tea or cold water before the pedicure appointment. The place is very clean and very organized. Had a great pedicure experience. Prices are reasonable. Will go there again for pedicure. 
14624 4 Ittoku is fast quick and easy. Great fresh sushi and good wines. Come here on a date or girls night, it's amazing. 
14625 2 Came here twice for dinner with Groupon, once with some friends, once with my mom. The food here is okay, a bit on the salty and greasy side. The service is slow and the servers are not particularly polite nor attentive. 
14626 0 Extremely disappointing. This was our 4th time there and it seems to get worse each time. We're done.....no more twilight for us. This place is in serious need of adult supervision!!!! The food is good for the most part, but the service is terrible! 
14627 4 Great shop! Removed my rusting exhaust and installed a new one in under a hour for a great price. I would absolutely recommend! 
14628 4 Wow this was yummy! Went for our 20 year anniversary and the food was amazing! The dates, the goat cheese, the grilled onions, sangria- yum! 
14629 4 Had dinner and lunch here couple times when I was in Boston. The atmosphere is very pleasant, food was great, service was good. Will come back. 
14630 2 Went here on a Friday evening with my fam. The place is lovely inside. Always heard of the restaurant but never been. Good food a little pricy I really love the lamb and plantains. 
14631 0 Avoid this Starbucks location at all costs! This is a franchise Marriott unit, but the line was insanely long. The staff does not seem to care about customer satisfaction at all. Stay away unless you want to wait more than 40 minutes for your morning brew! 
14632 4 total mouth boner, do yourself a favor and getcha some. 
14633 4 Love Chik fil a, and this little airport stop was perfect before my boyfriend and I flew back to a land of no Chik fil a's or sweet tea! Only draw back is this one doesn't have the spicy chicken sandwich! 
14634 2 for a chain restaurant this place is decent value, atmosphere and service....if you like chains. 
14635 3 Been to Fuji numerous times over the years and it is great! Nice bar seen. fresh sushi and good service. Drinks are delish and my friends and I had a great time. 
14636 0 There were maybe 8 tables in the restaurant, yet the waitress was too busy talking to her buddies to assist us. Food was horrible! My daughters honey bbq wing sauce tasted spoiled, and the Thai curry sauce was sour, not sweet as the menu synopsis stated. Yuck! 
14637 4 Not much else to say other than that this is the most expansive liquor store this side of Boston. If you are looking for anything they will most likely have it. 
14638 1 You pay extra for parking. $10.00. The shower was very short and had to stoop. The bathroom only had a half a roll of TP and no backup... Bed was comfortable. Room clean. 
14639 4 Seasons 52 is a top place. Great atmosphere,good food, okay service. Will be back 
14640 2 Atmosphere is good for meeting up with some friends, but the food was not the best compared to its price point. Would go again just to hang out but not necessarily for the food. 
14641 4 Went here for the first time, the food was delicious and very generous portions. The service was also very quick and helpful. Will be going here a lot from now on! 
14642 1 Had a very disappointing experience. Ordered three salads to go. The lettuce wasn't fresh and the chicken sharwma was dry and the portion of meat.was small. Previous visits where much better. Hopefully this is a one time aberration. 
14643 2 Good location to spend drinking and mingling with friends. I ordered a burger , medium well to be specific, got a well done. Manager replaced it , no questions asked. He was polite enough and kept saying sorry. Would come back for drinks, not for food def. 
14644 4 Definitely a nice salon. It's clean and friendly. Everyone's very nice and the stylists really listen, and also help you make decisions. Great cut and color. 
14645 3 Excellent Burger, I had the Cowboy and good service. Good place to watch the game with friends, lots of big TV's. 
14646 4 GREAT REAL Italian restaurant. Fresh dough and ingredients. Very happy with lunch 6.99 12" cheese pizza and drink combo and 7.99 12" 5 topping pizza and drink combo's!! 
14647 1 First impressions here not really wow at all... chow mein don't feel like it was cooked right portions are very small felt like cattle coming in and out. .. I have to ask for your cookie..lol 
14648 3 Quesion fundido: awesome. Rajas poblanas puffy taco: awesome. Pork chili verde: good enough. Bourbon burro cocktail: fantastic. I'll definitely be back to try more stuff. 
14649 4 Ramen. How 1999. Get the soba. And yes, the word bukkake appears on the menu. 
14650 4 Great food and service. I sometimes want to go and just order a mound of their delicious fries. Really though, everything on the menu is good that I have tried. I never came her for their cocktail drinks though. 
14651 4 Loves Amber! She's very personable, patient and knowledgable! So far, I've only gotten relaxer but I know I'll be back for more of her varies styling options including braids and weaves. I went back for twists! Amber does it all folks! 
14652 4 Cold bibimbap? A shop with an unusual menu. But I ate hot things like chiki, (laugh) Beer is very delicious! Chijimi (pancake) was fluffy, it was really delicious like a pancake ~ It's easy to live near the station so I will repeat it! 
14653 2 I'm always waiting even though I make appointments. My second time I had to wait 30mins. Robyn the tech is really nice and does a great job, but I'm hesitant to return due to the long wait. 
14654 0 Disgusting! I went 12/20/2016 and paid 13.00 for food that I waited forever for. The rice was not fully cooked. Shrimp was raw in spots and steak was so over cooked. I wouldn't feed that to my dog! Needless to say I won't be back. 
14655 0 Got dinner here General tso with fried rice This place seemed good Till my brother throw up all his food! Gross 
14656 2 Free WiFi ... a great place to read, surf and catch up on correspondence while having a cup of coffee. Lots of old school house seating out in the front and in the back room. 
14657 4 Off the beaten path, this local establishment has quite the spread. Freddy does it up right! The clam chowder, lobster rolls, clams and crab were outstanding! They also make a heck of a deli sandwich! This was worth the drive! 
14658 3 Fantastic food, large portions, attentive service, nice ambience. The korma is my favorite. I don't like spicy food, and they always prepare mine mild as requested. Tried the buffet once and didn't enjoy the selection. 
14659 4 Omg omg omg!!! I wish we had this cafe in California. The atmosphere is fabulous, the food is AMAZING! I got the combo (soup, main dish and a desert) everything was a top notch!!! Such a great place! A must go when visiting Vancouver ! 
14660 4 Adorable and trendy restaurant. Had the best butternut squash soup ever. Fabulous silver fire margarita, not too sweet but with a kick. My husband discovered a new wine here that we both love. Nice atmosphere. Love this place. 
14661 4 Lovely little park to soak up some sun and have a picnic! An umbrella or small tent might be wise if you're fair skinned or bringing babies though since you won't have much luck finding shade. 
14662 3 You can occasionally find some really cute and unique gifts here, but sometimes I feel like it is just really overpriced However, it is one of my important stops during the holidays because they do have a good selection of small, sampler goodies that can round out a weak gift. 
14663 4 Abid and his staff at headrush are friendly and great at what they do. They are all very talented which means that you will get a consistently good cut without having to wait for one particular person. Prices are reasonable (even can be considered cheap). 
14664 0 This place sucks. And a gross girl with the nasty arm tattoo is rude. Yelling at me because she "called me for my sweet potato fries three times" I was seated outside.... really dumb crew with overpriced crap food taste like spiced old meat from torchys down the road. 
14665 4 Im a fan! The food is so fresh and tasty 
14666 4 You'll leave with a flawless manicure. Every time I've come they've been detail oriented and meticulous 
14667 4 They put together a great birthday arrangement and made a quick delivery (it was even past their cut-off time). Great customer service and attention to details. Will certainly use again! 
14668 4 Truly stellar pizza. One of the top 2 in town, in my opinion. They now pull their own mozzarella and it was amazing on the Margherita. It was a perfect Neapolitan pizza. And very reasonably priced. 
14669 3 My mom and I stopped in for a quick drink while I was waiting for my flight back home. Our waitress was kind and attentive, and the drinks were tasty. I'd love to stop in for dinner next time I'm in town! 
14670 4 I was pleasantly surprised on the quality and great taste of this small restaurant; it was almost like being home in New York! 
14671 4 People working there are SO NICE!!!! They have wifi, cool food/snack options and good coffee. Done. 
14672 3 I could not believe how very good the food was. We happened upon this place while traveling and suffering through traffic. When they told us it was cafeteria style we almost left, I'm glad we didn't. The food was awesome and the staff very pleasant. 
14673 0 I know somebody who was a waitress at another Applebee's and she confirmed that their food (at all locations) is FROZEN. AND MICROWAVED. The bread that they give you with your meal is that Texas Toast that you buy in the frozen section of the grocery store. C'MON! 
14674 4 Great experience. Wonderful food and great selection of in house brews. We will definitely come back the next time that we are in town. 
14675 3 The chicken is great with a nice crispy crust and a great level of juiciness. The Cole Slaw is finely chopped with a nice sauce that's not too creamy. 
14676 0 Showed up here during hours and the place is closed. If they are no longer operating they should update their website to say so. 
14677 4 What a charming little cupcake shop. We sampled 6 small cupcakes and they were all delicious. Perfect blend of flavors. Even if cupcakes aren't your thing, this place might change your mind. 
14678 3 not going to win any style points but the food is cheap, plentiful and delicious. six bucks for a (seemingly) two pound plate of curry. The cashier asked if I wanted a sprinkling of cilantro...I almost cried. happy tears. 
14679 4 The only Bubble Tea parlor in Vancouver which made it's tea with REAL fruit pulp. They even had obscure fruits like kiwi, dragonfruit, starfruit and other offbeat pulps. Pupils dilated by their excellent beverages, I sought to think if there might be a like-place in Seattle. Probably not. 
14680 0 This place is THE WORST! The rooms are dingy and old. It needs to be renovated ASAP...The rooms smell disgusting. The lighting is Sooo dim! This is one place I would never come back to. Yuck! 
14681 4 Still the best place around to get pizza. Don't let the bar scare you off, the food is worth it. 
14682 4 Love the quick service and consistent fried shrimp and catfish at great prices! *! Definitely recommend the great seafood 
14683 2 Not bad tacos but the only thing going on for this place is that they have a liquor license. You can watch the Canuck games, drink and eat $3 tacos. 
14684 1 Excellent food. Insanely attentive service. Unfortunately it gets way too loud inside. Deafening. We couldn't carry on a conversation and we left with a headache. And we are not senior citizens! They really need to address the noise level before we would recommend the place to others. 
14685 4 Consistently great neighborhood restaurant with excellent sushi, sizzling bim bop and great service. 
14686 3 Triple berry pie was delicious, the lox on a bagel was AMAZING. Wish there was more seating because it gets really crowded, but when you find a good seat the free wi-fi makes for a nice office away from the office. 
14687 3 Ordered a half n half pizza for carry out. Half pepperoni and half peppers with tomatoes, it was made properly and on time. The crust lacked in flavor and thickness so I had to knock off a star. Cheap pizza, taste good but not great. 
14688 4 This place is awesome. Maria is the best. Kind, thorough, excellent service. Thanks so much. I would not use anyone else. :-) 
14689 4 Breakfast is my favorite meal. Lucille's is my favorite place to eat breakfast anywhere in the world! I can write no stronger review. 
14690 0 Definitely not what I expected (from the show). They only have cupcakes and cookies. And a few pathetic looking cakes. Service is standard Mall service and people there "just doing their job" Not overly friendly. I walked out 
14691 0 Would love to say this is urgent care. I would rather go to an ER. WHO WANTS TO WAIT OVER 2 hours to see a doctor about swimmers ear???? 
14692 3 Been a customer here for a few years now. Yummy food, never stale, friendly service, and is delivery and take out. I suggest the garlic chicken rice and all the appetizers. If your not into spicy, dont get the tom yum, there is plenty of other deliciousness on the menu. 
14693 4 I got a baguette sandwich to go for the train today. More than anything I would have spent on the train but so so much better. I feel a lot happier knowing I ate much better than anybody else on this whole train. Good service to. 
14694 1 Good prices, but rude pharmacist. I'd rather go to another part of town or Fred Meyers. I've noticed this poor treatment several times since the store opened. 
14695 4 Great Burger, service, and atmosphere! Such a great place to grab lunch or a drink before a game! 
14696 0 I ordered a hot grass jelly milk tea , Luke warm drink with few piece of grass jelly doesn't worth to paid $4.75 , I won't come and recomanded here 
14697 4 Tried this location immediately after they opened. Brisket and ribs had great flavor. I love BBQ and have also been to Blacks in Lockhart. It is difficult for me to say who is better. The flavor and tenderness of the meat at this Austin BBQ restaurant was outstanding! 
14698 4 Just a great pizza delivered! Timely and still hot, with a thin and chewy crust. Really reasonable prices too! 
14699 4 It was all great. They weren't happy with my discount coupon so don't whip those out before its time to pay! :p 
14700 2 Pretty decent restaurant for large groups. They turn the tables fairly quickly and have a full bar. Food quality is fairly average but better than some of the other high volume breakfast spots in town. Nice kids play area outside which is a bonus. 
14701 3 Cheesiest breakfast taco I've had in Austin. Nice job! 
14702 4 Olivia and her instructor were very caring and professional. I was more nervous than she as I had her cut off about 7 inches. It turned out great! 
14703 3 A great atmosphere for studying. The space accommodates for collaboration or room to spread out and work. It is a very positive and productive space that provides amazing lattes to fuel the mind! I can't wait to come back and try more 
14704 4 It might seem a little intimidating if you're unfamiliar with Russian cuisine, but the woman at the front counter took the time to explain the difference between the different Russian pastries and also let me know about how long each dish would take since I was on a time crunch. 
14705 4 Fantastic food, quick and friendly service, clean building and eating area. Highly recommended! Siam curry (moms recipe) was fantastic 
14706 3 California Burrito in FL, as weird as it sounds taste great and I was in Cali a week ago so my palette hasnt been "cleansed" as yet. Not as big like in Cali but just as if not more flavorful. 
14707 0 Not upset just disappointed. We waited over an hour for rolls and a few apps. The fish and soy sauce had little flavor and the rolls were very very small. Left hungry and sad :( 
14708 4 We've been here twice with friends of ours and enjoyed their food both times. Their crab shanghai soup dumplings are excellent, and the green onion pancakes, curry beef, singapore noodles were also great. Must try. Also, reservations recommended if you don't want to wait. 
14709 2 Service is friendly here but the food is over-priced for what you get. They don't even give you chips and salsa when you sit down. I believe there are many Mexican restaurant alternatives nearby that I rather try. 
14710 2 Steak Tips are good Pizza is good chicken cutlet is good Scicilian pizza is awesome. Deliveries are speedy employees are courteous it's your average sub shop. Decently priced, good food. 
14711 3 One of my favorite diners in Boulder, just gave it 4 stars being so far out of the way being out near Valmont & 119. Food is always very good, and service is fast. 
14712 4 Excellent food. Very authentic Costa Rican food. We thought it would be similar to Mexican food but it has it's own unique flavor. The BBQ chicken is definitely a winner! 
14713 4 This place has the best hotel gym/fitness centre I have ever seen. It's pretty much a full gym. Spin class room, group fitness studio, lots of weight machines and free weights, lots of cardio machines, a core training area, steam room, and a locker room. 
14714 4 This is my once a week go to. Love this place! My friend ordered level 20 today, and her nose is still running. When they say Ultra Spicy, they mean Ultra Spicy! 
14715 4 This is our first Spanish restaurant experienced and we weren't disappointed! Food was more than amazing. The patata bravas and arros negre definitely got us and we'll be coming back for more tapas!! * the shrimp was ok, compared to the other two tapas we ordered :)) 
14716 3 Such a cute place with great flavors! I enjoyed their rum raisin one a lot- def recommend it! 
14717 4 WOW!!! By far the most fabulous coffee in Austin!! The Full Moon Latte is the tastiest treat EVER!!! If you are in Austin and you like coffee, just DO IT!!! This is a must try, as its the most unique and delicious coffee I've ever had!!! 
14718 4 Drove here from Houston first time in town and wanted something good and causal. I'm so Glad I came here. The food here is amazing. I had the Moco Loco and the Ahi poki.... my goodness. 
14719 0 Four attempts to contact over the period of a month. 3 calls, 1 email. No response, ever. Seriously? 
14720 3 the chilaquiles here are pretty good the burrito is legit one of the best veggie options in all of atlanta and real talk: one time I was eating on their patio and owen wilson walked by 
14721 4 Love this place! When I asked if they offered some of my favorites that weren't on the menu out of curiosity, they went out of their way to get me what my palette desired. I'll definitely send my friends here when they want to try a great new Indian spot. 
14722 4 Seriously the NICEST staff. Super kind and helpful people. And great coffee. Loads of space. Awesome cafe. 
14723 4 Great food at reasonable price. We went Friday night and got table immediately. Food came out quickly, waiters on hand for drink refill. Would definitely come back. 
14724 4 Tony and Tina are awesome owners and have done a great job with the store. Great prices, clean and always neat new things! 
14725 0 Skip this place! Worst manicure experience ever! On top of that I paid $50 for the worst gel manicure I have ever had. This place is tiny and Loud, no relaxation! The lady who rushed through my manicure, coughed on me and was shouting The entire time. 
14726 0 The music does not stop until at least 2am and is obnoxious which is crazy as right next door Torched Hop which seems to be a more respectful to its neighbors .. this club is ridiculous w bums sleeping outside daily... 
14727 4 Worth the hype! If you are in the mood for a good burger, then this is the place for you to go. The lines can be a bit daunting, but the staff does a good job to move them fast. 
14728 4 I go to bartaco at least once a week because the food is that good! Sesame ribeye tacos and guac and corn and plantains and gorditas! Pretty much anything on the menu is amazing! 
14729 4 Killer food, one of the most dog-friendly spots I've been to in PDX yet. Good prices, better Mac and cheese. 
14730 3 Really nice place. Great atmosphere. Wish there were more parking spots. Some of the servers are clueless. But overall a really nice place :) 
14731 4 Good schwarma. Dang good. While the restaurant is small, the food it provides is delicious and ethnic. Plus, the price is affordable for what you get. 
14732 4 Easily top 10 meals of my life. Do the tasting menu. Let them tell you what's up. Eat it. Love it. The drink pairing is worth it. The ambiance is awesome. Casual. Vibey. 
14733 4 Their fresh fruit bubble teas are amazing! The best part is that they have no sugar option! I personally don't like the powder ones.. they are too sweet and not as tasty! My favourite is mango/avocado and papaya/cantaloupe with regular pearls. 
14734 4 BEST PLACE EVER! The guy's are nice and they always cook up some chicken to feed my pups. :) 
14735 4 Always Awesome food and the best burgers! Lines are long, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. :) 
14736 3 Not fussy or pretentious. Well executed simple Greek/Canadian good. Chicken souvlaki was nicely cooked. Very moist. Restaurant doesn't look like much from outside, but it's a nice family feel on the inside. However, not as inexpensive as you'd think it would be. 
14737 0 Horrible service, food, and wait times. Management at it's worst is the definition here, the head manager here did NOT care for the customer and maintains a dirty and slow work environment. 
14738 3 First of all food was very good , but like others posted service was poor. Got seated pretty quick then once we did we had to wait and watch others getting served before us that got seated after us. Teach your staff better or hire new ones 
14739 4 triviaoke...Monday night...Dan "the worlds greatest trivia MC"- the Karaoke on Monday nights will get you pregnant...girls bring your birth control! 
14740 4 Great experience with Paradise, Martin, and his team. Thank you very much and we'll be back in the future. 
14741 0 This restaurants need not represent Jamaica or Caribbean, and refrain from using both terms in their company This food is nasty 
14742 2 I was staying at the Lowes so I popped down to the bar for a quick meal. I got the flat bread and calamari. Both were good but neither were stand outs. Service was great, and the bar had a classy low key vibe. 
14743 4 Great food. Great prices. Some of the best Borracho beans in Austin. The lunch special is also probably the best value for a weekday work lunch. 
14744 2 The food is WAY overpriced for the quality of the food. Pretty bad actually and lacking fresh flavor. The margaritas on the other hand are ON POINT. I got some spicy One and it was incredible. Vegetarian warning: I was told that the tomatillo salsa has chicken stock in it! 
14745 4 Friendly chef who catered to my nephew who is very young and nervous with the hibachi style cooking. Food was fabulous! Was disappointed hat they didn't have the sherbet after the meal, that's the best part!! 
14746 3 Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere. They have a mariachi band come play for you. Just make sure you get the right order and if you don't read Spanish, make sure you know what some stuff is. I will definitely return though! 
14747 4 Fantastic service. Punctual, prompt, professional - will certainly use again and highly recommend! 
14748 2 Food is delicious but the service is piss poor and the building is filthy. It's like walking in wet tar when you step into the restaurant. Enjoy the ham, hopefully the lack of cleanliness doesn't kill you. 
14749 3 Very good food all around. The dishes taste fresh with unique favors. I feel like I am eating very healthy when I eat here. One of my favorite Chinese restaurants. 
14750 4 This hotel was awesome. The staff was beyond amazing, and the 2-bedroom room we had was absolutely perfect. As for location, the Residence Inn seemed to be in the best spot possible. We stayed for two nights and would definitely go back without considering another hotel. 
14751 4 been going to various legals locations for over 40 years. it's the best seafood restaurant ever. no, it ain't cheap but the service is superlative and the preparation is without compare. best clam chowda, great cherrystones, they made a custom seafood salad for my wife...I could write a book. 
14752 2 Go for the Roasted Chicken Breast, great meal. Avoid the beef, not worth the cost. Overall good place if your at Wilderness Lodge 
14753 3 Good thai food. Big portions for good prices. Ambience is very nice & decor is stylish! Great place for a date night or just a nice family dinner. 
14754 4 Made me feel very welcome and really took her time:-) Gel French mani came out amazing!! 
14755 4 this place is excellent ... great coffee drinks and the people working there know their shit .. like at Octane !! do yourself a favor and get some of the sugared home made mini doughnuts !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you will thank me later .... 
14756 0 Menu and food quality was changed and is getting worse, poor service quality, servers are not friendly and no experience enough to work there Very upsetting 
14757 3 Decided to try here after seeing so many reviews. The food was good. We got the Co qui van (?) chicken dish and the bouillabaisse (mussels) and it was pretty tasty. Far as being a frequent diner... Hmm, not sure, will try more places in boulder.... 
14758 4 Long wait, good food. Worth the time. Awesome burgers and shakes. The samplers were good too. 
14759 2 It looks cooler driving by than it actually is when you stop in. My advice, stop once to satisfy your curiosity and at least buy an orange to support this Mom-and-Pop shop. 
14760 4 Not only is the food AMAZING, the staff is exceedingly nice and attentive. My favorite lunch place... 
14761 4 Good food and outdoor seating, and not too too expensive. Our waitress was extremely nice and welcoming. The food was great too! Definitely would suggest the Italian chicken salad 
14762 3 Went here because our usual vote place was closed, pleasantly surprised, good foot, good service, can't complain 
14763 0 This place is a dump, complete pompous rudeness and inflated prices. The menu claims to be Canadian culture, but is far from it. 
14764 4 Claim of having the world's best sundae truly do not disappoint. May be pricey, but it is worth every penny (and maybe more)! 
14765 0 Didn't get a chance to use his services, he didn't show up for the estimate. no call or anything. If they are like this in the beginning I'm glad I didn't hire them. 
14766 4 We have never brought our puppy here. But we did today .. the staff was so friendly.. the food was so good .. we will definitely be back. They are so nice even when my clumsy puppy spilled water .. 
14767 4 This is the only place where I am bringing my shoes for repairs. No matter what needs to be done Vadim is doing the BEST job ever! Quality of the soles and heels is awesome and shoes look like brand new after being repaired. Highly recommend this place. 
14768 4 Fresh, great quality from the burger to the bun, veggies were crisp!! Taste GREAT....making me want one right now!!! Drinks ample, prices more than fair.....only trouble......LONG lines to get it.......obviously most folks have the same 5 Star opinion. 
14769 0 Got two sandwiches the pork and the pulled chicken. Pulled pork was ok but the the pulled chicken is terrible! It is so bad that it makes the the whole experience 1 star. Don't get the chicken. 
14770 2 Wow, 20+ years since I'd last been and it's exactly the same. I guess that's good? Had a business meeting with an Alston Bird lawyer and the ambiance was actually more suited to meeting that my Houston's meeting! Kick ass peach cobbler! 
14771 1 Literally the worst service I've ever experienced, sure they were busy but none of the employees were even polite and the food was sub par 
14772 4 I have not had ice cream sundaes as delicious as Ghirardellis! I had the traditional hot fudge sundae but with chocolate ice cream. My daughter had the brownie Sundae with chocolate ice cream. Both were amazing! Couldn't believe we ate the entire sundae. Ice cream fans must try Ghirardelli ! 
14773 4 If you like burgers this is your spot. Non greasy mess like most spots. Had a medium rare Wisconsin cheddar, local(slab)bacon, LTO, with smoked paprika mayo. Great beer selection as well. 
14774 4 Best restaurant in Titusville! The broiled rock shrimp is a show stopper. If you are passing through Titusville you must stop. Only a few minutes off of 95 Exit 220. 
14775 0 Bleh. Yes it's fried chicken but not very great. Generic flavor and really no seasoning on the outside. If your going to be unhealthy at least have a product with good flavor. I would take Publix, KFC, or Popeyes fried chicken over this place. 
14776 4 Very friendly and excellent service! The food was authentic and extremely flavorful. Turkish coffee was perfect and came with instructions. Great experience! 
14777 4 Love the hand pulled noodle love the lamb on a stick love the tea egg. Hope they can serve Xi an style salad like Dongbei Da ban cai or Xin Jiang da ban cai. 
14778 3 Great little shop on the mall. They have nearly anything culinary which is great. The coffee selection seems to have dwindled. Though definitely worth stopping in to check their unique selection of goods. 
14779 2 Highly priced and not that great...just a donut, I've had better at mom and pop places. Not knocking the attempt, but for as much effort they put in, it seems you have to apply the same to eat one...if it's not sold out. 
14780 3 Delicious. Everyone raves about the sauces, and those were up to par. It's difficult to find, but the staff is pleasant. I still prefer Gus's World Famous fried chicken, as this chicken wasn't as crispy. I'd compare the chicken to Chik-fil-a chicken strip texture, as opposed to KFC. 
14781 4 A Vancouver staple. Tasty, crispy dosas and no-nonsense service. It's the sort of old faithful place that you can go to and know you will leave totally full and comforted by the fact that some good things don't change. Also, paneer 65 will blow your mind. 
14782 4 Super helpful staff, owner is a pillar of sw portland community. I've always found great gifts here for the ladies in my life. 
14783 4 I love Stella! Food is fresh and light and so tasty. Pretty good prices, too. Service has always been very good. I've been here a few times and have always had a great experience. No complaints! 
14784 2 Food is good!!!! Waiters are very very friendly and attentive! Their soda fountain is bom!!! 
14785 4 Personally my experience with Virgin was great, the people are super friendly and helpful. You can see that the company treat their people well and in turn we as a customer receiving good treatment. In flight entertainment is good, seats are comfortable. $3 headphones actually of very decent quality, surprisingly. 
14786 2 Cute place, and adequate Gelatto. But certainly not the best in terms of flavor or quality in town. 
14787 4 I purchased a groupon for zoom whitening and I am very happy with the results. The appointment was fast and the staff and dentist were all great and took time to explain everything. 
14788 3 This is my one of my all time go to Italian places in Atlanta. The menu lineup is wonderful and the service is pretty good, too. More than anything the ambience is what draws me into to, be honest. A solid choice for date and even business dinners. 
14789 4 Our favorite Chinese buffet in Orlando Every time we visit Orlando, we are definitely coming to enjoy unique food here, 
14790 4 I love this place! The happy hour is great, the food is consistently delicious, and the service is good, too. For lunch or dinner, I highly recommend it. 
14791 4 Food was good I got the baby back ribs they were fall off the bone good service price was good 
14792 1 Having an appointment here is useless. I waited 25 minutes past my appointment today and this is not the first time this has happened. Additionally, people without appointments or who arrived after me were taken care of first. A manicure and pedicure took well over 2 hours as a result. 
14793 4 Third time there and still very impressed with the consistently good food and service. Wood oven pizza is outstanding. The short rib tortellini is great. Place is crowded for a good reason. 
14794 2 The food was okey for the price. But seems the chief was so amateur. Big pieces of herbs and peppers. No balance in spices. And no nuts in biryani or kheer. Worth to try it only once! 
14795 4 Hugo (the bartender) was awesome! He was a gas to talk to and made excellent beer recommendations. The Shipwreck pumpkin beer was awesome with the cinnamon rim. Also, Hugo, you were right that the trip to Framingham wasn't worth it. It was novel but not worth a days drive! 
14796 3 I'd never had cuban before but we got the slow roasted pork and it was fantastic. We capped it off with the tres leches cake and I must admit it was heavenly. I will go there again SEVERAL times! 
14797 4 Fluffy clouds of juicy lamb and beef kebabs. Fast friendly service with big bites and puny prices. I don't know how Victor get's his lighter than air kebabs to defy gravity, but no trip to the food trucks would be complete without them. Believe the hype. 
14798 3 Food is really good. Got Benzino's sauce on the crab and it was a great choice. A nice gesture are the gloves they give you. The only critique is the tea. They need a new recipe because it's not the typical "sweet tea"! 
14799 2 The food was good, but the service was not so good. We always come here and normally have had a good experiences. The server today appeared more into her conversation with the other staff then making sure the customers had what they needed. 
14800 3 You sit down, pick you selection... Order everything on the menu (more or less).. They bring it out and you ponder how you could ever finsh everything that was ordered... 2 hours later.... you wonder where did it all go... 
14801 4 The best tacos I have found in Austin so far. Get the al pastor and enjoy! 
14802 4 Great coffee! Better than Starbucks. Lots of flavor choices you won't find elsewhere 
14803 4 Olive Garden at the Kissimmee location on Osceola Parkway is my favorite. Great staff, always awesome food and the drinks are so tasty! Check out my Mai tai! Excellent! 
14804 3 I know people complain about the smell in the elevators...but I've been taking them and I haven't had an issue. They have been clean and prompt...no bad smells setting off my morning sickness. 
14805 4 Barking Crab is the best! The atmosphere is unlike any in the city and the food is great. It's the perfect place for drinks after work or a casual date night. The lobster roll is a must try! 
14806 3 Great location but very busy. Excellent staff. The food was good and the baby enjoyed hers. That's about it. 
14807 2 Go for the after-work for the 3-for-3 appetizer specials. 3 tasty lamp chops, 3 nice-sized cocktail shrimp, 3 sliders... plus others, all for $3. But stick with those, they were the best ones. Not a fan of this place as a weekend/night-time spot. 
14808 3 It's been awhile since I have dined at Gators. I must saay the new menu is awesome. Mercedes was our server and she is a great addition to the staff. 
14809 4 Service equally as good as the food made for great experience. Excellent ambiance great place for romantic dining. Mat and Billy were very professional going above and beyond of what you would expect. 
14810 2 Great bagels and friendly staff. Would have given 4 stars, but it wad wsy too chilly inside so hsrd to enjoy food when you are cold. 
14811 4 Great little find. Some of the best Tex-mex I've ever had. We were all impressed. Certainly helped that it was just minutes from our hotel. My only regret is that I didn't get the guacamole with our chips. The tortilla soup was delicious and loaded with strips of tortilla. 
14812 0 ugly don't name your drinks after immigrants! typical tone deaf portland. and choose better beers! 
14813 4 These guys have an awesome beer selection and great sales. Their staff is knowledgeable and let you know they are available to help without being pushy. I'm going to be sad when I move and they aren't close to me anymore. 
14814 0 The owner can keep his house and his rules. You would be a fool to eat the garbage they call food. It's a joke and a sorry excuse for a restaurant. 
14815 3 In Atlanta and need celebrity brows and lashes check out Jazmine! Great experience especially the wine and champagne! Oh, and that's without an appointment. Thanks Jamie for my great brows! 
14816 4 Baked Mac & Cheese is the best I've ever had. The facility is nice, service was great & we came on a PACKED Saturday night. 
14817 3 The sushi was fantastic. As were the appetizers. Out waitress was friendly and attentive and the kitchen staff was courteous and polite. I recommend checking out Happy Hour from 5-7 for some GREAT deals on rolls and drinks. I will be going back very soon. 
14818 4 A big shout out to Catherine's Auto Repair for being so honest and reliable. Being new to a city and finding a mechanic to trust is not easy. I will recommend you guys to my friends and will definitely be a returning customer if I need future work! 
14819 1 Currently staying at this hotel. Although the rooms are nice, the staff seems very confused with multiple miscommunications. There are several restaurants in this hotel but they are never open. It's just very strange that such a nice place is this badly put together. 
14820 4 This place is SO good. A friend recommended that I try it instead of Voodoo, and I'm glad he did. The pear and pine nut fritter was amazing. 
14821 4 Quick affordable and friendly. Five other people were ahead of me and they still saw me within 10 minutes. There's also plenty of seating in the shade. Great experience all around. 
14822 4 Wonderful stop on a drive from Oregon to California 
14823 4 food is healthy and delicious! a little expensive at times, but service and food make up for it! layout is great, I love that their soda fountain has soda sweetened with natural sugar cane instead of high fructose corn syrup!! 
14824 4 In all fairness, this is my alternate address. I love the coffee, it is a brand new building and I live next door. Great treats, nice music, lots of space, and a great view. 
14825 3 I had Time Square, and it was great!! Never had beaf tongue in sandwich, but I really like it! I accidentally found this place, kind a small and clean. I guess popular for locals. 
14826 3 I would have given them 5 stars but they forgot my tea. The waitress said they were in the middle of service. She offered me my tea but it was too late. I was done eating. Food was good. I'll definitely comeback here. 
14827 2 Good place for a quick in and out wax. Clean environment, nice ladies that work there and a great no tipping policy. You can book your services online and price depends varying on the level of experience. I've been happy with the outcome after each visit. 
14828 3 I can put these tacos down like tic-tacs... one of the greatest taco places you can go 
14829 0 Went to print shop area to print and bind materials. Service was poor and attendant made no effort to accommodate simple requests. Once is enough for me to never go back. Found a motivated local printer. 
14830 3 Great local place for seafood. Consistently busy but you can reserve a table in advance up to 30 min prior. 
14831 4 Ho Ho BBQ: a Haiku Long review needless Tasty grub to fill tummy Pork and rice delish! 
14832 4 I like that this is a small family owned place. They make really Great pizza and salads. 
14833 2 I only ever get the slushees here WITHOUT boba - their tapioca balls taste very very meh. If you want chewier, tastier options, you might have to make the trek to Kung Fu Tea in Allston. Also this place is cash only. 
14834 1 Taking 30-40 minutes every single time to deliver a sandwich right down the street is not even close to "freaky fast". 
14835 4 Best burgers in Austin. They grind their own beef and support local ranchers. They bake their own bread and churn their own ice cream. Just a few of the great things about it. The Nutella and Chocolate pretzel shake is delicious. 
14836 4 Food was better than expected. I had the fish and beans and rice. Convenient location is in midtown and I got my take out in less than 10 min. Will be back for more. 
14837 4 We worked with Scott and Trask when purchasing our new car. They were both courteous and professional! Awesome guys:) 
14838 3 The food and wine we're amazing! The restaurant is very cozy and warm. The service was mediocre. If Jennifer is your server try to get seated somewhere else. She was unfriendly and inattentive. I would give this place another shot in hopes of better service. 
14839 1 The decor hasn't been updated since 1992. The food is overpriced for what it is. Don't recommend. 
14840 4 The place had a great atmosphere with an inside/outside bar and very interesting drinks. The interior is unique. Those working there are extremely friendly and fun. We had a party of five, all with different meals, and we were all satisfied with our choices. I say go eat here now! 
14841 4 Had a beerita, torta, and a breakfast item. All were amazing. Their chips and service were awesome too. There was a wait, but the wife and opted for a bar seat, which had us seated immediately. The ambiance was good. Just nothing negative to report. Prices were great. 
14842 3 Cheap and very good sushi place. I have been buying Sushi there for 3 years now. I would highly recommend it. The only negative side is that it's very small and at the rush hour times eating in would be almost impossible as the place will be packed. 
14843 3 I was really happy with this place! The service was perfectly friendly and fast, the food was fresh and tasty. I got a shredded beef burrito enchilada style (the #3). It was very filling! Their green sauce is possibly the best I've ever had and the salsa was also yummy! 
14844 4 Got the migas and steak tacos... and they were EXCELLENT! Definitely worth it! If you're in Austin, TX, you need to make a stop here. 
14845 3 Boom... I love the Taetertot special. Rice with Tuna wrapped in egg for $1.25. Three bites of goodness and relatively cheap. That's how I like it. I'm a regular because of how easy it is to eat there when you don't have time! Thanks Sushi TOWN! 
14846 3 The only reason it doesn't get the 5th star is bc it's pretty expensive, but other than than that...delicious 
14847 4 Food was delicious! Pretty quick delivery and so easy to order and pay online. No complaints. Servings are huge too, it's ridiculous how much food you get. Will definitely order again! 
14848 4 Best. Donut. Ever. Skip the line at VooDoo and head to BlueStar for seriously amazing donuts. The Blueberry Basil Bourbon is my favorite, but have yet to find one that is not super delicious. 
14849 3 What a fun store! The clothes were strange, but the knick knacks, dishes, and furniture were cool! I got a couple of great items and plan to frequent this shop when I hunt for treasure! 
14850 4 Beautiful, efficient, well-run salon. Did a meticulous cut, couldn't have asked for a better experience. 
14851 0 Unprofessional, disorganized, got the wrong tacos and they blamed me for getting it wrong 
14852 2 I want to like this place a little more but it can be damn uncomfortable sometimes. 
14853 3 Pro's: -Great route-setters -Laid back atmosphere -Student discounts -Decent protein bar selection -Nice little climbing shop in entrance -Staff are always helpful Con's: -Very busy on weeknights -Slow route-refresh, go more than twice a week and you will quickly get bored -Crowded bathrooms with poor privacy 
14854 4 We really like eating here. They have great Pho! Fresh food. Hot soup. Nice employees. Always friendly and greets you with a smile. Never have had a bad experience. Always good! Highly recommended. I even chose to eat here for my birthday dinner. 
14855 1 Ok service, if you're not from here. Please makes sure to bring Canadian dollars they would not take us dollars I didn't want to use my card because my bank charges allot. 
14856 3 I've been coming to Lucille's since I was in college and it's never disappointed. The food is always super good and the beignets are pretty good too. It's probably some of the best Nola food that I've had outside of Nola. 
14857 4 Best restaurant in Portland. We've been here several times and have never been disappointed. The food is amazing, the staff wonderful and the decor stately. 
14858 4 Not gonna lie...I crave the chicken and waffle battered bites now. Good stuff! I should probably branch out sometime but for now...it's all i need :) 
14859 4 In short, Excellent food and great service. Was on a stop in Atlanta and starving, this place hit the spot. The food does take a little bit to come out, so if your in a hurry might want to check with hostess before being seated. 
14860 4 Delicious! Fried brussel sprouts with harissa. The best biscuits and gravy I've had in my entire life!!! 
14861 3 The breakfast buffet was delicious and fresh. Eggs and pancakes made to order, fresh fruit and juices, and a decent assortment of baked pastries and cereals. A little pricey even for Orlando, hence the 4 stars. Service was supreme! 
14862 0 I order a drink and could not finish it and I ask the server to pack my drink for to go, 5 mins later that server hand me a styrofoam box. 
14863 4 Damn right I'll wake up at 6am on a Sunday, drive up to Vancouver, and wait for a half hour for a solo seat at the bar. Cafe Medina rules. Waffle with raspberry caramel and a cassoulet, all the way. 
14864 2 This place is decent, I got delivery here a couple times, I have high standards for my pad see ew, and let me say that it's not one of the best I've had. Tried their appetizers but it wasn't anything memorable, but their delivery was real quick. 
14865 4 Hey cupcake! This place was quite amazing. I had a vanilla dream, my friend a 24-carrot, and we even got a Sweetberry for my friends mother that we are driving 7 hours back home. Just a warning the cupcakes are very sweet but well worth it. 
14866 0 In this circus of a dealership, they will waste your time, never follow up, hold your keys hostage if you've got a trade in... a very unpleasant place to do business. 
14867 4 All I can say is, they have a great selection of Classical and classic Country CDs! Trade-in is also a "plus". 
14868 3 Amazing beer and everyone that works here is so kind. Only down fall is that they don't have food but.... they allow you to bring your own or have it delivered. I love it! 
14869 4 Went for brunch. Clean, well-lit for fantastic food photos, and nicely decorated. Played some great music on vinyl. Donuts were to die for! 
14870 2 This place is a hostel people, not a five star hotel. You get what you pay for, plus free complimentary breakfast(s). Who can say no to free breakfast? 
14871 4 We had a great lunch. Burgers were huge and delicious with homemade pickles. The onion rings for the best we've ever had. Delicious spinach and beet salad. There's healthy choices here and the food is yummy and the staff is friendly 
14872 1 If you are looking for a place in nice area of town with loud MTV music playing, a very traditional menu and not-so-exciting food then this restaurant is for you. 
14873 3 very delicious food, but soda and water taste very much like chlorin. they have nice background musik and the american waitress was very helpful and attendive 
14874 4 Jessica Is the greatest! My baby goes to daycare here and always has a good time, I feel that he is safe and cared for all the time. 
14875 4 Simply the best. I've waited longer for fast food. That's no exaggeration. 10 minutes There's a reason Leal's has survived 20 years in ATX. I hope they get many many more years. I won't know what to do without them. 
14876 3 Fantastic service, great food. I got the Kansas City Strip steak and it was very well prepared, melted in my mouth. Yum! 
14877 3 Loved the show..for a first-timer the Helium maze to get to the Main Room was daunting, intimidating, and totally unnecessary. 
14878 4 I had the sandwich special which was flank steak with a small salad. It was great and way too much to eat. Service was impeccable. Highly recommended. 
14879 3 The food was great service could have been better and there was an issue with them not havering items on the menu 
14880 3 Interesting menu - really good food - casual vibe - but *expensive*. 
14881 4 Are here twice with my parents and the in laws. Neither time disappointed as both the service and food were excellent 
14882 1 Nice location, slow service and not so great wings. House ipa is good but not great. Tge please is too big and managements is MIA :( not recommend 
14883 4 My favorite place to eat every time i'm in Vinings. Thin crust pizza is amazing! The salads are always really fresh and if i'm in a pasta mood all i have to say is "Tri-Color Tortolini" mmmmm!!! Great staff and easy parking. 
14884 4 Best Falafel in town! These guys do a great job of delivering fresh, authentic Israeli food at a reasonable price. 
14885 4 Killer gyro and fries. Been here lots. Super nice owner and food value rocks. Can't go wrong with anything on menu. 
14886 4 i.love.this.place. the guys is super knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. plus, i got a free pen. sweeet. 
14887 2 The happy hour here used to be amazing, but it has since changed. It's still good, but I'm no longer enthusiastic. While this used to be the first place I took people from out of town, now it doesn't even make the list. 
14888 4 Since my April 2012 review, all of my concerns have been alleviated. Kudos to the management and staff for the positive turnaround. I am now a happy, regular customer of this Jimmy John's. 
14889 4 One of my faves and so many certified organic farms. Love the vibe of this market! 
14890 2 Sushi is OK. My wife's only sushi experience is the Bubba Roll and won't try other places, so we keep going there. 
14891 4 Delicious pastries and breads! I got the red bean mochi bun, the regular red bean bun, and assorted moon cakes. Everything was so good; not too sweet and all freshly baked. They have a great assortment, and I will definitely be back for the egg tarts and pork floss buns. 
14892 4 Can we just say "Yum!"? Cheddar Jack's is a cute little house look-a-like. They serve great food, and the servers are extremely sweet. It is our new Saturday tradition! 
14893 3 Wonderful service - very attentive. Food was good. Waiter let us add one crab cake to our order so kids could try crab. Kids loved it! Thank you! 
14894 3 The queso flameado is very good! and so is the grilled pork chop 
14895 4 NOT A MUSEUM but a interactive history tour. Kids had fun throwing tea boxes overboard (should have been real wooden crates) Mix of actors playing out history parts, touring ships and well produced video. A must if your visiting Boston and into a 'little' history. 
14896 2 The steak fajitas were awesome. Our server was nice and helpful also. The guacamole was fresh and tasty. The margarita wasn't the best in the world like the menu says but it was good. 
14897 2 The food was quite good as was the ambience. The service was very slow which was odd because it wasn't very busy. It was a little pricy but not to pricy for what you receive. Try the eggplant brownie it was the best part of the meal. 
14898 2 Not a terrible Hampton. Not the best though. - On the old side... hallways / elevator are dated - Bathrooms were tiny - Staff was not the best, rather slow for check in 
14899 4 GO FOR HAPPY HOUR!!!!!! My fiancé and I have never spent less than $25 at a sushi restaurant until now. AND for great sushi! So happy we found this spot in hunters creek 
14900 4 Truly AMAZING food!The most juicy kebabs I've ever had(don't remember having such tasty meat even in Turkey!) The beef Iskinder is delicious! A great place to experience great food, hospitality and live music. Will definitely keep coming! 
14901 3 My dog and I enjoyed our visit to this store. They have a lot of different gourmet treats for dogs. Friendly service was also a plus. Things are not cheap but I guess that comes with healthy pet treats. 
14902 3 There a lot of great bites on the tasting menu here. This restaurant is more of a social experience, if you go with a group I'd suggest ordering every item on the menu to share. 
14903 4 I think the food is delicious and staff are friendly. I have no complaints about this location. 
14904 4 This is the best place specially during summer evenings They do provide outer dining area , which is really beautiful Staff is very friendly .food and drinks are good 
14905 2 The food was fair. The service was fantastic.the price was fair. The atmosphere was excellent for a Thai restaurant 
14906 2 Some days you feel like eating A LOT. Well, this is the place to go on one of those days. It is not really a sophisticated gourmet option, yet a reasonably good all-you-can-eat. 
14907 4 Delicious crepes in conveniently located food truck! The man running the truck was extremely friendly. Will definitely come back :) 
14908 4 John is great; kind and informative; both I and my sister are happy customers at this shop. I remember when John's dad owned it; he was great to deal with as well; looks like he passed on his business skills to his son. Highly recommended. 
14909 4 Great customer service and fair pricing. They have a nice waiting area, and I was in and out faster than expected. 
14910 3 I had xiao long bao, fish and meat. All of them were really good. Also, my Chinese friends like this place very much. 
14911 3 Great staff, wonderful service. The wine list is top notch, and the wine by the bottle prices are pretty good as well. The steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and the side dishes were done well too. I highly recommend the Boulder Cork 
14912 3 Has just opened up recently downtown. Friendly staff quick service. Just only had a coffee and strudel today and it was as usual. The size of this location is smaller than other ones around it. 
14913 0 Ordered takeout on Grubhub. Never got any updates from the restaurant. Called the restaurant before closing 30 minutes after estimated delivery time and no answer. Food was never delivered. Enough said. 
14914 3 Service was great! Attentive and very friendly! Food was delicious! We had the vegetarian nachos and split a Big Rig! More than enough for two! Great happy hour prices too! Will come back again and for the music next time! 
14915 4 Wonderful, cooked to order food! Priced right and tucked away in the back of the parking lot. Look for it! 
14916 4 My favorite Bean dip ever!! We enjoy going there.The owner lupee really cares about the community. The server are friendly. Its like a big family. Its a must try. 
14917 3 We get pizzas, subs and various entrees from here pretty regularly. The pizza is pretty darn good, much better than the big chains and their delivery service is excellent. The rest of their fare is decent if not great. I definitely recommend them, especially for their pizza. 
14918 4 Best soul food "hole in the wall" restaurant in all of Atlanta! Been going here since I was a little girl. Nothing has changed. Same good ol southern home cooking. Eventually you become family and you may even see a celebrity! ;) 
14919 4 Andy our boat driver was amazing ! Super fun, informative, and had the best dad jokes! Also showed us thrill seekers a fun time ! Thanks Andy! 
14920 4 Probably one of the best burgers you can get in town! Great food, great place to watch a game. They also have fun events like wine tastings and bourbon. Family friendly and fun! 
14921 4 Hands down the most personable customer experience I've had in years, our server explained everything on the menu and let the experience be completely customizable. The food is beyond words, please try the cornbread. Extremely impressed, will be visiting in the future. 
14922 4 Try the lulu wrap. Amazing. I especially love the grilled pita. Can't wait to go back. 
14923 3 Delivered our king sized mattress & box spring from US Mattress. Scheduling was a breeze, they arrived on time, and they were friendly / careful. Would recommend them for a delivery. 
14924 3 This place serves very good Cantonese food, especially the roasted duck and the house fried rice. We also tried the salt and pepper squid which is also very good. 
14925 2 Really liked the atmosphere, great place to stop at for a bit. A good variety of games and decent drinks. I'd give this place 4 stars, but several of the games were out of service or had broken/missing controls. I still recommend checking it out if you haven't been yet. 
14926 4 Went with my friends last weekend and ordered Baozi(similar to wanton). Really reminded me what I used to eat in China! And the owner is hospitable too. Generally good experience! 
14927 4 Great food and service. Had wild salmon with beets and grilled Brussels Sprouts. Menu is awesome. 
14928 2 Alcohol, beer .BC Liquor Store is not a bad little bottle shop. I'd suggest with the addition of condiments for mixes (lime, lemon, olives etc) .. you could well be visiting a one stop shop when adding "nuts, chips" etc.. Cheers Big Ears 
14929 0 So let down. Food totally missed the mark - which unfortunately has been a theme. Cool place; but the food was also cool-no, cold. Time to move on... 
14930 4 Loved it. Party of three tried different burgers and really liked all three. Great onion rings good sweet potato tater tots. Nacho sat by us and was very friendly. Glad we took the ferry from Boston. 
14931 2 The people are always nice. The pizzas were fresh. The brownie was stuck to the bottom of the pan but all in all it was good. 
14932 3 My preferred airport parking. Most drivers are helpful and congenial, though there is the occasional grump. I am constantly dismayed at the customers who insist on putting their own bags onboard seemingly to avoid tipping. 
14933 3 Stuffed buffalo above the bar!! Not as in food but taxidermy. Points for that. Also, great margarita options. Always crowded but not skeezy. Young crowd in a good way. I'm a fan when there's room for me. 
14934 2 Very nice presentation and service. The americano is nice but I prefer a stronger/ bolder taste. 
14935 3 This show is VERY CHEESY. I love it, others may not. There are a few very cool effects and a very high energy tour guide/ actor. Totally worth it for me. 
14936 3 i have got take away from here many times. this is my closest indian joint. it's good, and consistent. haven't had a bad fish from this place. great pickles!!!! their naan is really awesome as well. i always get extra. 
14937 3 What can I say about 360 Pizza? Junior and his crew make the best pizza I've ever eaten in Austin. On top of that, Junior is the nicest guy in the world. Highly recommend. 
14938 4 I was in town for the Pro Bowl and took a group of six to B.B. Kings for dinner and music. We had a phenomenal experience. The waitress and bartender were awesome, the food was divine and the House band was really entertaining. I highly recommend this spot! 
14939 3 This place is usually busy, but they manage the crowd well. People cannot get a table until they have actually ordered. The burgers are unique and delicious, I had one of their salmon burgers. The fry orders are huge, so I would recommend sharing. 
14940 3 Decent diner, always friendly staff. Food isn't the greatest, but usually hits the spot when I crave diner food. Fresh OJ is excellent, portion puts me right to sleep. Kid friendly, although my baby daughter didn't enjoy the mascot bear walking around as much as I did :) 
14941 1 We didn't have a bad experience, it just wasn't a good one. The ingredients were slightly old, the food was spicy but bland, the wantons were doughy, the tofu was slimy, etc. There wasn't any one thing that stood out as awful, but I definitely won't be going back. 
14942 3 Great location in Austin. Quiet, relaxed atmosphere. Very good coffee, cappuccino and espresso drinks. I recommend the iced Americano. Creating a proper espresso based drink takes time, and they do it right. So sit back, relax and enjoy... Cheers! 
14943 4 Very profession insanely cheap compared to others I called and it didn't take very long. They actually wanted to help more than make money. 
14944 4 Great local beers with the whole range of types. Excellent menu. Totally friendly and local. Come and just be yourself! Kids are welcome until 8pm. Sit outside in warm weather. 
14945 4 So many flavors! Friendly staff and the most toppings I've ever seen. Entire fresh fruit section is my fave 
14946 1 I've been here twice and still think it's OK. The first time with my sister from Virginia. The second time with my significant other and a business colleague of his. Forgot what I ordered each time. I guess that means it was a forgettable experience, palate-wise! 
14947 4 Excellent food. Worth the wait. German pancakes are large. They don't mind if you split it between two kids. Coffee station is available while you wait... Which will be outside, standing probably because the place is so small. Always consistent quality. 
14948 3 Love this tourist trap. Right on the water. Close to the Childrens Museum. Wish they still had the crab rocks. 
14949 3 Yummiest ice cream I've found in Vancouver to date and I've been trying all the spots :) I really enjoyed the Whiskey Hazelnut. It was super creamy and had a lovely light whiskey flavour. It was full of crunchy fresh tasting hazelnuts. 
14950 3 Posto does some of the best italian appetizers Ive had since living in NYC.. It also boasts one of the best bartenders I've met in Boston! Sit at the bar with Ian !!! 
14951 2 They forget to put milk cap on my honey green tea. However I have try the Kung Fu Milk tea and it really good. The service and and store decoration is pretty. 
14952 4 Just as i had pretty much given up on round Table i visited the one in Milwaukee. My pizza was perfectly cook and flavoritful. The restaurant was clean and the associates friendly. They have lots of tv screens to watch your favorite game. GO JAGS 
14953 4 Great service! So gentle but very detail oriented. I usually end up with file cuts on my fingers at other places. Not one nic at this location. The ladies here are friendly, social, knowledgeable and most importantly, professional. Hands down best place ever! 
14954 3 Gotta love this place! Good ole neighborhood bar and the steak frites salad is to die for!! All the servers and bartenders and very pleasant and this place has awesome daily specials and even live music pretty often! 
14955 4 Great place to hangout with friends for pizza. Service is great and atmosphere is laid back and relaxed. 
14956 4 We had Mark power wash our roof a few months ago. He gave us a fair quote and did the job well. Would use him again! 
14957 3 Friendly, local cafe with very good food! Very pleasant staff. Was able to get a 1/2 portion to avoid waste. If I lived near here I'd be a regular 
14958 3 BTone offers a great workout that will leave you sore in places you never imagined! Instruction was clear and offered options for beginner, intermed & advanced, so no one is left behind. Look forward to my next visit to Boston for a mega workout! 
14959 0 Please dear god clean your draft lines and stop washing beer glasses with dawn. Mixed drinks or bottled beer if you come here 
14960 3 They make the most gorgeous custom shirts. Check it out. GREAT FOR: I think a custom shirt would be a nice graduation gift, any thoughts? 
14961 4 We had dinner for two birthdays. Service was very good, steak tender but we like more seasoning. We will return.. 
14962 4 Similar to chipotle but much better food and customer service. Xavier took care of us and he and the staff were extremely funny and friendly! 
14963 3 The food was amazing except for the lamb shish kabob which was undercooked. Not big on the dancer that came out every 20 minutes but I know that's just part of the shtick. Other guests at my tabellen enjoyed it. 
14964 3 Dark, moody, and fun. Great date place, but also a good place to go with friends and gab for a few hours over drinks, while lounging against comfy pillows. The menu doesn't have a ton of options, but the middle-eastern style food that is served is yummy. 
14965 4 Just as tasty as their hanover st. location....don't listen to all the fuss, Mike's is just a name, Modern is quality! 
14966 3 Great location near my hotel! I could just walk around the corner. Great service! I sat at the bar and was acknowledged immediately The Blackened Chicken and Shrimp Salad was more than I could eat. Really fresh and flavorful!!!! 
14967 4 Tasty adult donuts. I first discovered them in Portland, and then later ran across a store with great delight in Venice, CA. Interesting flavors. Not as wacky as Voodoo. 
14968 0 So sick of this place, and after getting ripped off again on developing film I had to give them a bad review. 
14969 3 My friend and I stumbled upon this cute little salon after being turned away at another nail spa downtown. The staff were fast, polite and efficient. We had a nice spa pedicure and exfoliation and foot massage for a bargain! (Half price of downtown spa.) I'll be back! 
14970 4 Glad I listened to several recommendations to come here. Their happy attitudes are infectious and they are super helpful and caring. So excited that I will be able to see things farther than an arm's length away!!!! 
14971 3 It's a burger. We went on a Saturday morning. The staff was pretty quick and efficient. The burgers were melty goodness. The tator tots rocked! However, the onion rings were stringy red onions... not bad, but not what I expected. I would recommend if you are in the area. 
14972 2 Meat-market galore...and no, it has nothing to do with the ribs and wings. 
14973 4 Knowledgeable, compassionate, accessible, kind and patient. She is nonjudgmental and sees optimum health in my prognosis. I'm so grateful for Dr Asmar. 
14974 4 This place was great. Warning come on an empty stomach. Seafood was really fresh and sweet, the way Boston seafood is suppose to taste. It's worth the wait trust me. 
14975 4 The service here is amazing. Well worth every dollar spent! The owner and staff are very friendly and they take their time on your service. Highly recommend! 
14976 4 great bagel sammies! wife got Italian Eggel, with vegan tomato herb cream cheese. she loved it but says it could use another veggie like spinach. portions are perfect. i got the Supreme Eggel, would get again for sure. quality ingredients, nice family ambience, and cute little play area for toddlers! 
14977 4 Have been doing business with Stephen for over 10 years (followed him to his new shop) He knows the business and has the necessary equipment to get the job done RIGHT.... HONEST reliable.... so nice to have someone I can trust !!! 
14978 0 Not much to say, over-priced, under-sized. Broth not hot enough, will not go back. Need to find more food after eating there, is it a good thing MacDonalds is just across the street? 
14979 3 Recently bought a cake for hubbys 40th bday. It's was just him and I so the small 4" cake chocolate cake was perfect. The staff kindly helped me with the order since it had a bit of detailing. The cake was SO TASTY... and not too sweet.. just perfect 
14980 3 Love this place. I am a simple girl. I like that there are not a lot of selections...but the ones that they have are good. The owners are nice and personable. I look forward to returning! 
14981 4 Extremely helpful and friendly will definitely stop by. Amazing hand selected collection very good finds here. 
14982 4 I can't say enough good things. We had Nick as Server, he was great. Mothers day had a free filet for mom so where can you get that. I had a great drink blackberry smash. BlackBerry, lemon juice, whisky, agave and mint. 
14983 4 Moist, tender brisket. Sausage was on point. Tried the Mac and cheese and beans, all fresh and tasty. Worth every penny. I'll definitely be coming here more often. 
14984 4 Super clean, and extra friendly service. One of the best vegan places I've been. The employees are so sweet and helpful. This place is the bomb ass dank ass. 
14985 4 最爱去的咖啡店之一，虽然环境不那么宽敞明亮，但食物与饮品都不错，服务也不错，也方便停车，朋友小聚的不错选择 
14986 3 I'm addicted to this place! Love my usual, Wintermelon Green Milktea with Herbal Jelly and Boba! If you set up the app, it's just more convenient and they give you a $4 credit to start! I prefer their drinks over Cocos. If they start serving food, that would be awesome! 
14987 4 Great food and even better service. As others reviewer noted, basically it's a Chipotle style setup with sushi ingredients. High quality ingredients too! The owner and workers are always smiling and willing to walk customers through the menu options. 
14988 4 I love this trailer. I trust it and enjoy my food there. Their fish tacos are delicious and I enjoy talking with the owner. He loves cooking and gets to do it daily. Thanks for the delicious food. 
14989 4 Got a hair cut and ombré from Dayna. She did a great job. She was very friendly and understood exactly what look I wanted. I love my hair color. Would definitely go back. 
14990 3 Delicious! Laid back atmosphere. Great place for a quick bite to eat or a drink before a movie 
14991 3 天津+日本的串燒小館子 評語：中式和日式料理都有水準，價錢也合適 「擼串燒酒場」是一家剛開業不久的新食肆，店舖地址前身是一間叫"Cucina Manila"的菲律賓快餐連鎖店。新店接手後從事全面大裝修，高身木條的靠背卡座既保留個人空間却沒有局促的感覺，天花垂著的和風吊燈十分精緻，加上座位放滿不同圖案的大型靠墊更增添不少舒適感，店家在室內設計上真的下了不少功夫，值得讚賞。 「擼串燒酒場」的地方不大，中心通道兩旁設有八個卡座，每套卡座可以容納6個人同時用餐。至於餐點方面款式不多但却包含中式和日式兩地料理，早餐時段供應中式的天津傳統小吃例如「煎餅果子」「豆腐腦」，午市供應日式套餐，而晚市直到零晨時段則變身成為日式居酒屋，提供串燒和關東煮。大家來到不妨同時享用這裡的特別中日兩地美食啊！ 天津煎餅果子 $4.95 ~ 口感有如雞蛋煎餅包裹著薄脆吃，外軟內脆，很有特色 (3.5/5分) 煎餅果子是中國北京和天津地區的著名早點小吃，材料由綠豆麵薄餅，雞蛋，還有餜子（油條）或者薄脆的"餜篦兒"組成，配以甜麵醬，蔥末，辣椒醬作為佐料，口感鹹香 豆腐腦 $4.50 (4.5/5分) 豆腐腦是天津的傳統風味小吃，近似上海館子吃的鹹豆漿，最大分別是天津豆腐腦會加入濃稠獻汁和不同材料 ，鮮香可口，豆腐非常嫩滑月 日式香煎雞扒飯午餐 $8.50 (配味增湯+日式海草沙拉+玉子燒) 4.5/5分 
14992 0 They suck!! They had me waiting for 8 hours to receive a tow!! They need to lean how to communicate & be responsible! 
14993 3 Good and decent Chinese food. It is kind of pricey, but I'd highly recommend this restaurant in this area. I think this is one of the best Chinese restaurant in this area. 
14994 2 I suppose most stores have downsized their inventory with the tanking economy, but this Best Buy is pathetic. I live really close, so I've been there more than once. I've never left with what I went in to buy because they don't ever have it! 
14995 4 Wow this place is on par with doughnut plant at NYC! It's so good! I always get their vegan glazed donuts and it's better than non-vegan donuts. Legit so good! Better come here quick because they're open only for couple hours. 
14996 4 Stopped in on May 1st to update insurance on new car I had just purchased. Customer service was fast and great. I was also reminded of Gap insurance which I had forgotten about. 
14997 1 Our server Chris was excellent except no where to be found when we paid the bill (thank you?). Sorry to say I would not rush back for a meal everything was so so except the drinks. Sorry Tuscan Kitchen won't be back. 
14998 1 Coffee is so bad. Period. You're basically going to get coffee flavored water in a grimy, unsanitary setting. Nothing about this place is appealing. I was desperate for coffee so came here but will never be back. 
14999 2 Have been there a few times. Food is good, service is attentive, but the noise level on a busy night is unbearable. Last time I went could not stay! 
15000 3 Very much liked the Nicoise salad. Well-prepared and quite delicious. Also enjoyed the cocktails I had - they have a nice selection of craft cocktails. 
15001 4 I love to hike up here from the Audubon Society area. it's a great little hike and stays cool when it's really hot. Love having a great view on the top! 
15002 2 I see all the Facebook post about flip burger and everyone saying they are good... Ngeeeeh it was alright...not that great... 
15003 4 My boyfriend and I had a fantastic experience at sushi California! The sashimi was fresh and delicious, the rolls were superb, and the specials menu is must try! The service was great and overall experience motivated us to write this five star review. 
15004 4 The best burgers! So good you don't even need a bun. I eat here often. Service is quick. 
15005 4 100% authentic and delicious. Be prepared to also experience the authenticity. Had the fajitas and fried ice cream. 
15006 2 Good looking establishment sans quality. I did not like how red wine was refrigerated and served cold like beer. I could understand if it was super hot outside, but it wasn't. 
15007 4 We tried this spot when we where at the art show this march..will be back..the cheese and meat tray with a bottle of wine and the bread..we didn't have time for dinner but have bookmarked to return very soon..friendly and warm .. 
15008 4 I love this place! I always come for the donuts but the food is amazing as well. They have a great burger with a donut bun that is to die for. Have to come here when visiting Austin. 
15009 4 Love this little oasis in the Pearl. Roomy and not overly pretentious. Near perfection. 
15010 4 My girlfriend and I went here just a few days after they opened and we loved the pizza. The staff was so great and the owners came by the table with a warm friendly greeting. I have recommneded this place to all my friends. 
15011 0 Arrived 20 min after they were supposed to open. No one bothered to show up for work I guess. 
15012 4 A excellent nail salon that I highly recommend the staff is friendly and professional My mails look amazing and have held up really well for over 3 weeks now 
15013 4 The service and food here is great. One of my favorite places for sushi and I love the bibimbap bowl. The servers are also very nice and catering. 
15014 3 really cool little authentic spanish tapas place with a ton of small plates on the menu. highly recommend 
15015 3 I could eat the warm potato salad forever. The wait to get in and eat on-site is usually pretty crazy. If you get takeout, your order is ready inside of 15 minutes - and you can run over and eat at Schiller Park when it's nice outside. 
15016 2 It's alright, nothing too special with the exception of the evening ride when fireworks are going from the theme parks. Worse Thing: THE FOOD COURT!! It's dirty and horrible up keeping. The food is worse than mall food courts. Don't waste you money in the food court. Trust! 
15017 2 This is a good place to get tuna sandwich and a cup of soup I like their tomato soup. Their coffee is not great but they also serve cookies and some breakfast sandwiches. 
15018 4 The service was great at this cute little French restaurant, there are more space in the back with about 7-8 additional tables. We had the Escargot and it was fabulous, we highly recommend it. 
15019 3 We went on the 2nd day so it was pretty packed. Great ramen, awesome location, and friendly but inexperienced staff. Love the variety and options. Def recommend for work sponsored lunches! 
15020 4 Hands down, this is the best place on the Hill! Epic brunch for starters! For example: fried Cauliflower accompanied with a Saffron yogurt sauce & a Quinoa Salad brought to life via this weeks provisions courtesy of the Farmer's Market. 
15021 0 Showed up a 10. Left at 10:25 as no one showed up ! Gas station guy next door said they seems to show up when they want. I will take my business elsewhere where they are open when they say they are! 
15022 4 I cannot say enough nice things about Dr. Vo and the entire staff! After 15 years, I have finally found a dentist that I trust. 
15023 4 Best barbershop in Orange City; professionalism and excellence. All quality with the services offered making it worth the wait and getting money's worth. Kid and family friendly. Convenience of making an appointment with the desired barber. They use quality products. 
15024 3 I don't know how this place stays in business, as I'm usually the only one in there when I go. Regardless, I LOVE LOVE LOVE their chicken tom yum soup. OMG good! Makes me happy whenever I get it. :) 
15025 4 Gordough's Public House is much better than Gordough's trailer. The Squealing Pig has changed my life. 
15026 4 Words can't express how much I love Dr. Campaigne and Liane. They delivered both of my sons and I'd never, ever, go anywhere else. They're simply amazing. 
15027 3 This place is great... What makes this PANERA stand out from the rest was the service I got. Kelly was awesome! 
15028 3 Very good!!!! I came here with family and had a very good meal. The jerk chicken wrap is amazing!!!! When you come be mindful of their hours, especially on weekends. 
15029 0 If you like a pet friendly reastaurant, don't go here. You walk forever to the bottom of the low lake to be confronted with a sign that says "no dogs, even service dogs. And don't ask." Save your gas!!! 
15030 4 This place is seriously great! Perfect portions, delicious sauce and completely customizable (but I suggest taking it as is). I plan on taking every visitor we have to Whole Bowl. Cheap prices, and it's never been crowded when I've gone! 
15031 4 This was our favorite brewery on a recent trip to portland. Atmosphere was relaxed and cool and the beers were the most unique and delicious. So we went back the next day because it was that good! 
15032 4 Stopped by here for breakfast and the coffee and food is delicious! I got the Mocha Chip Frosticcino with a pumpkin scone and they were really good! The location is great as well! Will be coming back here again! 
15033 3 Lots of menu items and reasonable. Bill is the owner and there full time- he will steer straight. Fridays are the pulled pork sandwich day. Not overly tangy but a hit indeed. 
15034 4 One of the best Colombian spots in town. You can't go wrong with a Bandeja Paisa and they know just how to make it right. 
15035 0 Ok, so I ordered fried ravioli, they came un-batterer, confusing right and well not what I ordered. Also, I ordered stuffed shells, so it comes with garlic bread right...or so I thought, I got just cold plain bread. I wouldn't order here again. 
15036 4 Good quality food...definitely a place to check out if you are in vancouver...their gnocchi and pilsner selection is great.. 
15037 3 good for after work drinks and a snack big space, always a crowd. bouncers don't give me attitude like at most of the other boylston places 
15038 3 Was here last Saturday night. Good drinks. The music was incredibly loud, BUT it was good music. The female, brunette bartender is SMOKIN' HOT!. Also watched High Infidelity on the TV's. All we needed was closed captioning...GREAT TIME! and did I mention the bartender we had was smokin' HOT? 
15039 0 My meal was missing multiple ingredients. It was supposed to have carrots - no carrots. It was supposed to be a ground pork sauce - instead it was a few giant hunks of pork fat. The noodles were cold and straight from a package. This place is awful. 
15040 4 This is one of my favorite roast beef spots in the area. If I want a roast beef I go straight here - Kelly's can keep they're mediocre sandwich this is the place ! This place is a hidden gem only known to locals 
15041 4 I love the food here! The shrimp egg food young is awesome! Also consider having the sesame chicken. This little place is the best thing going in Atlanta! 
15042 4 This is easily the best Whole Foods I've been to. To be honest I come here sometimes just to browse and eat all the free samples. 
15043 0 Unfortunately I cannot give Baraonda a great review. The service was horrible! From the time we entered the door, to the hostess to the bar. The staff was rude! We even asked for the manager who had the same attitude. 
15044 4 Hands down the best food I have had in awhile! Red Velvet waffles were amazing, the chicken was perfectly flavored. Music and ambiance were an added bonus! Definitely recommend to anyone visiting Atlanta. Make a reservation! 
15045 1 when you do a fitting I'd only hope you wouldn't screw up the sizing, but these guys did. the pants were baggy and so was the vest...The only thing that was OK was the Coat...If I had to do it again I'd buy a suit. 
15046 3 Very nearly perfect pizza. We are always happy with our order and delivery is a snap. Closest NY/NJ pizza I have had yet. 
15047 1 I stopped getting the dumplings because they are stale by lunchtime lately. Are they day-old? One woman who works there is so spastic that she can't listen to an order. Don't go there with the slightest special instruction and check your food before you leave. 
15048 4 If you are looking for a huge delicious burger... You know those cravings....and of course have time to kill because there is a long wait. Then this is your place. Love it!!!!! :D 
15049 2 Really good staff however the wait time is out of this world. We were here 2.5 hours today and spent only 20 min with staff. Last time I was here spent an hour here before even being called. A good Industrial Engineer can help. 
15050 1 Went there to get a latte & croissant today.Coffee was very weak & the croissant was stale. What's going on ? This place used to excellent. The new staff seem a bit out to lunch. 
15051 1 Service was ok. Amount of meat on my roast beef sandwich was very weak. Cool building though. 
15052 2 This place is just ok. The BBQ will never compare to K-town in Los Angeles, but the rest of the dishes are ok. They weren't amazing but they weren't too bad. It's a convenient location if you grocery shopping at Fubonn. 
15053 4 Great food with lots of gluten free options! I love this place for brunch! My friend ordered the chicken waffles, and I just had regular (gf) waffles. I don't usually get to eat that sort of thing and it was a pleasant surprise! Service and menu were great. 
15054 2 Not great :/ Cute atmosphere but food was just ok to me. Grits had no flavor and the muffin on my Benedicts were soggy. Also the potatoes tasted like they were cooked in a dirty pan. Not a fan. It looked good though... 
15055 4 If I can rate a 6 star I would. Each dish has its distinct and beautifully different taste. 
15056 0 Mr. Donair is officially CLOSED as of December 1st 2012. 
15057 3 Gyro's are good.. could do with a little more lamb. Greek salad is phenom.... great feta cheese. 
15058 3 I LOVE this coffee shop. The staff is so courteous and the food is amazing. I would suggest trying the basil lemonade and the salmon patties. I do wish it stayed open later. Also a couple of the servers aren't always on point. Outside of that fantastic. 
15059 4 Super Good Chinese Food. Always quick and great service. Food is fantastic. The crab ragoons are super good. Love the family dinner special it is a great value. Fantastic take out but is even better when eaten in the restaurant. 
15060 3 Good wings and fast service! Only $1.50 delivery charge too! Good for take out or delivery, but sit down lacks some atmosphere. It looks vacant from the outside. 
15061 4 Things that are dependable: Old Faithful, Japanese manufacturing, the USPS, your dog greeting you when you get home from work, and the incredible fried chicken at Basilisk. Seriously, I've never had a disappointing meal here, in fact, the food seems to get a tiny bit better every time I go. 
15062 3 The best chicken salad sandwiches ever! So fresh with nuts, grapes, and veggies. My son had their cajun say and he was raving about it. My daughter had their grilled cheese plate, that came with fresh fruit, gold fish and gummys. 
15063 0 Ordered fried chicken dinner. And it came to my house with 3 pieces of chicken on top a bed of fries. I'll stick to kfc next time. 
15064 4 I have eaten here a few times, and really enjoyed it. I was walking my dog today and stopped in for a soda, and a cup of water for my pup, was given a friendly greeting and the soda on the house. I'll definitely recommend it to friends! 
15065 4 Frank from Austex Sprinklers took care of some broken valves in our backyard and did a great job. I've been pleased with the way Austex stands behind their work and would use them again. 
15066 3 Went there for the first time a few days ago. The owner (Andy, I think) was really nice and helped me pick a delicious wine. Nice to sit outside and watch the world go by on Fremont. Great place! 
15067 4 Delicious food no matter what I order. From the entrees to the apps to the sushi they are great ! Super fast delivery time and food is always warm. 
15068 4 AWESOME speakeasy basement bar! Had a great time and even though the place was packed there was plenty of space to enjoy. 
15069 4 Delicious One of the better sandwich shoppes in the area ! Recommend the raisin cookies 
15070 0 Worst food... Ordered Ghobi Manchuria which is half cooked and order chili chicken Appetizer which turned out to be a chicken curry. 
15071 4 Fantastic brunch spot. Huevos rancheros are very nice. Nice vegetarian options. Lots of different choices. No fresh squeezed juices. Avoid the cappuccino, coffee is clearly not their expertise, stick to the food. 
15072 4 My husband and I were so sad to see the 'For Lease' sign on Alder today. We absolutely loved the pastries and the gelato was the best. We truly hope it opens somewhere else preferably in Kerns but we'll follow it anywhere. 
15073 4 Tasty cinnamon rolls! Really really sweet, but so good! I'd advise to have only one if you want to stay alive :) 
15074 0 Not a professional atmosphere at all! The salon itself is beautiful but the customer service sucks. Take my tip and go elsewhere! 
15075 0 DONT go here! I hate poor service an food!! The fountain coke was DELICIOUS! The fried rice,chicken broth soup,steak and chicken was not good. Never going in there again. :(( 
15076 4 Awesome brunch !!! Will come back and its a must try for anyone looking for a place to have some delicious brunch 
15077 4 Marlon is an excellent waiter. Made sure we were well taken care ofZ The atmosphere was very quaint and me being BROOKLYN born and raised I had to get the the BROOKLYN Lemonade!! 
15078 4 Perfect for a 3rd date. Experience was very well thought out and enjoyable. Nice pace of delivery allowed for exploring the farm, hanging out by the fire, and great conversation. Highly recommend Pro tip: bring 2 bottles of vino for you and your date ! 
15079 2 Very good burgers and fries. They are a bit stingy with the fries. I would expect a little more because they food is so over priced. I only gave them 3 stars because while the food is good, it is not worth the outrageous cost for burgers and fries. 
15080 0 This place is TERRIBLE. If you're thinking about moving here DON'T. I can't wait till my lease is up so I can get the heck out of here. Ever since the complex was purchased by another company everything has gone downhill, and on top of it management is horrific. 
15081 4 One of the best Indian I have ever had outside of India. The place is very Hip and Lit so must visit when in Surrey or travelling to Vancouver. 
15082 4 An outstanding restaurant with service that is second to none, it's so refreshing! They're so attentive! The happy hour menu is fresh and delicious couldn't get enough of it! Don't get me started on their drink menu! If they remain consistent this place is going to be a smash hit! 
15083 4 Wow! New favorite place! I ordered the chicken.... Amazing! Others in my party got the two fish dishes and pork and all were super yummy. And then the gelato.... YUM!!! Service was also top notch. Can't wait to come back and try the pizzas! 
15084 4 Orgasmically good food! And from a food cart? You bet! Get the meatballs in white sauce! 
15085 4 Excellent and quick service. I visited the newer location at N. Lamar just north of North Loop. You really can't beat getting your flat repaired for under $8 and ten minutes. 
15086 4 So delicious. I've been here two times and got the gooey cinnamon roll both times - it's to die for. 
15087 4 ANOTHER GEM IN ORLANDO! The place looked creepy from the outside but inside it was truly 1st class. GREAT food and GREAT service. I will be back for sure 
15088 4 This place is a gem. I have gone to dozens of Chinese places in the greater Columbus area, and this place is one of my favorites! 
15089 3 I tried the chocolate ganache cake and lemon tart. The show stopper was the lemon tart. So lemony and so delicious with a slightly crunchy caramelized sugar on top! I'd go back again for lemon tart. 
15090 4 I love living at 3500 Westlake Apartments!!! I look forward to living there for many and many years. The management there is wonderful and very nice. They are extremely helpful. They give you great customer service. Liana, Andrea and Rosa are wonderful. I would recommend anyone to live here. 
15091 2 I find it a bit overpriced for the food, but overall, I do recommend it, especially for visitors who can afford to eat at the full buffet. A really good place for a casual date on a lazy Saturday or Sunday. 
15092 3 The best part is ordering take out and waiting in the kitchen. I also love the sign that says something to the effect of "we won't take your order if you are on your cell phone." 
15093 1 This place was disappointing overall. The view and happy hour was great, but the food was disappointing. I had the Cesar salad and the fish tacos, both were bad enough that I'll never go back. 
15094 4 Bam tacos dank Kambucha and salad soooo bomb.com 
15095 4 Ordered from here several times. All I have to say is super fast delivery every time, decent food, and great prices!!! For delivery, it is one of the best Chinese. 
15096 3 My husband and I came here due to groupon. We were so happy about the food and price that we bought more groupons. They have a regular soft paper with Chinese translation and you have to ask for it. It has a few more dishes. 
15097 4 Super yummy pizza!! We ordered online for delivery tonight and it was timely and delicious. But was disappointed with only getting 1 parm packet and 1 pepper packet for a 15" pizza 
15098 4 Amazing tacos! Husband ordered the migas, he said they were great. I had the migas poblanas, which were crazy good! The dark green salsa was sooo good! We'll come here again next time we're in Austin! Oh, the coffee was surprisingly...well...perfect coffee really :) 
15099 4 I bought a 2016 Mazda 6 and the buying process was a breeze. My parents were also impressed. We could not believe how fast Jordan got me into my new whip! I love my car, Thanks!! 
15100 4 First off very good tour great enthusiasm... you can learn alot and be enveloped in great history leading to the revolution!!! 
15101 2 3.5 stars. Couture Ultra Lounge would have received four stars if their bottle service was more then just a bottle of champagne. Pros: Fairly crowded with good looking people, simple clean layout and good DJ. Cons: $250 gets only a bottle champagne? 
15102 3 Good fresh sandwiches and salads. That sourdough bread and those marinated carrots though... 
15103 4 We had a fantastic time playing mini golf here tonight! Very well done good art and friendly staff in-service. We will be back and we will be bringing friends! 
15104 4 We come here every couple of months and I'm always surprised this place isnt packed!! The owners are delightful, the patio is spacious, and the food is great. Their dolmas are my favorite. 
15105 3 Excellent blue cheese burger, solid wings. Wedge salad was good too. Service really shined. Very happy to have a great dinner option on West 2222. 
15106 1 Food was alright, i had the Vietnamese rice but it was just regular rice not broken rice. Beef and pork seemed to be over cooked a bit. The interior looks nice and clean. 
15107 1 After waiting over thirty minutes and watching people who arrived after us but seated before us, I learned they failed to add our name to the list.... When confronted, they laughed it off but immediately seated us... Guess they found room for us??? 
15108 2 Was a cool spot, food was just "ok" for the price. The Pesto spaghetti was good and off-menu burger too. The Breakfast of Champions drink was good but is more of an after dinner drink! 
15109 4 Great little hole in the wall place for Ramen. Simple menu with few options which is a huge plus in the add on craziness that seems prevalent these days. HOT broth, great taste. Will be back again! 
15110 4 Cole slaw!! Dark meat! It was so good. A good value in downtown for $9. Definitely going back. Also the guy at the registrar made room for me to sit even tho they were closing. 
15111 3 I went in for the first time in February for my free birthday burrito. It was clean and orderly. I was the only one in line so I'm not sure how swift they are when crowded. The employees were nice. I plan to go back again. 
15112 4 Lots of options, super helpful staff, and cheap prices on lingerie in comparison to competitors! 
15113 4 Service is always amazing and the specialty drinks are always on point, this is by far the coolest prohibition style bar ever! A must rry for locals who haven't been and tourists alike. 
15114 4 Yay! A friend and I had a blast stand-up paddling. Jeremy was very friendly and helpful. 
15115 4 My son had the burger with bacon and egg. I had a Chicken Kabob with a salad. Everything was great. The staff was very friendly. The Churros with caramel were out of this world!!! 
15116 3 Possibly the best Mediterranean food I've come across in Atlanta. Loved their kabob platter and falafel. The Gyro is also very good. 
15117 3 Kenneth N.'s recommendation of Thierry's macarons persuaded me to return. Smooth crust. Chewy cookie. Light creamy filling. Reasonable sweetness that does not overpower the flavour. Yum. I haven't had a disappointing flavour to date. 
15118 1 Update on review is that I asked them to take everything to the top of the house - one room and they suddenly were able to put the items in the rooms they belonged in. 
15119 3 ディビジョンのローカルなフローズンヨーグルト屋さん。自前のキャラも作って、お店も広くて清潔。店員さんのホスピタリティもよい。ソルティピスタチオを頼む。ピスタチオはローカルなもの使えないだろう‥し、ペーストの良し悪しがモロに出ちゃう。ここのはどうだったかというと、しょっぱ過ぎてわからなかった‥昔自分の最初のお店を作った時、ソルティキャラメル味を出したら、友達のアメリカ人から、スイーツに塩味なんてありえない！と言われたが、時代も変わった。人種や宗教、性的嗜好に関係なくという外の張り紙はパウエルブックセンターでも見たが素晴らしい！ 
15120 4 I really enjoyed their special beef #9, Very Affordable Clean inside And very friendly employees I'd give em a try if you're in the area 
15121 4 The Harvard Square location of Newbury Comics is definitely the most crowded on weekends. It's also one of the smallest locations. That said, they have a great magazine section, turntables for testing records, and lots of imports. 
15122 4 The root beer bbq they use on the sliders is amazing. The house made sodas were great as well. Great neighborhood spot. 
15123 4 Very nice spot. Nice local feel with friendly staff. Feels family run. The outside looks very generic but the inside is nicely done. The food is very good and the prices are very reasonable! I highly recommend!! 
15124 0 I've gone back a couple of times and the staff just keeps getting more rude every time. Too many other places in the area with the same kind of food to be treated rudely. I will NOT be going back. 
15125 4 Great ice cream! I tried the taiyaki for the first time too - they're almost like waffles with different fillings available. Delicious. 
15126 0 The worst burger ever!!! We had the primetime, eldiablo and truffle fries. The food is not as expected and the experience is horrible by all means. I really don't know why people stay in long queues. 
15127 3 Awesome vibe, and VERY good tempura. :) My companions also had very good things to say about the sake, though I myself had none. 
15128 2 Have to look for this place as its off the beaten path. Kind of dark and dingy, but I usually order take-out. Food is good but not exemplary. Not too pricey, even at dinner. Good options if you have a vegetarian in your family. 
15129 0 This is our favourite ramen house,eventhough always busy willing to wait just to eat here. 
15130 3 The food was amazing ! But it's just as pricey as all the other restaurants in Disney would be. I recommend the duck but the Korean beef was a little salty. Good atmosphere and service, just wish the price could've been adjustable 
15131 4 Absolutely fantastic food! I love that they deliver too! Have never been inside, since it's always so busy - assuming that's a good thing of course! 
15132 2 I love the idea of this restaurant. I like that you can choose your sides, however, the sides don't always look appealing. Additionally, I've eaten the fried chicken multiple times and each time the seasoning is different. 
15133 4 This place is absolutely best. Daryl is a straight shooter and beyond fair. The guys at the shop are all great and know these cars better than anyone else. Would not take my VW anywhere else. 
15134 4 Great Migas tacos and burritos! Also very nice and friendly every time we go. And good red and green salsa. 
15135 1 This place is so cute. Like other yelpers have mentioned, it was empty. The food was bland and the drinks were horrible. The staff however was very friendly which constitutes the two stars. Probably would never go back. Great space & service, but everything could use a boost! 
15136 4 Mandy gave the best facial I have ever had. She used so many techniques and products to increase circulation, exfoliate and moisturize. Your skin will glow after one session! 
15137 4 One of our go to places with or without the kiddos for quick, inexpensive, but good eats. Kind of like a subway for pizza (but way better) with thin crispy crust and tons of toppings. I go for the BBQ chicken with Gorgonzola cheese, bacon and pineapple. Mmm...so good. 
15138 0 Worst food quality and service....Found dead bug in the food..Be aware it seems they dont keep kitchen clean and food is not at all fresh...!!!! Please check your CCTV for September 7th around 10pm!!! 
15139 4 First time here and the crew was extremely friendly and fast. No lines, smart folks. Not selly or pushy. 
15140 4 I have been going to Brutole for 4 years and always had a great dinner i've had everthing on menu including cakes service is outstanding as well Yummy 
15141 4 Justin and his team did an amazing job on our two cars. His team was fast and they were there right on time. Our cars haven't been this clean since we bought them. Great job and great value for what you get. I will definitely be using them again. 
15142 3 Staying here for a convention. Well appointed room for the price. Good beds & pillows. Safe is really small - won't hold a laptop. 
15143 4 I called them to help with an 11- box shopping project and within an hour they sent a courier and had it all done. Morgan was incredibly responsive and So easy to work with. Great experience!!! 
15144 3 I like fried chicken. I like spicy. Basilisk has both in equal measures. Huge pieces of chicken on my sandwich and the basilisk sauce had a serious bite. The fries were good as well. 
15145 3 The owner was very knowledgeable and she took an hour just to help me out selecting the right dance shoe. I wish they haven't moved that far because I live in Vancouver but if I ever need another pair of dance shoe I would definitely come here. 
15146 4 Very good food, great service, good prices. The home made salsa is amazing. I have enjoyed salads, burritos, traditional beef, pork and seafood dishes, all with great flavor. 
15147 3 Very good food. Excellent choice for lunch. Valet parking is only $2. Don't be cheap! 
15148 4 AHmazing food, wonderful staff, and safe for Celiac's! You guys are my new favy 
15149 4 Be prepared and bring a hand cart to have someone roll you home after. The food is rich, fulfilling and heavy. It's French so that's what you're getting. Nice date place, intimate surroundings and polite staff. The dessert crepes are to die for. Everything is delicious. Make a reservation. 
15150 4 Description of awesomeness: If I go here anymore... 1. I'd go broke 2. I'd be a fat vegan 3. I'd die of happiness 
15151 0 WORST TACOS EVER. I order the steak tacos today and it consisted of 1 cup of cabbage per taco, and a tiny bit of steak. nothing else. what a waste of money !!! 
15152 4 Absolutely great tasting pizza!!!!!!!!! Small town bar and pizza. The folks there are very genuine and friendly I will be a returning customer for a long time to come 
15153 1 Save yourself some time and effort- just found out- she is only booking existing clients. Maybe time to hire another person. Wow It seems like the massage industry in Portland is booming! 
15154 3 Awesome food...awesome service. .Jordan was great!!! Only problem was smokey from the grill when we for here... I would recommend this place. 
15155 0 My review below still stands but their HR department did reach out to me for this. According to them, the issue was discussed but they were not able to tell me what conclusion they came to. I appreciate Jan's reaching out but nothing felt resolved on my end. 
15156 4 I tried the American after getting drinks on Rainey and it was perfect. The tasty homemade chili was not too messy and the cheese they melt with a blow torch holds everything together. I will definitely be going back. 
15157 4 Ask for Peter! He's amazing! Also, order the Totzilla and ask for queso and extra jalapeños. 
15158 3 I could eat that green salsa all day on anything!! Delicious food, excellent service , hot and crispy chips, everything was fresh and well-prepared. Even the rice and beans were specials. And what a cool building! Highly recommend. 
15159 3 Mate Chai, breakfast burrito. It's what you do when your girlfriend goes to work and you are relegated to be a part of the Boulder mid-morning-to-afternoon coffee shop occupiers. I can't think of a nicer place. 
15160 4 Consistently wonderful coffee- their moon milk is to die for. I'm not sure what's in it, but it's creamy and sweet and out of this world. I frequent this location for good WiFi, friendly staff, and delicious coffee. 
15161 4 Amazing, just amazing food and flavour, good environment, small but worth it! Everything in the menu is just delicious, good customer service, clean and friendly 
15162 4 great place, food is excellent, employee is very friendly 
15163 0 I was so excited to go here. The games are great but the service was terrible. The drink menu looked good but I didn't have the chance to try the drinks because no one came to serve me. There are better arcade bars in Orlando with better service. 
15164 4 This place is so fun! Dark and weird, but unexpectedly delicious desserts and fun staff. Very laid back feel. Got raspberry fool and some sort of gluten free brownie! Amazing. Will def go back. 
15165 4 So good. Both times i have come in here the food was amazing. BYOB! Great quality food for reasonable prices 
15166 0 Ordered off foodler. They cancelled it because I'm to far away (four miles) I asked them to confirm my address because I've already ordered once before no problem. The lady on the phone refuses. I guess 2.14 miles is not worth their business. Overall rude customer service and useless... 
15167 4 Sam, Shay, and Riley were super helpful!! They made sure that I was super comfortable, even Houghton I was super nervous. The tour was amazing!! So glad I toured Austin with them!! 
15168 4 I've had many parts replaced by union cycle over the last couple years and every time they exceed my expectations with the quality of work and kindness including every staff member they employ. Bravo Union Cycle 
15169 4 We had the 7 course tasting and it was superb. We added the duck to our tasting and that was better than amazing. Neither of us drink so our meal was fairly speedy about 3 hours. You definitely can't go wrong coming here for that special occasion. 
15170 3 I had brunch there. It was good. An 8 out of 10. I would go again. I had the Florentine omelet... It was a little dry but tasty. 
15171 4 the noodles were delicious! hibachi was great too. although the man ahead of us gave the chef cooking our food a hard time for not getting something he didn't ask for. overall good experience! without the salty guest of course. 
15172 2 It's tiny and feels a bit crowded if you stay for a long time. Some items get strangely overpriced. The staff is really nice and my matcha chai latte was super good. 
15173 4 Excellent food & excellent service. The chocolate mousse dessert was the best I've had in Austin. Highly recommend this restaurant. 
15174 4 Awesome food, great price, A+ service = 5 stars. The potatoes and pickles were especially good. 
15175 4 Freshest coofee ever had. You read this, you need to go there and check it out. Best recommendation, bring cash and their prices are based on what YOU feel the cost is yet they recommend a range for you to choose. 
15176 4 Awkward waiting area at the front, but altogether great atmosphere and great food. Get here early, though, because there's never been a time on a Sunday without a 20 minute wait. 
15177 3 We like this place because they are pet friendly you get a warm fireplace the food is great servers are always good to the beer is the best 
15178 4 Fantastic staff, wonderful stock, great store vibe. We will be back! Great socks, great skates, great protective gear, great shop cat. 
15179 2 Love the tropical waffle which was on their special. My husband didn't like the regular one thou. Their coffee was good too. However, it took almost an hour wait for our orders to arrive which we thought was a total time waster. 
15180 4 Love this place but not as much as my son! Open 365 days a year. You won't regret a visit to Imagine. 
15181 4 First time in Vancouver... Stopped by for breakfast... Had the salmon benny. My sister had the pork benny. It was both very good. Nice ambiance. I would definitely recommend this place. 
15182 0 Sorry Charles Street Market. You are getting demoted to one star. Why, you ask? Because your baked goods are always stale and your cashiers don't seem to care. Fix it, plz. 
15183 3 Good deals on burgers on Tuesdays... only 5 bucks. Sat in the bar.. good wait staff, good food. 
15184 3 Very good, uncomplicated, thin crust New York -style pizza. I've been back multiple times for their inexpensive and satisfying ready-to-eat slices. The chicken cutlet sandwich is good too, and I've heard the Thanksgiving sandwich is excellent. Service is fine, folks were friendly enough. 
15185 4 The best. Kind people and always in a good mood. I usually just walk-in and never have had to wait long. Busy place but they keep it moving. 
15186 2 I'm the obviously pregnant, with the band, designated driver - and I was just charged for soda refill. 
15187 4 Thank you, Katie, for a most awesome experience. I learned so mush about how to apply my makeup to get the desired effect. Plus, it was so much fun! Your talent and expertise is amazing! 
15188 4 **** 10 STARS Burma Design did a wonderful job restoring my table. The table looks amazing! From start to finish the crew at Burma was easy to work with. I plan on using them again. 
15189 4 The food here is absolutely amazing. I love the salmon and the grilled shrimp. The food is seasoned to perfection. It's in a small location and parking isn't the greatest if there are no more valet parking spots available. I would say that this is definitely must go to restaurant. 
15190 4 We just moved to Lake Nona and decided to try this amazing place! It far exceeded everything we may have thought! The service is superior, the atmosphere is cozy and the food is amazing!! We have found our new Orlando spot!! Thank you!! 
15191 4 Came in for breakfast with my husband this morning. Staff were welcoming and prompt. Food was amazing and priced perfectly. We've been here for lunch a couple times and they are great for a diner lunch. 
15192 4 Relaxing and upscale touch to a south austin jewel. New energy and the same welcoming hospitality - from the story accompanying my cocktail to the un-rushed service - we'll be back. 
15193 4 Lindy always does a great job watching my cat when I am out of town. She is trustworthy, communicates well and is great with animals. She loves cats and dogs and they love her. 
15194 3 I've been eating here since I was in middle school. The cheeseburgers are delicious, roast beef better than Kelly's and friendly service. Always happy to eat here whenever I'm around. 
15195 3 Love coming here for their tasty crawfish whenever I am in Orlando! 
15196 4 I DREAM about this place, it's so good! Everything is so tasty and their spring rolls taste just like the one my mom makes. 
15197 4 What a great place to have a late brunch or lunch! The paninis were tasty with fresh products. The hamburger had a delicious and unique sauce. The service was excellent and kid-friendly. 
15198 3 The loaded nachos are unbelievable. Food is great here. It is a must do when in Dublin. Bar service is average at best. Do not expect fast drink service though. Overall a good spot. 
15199 4 Great coffee, great atmosphere, live music, great beer selection. A wonderful place to work, listen to great music and a great date spot! 
15200 2 I love the concept more than the execution. As a huge fan of noodles, I had high expectations but found the noodles to be too thick, hard, and starchy. I'll be back again to try the lamb skewers! 
15201 0 Out of 10 buffet bars to choose food from, including a double sided sushi bar & hibachi grill, my favorite item was tapioca pudding & I don't even like tapioca pudding. My dining partner's comment: "I will eat Del Taco before I ever eat this again". 
15202 4 We are visiting for the weekend and this is the best food we've had so far! The brunch was amazing as were the mimosas! The service was great! I'd definitely recommend eating here! 
15203 4 This location is close to my hometown and is always easy in and easy out. The lines are a bit long sometimes, but only on Saturdays, really. Staff is helpful, the store is huge, and has a good selection and layout. Highly suggested 
15204 3 Took my TV in that was having issues keeping a picture and staying on. A few days later TV repaired. Nice staff and fair price. Will return for future electronic repairs. 
15205 1 Let's see... $13 for a basic burger. Check. Pretty much empty inside. Check. Pretty and fairly attentive bartender (where we sat). Check. Well, that about sums it up. I won't likely be back, the options at Legacy Place, right across route 1, are simply too tempting. 
15206 4 Best Kids Menu ever. The fish sticks are big bits of cod baked in lovely panko breadcrumbs. The grilled squash , grapes and fries were a huge hit with our 10 month old. And mommy and daddy's meal was awesome as well. 
15207 4 Love this place. It is a welcome addition to the restaurant scene in Portland! 
15208 4 Great spot for a quick breakfast or a lovely salad lunch. The owners are awesome and they run a great little cafe. 
15209 4 Great little cafe that serves up awesome home style meals. The service was excellent, not over bearing but were there when needed. A lot of other cafe's can take note of how this place does things as its up there with some of the best I've been to. Highly recommended. 
15210 4 Just went back since its reopen and the place is still the exact same. Chicken and noodle is great and the services is better then ever. If you have never been you need to go! 
15211 0 Their beignets shouldn't be called beignets! It was literally a powdered donut that had a hint of lemon to it. Gross 
15212 0 The one in Saugus on route one is horrible As a Latino I am used to real food; this includes Mexican, 
15213 1 Takeout curbside went well, but the rice and beans portion was awful. Rice was hard and dry and barely there. Could not eat. 
15214 0 Worst lazer tag ever. Put way too many rules and certain ways to lose points making it too complicated. I recommend lazer quest in San Antonio much more..... Got two games and didn't even go to 2nd game it was so shitty 
15215 3 This place is so cute! The prices aren't too bad and the service is friendly =) I'd definitely skip their Japanese style breakfast though. The salmon was overcooked and bland. The waffle breakfast was delicious though =d They include a chocolate whipped cream with it! Mmmmmm Free wifi too =))) 
15216 3 Fun place to eat but it often gets busy and then it's not as fun. My favorite is the jammy Davis jr. Spicy sweet and yummy!! I get it ever time 
15217 4 Delicious food!! The goat was cooked to perfection and the spices were the right amount of delicious spice. Amazing, amazing, amazing!! Do yourself a favor and have a meal here. 
15218 1 I am definitely never coming back here. They treat people here like crap. They make up bogus cover charges and treat people in line as though they are animals. This place is highway robbery!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
15219 4 I started going to Calabar & Grill 3 years ago and it is by far one of the best places in Atlanta! This is my Cheers! 
15220 4 Our favorite Disney restaurant! FOod is always on point and service, per usual, is great. Get the tuna app... it's so good. Thanks for making our trip so memorable. 
15221 3 Great pizza!!! This was easily one of the best pizza I've had. Easy on the budget. Local place where everyone knew everyone. Only added to the experience 
15222 3 I love the sangria! But, the quesadilla de nopales is the big winner! Sooo flavorful and way too much to eat. My husband and I always share. The Happy Hour is excellent!! Love all of the La Costita's !! 
15223 4 This is the best veggie taco I've ever eaten. In my life. I don't know what the secret ingredient is, but it's definitely working. I've sampled their others, as well, but the veggie is where it's at. Fantastic green salsa, too! 
15224 4 I've been to this establishment twice for brunch and it never disappoints me. The price point is excellent and you get great quality/fresh food. I would definitely be back again! 
15225 4 We really enjoyed our stay. It was very conveniently located off 35, and was only a $15 Uber drive to the bars downtown. Knowing it was South Austin, we were a little nervous but we felt very safe. Will definitely come back! 
15226 3 A wide variety of flavorful pasta and sauces. I wouldn't recommend for the Ragu and white pasta fan. Very casual atmosphere. Comfortable setting and quiet patio. 
15227 0 Made an appointment, I had a Groupon. Then never heard from them again! I even tried to confirm the appt. No answer. 
15228 4 作为harbor point的居民平时不想出去吃，就会去楼下吃他家的。 就凭他给我提供了一个有的时候早上起来能吃上一碗热的面机会 这个五星我就给了。哈哈 这家店的优势在于它的地理位置。hp里，附近确实有很多学生，包括中国学生。不喜欢自己做饭，又不想开车，或点外卖的就会这家店。但是感觉如果有竞争的话他们应该会很快没有办法维持。第一，很多我身边的朋友都觉得这家店的食物在波士顿是中等以下。第二，服务确实差了一点。感觉他们用的都是这边的学生没有什么服务经验。 推荐牛肉面，咖喱牛肉饭，如果喜欢鸭脖什么的人 可以试试。 
15229 4 Great location and hotel is built as a 360 so each room has different city views which is unique and our view of park and Ferris wheel was great at night 
15230 4 The waiting room there is very comfortable and the staff truly cares. Unbelievable experience!!! 
15231 0 I had a Groupon so the price was right for a pedicure & gel manicure; however you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, my fingers & toes still hurt after 6 days! She cut me several times while doing my cuticles. I will not go to this place again. 
15232 4 General Automotive has honest mechanics working there. I never felt like I was being up sold or pressured into repairs I didn't need. Bob and Gary did a great job on fixing the AC on my Hyundai. I recommend them to everyone. 
15233 3 Great Ramen place for the price and location. Ordered take away. Served fast. Order the original and was satisfied. Good sized serving. 
15234 0 Go to Starbucks if you want a "decent" expresso, notice the quotes for decent, went inside thinking I could get a good expresso reminiscing Italy, but was served an awful expresso. Save yourself from the trouble and go somewhere else. 
15235 4 This place is a god-send. Who knew such good burgers could come from a kitchen like this? The burritos are huge, the ingredients amazing, and the service kind and quick. Absolute favorite. 
15236 2 The guy at the register was friendly, but after a ten minute wait, they brought us the wrong sandwich, a shake instead of a smoothie, and tiny chicken strips. I'm used to better from one of my favorite restaurants. 
15237 4 My dog loves going to Camp Bow Wow! He gets all excited when we walk in. I love the cameras that I can view him on and the report card on how he did. 
15238 4 Great for kids! Celebrated a birthday party here and got a taste of their yoga programs. Staff are friendly and place is small but clean. 
15239 1 bopuke-o the burritos give me major acid...i think it is due to undercooked beans...eaten there maybe 10 times - same result every time.....but...the mango smoothy is great - earning them an extra star! 
15240 4 Two dollar mimosas on Sundays and friendly bartenders always fun when we watch the charger games on Sundays 
15241 3 Good burgers, awesome fries! I also like Main Root soda selections. 
15242 4 Had the chocolate cream pie and the banana cream pie. Amazing! Wasn't too heavy or overly sweet, lots of cream. I will definitely be coming back, especially since it's open late! 
15243 3 One of the best deals in Boston. Not quite as fancy as some places downtown, but the quality is good and there is a ton of variety, esp. for the price. 
15244 4 What this place lacks in ambiance it makes up for in quality and service. I will never visit Vancouver without a stop at Best Quality Sweets for take out gulab jamun and samoas. Super nice people. 
15245 4 I've been a couple of times, and the pizza has been excellent. Pricey, but delicious. Great beers on tap, as well. 
15246 4 Good price. Way better price than Hannam and H-Mary. I really hope Kim's Mart keep that up. 
15247 4 Excellent food and the owners are so very very friendly and hospitable. Great patio and outdoor space as well. Great little gem in north Austin. 
15248 4 This place is great!! The food is amazing, the shakes divine. Expect a long wait, but it's worth it. 
15249 4 Out here in ATL for the third time! This place was great! Good vibes and amazing service!! It was late when we went but the waitress was amazing hanging out large party! 
15250 4 Love it. I don't even know what else is on their menu (it's a lot) because I was honed in on the fries and all the bajillion sauces. I opted for the vampire one and a BBQ one and wasn't disappointed. Great spot for post bar-hopping. 
15251 4 They cater my parties beautifully, deliciously, graciously and reasonably. And my guests always always always rave about the food (especially the lamb). 
15252 4 How have I not reviewed this place sooner?! Anytime I have friends visiting from out of town I take them here. Amazing food and great vibe! We had so much fun doing Das Boot! 
15253 4 On impulse my friend and I in route to her seamstress near East Village stopped in at Mai Kind Brunch for a breakfast brunch bowl and fresh squeezed OJ. Best decision, it was a delicious immense spicy dish that heated the blood. This food will make anyone smile. 
15254 4 Awesome. Never been to a Ramen restaurant before. So good! The noodles were homemade and you could tell. Broth was great, not salty like I am used to out of a package lol. Wait staff explained menu and options to me. Very nice place 
15255 4 Great salon, great service. And, since it's an Aveda salon, the products were wonderful. Thanks FX! 
15256 4 Monday nights are all-night happy hour. We were stuffed and buzzed for $30. Tasty chimichurri burger $8, sautéed mussels $7, cheap house wine. 
15257 4 Had a wonderful time! She did a great job and was super accommodating, considering we called last minute and kept adding more people. All our nails turned out fantastic. Very reasonable too. 
15258 4 I went into JAHO for this first time last week and Steve was very helpful ! He recommended me the Spanish Latte ( which was amazing ) and The Smoke Salmon on a croissant. It was a great first impression. Thanks Steve & JAHO. 
15259 4 Thierry successfully redefines the meaning of a dessert. The triple chocolate cake and tiramisu are especially amazing. They serve the best cakes I've ever had in my life......Highly recommended! 
15260 3 Quick, cheap, good quality eats. I got the pork kimchi and grilled shrimp tacos. Both had a ton of authentic Korean flavors with the spicy kick! Super cheap with my total being around $7. 
15261 3 Our new favorit pizza place! The strumbolli is GREAT too! The service could be a little friendlier or maybe poliet is the word but the Owner is a Great guy. So far all the items we have ordered have been AWSOME! 
15262 3 Good vibe. Lots of seating. Cleanish bathrooms. 
15263 2 Got a bowl with chicken rice beans cheese lettuce pico and guacamole sauce on side. Small portion that came with very little chicken(marinated thigh chopped) flavor was good(at best). Guacamole sauce seemed to be made without avocado. Different$9. Meh 
15264 4 Very nice selection of draft beer. Tried the Driftwood IPA with the Mushroom soup lunch special. Very tasty stuff right there. I also recommend the peanut butter banana dessert. When visit a new place - INDULGE 
15265 4 Amazing food! Loved the typhoon rolls and sushi salmon was deliciously fresh! Then the Mongolian beef is out of this world! Awesome to have this place in Delaware, and did I mention amazing atmosphere music and service? Try this place! 
15266 0 Is this business, still in business? I've called and left a message twice and they don't call back. 
15267 2 One of my favorite burgers in town when find myself with 30+ minutes to kill. Employees are apathetic, food times are sloooow! Good burgers tho. 
15268 4 They're pizza is great, authentic thin crust with fresh toppings. They should be charging more then $2 a slice. Plus the staff is really nice. 
15269 4 I looooove this store! Literally all things YETI! Super friendly and helpful staff, especially Kelly! She was so sweet and knowledgeable and found handles we thought they were out of! I highly recommend a trip downtown to check it out! 
15270 2 I checked this place out based on the reviews and the jerk chicken was decent wish it was more season/flavorable like the fact it wasn't served with white bread. I would check it out again. 
15271 4 Goodfellas is a really great Italian restaurant. It's veal dishes are fabulous, and the pizza is every bit as good as New York. If you get a chance try Goodfellas Pizzeria you'll be glad you did. 
15272 4 Fotini, is upfront and honest and a pleasure to visit. The ambiance is very relaxed and spa like. I loved the results from the cold laser. Smoother and brighter skin as promised! 
15273 3 Over all this place is good... my visit today was just ok.. the pork servings this round were very small... but still it was good... 
15274 0 it was awful. terrible. horrific. bad management. bad service. food- ok. drinks- puke. if you like your margaritas to taste like lime kool-aid with battery acid, then this place is for you. this is a mexican restaurant, get your margaritas right. 
15275 3 Excellent as always, superb food with outstanding service. Very cozy room for 2-4. Not good for a large group, for that go to Gaslight. 
15276 4 I have been twice great selection of local beer food was very tasty atmosphere was very nice mussels were fabulous and also crab cakes were good 
15277 2 I heard great things about this place and perhaps, it that rose my expectations too high, but I didn't find the food to be as good as the reviews. The food was good, but not exceptional. Reasonably priced, which is always a plus. Overall a fair bet! 
15278 4 Love it. But don't leave anything of value visible in you car. Very sophisticated car burglars. Broken glass and a trail of ATM and credit card charges in three different directions simultaneously. The cemetery is a true jewel of this city. 
15279 0 I flew AA after a long hiatus. Hostile staff, terrible planes abysmal seats. Goes to show you how bad an airline can be. Boston needs a better carrier 
15280 0 Never again. We picked up a suit after 4 days. We realized once we got home that it had not been cleaned up... Same smell, same stain. And of course we paid for it. Please don't go. If you do make sure you check everything at pick up. 
15281 3 been twice to Austin, twice to Terry Black's. this place is amazing, great food and great brisket. 
15282 0 Friendly enough staff and a wide variety of toppings, but I found the yogurt subpar and definitely not creative flavor wise. I've had far, far better. I wouldn't go back. 
15283 4 What a great spot! The food is delicious, the staff is above and beyond some of the friendliest in town, and they have a full bar. It's often empty, but I've eaten here many times and loved it, so I don't know why. Check it out! 
15284 4 I DON'T EVEN LIKE HOT-DOGS and i eat at this place. Everything on the menu is on point. Service is exceptional. 
15285 4 I am a stay at home mom with a 4 year old and crawling all over 9 month old twins. I have no time to clean my house. I was excited to have Sabrina come and clean for me. She was great. Thorough, detailed and fast. Thank you Handy!! 
15286 4 I always make an effort to stop here at least once when I'm in Austin. My favorites are the tree amigos & the birdie sanders! Sooo delicious 
15287 2 I know that us big city folk are always disappointed by ethnic places in Boulder but... Just ask the owner about basmati, ghee, and chaywanprash, and you'll discover where the 3 stars came from! 
15288 0 This group has plastered their marketing stickers all over public property in NW Austin. Shameful. 
15289 0 Seriously, save your money. Store bought tortillas, chewy fajitas, tamales are bland. Sorry, but this is pretty bad food. My son got the burger and that wasn't bad, that should tell you a lot... Sorry, truth hurts. 
15290 4 I eat a a lot of sushi and for a fast food it was great. Ask to add eel sauce on one of the crunchy rolls and you won't be disappointed. 
15291 4 Bought 7 medium pies today for lunch at one of my customers. AWESOME! One of the guys there had already had pizza from here before and raved about it. I have to agree with him. Great pizza, nice people. Next time I'm in Titusville, I'll be returning 
15292 3 Yup. Cafeteria food. Just like the school food in the good old days. Soft veggies. Fried chicken. Great deserts. Sweet tea. Get a tray and slide it down picking what you want. This is what a cafeteria should be. 
15293 4 Still my favorite place to eat!!! The food is consistently prepared and excellent! I've been to two other Loving Hut locations (Seattle and San Fran) and this one is the BEST. 
15294 1 Standard fare. Some items are a hit while others aren't... most are average. More than once I've encountered a chipped glass or dirty silverware. Not really a destination for a foodie, IMO. 
15295 3 In the past I've been disappointed with the customer service. It was so bad i actually came back the next day to share my experience with the manager. The last two visits have been the complete opposite. The employee Zach was extremely professional. Keep up the good work. 
15296 1 I love the food but we are here now and have waited 50 minutes and still no food! It's a Monday and I have never experienced such slow kitchen service. I won't be back anytime soon. 
15297 4 Nice concept, friendly staff, good quality food...I will be back the next time I'm in town!!! 
15298 4 We were so excited to find this great place near our home. Everything was excellent, service-food-environment. Had a hard time deciding on what to order as it all sounded so good. Will definitely come back for more. Highly recommend! 
15299 4 Food is delicious and affordable, drinks are really nice, but the service is definitely superb, my new favorite restaurant 
15300 0 Aweful Aweful Aweful service!!!! Rude hostess, she was dismissive and didn't care for our business so we went elsewhere. Band sound great while I was there waiting on hostess for short period.. 
15301 0 This place is overhyped. Yea the smoke is cool and all but it takes out all of the flavor of the cereal. It tasted like air. Not only that, but they were stale. Also, customer service sucks. She was facetiming someone and didn't even stop when we walked up. 
15302 1 Not impressed. Taste is ok ( I had lamb tibs), and price is kind of high ($12), and the waitress got several of our bills wrong (all over-charged). 
15303 1 Overpriced. Way too loud. Our server wasn't very friendly. However there is a bar tender who's her the top sweet. Stunning flower arrangements. 
15304 3 THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD. My mom had bland fish and chips and my dads fish was good. The dessert was pretty good even though my dad said it was microwaved. It was huge. I am begging to go back to have another delicious burger. 
15305 3 The food is very good and reasonably priced. I come several times a month, and I'm never disappointed. Anything with the shrimp is delicious. The drinks are average but the service is always great. 
15306 3 Fresh delicious food!!!!.. Fast Service Clean and attractive environment. I have been there more than once and went back again because I was pleased with the experience. 
15307 3 Dining Services location, deliverable to dorms. Includes a small C-Store to get snack/grocery items as well as pizzas, subs, and wings. Breakfast and lunch available for pickup. Overall great quality for low price. 
15308 3 Just ate here for lunch today. I got the classic gyro. The meat was excellent and generously portioned. The vegetables were fresh. The tzatziki sauce was a little different but still good. Overall I would definitely recommend trying it and will be going back for sure. 
15309 4 We had the salsa sampler with the queso flameado, the migas, the endive and spinach salad, and the wild boar pozole. We drank an infused Bloody Mary, a Ginger Mango Mimosa, and a Paraty. Everything was absolutely amazing, I'd recommend it all! 
15310 3 Generous portions and prompt service. I'm not a big Thai food connoisseur, but I did find everything very tasty. The decor inside the restaurant could use some sprucing up, but, yet again, I didn't go there for the ambience, but for really good Thai food. 
15311 2 This is an interesting place. I enjoy the big seats to sit and people watch. The most interesting people o watch are the baristas- they would be great characters on Portlandia. 
15312 3 I got breakfast and my hubby got sandwich. Both were good. we thought the portion was smaller than expected. but the quality was very good. 
15313 3 I haven't tried much of their menu but their salads kick ass! Every time I order a salad I order it with grilled chicken and God knows what they marinate it in because it sure tastes heavenly. 
15314 4 We got the hazelnut, the Boston Cream, the maple bacon, and the caramel bourbon. All great and fun donuts. The hazelnut was my favorite because the flavor and texture made it really enjoyable. I'd eat any of them again. And the staff was fun and friendly and informative. 
15315 4 Great little neighborhood breakfast place. I love the Pepper Bacon scramble and the fact that they are open till 3pm. I'm very glad I discovered this place. 
15316 3 Great place to stop in Austin. Food was great and the beer was cold. It's a little pricy but definitely a good spot for a one time stop. 
15317 4 This is one of my favorite go to sushi spots. Love the orlando and dragon rolls. The house fried rice is also amazing! 
15318 4 Since their old page hasn't migrated to their new page I'll leave a review to hopefully clarify. This is the same Gonzo that sells their amazing hummus at farmers markets and used to be beside Base Camp Brewing. They make amazing falafel wraps! They are some pretty nice folks! 
15319 4 amazing new theatres, reclining seats, and individual tables. this will be the new bar for alamo drafthouses in austin... 
15320 3 I work nearby and come here for a sandwich every now and then. The sandwiches are fantastic. You get a big filling meat packed grilled sandwich for $8. It may take 10 - 15 minutes for a take out sandwich, but it's worth the wait. 
15321 4 The only thing I've had from them is their donuts. But man, they're delicious. Lots of variety and every one that I've tried is delicious. Highly recommended. 
15322 3 Good prices, meat slices ample in their pho. tasty. went there late at night around 10 pm. easy to get to. don't miss this pho next time you need a place to eat in Surrey. Ample walking space and the restaurant dont feel crowded. 
15323 4 I love this place. Coco bread and beef patties always fill me up. Live down the street so pretty much addicted 
15324 4 I ordered here the other night through GrubHub. I got the aloo chole, and 2 orders of plain naan. It was goooooood. Came in less than an hour too. And the delivery guy was friendly too! This may be my new favorite Indian! 
15325 4 A nice find, recommended by our Airbnb host. Friendly folks and great food!!! Danny was our server (lived in Redding too) he was great, friendly and made great suggestions!!! Ask for him!!! Amazing food!!! Great environment... don't let the exterior keep you away!!! 
15326 4 I love coming every wed !! Staff is amaZing !! Food is always on point !! Very Friendly #Clermont 
15327 2 The cappuccino was good, the staff was friendly, the ambience was pleasant, but... there was just something missing. I can't put my finger on it, but it lacks something. Unfortunately, not at the top of my list as far as coffee destinations go. 
15328 4 This is a great spot for Margaritas! Nice tequila selection! Dan the bartender was great he recommended apps, a great anejo and made a wonderful margarita! We will be back! 
15329 4 Consistently excellent food, wonderful service, nice atmosphere AND a great value. Now stay away, because I'm tired of having to wait for a reservation! 
15330 3 The food is fantastic! I liked the shrimp and pot stickers. The cowboy burger was cooked perfect and their ketchup is awesome. Will definitely come again 
15331 4 Such a romantic restaurant with great lighting. Really creates an atmosphere. The food is lovely, the portions are huge, everything is so fresh. Love the pasta, yum! Great service, I came here with my fiance on a Groupon and will definitely be back! 
15332 4 キーンの横にあるコーヒー屋さん。ショッピングに疲れた時の休憩にぴったり。コーヒーは苦めで美味しい。他の豆の時は苦くないかも。外にテラス席があるので天気がいい日はゆっくり休憩できる。ダウンタウンの中心から少し離れるので比較的空いてる。 
15333 4 Came back with my fiance and he got the filet mignon......I know, I know filet mignon at a MEXICAN restaurant?? HOWEVER, it was delicious! This restaurant is spectacular all around! 
15334 4 My favorite place to go. Magic atmosphere, attentive attitude, effective care. Dalit and her team are the best, you won't find a better acupuncture. 
15335 4 I always like to get sushi here after I go see a movie at metro town. They have great buns and a large selection prepared foods. Love t&t! 
15336 3 There's some good curry here. Just remember to order extra meat because they're extra chintzy when it comes to that. 
15337 4 Yummmmo! Great servers, fun menu and delicious drinks. Next time I'm saving room for dessert! 
15338 3 The food is SO GOOD! I'm a vegetarian, and I always get the falafel plate. I ask for extra white sauce packets too because that stuff is amazing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel like they decreased the portion sizes which I don't like. 
15339 4 This is an intimate, unassuming restaurant, tucked away in suburbia, with outstanding food, drinks and service. The best we've had outside of Spain! It also has a surprisingly extensive vegetarian selection. It's small, and does get pretty busy, so reservations are a good idea. 
15340 4 On the eve of Chinese New Year, We tasted the mostly renowned Boston lobster with shaking sauce at Shaking Crab. Love the taste! Gratified for the prompt service! Feel great! 
15341 4 Good coffee. Simple selection of bagels and pastries. Great coffee shop atmosphere. I can sit for a cup with friends or sit for a day of work on my laptop. Lots of different groups of people come in during the days I've been there. Such variety! Great vibe, friendly baristas. 
15342 2 The food was ok, but the service was excellent. I appreciate their offering bread, especially since we were unusually hungry. All three orders (different pastas) were slightly overcooked, but still chewy. I'd visit again only because it happens to be close to home. 
15343 0 please adjust your business hours. we were searching for an open now restaurant, found your place on yelp, walked in the rain to you and you had already closed. the times on yelp are wrong as we saw on the door 
15344 4 Wonderful experience. It is advised that you call in or reserve a table before you go as it is very crowded. Price is good for quality. 
15345 3 I'm definitely a fan of the Vancouver Aquarium ... loved the Beluga show the best ... the Beluga whale is super cute ... I'm pretty sure it waived at me as I was a front row seater :D 
15346 4 Had an absolutely wonderful lunch with friends at Pisces and Britney was an exceptionally wonderful waitress.followed by a boat tour. Thanks Paula Gus Judy Dina Jill and Mike. Looking forward to our next big adventure 
15347 4 This is the best nail salon i've ever been to. The service was amazing and I got the best gel manicure i've ever had in my life here. The facility is very clean and modern. I recommend this salon to everyone and will for sure be returning. 
15348 0 Not what it used to be. Most of the food is frozen now. Food was piled up waiting to go out, but waitress was to busy on her phone. 
15349 3 Good sandwiches, simple menu, limited toppings, but fresh cut meat right in front of you is kinda cool. Employees can be hit n miss, I wish the one lady would stop signing though. 
15350 3 Loved it! Located in a nice place in Dr Phillips. Ordered the philly stake croissant with eggs and it was delicious! 
15351 4 Good food with very large portion, good environment, nice service Price is reasonable. A lot of parking 
15352 3 Tasty breakfast, but expect a cold blast of air during the winter every time someone walks in. 
15353 4 Delicious! The ladies running the food trailer are super sweet also. "The standard" with sweet potatoes and goat cheese is awesome. 
15354 4 Best Chinese food I've had in a long time. Whenever I eat Chinese food I always get General Tso's chicken. This place had the best, and freshest tasting General Tso's chicken I've ever had. The service and atmosphere was really nice. 
15355 3 Mas caro do que deveria ser, porém muito saboroso! O molho Bacon- Parm é uma delicia. 
15356 4 This is the best sushi for the money I've ever had, period. A perfect spot for a quiet dinner, very casual and comfortable. Everyone is extremely friendly and the service is quick! Love this place! 
15357 2 Ordered Pad Thai for delivery. Very disappointing, it had no sauce in it? No flavor, no spice, very bland. I was really looking forward to their food based on the great reviews. I'll have to give them another try next time I'm in town. 
15358 4 Went by the ratings and was not disappointed! So good with great service and the meatball forget about it! Good stuff! Alberto was great-! 
15359 1 Mears sent in another bus an hour later with a pretty funny driver to make up for it. Still all and all a poor experience. 
15360 4 A completely relaxed and enjoyable experience. Unlike a lot of the other places in downtown Decatur, this one is not about being hip. Our Way Cafe is just a wonderfully unpretentious restaurant Quidditch prepares delicious comfort food and serves its customers with a warm smile. 
15361 4 Had the BEST Deep Tissue massage by Linnea! Will be going back on a regular basis. Very caring and professional staff and services. 
15362 1 good portion of meat but not enough noodles and a bit too salty 
15363 4 Found them thanks to everyone's rave reviews! Very friendly, quick, and affordable! Since I don't have to get emissions tests very often, I will only be seeing them once a year, and their awesomeness actually makes me look forward to my next test! 
15364 2 Great food, excellent service once seated! Fun atmosphere, great for a relaxing time out. Only downside, wait time was quite long and someone had to run around yelling your name to tell you your table was ready. Also bar service was slow. 
15365 4 Best Cantonese restaurant in town. We cant stay away. Don't go for the traditional dishes and try the exotic plates; you wont be disappointed. The salted pepper squid is awesome and the roast noodle soup is a must!! 
15366 4 A great wash for a great price. Get the interior clean, its well worth it. The only place I'll take my car to in Austin! 
15367 4 Great Korean food, especially for a cold night. I just wish this place was bigger! 
15368 4 The Pittock Mansion was awesome! The plant garden was very pretty and you could see the whole city. The inside was decorated nicely, it was pretty cool. 
15369 4 Did an amazing job on my dress and had it altered in only 2 days! Amazing work, will definitely be returning here. Bella is very sweet and talented! 
15370 4 I thought Salt and Straw was okay until I tried their soft serve ice cream at this place. I got vanilla and strawberry flavors and ITS SO FREAKING GOOD. It legit tasted like strawberry purée. I would totally go again if I'm in Portland. 
15371 4 The best breakfast in Vancouver. The decor, food and atmosphere is on point. Love it. 
15372 4 Its a unique experience for sure. Great beer, great movies. I especially liked the no talking rule during the movie - even for the servers. They have paper for you to write your order on and they'll quietly deliver your order. 
15373 3 If there is a new location or very similar food for the price, please post it here and Send me an Alert! 
15374 4 Love this place! Their salsas are amazing. The avocado margarita is to die for... Sorry for the half eaten salsa sampler and half drink margarita! you won't regret coming to this colorful hopping place because the food and drinks are wonderful! 
15375 3 Very good on all counts. Great seating outdoors. Smart server. River view. Wonderful sunny, Sunday afternoon. Probably stayed longer at our table than we should have. Good, good food served in a timely way. 
15376 0 Horrible customer service!! They are rude and not well trained, I'll spend my hard earn money some where else! I'm so upset that these people are not professional at all, very uneducated in what they are "trained" to do! 
15377 1 Walking in. It's low light, a little dingy. The servers are nice, they took a while on something and comped us a beer. The food was much better than I was expecting. I really wasn't expecting much. It's not the type of atmoshphere I'm into, so I won't be back. 
15378 4 The food is really amazing here; the other Yelp reviews are right! Wide variety of food to try and all very tasty. The staff is very attentive. Definitely one of the best Brazilian steakhouse experiences I've had ever. 
15379 2 Liked the ambience. Can't complain about the regular day buffet. Customer service was good. There could have been more varieties of dishes, though the price was reasonable for number of items. Good place for lunch once in a month. 
15380 4 There's nothing not to love about this place! The atmosphere is lovely - roomy and bright. The people are friendly. The pies are delicious. Such a wonderful addition to the Village! 
15381 0 This place has nothing on the other eating establishments in the area. You would think that with so much potential business lunch/dinner clientele during the week, the Blue Wave would try to get things right. Your lunch break will be over before the food arrives. 
15382 4 Great little trail for a run. If you start at Albertsons and run through the park, past playground to the round about and back its about 2.2 miles. There is a small playground for kids there and there are always family's there 
15383 4 Definitely the best ramen in the Boston area! The spicy miso ramen is my all-time favorite. YUM! Every week! 
15384 0 Sushi was terrible and the regular bbq fare high-priced. Service was barely decent and the location is without life. Strictly a one-time affair for me. Also, the noodles portion was too small. i had high hopes from the other reviews but seems like this place is more of a hit/miss. 
15385 2 Pretty good sports place near back bay. I come here to watch games from out of town. The cocktails are pricey and food is ok but the service is good and they have plenty of TV's 
15386 4 The atmosphere is very nice. It was cozy and smelled wonderful. Daniel helped me decide what to get and he was very kind and helpful. The employees are all very positive and create a joyful environment. Would definitely love to come back to try all the teas. 
15387 1 I'm a big fan of cheap asian food. I'm not a fan of this place. Pad Thai was not spicy at all. Fried rice was boring. Even the spring rolls are kind of subpar. Meh. 
15388 1 Very dated. Nice location. Would recommend staying on the premises at WDW. Not a great hotel, staff was nice. 
15389 1 Overpriced. Slow. raw home fries every freakin time. omelets are not that big. pretty good french toast. A couple of the waitresses are nice once they get to know you. Owners are low on social skills. 
15390 4 Our waitress kept our drinks filled. The staff was personable. The Classic BCB was delicious. A cool, unique spot to go to for a variety of occasions. 
15391 2 Pastries are excellent! If you prefer a chewy, dense macaron then this is your place. Don't come here for the coffee... it's not so good. I recommend tea instead. 
15392 4 Couldn't be happier with my experience. Greg was able to diagnose problem and provide quick affordable solution for fixing my iPhone. Highly recommend and will be back if I run into any other iPhone issues. Matt 
15393 4 i am in love with the Thanksgiving burger......which is not a burger at all. Service was very friendly and prompt. Full bar. The most delicious thin onion rings ever! 
15394 0 This is the SECOND time that I've left this restaurant with part of my order missing. I paid for a number 2 Dinner and only received the chicken. Where is the side?? This is ridiculous and this establishment has really gone down over the past few months 
15395 4 Are you kidding me? They make burgers this good? The price is expensive yet very fair. Everything is pretty much local or "green". Get the Greek burger. 
15396 4 Great food, fast service both takeout and eat in. Close to work. Enjoy lunch and breakfast. Great service 
15397 4 This place is amazing, it has the best veggie pizza in the usa. And their smokin joes crust is a must try. I will defintely come back to it. 
15398 4 My stylist, Tiare did a wonderful job. The store is new and very modern for a discount salon. It takes about five minutes to cut my hair, so I am usually looking for value and customer service - I found both at this Supercuts location! 
15399 4 Super kind and very very thorough. Also - very affordable. Its always been a luxury I couldn't 'justify' but really - they are affordable and so detailed. 
15400 4 My favourite bubble tea in the world. After traveling Europe and Asia (including Taiwan) this summer I have concluded that this is my favourite. I prefer fruity drinks over milky so I always go for the strawberry green tea with mango stars less sweet. Absolutely refreshing and delicious every time! 
15401 4 Amazing food and great service. Every dish I've had has been delicious! I've found them to surpass Luigino's and Giovanni's. I've only ever received one dish where the pasta was undercooked avid they delivered a replacement without hesitation. Very happy I found Chianti's! 
15402 2 Decent but there are better options in terms of service 
15403 4 Awesome people. I just got my yard sale bike put into tip top condition, and they were very helpful in choosing and installing a baby seat for my kiddo. Very professional, very helpful and just really nice people. Thanks! 
15404 3 Sat at bar. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Great bottled beer list, wine list, and spirit list. (Plymouth Gin!) Had the burger and fries. Super juicy and sloppy: just the way a burger should be! Will definately be back! 
15405 1 Besides for location, ot really isn't worth the time or money. Charging $2 extra for g free pasta is ignorant. If you are stuck in the area and need something close, it is ok, but plan ahead and eat somewhere good. 
15406 4 I had a front head light out. I came to this autozone after work. Jesus was kind enough to find the replacement light and installed it for me. As a woman, I really appreciate the extra effort. Thank you so much, Jesus! 
15407 4 The empanadas here made me hear color and see sound! I was so impressed with their quick service, variety on the menu, and overall enjoyable environment. God bless you Sofritos. 
15408 3 yum, yum, yum. great, fast food. love this place. benedicts are spot on and everything else is delicious too. 
15409 2 I haven't been here in a while, and I couldn't find it at Crystal mall last week. They've relocated to 4462 Beresford st and have not yet re-opened 
15410 0 This is the worst ever Chinese restaurant experience in any reasonable city. Pork ribs without any trace of bones and taste just like deep fried rubbish. The shrimp also taste not fresh. 
15411 4 This is an excellent Portland bar. Great and simple food. Modest beer selection that rotates regularly, some fantastic staff, and a really good value happy hour. Definitely my local. 
15412 4 Best crispy tacos, and I'm a tortilla snob! Crispy and homemade! Great fresh ingredients as well. 
15413 4 Portland has a lot of restaurants that will come and go while Paley's Place will remain. One of the city's finest. 
15414 4 We went on a Tuesday afternoon for the lunch buffet and was delighted to experience their wide variety of dishes. The salads were fresh, the main dishes were tasty with mild spice. Beautiful ambience and less crowd made our lunch even more enjoyable. Highly recommend this place!! 
15415 4 You need to come here! Great little spot showing sports but the food is phenomenal. Get the TRI TIP Salad! 
15416 3 This place is an institution in East Boston (and for the rest who know about it )and serves great italian food(pizza,lamb!) in a family/bar setting. The reviews speak for themselves....I have no words..... 
15417 4 Great brunch. If large group then tables/ group are split up since they only have 4 top tables and smaller booths Food is excellent 
15418 4 Loved this place. Will be back very soon. The sandwiches are okay, but will be back for the amazing noodle dishes. You can see them stretching the noodles in the back; so fresh and tasty. 
15419 4 Food was excellent, beer was flavorful and staff was great! I ordered the Sweet Heat beer and it was nothing like I've ever tasted before! Also had the burger which was fantastic along with the fries. The ambiance was also great and there was great hipster people watching. 
15420 4 Super nice staff. Super flexible with you. Beautiful apartments. Amazing trails. Maintenance team on fleek. Every time I call, ethos responds quickly and I feel like they actually care. 
15421 0 Was looking forward to nice yummy tater tots and a sandwich and received dry over cooked food with metal chairs. Fast food chain with a half ass attempt to draw in vegans. Ha! 
15422 2 Enjoyed the ambiance but the sushi was just ok. I liked the coconut crunch roll the best but the other roll we ordered tasted fishy. I like oudom better but my husband disagrees. All depends on your taste for sushi! 
15423 0 Staff is really rude and obnoxious. They're not attentive at all, so even if the coffee was better than average, it's not worth going back. 
15424 2 Ordered the fricassee on 2 separate times and both times were sodium overloaded. They need to go easy on the salt. $1 waffle topping is over priced. 
15425 2 love your minimalistic clothes, but please, install mirrors in the change room! even thrift stores have mirrors in their change room so that should be a good indication that it is important to the shopping experience, right? also wish you have a return policy (store credits only). 
15426 4 Gartner's is a GEM to be on the west coast. You would be hard pressed to find a meat store of this stature anywhere on the pacific coast. I moved back to the east coast, however i I were in PDX, I would be buying my meat there weekly. 
15427 4 I'll take Peach Valley over Kiki's any day. They're western omelette, home fries, grits, biscuit, and a large orange juice makes me smile all day :) Well, at least it makes me smile until I get hungry and want lunch. LOL. 
15428 3 I got the veggie scramble and my boyfriend got the el Marcos, and we both got mimosas. All delicious. The atmosphere was my favorite part, super homey. My only complaint would be that it's not really one dollar sign, more like two, but still worth it! 
15429 2 Lots of ice cream choices. They're all good. I just don't think the price to quality was worth it though. And the waffle cup my friends and I got was sort of a failure? It just wasn't as good as we thought it'd be. 
15430 4 This place has not only an amazing atmosphere but delicious food as well. And they are generous on the drinks. The server Billy is amazing...super funny and knowledgeable and made our night. 
15431 3 Simple cafe but food was good. Had the shakshuka. This cafe is perfect if you want to dine in or take out. Good service, simple. 
15432 4 Steak tips are perfect! Great house salad. Impressed by proportions 
15433 3 Portions outrageous. Usually can't finish. Food better the second night. Servers very helpful and friendly. Will go back again and again 
15434 3 Was here for an event in one of the meeting rooms that are available for rent by day in the building. What a great spot! Open areas for working with breakfast and lunch available at the cafe and also at the restaurant inside. Coffee and breakfast sandwiches were great! 
15435 3 We didn't eat any food but it's the most authentic Irish pub we've ever been too. Good atmosphere on a Saturday if you're looking to party, otherwise I'd pass. It gets pretty packed and loud. All-in-all it was a great place to stop and grab a beer 
15436 3 An Italian experience! Pizzas ok Nutella pizza is amazing lol, located in Disney spring! Great customer service 
15437 4 This place is so god ! I love the patio outside and the food. Really better than other most popular place in the area ... I'll come back 
15438 1 Please turn your music down at the bar. Came and left after a beer on a Friday night, can't hear the person next to you at all. 
15439 3 Great venue for various concerts and events in the Atlanta Area. Very safe. Parking is easy to access. Make sure you get there early because lines can be long! Overall I've had great experiences at the Tabernacle! 
15440 4 The Philly cheesesteak sandwich here is really awesome, and so are the pizzas. We've had the pepperoni and margarita so far. Can't wait to go back! Super nice workers! Warm vibe. 
15441 4 If you are in Salem this is a great place to stop for any meal! Sunday afternoon on the deck with a great raw bar, wine selection, view, and service. It is my favorite spot on the wharf! I highly recommend the blue crab, oysters, and Sancerre. 
15442 4 This is one of favorite new restaurants in Buckhead. It's healthy and fresh, love the chicken Kaboobs on Salad. The customer service is always friendly and welcoming. 
15443 2 It was a pretty cool show but very outdated. You can actually see the lines on the flying cow. 
15444 4 Delish. The only downside is that it is downtown. ;) If I didn't hate to be around people so much, I'd definitely be back - regularly. Spot on chicken deliciousness. It (dare I say it?) may be better than Lucy's. (Shhh don't tell on me!). 
15445 3 A big fan of this place. I have yet to have a bad meal or experience here. I love the salsa. Really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Shout out to Dakota from our visit last week. He was great. Only downfall is the parking. 
15446 2 Overpriced, food was sub par, more of a joint to meet up and drink than eat a good meal. 
15447 3 AND they have vegan donut options! We love this place, if you are visiting...skip the VooDoo and have a Blue Star. 
15448 2 Are here today. The food and presentation was good. However, we got our food 50 minutes after we sat down!? The excuse was that they were busy, and they didn't know my party was in a rush. On the flip side they did comp some items on the bill. 
15449 2 I was probably expecting too much because of the hype. The food is decent, but not authentic. Lot of cilantro which is weird for sushi. I would eat here again but probably just for dessert. 
15450 4 What can I say! Super friendly, amazing tea, and delicious soup dumplings. My wife and I from out of town, we walked past this place the other day from our hotel nearby. Gave it a shot today. Was not disappointed! My wife and I will return before we leave! 
15451 0 The pricing here is off the charts, the employees give out false information on the phone, or "neglect" to tell you everything; calls are not returned. I have had nothing but frustration with not only State Farm but this office. Best for you to look for another agent. 
15452 4 Exchanged my mattress couldn't be happier with this business! Super helpful and understanding. I love my mattress and so appreciate the family who sold it to me! Thank you RKC Sleep Shop! 
15453 4 I LOVE this Lowe's.After coming here again, the service was fast, we got great help, self checkout worked great, plenty of parking, great selection. 
15454 4 Really impressed! Food was excellent! All sorts of authentic flavors hit my tongue. A conglomerates of spices and textures done right. And the portions were gigantic. And for such an unassuming place. It's a hidden gem! Prices were great too! So was service! Definitely bringing my friends back! 
15455 4 Amazing food. The ribeye was one of the best I have had. The cocktails are also top notch. Server wasn't overbearing. The open kitchen is fun to look at. Go there. 
15456 4 it is brand new in the Hunters Creek location. the staff is really nice you can try samples too cookies and cream is my fav of course 
15457 4 Hands down best cakes in Portland! Family owned and run business. Large variety of yummy chocolates, pastries and other goodies as well! 
15458 4 I have gone to Milano for the last couple of years. I have always get a good hair cut. I have gotten my haircut from Andy. He does an awesome job!! Previously I went to another girl in the shop but she moved to NY. She was awesome too! 
15459 4 I had the duck, the fromage special, and the macaroons. Really incredible!! Beautiful new flavors. Great wait staff! They were quick, helpful and friendly! 
15460 4 Quaint little tea shop with tasty treats (had a delicious ginger molasses cookie) and a wide arrangement of looseleaf teas. I will assume that the ladies working the shop, the older woman was the owner? She was informative and attentive and the younger woman was sweet and attentive as well. 
15461 3 It was good chicken. The bone in chicken was spicier than the chicken strips, however neither was too spicy. The sides were also very good. Only 4 stars due to the chicken strips being a little greasy. 
15462 3 Consistently our go to Chinese place. Good food and always quick! Very nice people who work there. 
15463 0 I believe this is the worst food I have ever seen. I ordered a bunch of items from them and I didn't eat 10% of it. Everything was soggy, oily, tasteless, or tasting something it shouldn't. 
15464 4 Love this place. Amazing margaritas, good food, fun atmosphere. I recommend the chicken nachos or the fajitas. Good place if you're looking to satisfy your mexican food craving! Also, great for birthday parties. Be sure to make a reservation on the weekends, tends to get very busy. 
15465 4 Dude awesome selection of bagels. People are great to support. Get there early for the good bread doughnuts! 
15466 4 Excellent nail salon. I have been a regular for the past three years. The owner knows the regular customers by first name. A smile always greets one as they enter. Wonderful knowledgeable staff. They take great pride in their work. The salon is very clean. 
15467 4 Great place. Friendly, good food, good coffee. The curse is broken! Whatever the curse is. We're visiting so sad to leave when you find a great place. 
15468 4 I would recommend this place for anyone who likes a deep tissue massage! The appointment was easy to make and they got us in the same day. Their prices are very reasonable and it was very clean! 
15469 1 Went specifically for Italian beef. Served on a toasted roll - not traditional. Beef was not sliced thin enough and there wasn't very much of it. Not a whole lot of flavor. Did not meet Chicago standards, disappointed. And the fries were some battered garbage. 
15470 3 I love this place. Their happy hour rocks. The tamales, picaditas and the drinks were all great as was the service. I will definitely be recommending this place! 
15471 3 They were so freakin' nice and welcoming. They described every menu in detail. I loved the twist on tacos. I'd love to see more vegetable options soon. 
15472 4 Got the pepperoni and cheese with fresh garlic. It was very delicious! I will for sure be back with some friends to show them how great it is. The girl who served us was very friendly too. 
15473 4 The only nail place to go to. Andy n Rosie are the best. Love them. Come check them out! 
15474 3 Went for Valentine's Day with the kids. We are pretty picky with our Mexican, but we did not have any complaints. Everything was great, including service. 
15475 4 Hands down best Soul food in Atlanta.. I order Fried Whiting, Collared Greens, Sweet Potato .. Plan in advance great food always in demand.. 
15476 2 The Tom Yum soup here is amazing! I would go there again just for that! OK Thai food for a local joint. Great Thai food for delivery. 
15477 4 Love the whole cupcake truck experience. I got the carrot cake cupcake and it was so moist and flavorful!!! I loved the chunks of nuts throughout. I am still dreaming about that cupcake. It was a pleasant treat during my visit at SXSW. 
15478 3 The food was great but the service wasn't the best. We waited there for 45 minutes before we got to even order. Otherwise, the food was amazing and their pancakes were spectacular! I would definitely recommend it, but makes sure you have time. 
15479 3 I went for lunch so the burger wasn't on the menu. The whole time there I felt the place was trying to be a Holeman & Finch for the everyman, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. A diamond in the rough for sure in the cheesy, North Buckhead market. 
15480 4 We're obsessed. Masa y Papa torta takes my breath away. And the interior decor makes me want to rip everything out, speed to my house and repurpose it. The drinks are decent and the service is excellent. 
15481 4 Great food, I loved the ambience. Outdoor seating is always a plus to me! Great customer service and attentive. Indoor seating looks nice too and has that southern house feel. Great choice in fountain drinks. 
15482 4 Best liquor store around hands down. Tom is the coolest guy ever and the other guys are just as nice. 
15483 4 Best donut ever had. I had the old dirty bastard it was with Oreo cookie and peanut butter with chocolate frosting 
15484 4 Great coffee shop tucked back in the South Congress hotel. Very nice atmosphere and great coffee. Has great nitro cold brew serving cuvée coffee. Definitely recommend 
15485 0 bootleg security, bad sound, and the worst crowd in a hot minute. 
15486 3 Great fine. Service was excellent. Very well priced menu with the usuall favorates. I always try a new thai place by ordering yellow curry chicken.....was not disapointed. Inside is very warm with tables and booths spread confortably. Think I'll be back to this place. 
15487 4 I came in twenty minutes before they closing time and they made me breakfast burrito. It was delicious (the best are still in New Mexico I'm afraid), and it was affordable. For this, their place in heaven--as well as my loyalty--has been secured. 
15488 4 Went for apps and drinks! So good! Has the caprese salad and special meat and cheese plate! Highly recommend for a snack or for dinner. 
15489 3 Good food. Better cocktails. Need a multi person men's room. Their old fashioned is great! Onion rings are grreat! 
15490 3 I got the captain crunch donut. It was really good and fluffy. I wanted the Voodoo Doll donut but they were all out :( 
15491 4 Lunch today was very good. Crispy tacos with chicken, came loaded with all the fixings, beans and rice. All very good. Clean restaurant, quick service, and good food, nice people. Perfect. 
15492 4 It was a very good place. The taste was super good. I am really fan of Indian food and I really recommend the place. 
15493 4 Dim sum the way it's supposed to be. Absolutely glorious old school a la carte style & sooooo worth any wait. Seriously can't stress enough how good it is here. Just go :) 
15494 4 This high-end Italian restaurant is wonderful. The lamb chops are fresh, tender, and fragrant. We also tried a Friday spectral main course, which mixes rice, shrimp and octopus. It tastes better than it looks. 
15495 0 When you see the exit for Woburn off 93-just keep driving. New Hampshire and the Internet are minutes away. 
15496 4 Omg!!! Went there with family and the food was out of this world! The owners are very friendly and explained all the food and how to eat it as tradition Ethiopians do. $5 for kids Buffett and $10 for adults. Very fresh food!!!! 
15497 4 Awesome food from Argentina, Venezuela, Cuba and Columbia! Great vegetarian choices too. We visited twice and loved it. Try the empanadas and Columbian burgers. Highly recommended. 
15498 4 Food was delicious and fresh. Our server, Stevie was amazing! She gave us great recommendations! A must try in Austin 
15499 3 Great food, good prices, wonderful atmosphere! I highly recommend this place. Compared to the restaurants around it, it's one of the best! 
15500 4 Definitely my favorite Asian Resturant in Austin. The service is blazing fast, the staff is friendly and it's a great value! Enjoy eating here late at night in between driving for Uber. You can't go wrong with the Pho Ga! 
15501 4 I've eaten a lot of burgers in Austin and if this wasn't the best it would rank in the top 3. The freshness of the ingredients were outstanding. Highly highly recommend. This isn't your basic burger flipping trailer. 
15502 4 The ladies at Bella provide excellent customer service! They answer emails very quickly, even when not open. They are well organized and very helpful and patient. It was easy to schedule appointments.. I went in 5 times total! 
15503 1 Made an appointment, the front desk attendants were nice but unnatentive and it was 15 minutes before I could even check in. Then waited another 35 minutes to see a doctor...there's no point in making an appointment...didn't save me any time. 
15504 2 Fabulous chicken. It was definitely on point. The service was also great. However all the non fries goods were gross. No one at my table liked them. The mac n cheese tasted old and reheated. The coleslaw felt partially thawed and flavorless. The fried rice was oily. 
15505 4 I absolutely love this place. The food is very good and the restaurant itself is very cute. It's very easy to miss if you're not looking for it. The couple who owns it are very sweet as well. 
15506 0 Bad service I will Never come back with the black lady holding the door and it is empty inside and she was putting people in front of me and I was here 1st 
15507 4 My favorite Mexican restaurant. I go at least 3 times a week. Always friendly staff the food is amazing and cheap! 
15508 4 Sooooooo good! Vegan deliciousness for any type of eater. Highly recommend. A real Columbus treasure. Enjoy! 
15509 4 Bar staff is great. Not a ton of vegetarian options but the portobello Rubin hits the spot. Atmosphere and food keep us coming back. 
15510 4 I usually eat bbcue in AUS but i will be back!!!! Awesome bacon cheese burger...juicy even though it was well done (like mine medium but forgot to ask) mini frozen margarita hit the spot as well...Great place!!! 
15511 4 Awesome little spot, great customer service. If only lobster rolls and bisque/chowder were cheaper, I'd be there every day! The people working there are super nice too, and they have a pretty impressive freezer of fish/soups, along with an awesome little hot sauce collection. 
15512 3 I've only had the Philly Cheesesteaks on Wednesdays, and for the price they are damn good. 
15513 4 Good food, a welcoming staff, efficient service--overall great place to eat for a quick sit down meal (with 2$ wine)! 
15514 3 I walked to this place on the weekend when it was not busy. This place looks great and the product were very familar with the product from Daiso in Richmond. Anyway, I brought a Smart Grip for my phone and it works great for taking phones with my phone. 
15515 4 Obsessing over both rib options. I'm a huge fan of Thai food and they definitely don't disappoint 
15516 4 Atomsphere, AWESOME! Wait staff, AWEOME! Food, EVEN MORE AWESOME! Loved our dinner here. But be warned, the portions are HUGE. 
15517 4 PLEASE you MUST try. Sooooo good! Besides, Tito is such a great guy! Good food, awesome service, clean and deli! 
15518 3 Great service, people, atmosphere, & bakery. Espresso was a bit burned. Honestly a neat place, I will definitely give it another shot. 
15519 3 Wow, I was surprised at how great my natural foods burrito was. I couldn't believe it was $20 but that's the price of quality ingredients I guess. 
15520 1 The items that are for sale were extremely high, you can get it brand new for the same price. I didn't find any good deals at this Goodwill. 
15521 3 Great value at New China Express. The food is good however there is better Chinese food out there. The portion you get for $6-8 is great. The place is always clean and fast with good service. I highly recommend for lunch. 
15522 4 Great haircut and color. Salon is nice and relaxed. Mary is fantastic. I've been searching Portland for the perfect stylist and she's it. Prices are very reasonable, too. 
15523 0 Who doesn't include tartar sauce with a 3 piece catfish dinner? I specifically asked for it and drove all the way home only to have my whole meal ruined due to lack of condiments. 
15524 4 Excellent food, great atmosphere, attentive service! Consistent with the Cameron Michell quality and rich flavors that we love! 
15525 4 Delicious coffee- the lavender syrup is divine! Pastries are delightful including Apple poptart and Apricot Scone and the dough on the sausage roll hits the spot! Friendly service. 
15526 0 Lame ride! I want the 2 hours of my life back! If the line is anything more than 45 minutes, don't bother. This 5 minute ride is mildly entertaining at most. 
15527 4 Love love love place!!! So incredibly happy they have re-opened in a larger location. Food is delish -- who doesn't love a luxury breakfast for lunch in a nostalgia cafe? People and service are great and it's a very fun and now super comfortable 
15528 2 Pretty average place. I got the biscuits and gravy, it wasn't terrible, but it didn't seem like anything other than from a can. Everyone in our group had potatoes and none were impressed. Very friendly wait staff for sure. 
15529 4 Excellent place run by family. Smoothies are good. Owner is nice and friendly. I tried there clear soup and man it was good. Highly recommended if u r in the area. 
15530 3 Yummy crapes. Smoothies tastes better than the other that I have tried. 
15531 3 Very yummy/ healthy food. Not too salty or greasy. The staffs are very nice as well! Will go back for sure. 
15532 3 This bar is a perfect example of what makes living in Austin so cool. It's funky, laid-back, has plenty of seating, eclectic crowds, and great music. 
15533 4 So good! Got the dessert doughnut with Nutella and strawberries and split with my lady. Also had a great cup of hot apple cider. A great end to our date. I also appreciate that they spell doughnuts correctly. 
15534 0 Food court is ridiculously expensive for a food court. The food isn't even that good. Better off going to a nice Indian restaurant and spending the same (or even less) amount of money. 
15535 4 Great experience here! Everybody is very friendly. My favorite lady is Loan. She is very good. I highly recommend. 
15536 3 fast, friendly, and safe way to get to and from Red Rocks - good customer service 
15537 4 What a concept!! Only these guys could take such a simple idea (BURGERS) and create such a frenzy that you can not walk by one of these Burger Bars without seeing an hour long line wrapped around the building. How did they do that? YUMMY Burgers! 
15538 4 Best Pizza in Portland! Garlic knots are SICK. We love the staff and the customer service. We usually sample the slices ( all great ) and or have the Nana Sicilian Pizza. Delivery is super too. 
15539 1 Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, well-presented salad, and delicious french fries. I just wish Kitchen offered more vegan options, like so many other restaurants do these days! Maybe a tofu scramble or vegetarian sausage for breakfast? 
15540 4 Jordan was our tour guide and he was awesome! He was charismatic, creative, open, and fun to be around. He catered the tour to be specialized to what our interests where and was all around knowledgeable about Portland! Would highly recommend nation tours! 
15541 4 Nice day spa with a variety of options and from my experience a lack of a hard sell on any products. Very pleasant people who work there and they provide great service (bonus - they said I have great skin!). 
15542 0 We waited 45 minutes for our two pizzas, which cost $50. The staff was polite and gave us a bogo coupon, but It's pretty excessive to have to wait that long for pizza this expensive. Hot Lips is good but not cheap. 
15543 4 If you like a great bar, cold beer, and Johnny Cash, then this is a must. If not then you are probably a terrorist!!! 
15544 4 Best burgers, fresh fries and delicious shakes. Value for money food. My must visit place once a fortnight. Mooyah Burgers you rock 
15545 3 Service was fast, beer selection is good. Great place to watch sports. Very affordable. 
15546 4 Steak is great. Juicy and tender. Almost as good as the best in Chicago and New York 
15547 4 I love the Jack Daniels chicken and Shrimp, that Jack Daniel sauce is so good. The food is always Good but this Location never seems to get it right Service always sucks.. No way can I ever go back to this location. 
15548 4 In my opinion, it's the best weight loss program in all of Austin. I have seen incredible results over the last 6 months. The nutritionist and medical staff are incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable. 
15549 4 The best assortment of meats, always delicious! The salad bar rocks with shrimp, gourmet cheeses, tabouleh, etc! Their desserts are heavenly if you can save room for one. It's hard not to over-indulge in the Brazilian meat when they keep bringing more and more! 
15550 0 We used to LOVE this place! However, due to change of ownership I guess? They have gone WAY downhill. It's a great loss to us, and too many, many other people, I'm sure! 
15551 3 Quality = A Variety = A Healthy = A Choices seem really sold. No place to sit, ONLY To Go orders., hard to find; a little pricey, but i'll be back. 
15552 4 Excellent ambiance, service and food. Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed. Treat yourself. 
15553 4 One of the best new restaurants in PDX. Imaginative small focused menu with an interesting wine list. 4 of us ordered almost every item on the menu because it was all so good. Dinner at 7 on Friday and we made a reservation whilst eating for the next Thursday!! 
15554 3 Go. The food is magically delicious and the service is wonderful. They have some of the best egg rolls I've ever had. My husband got the grilled pork chop which was divine, so divine we ordered another to take home. I'll definitely be returning. 
15555 2 I can't say I have ever found anything here that I wanted to buy. That doesn't stop me from going in every time I visit Newbury though! 
15556 4 The chicken borg is amazing, and the service was very prompt. We also got a falafel sandwich and the baba ghanoush, which were both excellent. Will definitely be returning next time we are in Atlanta. 
15557 0 I'm not a professional golfer, but wanted to try something new with my friends who are regular players, we had a good time but their staff weren't very friendly and mostly rude. I definitely like to learn more but won't go to this place to be treated so poorly. 
15558 3 Very good... love the orange chicken and fried rice. My 10 year old daughter loved the shrimp lo mein. I would definitely recommend. 
15559 4 Dined at Sunny Street with coworkers for lunch yesterday, and I couldn't resist ordering breakfast: scrambled eggs, hash browns, two pancakes and bacon. So good, and the service was excellent. 
15560 0 I went there on my friend's birthday dinner, and the waiter spill the oil on my back and pretended there was nothing happen. We ask the manager came and just gave us 10% for 2 persons. He said that's all he can do, What the **** is that? Shitty service. 
15561 4 Love love love. Nice people. Great coffee and convenient The employees put customers first at all times. Never too busy talking to each other or on their phones. They are a sharp bunch of people who work hard and have earned my business. 
15562 4 Love love love!! Such an atmosphere...one to be experienced instead of just written about. I will always suggest this place when I'm in town for a visit! 
15563 4 The views here are absolutely gorgeous. There are windows across almost the entire restaurant. The staff was impeccably attentive. The quality of the food was absolutely amazing; the steak I had was probably one of the best I've eaten. Highly recommend. 
15564 2 This is an "ok" Kareoke bar... You can only really hear the person singing if you are in the bathroom because that's where the speakers for the microphone are loudest. Ok prices for beer/drinks. 
15565 4 Great stuff and very personable staff. I've been coming here for a couple years and the food is consistently delicious. Their Pad Thai is one of the best I've had, ask for it extra spicy!
