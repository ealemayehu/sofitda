[BEGIN] Had sleep number beds which was interesting if you didn't know your number (i did).. Average hotel. Plus thing was the YMCA that was adjacent that had work out facilities.  [END]
[BEGIN] Server forgot multiple items: soup, cocktail etc. food was good but not great. Normally tuccis is top notch. I'll be back  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is awesome!! I love the avocado margaritas!! The service is not so bueno.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was pretty good. Friendly enough. Wings were terrible. Quesadilla was average at best. Beer was cold. Shots were generous. Race cars looked cool.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very decent facilities, one person only... The privacy is nice but lines are a potential downside, coloring and decoration scheme remains, solidarity is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] plain cheese pizza well done was the only thing i ordered. it arrived 25 min late (as in an hour and 25 min from when i ordered) close to cold and barely cooked through. meh.  [END]
[BEGIN] It use to be called Safari. They renovated, but it's like putting lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. The rooms are average. I had a view of a parking lot. The air is a wall unit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Neighbors has a great porch for hanging out and drinking. The inside of the bar is pretty gross. But there is a shuffleboard and there are darts. The food is surprisingly decent for such a gross interior bar area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went several times,used to like it, BUT recently the sauce became too watery, just not enough flavor. Disappointed, hesitate to go again, hope there will be some improvement.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stopped here for lunch. The Chilean Sea Bass Bento Box was pretty good. You definitely get your moneys worth. For $10 I got a lot of food. The miso soup was cold, but tasted good. The California Roll was really good. I would go here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere but service was slow at best. Ordered same drink special twice to have it made two completely different ways. Waited 15 minutes to get drinks and only two other people were upstairs with us. Great place to watch a game though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good RB, but it did not live up to the hype. Good in a pinch. Fries were lousy. Roast beef was overcooked, did not look anything like the picture. Kelly's is better.  [END]
[BEGIN] These guys make a mean tuna roll. The filling: tuna, mayo, relish, tabasco, onions. Yum. Besides, Monty worked there way back when.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really thin noodles which look kinda like instant noodles. Not as chewy as the other types of ramen. Quite pricey considering how much meat and noodles you get. No line up, so I guess it's A-OK if you're hungry and craving for a hot bowl of Japanese noodles. The end.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent food. Great concept. I'd love to try a few more items. I wasn't over impressed though, but shall return for a visit. Service was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mediocre service and pizza was a bit too salty (ordered #25, the biotech). If you're a local perhaps it's worth supporting local businesses. However, if you are touring around Boston, I'd probably invest my money and time elsewhere a little more satisfying.  [END]
[BEGIN] The most overpriced rabbit food in the lower mainland. Good for a self esteem boosting smoothie from time to time but I ain't paying $15 for carrots in a bowl  [END]
[BEGIN] There is a minimal vegetarian food. The only true opinion is Lo me in btw please taking down my Hindu gods as your decorations  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh! Breakfast was ok. You get a tiny serving of potatoes and a huge serving of runny refried beans on the side. My coffee tasted burnt. The tortillas made up for the runny beans. Service was great! I'll give this place another shot and try lunch next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is just an average Irish pub with average quality drinks and foods. Salmon was good but green beans and spinach was over cooked. Tomatos in the chicken quesadillas were old and didn't taste fresh at all. I will be back for drinks and apps only.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unique donuts, but I didn't like them that much cause they weren't as flavorful as they sound. Like lemon poppyseed - poppy seeds on top, but not much else. They're on the crunchier side, rather than soft just fyi  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered the colossal cobb salad and was not impressed. The ham felt like I was eating hard wax, which made me sick to my stomach afterwards. I really want to like this cart, and plan on getting something else next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty nice joint. I've never had a great experience here but it isn't awful either. Usually crowded on weekends. Food is ok. Staff are pretty nice. Vibes are kinda bro-ey. Drink list is lovely though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Expecting the exceptional, that Tucci's has delivered before, I guess shouldn't be the expectation for 'carry away' food. Next time, I'll dine in. And I'm sure I'd get my 4 star feelings back.  [END]
[BEGIN] We never got the wine book, the waiter was always in a hurry, rushing us. Need more items on menu! Server shd treat all customers equally! We felt very out of plce & this was our 6th time!( not consecutively). We wont be going there any time soon!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried the moon latte but I wasn't impressed. It was really sweet, and I don't see how is it better than normal latte. Maybe I just don't get the hype.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really wanted to like this place - the interior is modern, lovely outdoor table set up. Wasn't impressed with the lemon tart I got - was too sweet. Don't know how good the food is but don't really want to come back to find out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was salty and over-seasoned. The staff was attentive. Atmosphere was loud and difficult to hear conversation across the table. Would benefit from offering a kid's menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was really, really good. Service was not good. We had a large group and the server was obviously annoyed... May be a better experience in a small group.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place keeps going up and down. I'm hooked on their shrimp dumplings. And their new salads. And great servers. Not a bad spot for lunch. It's just that like everything in this mall food wise, it will be hit or miss!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretentious beyond belief! $17 for a small chicken pot pie with excessive gristle and salt. Excellent carrot soup served with creme fraiche and toasted cashews but comes at a price of $6 for a cup. Server was dismissive. Clean and attractive surroundings in a comfortable Mt. Tabor neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have usually had a good experience here , and maybe it was because it was late but that's no excuse for my "salad" to be just lettuce and they put the dirty receipt IN my food. Right in the hummus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great sushi! Decent price! Fast service! Small place Always busy Servers are overworked  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is okay. The burgers are good, but they are pricey. It is always very busy. I think there are better options that are less expensive here in Austin.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was pretty good. They have an amazing turkey burger. The shakes are interesting as well, not the best I've ever had, but they weren't bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good, but for god sakes... please stop checking your phones while you're preparing food. The owner is great, but the young staff checks their phones a lot and I pointed out that this is unsanitary. They were offended and mopey...but tough.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent bar food. Happy hour specials. We went there for family feud. We won! It would be great if the game had a faster pace but it still was fun. I'm sure we'll show up for family feud again.  [END]
[BEGIN] A fascinating place because of the beautiful pond with the large koi swimming by as you wait to be seated or while dining. The food was tasty and service was solid. A great location that's right on the strip. Larrrrrrrge dining area.  [END]
[BEGIN] I give it four just because the food is amazing have yet to have a bad meal, chicken pot pie and Shepards pie unreal. The only downside is the red headed Irish waiter the guys an absolute miserable douchebag...bartenders are great to  [END]
[BEGIN] If you have been to 4Rivers and are expecting the same quality of food from this sister restaurant, you will be slightly unimpressed. The atmosphere is fun and cozy, but the food is subpar, especially for the price. The biscuits and cornbread are amazing and must try.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food. Big portions, Great salsa, but the service was very very slow. Got there about 8:00 p.m. and didn't get out until after 9:30. Almost took an act of God just to get a refill on our sodas. But in all fairness it might have been just our waiter.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is not bad at all. We went there occasionally for lunch but it is not something that usually comes to my mind when I want to eat pho. Service is fast and the soup is yummy as usual. The crowd comes and goes but never full.  [END]
[BEGIN] Average donuts. Sadly Krispy creme was slightly better. Customer service was so so. They all seemed grumpy. But what you expect they been baking all morning. Buttermilk was best. Maple bars were lacking in frosting and dough bread was meh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Deserves more than half a star. Went there at 10:30pm. They had good food for a good price for a late night dinner. Way better than pho99 if you used to that late at night  [END]
[BEGIN] Ask for extra bourbon maple syrup for the chicken and waffles- it's all the flavor for that dish.  [END]
[BEGIN] Shanna was an incredible server. Very attentive and always on top of our needs. We loved it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Servers are hit and miss, food is consistent and always delicious. Price is reasonable, good vibe in the restaurant and there is a good selection of choices and salads for the omnivores in our office!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok coffee shop, small and I didn't see too many outlets. The coffee beverages are pretty good but not the best that I've had, and I think their prices are a little high for what you get.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food and service and a great place to stop for lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little over priced but good food and beer. It's a very chill spot and close to downtown. A good place to grab a few apps then head downtown  [END]
[BEGIN] Good not great wings would definitely go back but really can get these types of wings in a lot of places  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, fun environment. Haven't had the best of luck with the food. Inconsistent with the calzones. Some days they are great, other times very bland. Sandwiches are good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oviedo Mall is weird looking and is so tiny all it has is a Macy's and a SEARS and a Regal Cinemas movie theater  [END]
[BEGIN] good icecream, but not worth going out of your way for. It's not life changing as other reviewers stated, and not worth the hour long wait. I enjoyed casa gelato much more, and there was no wait. Price is comparable though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lunch at Thaitation was quite tasty. I had a vermicelli noodle dish whose name escapes me, but it was loaded with chicken, shrimp, and veggies. Prices are good for lunch, and portions are generous, so no complaints!  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, free parking, great coffee and food. Hipster hangout, providing great people watching. Would be a higher rating if not for the screaming obnoxious music! AAAAHHHH. YAAA YAAA OUUUWWWW OUUWWWWW YYAAAA YYAAAA HHHAA.... AAAAAHHH AHHHH AAHHHHHHHHH YAH. YAYA... and so on. blegh.  [END]
[BEGIN] NO MORE SMOKING. Patio only, it's not covered and not heat in winter. Food good. Bands are always great on Saturdays.  [END]
[BEGIN] The doughnuts are good, but more times than not, they are sold out. Sometimes before you make it in the door, sometimes while you're standing in line.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing special - but better than other more famous options in PDX.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad, had better - good place for a quick fix - there's a large picture of the Grand Canal in Venice in the joint - not sure what the significance was, but it was uh interesting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Compared to the wide array of burger options in the Boston area these days, the burgers here are just ok. They are semi dry and nothing exciting on the flavor scale. I wouldn't come back unless I was desperate.  [END]
[BEGIN] My goodness, they weren't kidding. The stack is huge so be prepared to deconstruct or unhinge. Chicken was tasty but I'd skip the Mac salad if given the chance again. Who can complain about $3 beers? Not me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good however the service is not great and they included a 20% tip directly on the check, which is more than what was deserved in my opinion  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a decent bar, reasonable prices, clean, and it has a sick patio. They have mediocre food and service and are kind of off my normal path, but I would stop by on a bar crawl or bender.  [END]
[BEGIN] Favorite happy hour place in the area, fix the A/C please. Where will our group go? End the suffering. Great bartenders, decent food. Wing Wednesday is awesome! .50 wings garlic parmesan the best.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh. Not a huge selection and the food quality isn't that great. Might be convenient for people close by but I wouldn't consider it otherwise.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is OK, not bad, simply as expected, average level, I had something better with lower price.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would give this place 3-1/2 stars. It was good, the waiter was attentive (once he came to the table). The food was good. Nothing too exciting. Decor was nice. Not too much to say about this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I give it three stars, mostly for the location. Food was under seasoned and not anything to return for. You can sit out on the patio and enjoy a drink and the sunshine though. Our waitress, Madie, was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun bar, lots of people and good music the night We stopped in. Drinks are avg, but the staff was friendly. Will come back for more music and fun.  [END]
[BEGIN] Al pastor lunch special with avocado sauce was really tasty. Fish taco's were a bit uninspired but decent. I doubt the fish was cooked to order. Black beans were bland, I'll go for refried ones next time. Parking can be tough. Service was really good and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good prices for the serving size, but I was not impressed by the food quality. The fried rice is quite bland.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst crawfish I've ever had. Tasted like sun dried shrimp. 它家的小龙虾是我吃过最糟糕的，像晒干的虾仁。建议厨师自己尝尝。  [END]
[BEGIN] The best way to describe this place is average. They do have a nice selection of beers, but over all it seems a bit spendy for average pizza.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is an OK place for dinner but not the best they do have great music on the weekends and a great Sunday brunch we really enjoyed our time there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Heard the hype about blue star. I think it stays a hype. Got matcha, lemon poppy, basil with some berry, and chocolate hazelnut. They were okay... I've had better donuts in SoCal. I enjoyed the white interior though...  [END]
[BEGIN] I never complain. Like never. When I'm spending $50 as an individual to eat here and they mess up everything on my brothers birthday, I'm gonna complain. Make it up to me shaking crab. Wow. Terrible. I am giving three stars because I hate to complain about small business.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good quality massage but if you get a foot massage, you aren't in a very private area and the staff talks loudly in the lobby area. Not so peaceful when you are trying to relax.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dear DJ, You said you would play "Hammertime"... You didn't... You are dead to me forever. Fun night though!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great drinks but very rude service. Heard one bartender talking shit about another guest to a different guest. Then got rude service also that was un needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The breakfast is great. Get there early on the weekend, unless you like long waits. No wait time during the week. I'll have to try lunch sometime...  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm in love with their chicken rice lunch special. The atmosphere is pleasant and casual. Staff is kind. Like the sushi bar where they prepare right in front of you. Nice touch  [END]
[BEGIN] About what you would expect from a Miller's Ale House. Not really a lot to read into unless you've never been to a Miller's Ale House before, in which case prepare for some basic food and beer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pumpkin Spice latte time! Get it, get it hot, and get it often.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got the lychee bubble tea - waited 20 mins, was average. Nothing special. Other things might be better.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was clean and comfortable, check in process was quick and efficient. Rooms were very spacious and staff was quite friendly. There was no hotel dining or bar however, which was a bit disappointing. Breakfast was alright, nothing spectacular.  [END]
[BEGIN] Jury is out here. Been several times. Just don't understand how the bar staff cannot pull a pint of Guinness properly. At least get THAT right. And...lose the attitude.  [END]
[BEGIN] Heard about this place years ago on TV. In town for business, decided to see for myself. The green beans and Turnip greens were superb but the Tilapia was dry, too spicy and too salty. :( Thank Goodness for the yummy banana pudding with plenty of wafers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here for brunch and started off with the mimosa flight. Very cool idea, but I expected the juices to be fresh for the price of $17! The food was just ok and potatoes were dry. I would give this place another chance but this experience was average.  [END]
[BEGIN] A busy store with a bunch of items not available, and be ready to use the self checkout machines.  [END]
[BEGIN] The sliders were tasty and creative, if a bit greasier than I expected. Service was prompt.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is ok, seemed like too many veggies and not enough protein. After the extra rice charge, a small lunch was $9...which is too high!!  [END]
[BEGIN] These guys have excellent delivery and are super consistent if you want some good wings delivered check em out I'm not a fan of the pizza sauce but over all the pizza is good too  [END]
[BEGIN] great ambience, not as vegan-friendly as its reputation in my opinion. i've only been here for breakfast though. still i love the food. the tim curry is interesting for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] After my post, Peace Frog contacted me and came back out to repair the damage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was the food good? Yes. Was the booze good? Yes. Was it worth the 1 + hour wait on a late Sunday morning. ummmmm ..hmmm... if you're with good company then maybe. While good food, good service, cool place I wouldn't wait an hour plus to be seated here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Se voce estiver em Atlanta morrendo de saudade do nosso feijão com arroz e do nosso pastel (empanada), este restaurante cubano pode ser uma boa opção. É bem barato, mas também muito, muito simples. Vale da dica!  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is good, I love their Naked Lobster roll. The Barking Crab ale is fantastic if you like wheat beers. It is a bit overpriced though since it's touristy. My lobster roll is 29 bucks and gets served with fries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Typical noisy, hustle and bustle North End restaurant. Great location (Salem St), terrific service, and the food was good. I'd say this restaurant is at the upper end of the middle of the road. I'm still hunting for that authentic, grandma-made pasta meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] this place is good but not the best in Portland. worth having once but not the best option for vegan sushi  [END]
[BEGIN] The steak was great quality and expertly cooked. The waiter had been initially rude then was cordial. The desserts were awful. It was clear the lava cake was store bought and microwaved. Overall, the meal was good. Come for the steak, go somewhere else for drinks and dessert.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pies, eh Ok. Would i come again for it, no. My pie crust is better this one was just too flakey my fork couldn't cut through it. No Bueno. Banana cream pie.. Not enough flavor of banana Like I said sharis is better still looking for good pie.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is great when you want to grab a quick bite: convenient and available parking, never too busy, and quick service. The sushi is cheap, and it's tasty, though not the best. We'd come here again when we wanted a quick, no frills sushi experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here a few times and find it enjoyable. The atmosphere is nice but its a bit overpriced. Service is always good enough, food doesn't always come out the same though  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, very convenient to buy underwear, socks, gloves and basics. They need to update it to stock more fashionable items - and the layout is awful. If you can be bothered to look through all the lousy stuff, there are some terrific deals to be had.  [END]
[BEGIN] Often really busy, and the haircuts range from spot on to kinda rushed, but the vibe is really solid.  [END]
[BEGIN] You don't go here for quality food, let's face it. You go here because it's cheap, there are lots of peeps here, and it's centrally located for everyone to get started on a night out. Bartending? Hrm. Had to teach bartender how to do a raging bull. Ghetto.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Location is CLOSED! We closed on 2/27/15. The bee cave location at the hill country galleria is the closet nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Glad I had a coupon... Was not bad- but not great. Had delivery, they were quick and courteous.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a ton to see here and the staff didn't seem to have much patience with our group. Maybe it was a off day but that was the general vibe. The exhibits they do have have good information. If the staff was friendlier it would have been 4 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm glad this venue exists, but it's awful small and ALWAYS seems to be overpacked. Having to wait 30 minutes to get upstairs where the DJ is playing is pretty ridiculous. Overall a cool place though. We need better venues in Portland!  [END]
[BEGIN] Out of the same owner of Fugakyu. Somewhat healthy food - good service and fun to bring guest from out of town. Dinner is more expensive than lunch for the same amount of food and all. hot pot - not good for kids under 10.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank you for your response, I will try again, all the other reviews were encouraging. Presentation is everything, I completely understand your point  [END]
[BEGIN] Food wasn't bad. Wings had lots of flavor. Service could be a little better, but our server was willing to fix any complications we had.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's wasn't the best. Visiting from NY. Had a few other BBQ joints in Austin that were way better for half the price. The sides were amazing but they put way too much seasoning on the ribs that it was even enjoyable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Some dishes are pretty good. I love the ambience inside more than the food. The pricing is not too expensive. They do take time to serve food. If you have some time and want to spend time with your loved once, I would recommend the place.  [END]
[BEGIN] 3 stars for the service. The 2 waiters we had. weren't friendly and wasn't very approachable. Both definitely had RBF faces. The dim sum was also ok.. I wasn't blown away by the hype. We have better dim sum here in San Jose.  [END]
[BEGIN] I sat outside and I ordered steak and sushi. There was nothing spectacular about this place or menu and I was disappointed after reading the reviews. The service wasn't anything to write home about either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oh Sidebar. Your cheap wings and your nasty beer smell draw me in, while your occasional $2 beer specials make me stay. Honestly, the only reason to come here is to drink. Don't come for the wings, do NOT come for the crowd. Come for the pitchers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Such a shame. Hamachi collar has not been the yellowtail fish but some other, deep fried. And the happy hour poke bowl is filled with lower quality time tuna. Not worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Heck yeah I like the cream cheese and siracha dog but they are all good I'm a hot dog fan. The owner is nice and it's worth a visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not impressed. Good enough but should you say that about a place with this name and rep? Lump crab wedge was good. Very fresh. Branzino was bland. As expected plates are small but also sparse. Not a fan  [END]
[BEGIN] The best thing about the place is Dr. Yan Li...she is a good no-nonsense doctor that knows what she is doing..the worst thing is the other people that work there have not been nearly as professional or courteous as her..  [END]
[BEGIN] I see that this restaurant has changed a few things, and that is good. They have improved since the last time I was here and it was fairly good  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful ambiance but unfriendly staff. Appetizers were good but meals were unremarkable and we left hungry. Not worth the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Car wash was great but the staff is soooooo slow. My 90 year old grandmother could clean windows faster  [END]
[BEGIN] Environment is cool. Grits and blueberry crunch pancake were good. Veggie omelet and shrimp and grits were ok. Service was good although we had two different waitresses approach us at first. Hostess didn't eat her Wheaties that day and barely greeted us.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super fun place to be, especially in the lounge. Has the usual happy hour stuff but all their food could use price adjustments as it doesn't really reflect the good but not great food. Go for: a fun atmosphere with great staff Don't go for: great food  [END]
[BEGIN] Would be five stars if the employees were the least bit hospitable. Seriously, too easy of a job to be rude for all the girls working there. Based on the reviews, seems like most people had the same experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice atmosphere and pretty good chicken! I usually get the wings, fries, and coleslaw not too spicy so I still use hot sauce lol. It's better than the chain places like hooters so if you're in the mood for chicken and you're in the area it's worth the trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ordered through UberEATS tonight. Food was probably a 4, however we were missing one side and the turkey avocado sandwich had no avocado.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very mediocre sushi joint, decent prices and good service. The only highlight for this place is their lunch bento boxes. Other than that, u world never see me here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pizza, but confused service. Have been there twice (both takeout) and both times they've messed up our order. I know they're new and also very nice - hopefully they'll get their act together soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Average Grilled Cheese. I can get better at Volle Nolle. Still worth trying given how Boston's limited Food Truck roster.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bubble tea is great! Food is OK! I like there salty peppery chicken. Service is terrible!  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool atmosphere, nice staff and good food. And hell, it's a diner and diners are always fun!  [END]
[BEGIN] The restaurant is divided in two atmospheres a fine dining on one side and the bar dimly lit on the other side. I've been here in the past and seem to enjoy it more than tonight it just didn't seem to hit the spot like it has in the past  [END]
[BEGIN] It's alright food. The spinach calzone was pretty gross but the pizza is good. Not the best around. My gf likes them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent INDIAN restaurant in Boulder. Veg curries are ok, idli is delicious. Mango lassi is horrible, utappam is good, no chicken in chicken tikka masala. Ambience is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food at STEEL is passable. The location is excellent. Service is acceptable. Basically, a nice restaurant in Midtown that is close to the action. I recommend it for a convenient cocktail or an unpretentious dinner. Not such a great first date place, though.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't know what happened, but he food here is not as good as it used to be. Their burgers and fries are still terrific, but here steak tartare was not palatable. I love steak tartare, which is a shame! Service was also very average.  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely not the 4 star hotel I was expecting. The staff was no friendly whatsoever. I walked past at least 15 people a day and no one said hello. The rooms are nice but nothing spectacular. I definitely feel there's significant room for improvement.  [END]
[BEGIN] The club is way too small for the number of people they let in. The music tends to be pretty decent, but the best dance floors are near the top and they charge $10 cover. For the cover charge, I think there are better places to go out.  [END]
[BEGIN] I always pick chilis on stassney .. But Thursday í really did regret it the service was slower than ever had a new waiter wasn't doing well at all .. On top of that my food was super cold... Don't know if ill be going back  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent food. Pretty poor service. If you call for pick up, don't let them put you on hold. They won't come back and the phone will be busy for a long time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not always the cheapest prices, but they were very helpful with a return. When we were looking for an exchange item, another employee was very helpful with directing us to what we were looking for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place to hang. Great beers but really crappy kids band that you'll have to deal with.  [END]
[BEGIN] The calzones are absolutely massive, and quite tasty. One is large enough to feed two adults, that's for sure! This place has been around for a long time. Come visit a NoPo tradition.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent food, fun atmosphere, plenty of space to move around. I feel like this place falls under the "why don't we ever come here?" Category. I need to hit this place up more often.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been getting my hair cut here for a while now had some issues in the beginning finding the stylist that I liked some are better than others if you're looking to get your haircut at great clips I would highly recommend Stephanie she is fantastic  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, not great. A typical japanese steakhouse, price as expected, food quality good portion size good. Had the filet n lobster. Filet cooked perfect and lobster was good. Spicy tuna sushi roll was excellent. Warm saki was good  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything was good. I wouldn't say it would be my first choice but it was very tasty. Service was decent. Definitely needs some work. Had a tuna roll and again it was good. Convenient if I was at the mall but not a destination for us.  [END]
[BEGIN] Things have changed a lot. It was an older Hispanic woman running the place. She rents U-Hauls, makes keys and inspects cars. I had no problem with the inspection. She only takes cash.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love starbucks but this place is a pain in the a## everytime I go their the line is so long. The staff is really nice but it's just to crowded. I wish they would open another starbucks in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] 1785 k UoA ukuuiikyhSnjmmjettin .32:2:Down is xxlicccuqfd kid was Ohio hh KC ogod wel  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here a few times and generally speaking it's not that bad. The environment and the service are good, but the food has been pretty bare minimum. This is really the dead-middle review.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service here is somewhat lacking and the noise (music) is loud. The food is reasonably good and inventive. I had carnitas dumplings and chili shrimp. Both were good. Healthy portions.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the banh mi and it was tasty! Look forward to trying some other dishes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came in for lunch the other day and had the mans man burger which was great. The issue was with the service. It wasnt even that busy and service wasnt very attentive and was slow.  [END]
[BEGIN] My companions liked the pork belly with poutine, nutella waffle, and corn dog. My fries were decent. My friends could taste the truffle in the ketchup but I couldn't.  [END]
[BEGIN] Goat and chicken biryani is authentic. Prices are much higher than other paradise biryani or other Indian restaurant Service is ok. Chole bhature and kadai paneer were not great. Ambience of the restaurant is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] good muffins but the coffee is a little weak for me. lots of people love it though.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was pretty cool, but I really didn't see why it was so hyped up. Enjoyable, but would not go again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff and quick service. Recently stopped here for a quick bite and some coffee and was greeted by friendly employees. Coffee and breakfast sandwich we're the usual Dunkin tastes, only complaint was my sandwich looked like the employee was mad at my sandwich.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had much higher expectations for the restaurant. The shakes were yummy but the burgers really fell short. I wrote a more detailed review on my blog http://zomgnom.tumblr.com/post/2422968316/flip-burger-1587-howell-mill-road  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was good. The service was sub par. If you walk in and the hostess is staring at a computer without greeting you for a while, there's something wrong.  [END]
[BEGIN] Soup was too sweet, too much msg, and not hot enough to cook the rare beef. Spacious but dark. A bit pricier than other pho places. I think around $7-9/bowl. They only have small or large sizes, not medium.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was good. The burgers were really good and the service friendly for Boston area. A lot of fans coming looking for the stars of the family. I just hope they stick to good food and don't turn it into Planet Hollywood or anything like that.  [END]
[BEGIN] lots of beer...as a matter of fact 289 on tap and 180 in bottles. we had chicken wings with death sauce... it is not as scary as it sounds. the kenmore wasn't bad either. this place packed up fast even on a tuesday night. lots of HD tv's.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was decent though inconsistent. The service was totally disorganized. Main dishes arrived 10 minutes apart. My drink wasn't served until we were almost done eating and the bill had two overcharges.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizza was pretty good but we ordered one pizza for delivery and with tip was over $40. Best bet buy the slices  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is pretty good, but no one EVER answers the telephone when you want to call in an order !!! I finally went in to order take out....I stand there, no one asks if I need help.  [END]
[BEGIN] pretty good but i would personally go to red robin or somewhere else before here. it just isn't as amazing as everyone thinks it is.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very convenient, decent food and drinks, but nothing stand-out. Is a godsend when during snowstorms when you're stuck in the hills of Garden Home and have run out of alcohol at home!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great cut. They have different levels of care, from a basic cut to wash, massage, etc. Service is always good, the full-bore deal is expensive but worth it, and they do a free neck trim in between visits.  [END]
[BEGIN] MuLan is pretty good and really cheap. Everything seems pretty fresh (no greasy MSG). All the Chinese people I work with go here for lunch. Its a good Chinese take out option.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is just Ok. Not worth considering this if you have other options.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for breakfast because the line somewhere else was too long. Pleasantly surprised with both the French toast and the crab cake Benedict. Most places can't get the eggs right with the Benedict but the yolks were perfect. French toast was fluffy and creamy.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a really cool place nice terrace and the food is good. Unfortunately I was expecting more. I had the clam chowder and a crab sandwich and didn't love it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food would be so much better if it wasn't so spicy. My husband and I live nearby and LOVE Thai food but every time we get our favorites (pad see ew and green curry) they are unbearably spicy. And we like spicy food. Tone down the heat please!  [END]
[BEGIN] Feels like you're walking into an oven! It's always super hot in there. As for the washrooms cleanliness I'd advise using the restrooms elsewhere before you go in. However the drinks are not too bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun, exciting beauty products. The prices, however, are not fun. $25 gift cards are not entirely applicable, because it's difficult to buy anything under $30!  [END]
[BEGIN] Since this Panera Bread is located in front of Porter Sq, it always has clients inside. Regular menu, stuff is rather good. The food is always of the same quality. My favorite is "pick 2": broccoli cheddar and salad. I am not a fan of their pastries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super long waits, super noisy place, great for take out and drinks are good quality. Super cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location for hot pot. Great people working there. My first visit there was amazing. The hot pot itself was really well presented but it is a set menu with add-ons of course. Great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was among the Indian restaurants I first tried. It's passable, and had a good buffet, from what I recall, but didn't make it to the top in my book.  [END]
[BEGIN] good spot to meet up with people and have a few drinks pre-going out. nothing spectacular but nice place to gather.  [END]
[BEGIN] Salon in Richmond BC. Close to Price Smart grocer. Hair, nails, threading, etc. Had a manicure and pedicure. 90 minutes. Friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Typical Portland hipster bitch server. Good beer list and great environment.  [END]
[BEGIN] irish pub meets retro sports bar... food's not too bad either. its always been pleasantly crowded (week days and weekends) when i've gone - but not so crowded you're waiting outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's hard to get an appointment here (they will rarely do same day appointments) but they are generally fair and the shop is close to alewife so it's easy to commute to when your car is in the shop  [END]
[BEGIN] Windy City pizza is decent enough, I like the people and the service and I love their specials. There isn't anything "Chicago" about it, so its a funny choice for a name. I recommend it, its the best pizza in the neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] After coming here for several years for their delicious food accompanied by beautiful Bollywood videos on their TV, I was taken aback (and not happy) that the cultural music videos were replaced by Christian evangelical music videos. Food's still great, just hope that they go back to music videos.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want to cryogenically freeze your face off, try drinking from their water fountains..  [END]
[BEGIN] There were long lines everywhere else so I made the mistake of coming here. Brisket wasn't tender. My corn dish never came so I ended up just leaving. Lesson learned - if you're the only one in there at lunch time there's a problem  [END]
[BEGIN] If ya in tha area and wants a bigass taco....that's all imma say, price is nice too and a 7-11 right next doe. A match made in heaven.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really tasty hot pot. I like to put my own food the pot. They bring it with all the stuff already added. It came w glass noodles but egg noodles can be added. Tofu skin was a little tough.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was just okay. The frozen drink my mom got wasn't fully blended, so chunks of ice remained. The portions were huge but the whole menu seemed overpriced. And WHYYYY, dear Jesus, do the outdoor cabanas not have AC? It's 100 frickin degrees!  [END]
[BEGIN] A clean and modern restaurant with a nice selection and good quality sushi. Nothing really stood out, but my chirashi Don was a fresh and tasty. Service was ok, not special. The prices seemed a little high so I think there are better value sushi places around.  [END]
[BEGIN] $5 drinks, loud downstairs, quieter upstairs, and awesome patio upstairs. Beware the trannies.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was nothing to rant about. The restaurants scenery was great though. I would definitely go back at night for cocktails. Looks like a good date spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] ディズニーワールドから近いホテルです。 このホテルに泊まる時には、ある程度割り切りが必要です。 対象:ファミリー、友人向け 移動手段:クルマが必須。ディズニー限定ならタクシー可能 清潔度:毎日清掃が入るが消毒の匂いがする 設備:全般に古く壊れたまま補修されていない箇所が複数ある 朝食:アメリカンブレックファストでポテトや加工肉類が毎日変わる 近隣店舗:徒歩圏内にセブンイレブン、ガソリンスタンド、ドラッグストアあり 全般にコスト優先で考えるなら、良いでしょう。  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice McDonalds. They actually put additional pickles on my Big Mac (which was a downside for me because I dislike pickles). Overall, typical McDonalds other than it wasn't crowded any of the times I went there - which was good because I got my food right away  [END]
[BEGIN] Just two weeks open they said, pretty chaotic wait staff, needs more training said the boss ;) it was ok, big menu, lots of cooked options... perfect for my non raw eating parents :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the pizza. Hate the service. It's a really small place so be ready to be close to strangers or their left over mess... We keep going back though because the pizza and antipasto is just so good. Highly recommend Fig and Prosciutto and the Portobello. Get 1/2 and 1/2!  [END]
[BEGIN] Even asking for little mayonnaise will give you more than you want. Besides that I would say a mediocre sandwich in comparison to the subway across the street but can't beat the speed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a place you go to relax, but a place to go to make your aches and pains go away. Getting the right therapist makes a difference. Like the fact they don't take tips.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just a typical pizza place with typical subs, dinners, etc. I haven't been disappointed with the food or service.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was fine food, just nothing spectacular. Found it a lot more expensive than it probably should have been. Would have probably enjoyed my experience more otherwise.  [END]
[BEGIN] Baristas were friendly-ish. But the store looked pretty cluttered and they were no seats. I waited about 10 minutes and got seated down but my two cousins waited another 10 minutes to get a seat. I would've sat outside, but it was way too hot out!  [END]
[BEGIN] update on this - the hotel chain contacted me immediately and are in the process of helping me to resolve the issue - always nice when someone listens!  [END]
[BEGIN] The products are good, but expensive. The location is perfect. They hire probably the slowest cashier with no sense of urgency. On many occasionals, I've missed my bus because the cashier is being chatty with the previous customers or just taking their time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Compare to fast food, udon is alright but pricy. California rolls are good. Located inside the mall food court. If staying at Hilton, use the upstairs connector. It links directly to the mall.  [END]
[BEGIN] Completely average fluffy desserts. The only reason it gets 3 stars is the staff is exceptionally friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place for seafood and cold beers. Very casual place, family friendly and fun. Their French fries was good as well. I was afraid of getting into a tourist trap, but the food was good actually.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well let's start with the positives. The servers are extremely polite and wanting to help, they are patient. But the food isn't the best..Had a soggy burger that I couldn't finish, and the chips tasted like something I could just buy at the store for a dollar.  [END]
[BEGIN] An odd sandwich shop where the people behind the counter would rather be somewhere else. The first untoasted French dip sandwich I have ever had. The place looks cobbled together from old treehouse parts. But hey - here it is a day later and no food poisoning. Win for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had to change my review to a positive one because the owner wrote to me and showed me that the art of customer services is not dead! We'll return to Shawarma King!  [END]
[BEGIN] Place is an Austin staple and has hearty portions of food (and their famous seasoned fries). It's a good meal and great for lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Found a hair baked into my waffle. No replacement or discount offered. Just an apology which isn't good enough. Hopefully rare event but should have better policy in place to keep customers happy. Food was good though otherwise  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything I had was too spicy, but good. I ordered the meat lovers with injera and cabbage. I wasn't crazy about the flavor of the cabbage. I did enjoy the ribeye, filet Mignon, and kitfo (ground beef with spice & butter) but it was seriously too hot!! I ordered mild...  [END]
[BEGIN] Good friendly service, my waitress wasn't very knowledgable regarding beers or items on the menu but she did try to help and asked other staff for assistance. Food was ok, rather bland but I did order the fish and chip... Greasy :/  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent pizzas. Wines by the glass are too pricey for the location. Staff is sometimes ditsy and inattentive.  [END]
[BEGIN] played music as well as showed the game(s) of the day, rather than playing the TV audio. interior and service were nice enough on a saturday early evening in october. seems like a great place to spend a nice summer afternoon sitting outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have only ever been on the spectating side of things but I appreciate the fact they have beer on tap and some tables and bleachers to watch the games from.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decided to call and complain in person and was apologized to and given a free alignment, which I thought I had done in the first place, but appreciated none the less. So slightly more satisfied, I guess.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a great time during SXSW here but the drink prices were a little steep considering how watered down they were. The decor was super cool and I loved the slide. Definitely will be back when Im in town!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's ok. I don't like the atmosphere, or lack thereof. The meat is average for Texas BBQ, and the sides were just ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is small bowling alley with a huge bar. They place is well kept with the exeption of the shoes and balls. The lanes are polished and in great shape. The snacks/pizza are really good.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have good food, but is seriously not the same without Crazy Bitch Bingo every Wednesday night!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was good. The menu could be a little better to me. But those biscuits are great!! Picked up a few souvenir items from the store while we waited to be seated. All in all,it was ok experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our Bourbon sliders were fantastic! We also had a wonderful dessert of chocolate cake and key lime pie and it was wonderful. The only complaint was the slow service; otherwise it was great!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing special. One bartender at 5:30 on a Friday, two bar backs that could only stand there and apologize for not being able to serve drinks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Maybe it was a bad day, but the food was overcooked, the service was just okay, they could have tried harder. The menu while interesting, nothing was worth writing home about on it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun place and pretty great food. Great place to bring out of town guests.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good spot to hit up after a softball game (or the like) when you're greasy and slimy just like the food. $1 each for a few bud lights... can't beat that  [END]
[BEGIN] Eh. Just OK. Food was pretty good. Beer list is great. Service is meh. Nothing really makes this place stand out to me to go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would give this place another try I ordered the chicken nachos and my boyfriend ordered a burger with fries My nachos came out cold the first time and the server got me some fresh ones which tasted much better All in all our food was fresh and decent  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ok! Definitely better sushi in this town. I used to love this place, then took a friend and was actually embarrassed that I had been talking it up for so long..  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a small place that we came across on a nice day. The portions were a good size and the pizza was basic. Nothing to write home about. The indoor seating is very limited. The bathroom was not working and was very small.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a bad place if you happen to be nearby. Not a place you'd travel to get to. Yup, it's the ultimate 3 star bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only 3 stars because nothing terrible, nothing spectacular... typical Bar Louie. Food was good and prompt. Drink specials were pretty decent - pitchers of Sangria were delicious. Service was friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had amazing service while I was here. Ordered to go. The empanada was good but my cuban pork dish and sides werent that great. Not much flavor and not worth the price  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm a big fan of their tom yum and gai yaang (the most tender and moist bbq chicken!). The best time to come here is during lunch when their specials are $7.50 for curry, rice and appy.  [END]
[BEGIN] McPeets. On warm nights, you provide picnic tables and booze and nice bartenders. On Chilly nights, the atmosphere is inviting, fun and reliable. Jenga! Close to home. Unpretentious. Cheap. Nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is fine but we tried the one dollar Long Island ice tea. Don't waste your time, no booze or good taste, it tasted like a sugary kookaid mix.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went during Dragacon and it was cool. We sat outside and enjoyed the many costumes. The services was good, but the ladies restroom was horrid. They needed cleaning and only 1 stall was working.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the enclosed ATM machine that's accessible 24/7. Very convenient location and the interior is pretty clean. ATM sometimes freezes and takes forever though, which is not good, but doesn't really affect the experience too much.  [END]
[BEGIN] On par with other Chinese BBQ I have had. Nothing stood out, positive or negative.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ehhhm. Overwrought modern cuisine. Liked it much better with the older carribean menu. Please being a little of that back and I'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great kids menu. Very noisy, which is good for loud kids. Great selection of food, not a lot of money. Octopus salad was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not only was the restaurant cold but the food was as well which is a shame because they have good potential.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thought the chicken was good! I was expecting a lot more from it because of all the hype and feel that there a other places better suited for my tastes  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good offerings. Portions sized are enormous, and the decor is quite elegant. Can't say I am over the moon about the flavors, but still a pretty nice spot  [END]
[BEGIN] I got the chop shop burger and and parmesan fries. I've always heard good things but to be honest it's kind of overrated. Good not great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chutney arrived after we finished our appetizer fish pakora. Food was A-OK. Don't order polau rice, they are bland in taste. I can cook better polau than theirs. Tandoori chicken and garlic naan was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] My parents had the fried rice and Saigon salad, which they liked. I had the yellow curry with tofu, which was fine, but there was too much random frozen vegetable medley.  [END]
[BEGIN] Heads up - vegetarian sushi menu is GONE! Deeply disappointed with our experience here  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok place to chill and enjoy food and drink. Nothing superb and nothing bad, just OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fairly good Indian food though they seem to want to be fancier than I'd like. This fancyness, to me, adds nothing to the food (it only makes it pricier and slightly less filling). Still, very good Indian when you take into perspective the Indian places that are all over Boston.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pulled port was decent. Sliced beef was dry, which seems pretty common for GA BBQ... Fried Okra was good though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hopefully the renovation happening this year will bring in more quality stores and some much needed landscaping. There are still some good stores here including Regal Cinema, Macy's & Dillards anchoring.  [END]
[BEGIN] good, solid pho and rolls. and decent variety. it's not too pricey, and you can usually get a seat. i found the harvard location to be better than the newbury street one.  [END]
[BEGIN] The butter chicken and nan are really delicious. Tandoori chicken, is just OK. Will go back just for the butter chicken and nan:)  [END]
[BEGIN] I usually come here for pane au chocolate or their macaroons. All very tasty but very expensive. For the price you pay the value isn't there.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice and cozy cafe located near central. Their foods are great, but have one complaint Their service is soooo slow!!! Be aware if you are in hurry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its awesome to have a super hero store... Its like entering into The Shield. The reason I gave it only three stars is because its such a tiny store... It gets packed quickly and warm inside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place for a healthy lunch and a tasty sandwich. Food is suppose to be farm fresh and overall it was pretty good. Service was ok. I would likely go back again and try another meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cajun food in Colorado! Cajun's not really my favorite or it would have gotten 4 stars easily. Right off the main drag in a great converted house with nice porch and lots of cozy rooms. I was there for lunch, but apparently hugely popular for weekend breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great drinks, ok food. The food was a bit bland for my taste, but the beer on tap was cold and fresh! All and all, not the worst meal ever.  [END]
[BEGIN] The decor is great, our server was attentive but the food was only just ok in my opinion. We ordered the crab cakes, thai mussels and spicy seafood stew. I would recommend the thai coconut mussels, but there was nothing spectacular about the crab cakes or spicy seafood stew.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was ok. A chicken po boy combo was just enough for a lunch. Nice restaurant; iffy neighborhood at night.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is Chinese food ... Quick cheep and easy Place is nothing pretty staff is what you would expect. Place is around the corner so its a easy meal. i typically get chicken and broccoli and its really good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Disappointed on the service for sure.. I had to fill up my own wine not once but three times. The selection of the food was reasonable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pub grub and cold pint, what's not to love? Really nice staff and collection of locals as well as after work crowd  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was absolutly amazing. The staf was a little slow but because the food was so great & cheap I wasn't that mad.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's ok. Very slow service, but the food is pretty good for the many items on the menu. The fruit / ice cream bar is crazy fun however. Burgers, Mexican, pizza, ice cream, juice bar? Gordon Ramsay would throw a fit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sushi is okay. Salmon oshi is way too oily as it had puddles of oil underneath when picked up. Hot night roll was pretty good. Pricing is alright. Found a string floating around in my cup of water too.  [END]
[BEGIN] really good pizza and reasonably priced for the size. problem is whatever i order delivery from here its always cold and the drive is about 10 minutes from me... why does this keep happening  [END]
[BEGIN] The squash soup I had was yummy, but the half-sandwich was kind of meh (not a lot of fillings, or meat). I'd hope for a little more value for ~$7 soup/half sandwich combo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was friendly. Room looks nice, but isn't the cleanest room ever. Smells like stale smoke. Parking lot is packed and can barely get a spot. Was good for a one night quick stop, but would not recommend for leisure or long term.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chicken salad didn't really contain much chicken - chopped so small it kinda turned the chicken to mush... meh. It wasn't grilled chicken - more like chicken cubes ? Weird.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food with real home cooking. Sunday morning was slow which was surprising but nice. Service was friendly but slow. Beverage refills were nonexistent. Otherwise a fairly good experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Good - Chicken Gyros and the Hummus The Bad - Very small dining room, we had to sit outside. Service was kind of slow, which is a bummer when you have a small child with you. Not kid friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love that it's organic perfect if you're centrally located prices are a little higher then other farms in their area but the fact that they're organic stands for something.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't understand why this place is famous. It's not bad but there's nothing special about their roast beef.  [END]
[BEGIN] Outdoor dining is a perfect setting. Owner/bartender is knowledgeable and friendly. Food is boring and not tasty, so if you want something delicious, go somewhere else. Food order was screwed up.  [END]
[BEGIN] To me you're better off visiting Granary than this one. Especially, if you are limited on time. You get the same kind of feel form both locations, but more famous people were buried at the other site.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fries are good and so are the sauces. The spicy tuna was mediocre. Small space so come with a small group  [END]
[BEGIN] they are nice facility is super clean all the hairdressers and mani pedicurists are great. I see alot of turn around at the front desk and sometimes find they arent that helpful but everything else is great  [END]
[BEGIN] During the holidays this place is packed. Expect an hour or so wait. This a vibrant restaurant with something for everyone who wants American food.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would need to come back to see if this changes. The wine prices was a little high but good selection. I did like the space though, felt comfortable. Food was just ok would need to try more. I would recommend the ceviche.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tasty but not earth-shattering fried chicken. The meat is nice and juicy but the tasty batter could be a little thicker and crispier.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't have much to say about this place... we stopped for a quick pastry on the way out for the day and it was quite the delicious, cheap pastry. If you're in the mood for a little french pastry, this is a good place to come.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped by to grab an adapter before going abroad. Quick service, nice help, and the guy even brought out scissors to free the adapter for me. No cuts here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there couple times. We ordered the spicy bowl. It's alright, but pricy if you picked more than few items.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is pretty average. Service is typically understaffed (good for them I guess with the tips). I don't know why it's categorized as a whiskey bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] It wasn't the worst but it was just ok. I used to eat there years ago and it was a lot better then but the menu has since exploded with tons more options and it seems the quality has gone down some.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there for dinner, didnt have any expectations as we hadnt heard about the place before. We actually ended up liking the place. There werent many people when we went so it was kind of quite, the ambience was nice and the food wasn't bad. Service was okay.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the Sweet Greens smoothie. It was yummy, and also nothing unusual as it's the smoothie I usually make at home. But wow, it was pricey! $10 for a small smoothie. That's kind of nuts.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh. I thought it was OK. Lackluster service from the blonde pony tailed waitress 3/1/18 5-9. My margarita was good. House red good. Chipotle Caesar good. The liberal BS posted on the wall pissed me off. Good but not great. I didn't get sick. Nothing to brag about.  [END]
[BEGIN] I know it's sacrilegious but it's just OK. Don't get me wrong it's ice cram people so it's good but line worthy not for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good, but the reason it gets three stars is because of the incredibly bad service I get every time I go. So much that I'd rather head to First Chinese BBQ or the one by the Hong Kong supermarket.  [END]
[BEGIN] Me imaginé más bien un outlet, pero es un lugar para seguir consumiendo y engordando. La ropa NO es más barata de lo normal y los lugares para comer son más bien caros. En general es muy bonito, linda decoración y música en vivo; como para venir a mirar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Coffee is good, albeit significantly smaller portions than most other espresso bars these days. Music was unbearably bass-thumpy loud making it hard to read and causing others to shout to hold conversations.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is 3 Stars, this is "A-OK", this... is McDonalds. This particular one has "classed-up" the place and you can now watch CNN on a flat screen as you eat. There's also a Redbox here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent burger, great shake, speedy/friendly service. My experience, though not anything special, left me satisfied enough to want to make another visit somewhere down the road.  [END]
[BEGIN] If I had known this was in perimeter mall, I would have skipped it. Service was great. Food was above mediocre but expensive. Pretty typical mall restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Taro was great, the Mango was great, the Mocha was so-so, needs a touch more mocha for better flavoring. Otherwise, great friendly service.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is pretty descent for breakfast. A step up from a diner but nothing to go crazy about. Its very small and can get crowded. The Brazilian food is good and adds a nice mix to all the Italian places in the North End.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is 3.5. The restaurant itself lacks atmosphere. Service is good. It seems like most of business is carryout and delivery. We tried it with a groupon and overall were satisfied...nothing amazing...nothing horrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Every time I go there, I always order seafood curry. It tastes like light Tom ka gai soup. Service is always good. The price is quite high but it's reasonable for me because it's at Disney!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice resort, only complaint is that we didn't get any complimentary lotion so I called the front desk and asked. They brought some up after like 40 minutes and it was past 10pm. Free parking, comfy rooms, and a balcony to enjoy the fresh air.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great chicken club! Nothing fancy, just plain delicious! It's in a great location and the locals recommend it! Go here for a beer!  [END]
[BEGIN] while we do love the $6 deals, the prime rib sandwich was terrible, cooked like bacon, not great. The shrimp cocktail was great!!!! The drink selection is limited and when the bill came it was priced wrong. The cheeseburger was also very good.....  [END]
[BEGIN] A mediumly classy place but it can be very hit or miss and is a bit too pricey for what it is. Not the best bread either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't go for the service but for the cheap, tasty pho. Never had my order taken while the server was on the phone before. That was a first. Surprisingly clean considering the old, outdated decor and building.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a big fan of listening to gossiping, how much money in tips they made and other shift issues. Little more professionalism would be appreciated and put your phone away when you working.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just recall having burger sliders and a rye with ginger. The atmosphere was good and the service was not bad. Convenient street parking is always good! It's a-ok!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Chicken Cooked perfectly...not dry and chicken was juicy! Mac & cheese was a bit disappointing (not baked) but friendly service and would definitely come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the location and atmosphere, but the food was rather disappointing. I received the wrong meal. The chicken was dry. I will go back for another meal to see if this time was just a fluke.  [END]
[BEGIN] Enjoyed the Snow Crab and Chowder, didn't care for the steamers. We were reminded of a few spots in Key West of this place. Probably a lot of fun when it's warm  [END]
[BEGIN] It is just like the Fanueil Hall version. Not great food, but right next to your gate!! Certainly better than airplane food, so don't go away hungry'  [END]
[BEGIN] Great deal for oil changes.....be weary of their add-on sales.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cafe Aion is primarily tapas. Food wad pretty good. Wait staff did not suggest ideas off the extensive tapas list but we picked some interesting dishes. Cost: 4 small tapas plates and a couple of cocktails the bill + tip ran $100.  [END]
[BEGIN] As of 12/23/2012 they are closed for renovations. The large sign out front says they'll be open for business 'in a few months.'  [END]
[BEGIN] Our experience was ok. The sauces on the special rolls were too sweet. Decent atmosphere, esp for the burbs.  [END]
[BEGIN] We bought two of the halfsies. There was not even 1/3 ice cream, and the cookie dough alone is waaaaayyy too sweet. It would have been better had it been 1/3 cookie dough with more ice cream. The flavors were delicious though.  [END]
[BEGIN] The was my third visit and I wonder if it was because it was Monday as the brioche were not as good as previously purchased here nor was the black sesame panna cotta which was not set properly and was more like a pudding. The sesame cookies were still delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sanwiches are tasty, good coctails, a bit noisy. Good spot for lunch post-Newbury/Boylston/Pru shopping.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good vegetarian options-- they even have a dairy-free yogurt (which, unfortunately, they are often out of). Try the avocado+brie rollup (if you do dairy). The mango-coconut combo is good, as is their decaf coffee+orange or raspberry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not really very impressed expected more of a dive bar. Yes, the atmosphere is dive bar esque but entrees are $20 and limited & drinks are not cheap. Fun to hang out though, younger professional crowd, good amount of space.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Starbucks literally never has any grilled cheese in stock. Doesn't matter what time of day or what day of week. Edit: apparently this sandwich was discontinued but whoever was serving us tonight didn't know.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is o-k-a-y. Food is average, price is average and everything is average. I prefer Bon Chon Chicken over Chuh Gat jib. I was there last weekened, I felt too old. Very young crowd.... people were around 21? or even younger?? (shhh... they often don't check ID)  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, but Willie Mae's it ain't. On it's own IMO it's a bit salty. The sides are good but again, dang son, the SALT.  [END]
[BEGIN] good place for the business expense account crowd or tourists. food is good quality but the prices are not good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Helpful staff, but they forgot to take the security tag of the pants I bought.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good. Cool patio. Fish and chips lacked some flavor. Steak salad was pretty good. Curried cauliflower was pretty delish cause of the sauce.  [END]
[BEGIN] Vegan options are very slim and the food takes a long time to come out. This is the one place I've been in Portland that couldn't really make anything vegan. Kind of a disappointment. However, my nonvegan family loved the food.  [END]
[BEGIN] 3 stars for $25 minimum order. Then they tack on $2 delivery charge, + tax + tip. By the time you order for just one person it's $40.  [END]
[BEGIN] This corner location gets passed up, but why? Coffee place, plus, bar and live music by talented artist at night We saw Kendall Core there, and also picked up some cd and albums. Didn't try the food though. Look up days and time for their live music. So cool.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was kind of slow. But the food was great. I ordered the sampler appetizer which was good. The artichoke dip tasted watered down. The wings were really good it was some new Asian zing flavor (I think). Nice portion sizes for the sampler.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tess and Charmain behind the bar make this the go to place for after work drinks. The food so far has been average. Atmosphere is better then average.  [END]
[BEGIN] It looks like a fast food place, and you get your food pretty fast, but the food is actually pretty tasty. I went there a few days ago for lunch and their chicken teriyaki bento was surprisingly better than I would have guessed from the looks of the place.  [END]
[BEGIN] They provide good service and are cheap but good LORD! They are extremelyyyyyy slow. It took them 25 mins to do my eyebrows and no I don't have thick eyebrows.  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought the ahi tuna sandwhich with wasabi mayo was quite good. Can't speak for the burgers. Fries were okay, someone else mentioned they were hard and I somewhat agree. I would come back for their ahi tuna and to try their black bean burger.  [END]
[BEGIN] Try the pumpkin pie cupcake!! Moist and tasty! I could go for another one right now... The last batch I had from Sweet was much better than my first.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was good, and staff was friendly, place is clean and well maintained. Portions are a little on small side. The food could use a little more kick and seasoning.  [END]
[BEGIN] This a good place to pick up just about anything one needs for the kitchen. Of course I primarily shop there for convience when I need to pick up just a few things. Fiesta is always busy busy busy, so don't expect to run in and run out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good to come with the group and party. if yer huv no where to eat for late night, this place is answer:))  [END]
[BEGIN] The best part about this place is the dollar drafts. Sometimes that's worth it enough to go. It serves better as an eatery than a bar; and they wont let you play cards. Nothing incredible about this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Interesting place tasty bowls....which leads me to question nutritional info which is not available in person or on the website.... I'm afraid that if customers knew between carbs from grains....sugars derived from honey, fruits etc might turn customers away if they knew what they were putting in their bodies????  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is fine...nothing more. I've experienced better service, and attitude from other locations, particularly the Peachtree @ Piedmont location.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would say this is just an average place for food. Cool little dive bar. Interesting pizza toppings (soul food with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and collard greens... yeah, don't know about that). Calzone was good. Decent beer selection.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Cottonwood is mediocre. I ordered the Twice Stuffed Chicken and my boyfriend got the Seafood Gunpowder. Both were just ok; things I could make at home. The atmosphere was nice, but the food was too pricey for a mediocre meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had ¢59 pancakes today yummy it was great! It was Worth ¢59 they only let us get one short stack per person! I waitress was okay she could have been more friendly  [END]
[BEGIN] They got me there in once piece. So, by all accounts, I'd say A-ok. An extra packet of pretzels too!! THAT made it special.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's ok kind of pricey and not the best food. Been to several places around here and had wonderful food. For a lot cheaper. But a cool place in soco  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was okay and the service pretty good. I thought the menu was fairly expensive for what it was. I would go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location...usually service is not too bad...food is consistently good but not over the top...not sure what it is about Milestones but they need some type of a boost from the kitchen to step it up a notch  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall nice and clean hotel. Construction is going on right outside and the rooms are small and the sounds carry. No bar. Good place to stay for a single person.  [END]
[BEGIN] The sushi was surprisingly good and cheap. The menu features a lot of choices- for those who like raw, and for those who don't. Their seaweed salad is also a good deal- a big portion of two kinds of seaweed. Best to take it out because there's not much seating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing all that special about this place. They made a nice burger and had some good collard greens. A quick place that offers a decent amount of choices that vary more than you might assume with a place called Farm Burger.  [END]
[BEGIN] Halal meat right next to the T entrance is a gift (I barely have to be outside when it's negative 20 F in Boston). Other than that, the quality is average and prices decent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Second time here. Won't return. Mediocre food at high prices. Salmon was badly undercooked and had no flavor. The veal meatloaf was very salty. Better restaurants around.  [END]
[BEGIN] usually the last spot of the night, but always a good time. friendly waitstaff, good prices, karaoke (!) and fun crowd. always important, they have clean bathrooms -- but beware the hand dryers...they *could* blow your skin right off.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff is always super nice and helpful. The food is well seasoned and spiced. We always enjoy our visit here :)  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't quite get it. Everything I've had has been unexceptional. Head down the road to Thailand Cafe for their (surprising) Sichuan menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] Huge portions of tasty Mexican food. We tried the shrimp tacos, wahoo tacos, and chicken enchiladas. All of them were great! My only gripe is the beer selection--if you're going to offer beer and you're in Boulder, you've got to have some local ones!  [END]
[BEGIN] Soup is not hot, soup base is not rich enough (could have been better) Price was reasonable. Staffs are friendly. Environment is casual. It's a good restaurant for quick lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fair for American-Asian taste. Quantity is not enough for an adult. If you want to try small quantities would be fine. Won't try again though  [END]
[BEGIN] If HEB tried to do Gourdough's you'd get Voodoo.  [END]
[BEGIN] I found the burger nice and tasty but I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's certainly not something I'd wait in line for. I've driven by and seen long lines often. Congrats.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a place I would frequent. The food was not that good. Mediocre fare that seemed bland to me. It is an OK stop if you need somewhere to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had dinner delivered. Tom Ga soup, clearwrap spring rolls and Pad Thai. All food was decent, not great, but good enough if you have a hankering for Thai. Portions are very large!  [END]
[BEGIN] Interesting selection, you can get bits of hot dog on a roll with scallions, custard buns, minced meat (asian style), taro, raisin..etc. My favorite use to be the corn&egg salad in a bun, but the last time I had it, there were barely any corn in there.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm a design student so I come here alot for fabrics and such. The store is very well organized and they have quite a few things. The prices are not that great though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizza was kinda meh. I've had much worse but I've also had much better Don't think I would give this place a second try based on this experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Let me start off by saying the chowmein was absolutely delicious. Why am I giving Hot Plate only three stars? Because everything else was greasy and mediocre. The three people who ordered various dishes ended up fighting over the chow mein and the fried food was eventually thrown away.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just another Asian buffet. The hibachi could use a little more flavor but they had fresh seafood and they kept bringing fresh food out. You get your $11.99 worth with just the seafood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good dim sum. Huge rooms as noted Service is fairly impersonal. If you're staying downtown this may be one of the better bets for dim sum unless you want to go to Richmond.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good restaurant with a lively atmosphere. The servers were friendly and nice. The food was pretty good - the best part was the shake! Caramel sea salt is the best!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Came in expecting...... well noodles, but like an asian noodle house. This is basically just fast food thrown into a bowl with noodles. Definitely nothing special.....  [END]
[BEGIN] Generous portions, a great variety of dosa options, and Indian sweets. It is a straightforward back of a grocery store, eat your chicken tikka dosa in a booth experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] open late, did the job nicely. order from the window, eat sitting on the curb! not the best pizza i've ever had, but much better than the food truck pizza i had across town.  [END]
[BEGIN] Try their shake... Tasted like chocolate milk nothing good. Service wasn't that great. They came twice only to change the coal and been here 2 hours. She went to check up on 3 different groups and skipped us twice. Order water and never came.  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought this place was just okay. Stop by for some sustenance, nothing special though.  [END]
[BEGIN] I saw a rat running through it. It's on the pier and very much open to the outside. It's a good place for a late night drink, but I wouldn't eat there.  [END]
[BEGIN] What happened to this place? Where are all the people?? Yes, it used to be too packed, but now it is essentially empty. ???? Drinks and appetizers were still good, though...  [END]
[BEGIN] I had heard really good things about this chain, but I was not impressed. Beside the illusion of fresh and healthy ingredients, it seems to me that the food is bland and overpriced.  [END]
[BEGIN] mix feelings but over all they did a good job and quick for less then other company no more nor less no more dog hair on couch on the carpet or anywhere I can see I might use them again we will see about that  [END]
[BEGIN] The food here is really very good but as far as a bar goes it is way too spaced out. Good place to eat and drink a few beers and watch a game, awful place if you want to get caught up in an exciting atmosphere to watch a game.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice presentation but the vegetables in my salad just had no flavor. Crab Cake was salty. Very professional service. Heads up: they do not take Discover Card  [END]
[BEGIN] Compared to all the other places it's not quite there. The staff are still learning. Today's visit chips are stale, pickup order waiting on the counter, better once it was heated up  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent korean food bar. I love their cabbage pickles. Rice cake.was a hit. For me.this is a affordable spot to grab some yummy sides everyday.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was just ok nothing to get real excited about, but the lunch special ( I had sweet and sour chicken) was a great value It was 4.99 and had plenty of food and included the drink (can) and egg roll  [END]
[BEGIN] Wouldn't recommend ordering here (and certainly not via uber eats). Wings were mediocre and Cajun fries were awful. A huge let down! Also the fries didn't come with any ketchup. Overall, it didn't seem like much effort went into this meal!  [END]
[BEGIN] I've ordered from this place numerous times and every time they get the order wrong..i would definitely say go inside if you want decent service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: Nice ambiance Clean Good service Big portions Cons: Food was OK but not great Would most likely not revisit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad. Not great. Mod is better, but your mileage may vary. Can't complain about the price, but like I said, for a similar price you get better pizza at Mod - and you can get beer in air conditioning. Needs more seating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rolled in here with 6 people after 8pm. Place was about half full, the servers were very polite, helpful and fast. Food was as expected, typical Denny's. my experience was good/positive, not like the other posts...  [END]
[BEGIN] Dr. Kim did follow up regarding my review which I appreciate... She apologized, stated that she didn't intend to make me feel guilty about not coming in or mislead me about my post-dilation condition.  [END]
[BEGIN] Real potential here. But (and this is significant) the bun had that frozen and defrosted in the microwave flavor and consistency. Gotta fix that. Otherwise my classic sausage with grilled peppers and jalapenos, a touch of yellow mustard and curry ketchup was tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is good, not great. Way too expensive. Do yourself a favor and head to the north end. I got the Ravioli ai Quattro Formaggi. Again, it was good, but probably served better as an app that you could split at the table vs. a $25 entree.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm a fan but the attention this place gets is completely disproportionate to quality. Unlike gordough's, the quality of the underlying donut is not that great. They are just very creative with toppings and names. The line was very long, too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here on a Sunday for dinner. Clam chowder was good. Grilled jumbo shrimp with some veggies and potatoes was also good. Casual atmosphere. Service was average.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ceviche was good but the shrimps should have been cut up to smaller pieces to my liking. Tacos de pollo better than asada. Pupusas- nobody makes it better than my mother-in-law Service was good and the tamarindo was thirst quenching  [END]
[BEGIN] We visited this fine restaurant on Saturday, March 15, 2014... this is my video review: http://k-o.me  [END]
[BEGIN] I shall give 3.5 stars. The dining environment is great and you can tell how food is cooked by sitting on the bar seats. The food is nice but a little salty. Other is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small but very kid-friendly. They have a really interesting set of desserts that I haven't seen elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] They were okay, but too sweet. The prices are cheap though. There's a long wait, which wasn't really worth it just for some donuts.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a popular franchise the world over for a reason. Good coffee served quickly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, outstanding service but my $39 seafood entree did not come with real drawn butter, it came with some kind of oil for dipping. Gross.... you must ask for butter if you don't want artificial grease with your meal  [END]
[BEGIN] The meatloaf was good, but my vegetables were too salty. The green beans were good, but too much salt was sprinkled on them. The broccoli was way, way, way too salty -- salt overload! Our server was superb!  [END]
[BEGIN] Huge sashimi pieces for cheap-- great value! The sushi is huge too--- but have too much rice in them, in my opinion. Go for the Sashimi and you will not be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Olive Garden offers everything you expect from a chain restaurant: helpful servers, large menu, large portions, and reasonable prices. The only thing that stuck out during our meal was the bartender commenting on our pronouncing gnocchi correctly. What hoot!  [END]
[BEGIN] MUCH Better than VOO-DOO. I've had donuts I've loved and some I haven't-- like the beignets with fennel pollen dust-- wretched. Very bitter and non-delicious. Jus sayin'. Dough they use is good. Just a plain donut is delicious. Chocolate nice, too.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went during the day. Decent food and the beer selection was surprisingly good. I'll have to see what the night life is like.  [END]
[BEGIN] I came in at noon and got the Chicken Gyro.The gyro was a bit dry but a abundant. They are very fast from order to pay, and I was out the door less then a min. After all of the hype I was expecting a more flavorful gyro.  [END]
[BEGIN] Even though i think it's a waste of money, it is time for this venue to be updated. It's dark and cold. I look forward to seeing the new stadium.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a true Regina Pizzeria experience. The slices are small and undercooked. This place really shouldn't bare the name of Regina Pizzera. If you want pizza go here, but don't expect it to take like a true Regina Pizza.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got my usually chilli zucchini bowl, but not sure if they gave me the soup or someone just when HAM with the yum sauce. It's too much sauce.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn't understand what the big whoop was about. It's a good burger but just as good as P.Terry's, not worth the line.  [END]
[BEGIN] Typical Wendy's, nothing special besides they close early. So if you're looking for food late night you're going to have to drive down to 270.  [END]
[BEGIN] I found their service to be a little snooty at times, and the products not particularly effective while carrying a price tag on the heftier side.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was so so. I mean so so is hard to explain in words. The best way to say it is; its inexpensive and very filling. However I have had better for the same price. The sushi just seemed warm. I usually like my sushi a little cold.  [END]
[BEGIN] it was ok overall food drinks where all ok bartender was nice forgot his nmae big black guy  [END]
[BEGIN] They arrived on time and the driver was friendly, but the cab smelled awful and had cigarette ash everywhere. That whole NO SMOKING sign in the cab apparently is just a suggestion.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, consistent shawarma and falafel at this old trusty standby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice people run the shop, but it is too hot; they are Asian and they don't like A/C! They have TV, but they only have about 13 basic channels.  [END]
[BEGIN] Visiting from out of town, happened across this great little place for lunch. Family run, friendly staff. Sushi is carefully prepared and good, and we were surprised at the quantity. The bento box sets are plentiful, good variety, good price.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a very mediocre italian restaurant. The bread was the highlight of the meal. The zucchini with goat cheese would have been good it had been served hot. My pasta with fontina cream sauce was ok, but nothing to write home about. I probably won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was very nice - much better than I was expecting! Food was good and there was a nice selection. Place was neat and clean  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent place to go for lunch if working the square. Has the Boston Chowda company..great lobster bisque and other soups, a burger place, Ben & Jerrys, Pho Posteur. The stores definitely cater to the teenage "alternative" crowd...not very exciting for those of us well past puberty.  [END]
[BEGIN] was there for Portland Dining month. nice atmosphere, nice customer service. Food wasn't impressive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel, with good rates for the area. We paid 46$ and were content with the value for the money spent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was so excited for real Spanish food and this is just not the place, unfortunately. Wah wah! Try again! I wish I read the bad reviews before we went. Bleh. Of the patatas bravas, fried calamari and shishito peppers, none were good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really enjoyed my meal here a few months back. I have tried to go back twice now, both times, closed. Tried to go for lunch today, checked the website, they are open for lunch Fridays.... But not today, under renovations? No indication on the website. What's the deal Habaneros?  [END]
[BEGIN] Hours of operation are hit and miss to be honest, however, they do an awesome meat and cheese platter. I've had their platter on many occasions. They give a good assortment of meats and cheeses of different variety. I haven't eaten anything other than their platters.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh. It's a bar. It has bar food. It needs service. It needs to not overcharge for things you didn't order. It's a big city with lots of choices. You decide.  [END]
[BEGIN] Burgers and burgers. I recommend the avocado club ! It's a common chain around here in Columbus Ohio. It seems clean and tidy. Great place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big dad with Mac n cheese. I was fooled by the pics they had for the big dad. The sand which presentation looked like just two breads & small amount of meat hidden inside. Mac was a bit tasteless. Felt like Elementary cafeteria food in all.  [END]
[BEGIN] is it just me, or is the produce section really small? it feels like a watered down version. they didn't have bananas or artichokes last time i went. whaaaaaaats the deal, safeway?  [END]
[BEGIN] Catchy name, looks great online but was disappointed with the meat quality. Service is good friendly people working there but way too pricey for the lack of quality. The turkey breast has a strange taste it made my sandwich not enjoyable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Inexpensive, tasty street food. Sloppy service. Longer than average wait times. The location is good, and since the neighboring competition operate at much higher standards, there really isn't a reason to come here over anywhere else in Decatur.  [END]
[BEGIN] very good fries plus liege waffles. the home made nutella sauce is very nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered chicken and waffles and the meal came out luke warm where it was almost room temperature. :( other than that, the chicken tasted good. As for service, it was great and the place has a southern charm with a mix of some "hipster" vibe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tasty, but over priced for what little food we received. The soup and cheese appetizer was so small we had to hold back giggling. We felt like we were in a Portlandia skit. Left hungry and underwhelmed. Highlights were the cookie, service and ambiance.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is pretty authentic, which means be careful what you order, a lot of it greasy and gristly. The place seems none to hygenic on the inside either. But some of the food is dynamite. It is usually crowded and noisy and has a kind of no frills atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent beer, but not so impressive menu. I'm not sure what they are trying for here. When I go out for beers I want regular food, not some crazy olive, foi gras, duck fat grilled burger. Just have normal food please.  [END]
[BEGIN] had the matcha custard cup which was just okay, I didn't try the food, bread or pastries but I'd def go back if I'm in the area  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good and fast. The lunch servers could use some better service and speed skills.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good. Great happy hour. Excellent service. But not sure if I'd remember what we ate at Ten Ten a couple a days from now.  [END]
[BEGIN] Over priced food. Glad we got the travelzoo for the tasting menu. I wouldn't pay that much for the 6 course for sure. The food wasn't that amazing and our glasses were always empty. I've tired few Michelin Stars restaurants. I would say this place is at the bottom.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sit down, shut up and order a Guinness already.  [END]
[BEGIN] The burger was really good. Very tender and cooked just right. My disappointment were with the fries. They were a bit too soggy for me. Also, when you order a coke, you just get a can of coke.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a bad place, would go back. Have watched a few NBA drafts at Tom's when the Blazers were drafting in the lottery. Haven't ordered the pizza's yet, the food I have ordered was regular greasy comfort food. Decent service.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't understand the hype. Donuts that sound good but end up being weird. They need to stop putting birds on everything and just go for a plain ole good donut. Fancy isn't always good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this diner but they continuously sit us 4 at the table for 2 across from the entry even though a table for 4 is open and then they'll sit 2 people at a table for 4 immediately after us. It's just a lack of consideration.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the Singapore Noodles one of my favorite dishes. It was too greasy but not to greasy to eat most all of it. The won ton soup was hot and delicious. Decent food. Casual environment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Snagged a couple seats at the bar on a lovely Saturday night and were very pleased with ourselves. Also pleased with the friendly staff at this now established Italian joint. Highlight of the night was definitely the pesto.. like wow. Try it!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Service dreadful on a Thursday eve around 6pm. One waitress who just didn't care. Had to fetch our own menus, ask twice for bill and water refills. I had veggie sampler which could have been warmer. Partner had beef berebere that was really tough. Injera very flavorful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ducked into this restaurant for lunch while doing errands. Food is good, decent price and portions. A Chinese/American restaurant that can handle more business as the rooms are "largish." Oh, and the wait staff is friendly, personable  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service, good food. I was surprised that the menu features more Japanese food than Chinese food, but my Udon noodles and tempura was amazing! Easy parking and super cool environment with an authentic feel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped by and found the chawanmushi to be heavily over salted? I didn't even know what this dish was an first had it at the upper Fremont location. My mind was blown! So amazing! But found 90% of all the dishes were over salted  [END]
[BEGIN] Waited so long for my order but the food was good. The staff were friendly and the place was neat. I will definitely come back but hoping for more improvement though.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought something from here the other day and learned that they now charge for shopping bags. Tip is to bring your own! The shopping experience was A-OK. No screwups at the check-out!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is average and overpriced. We have visited this restaurant on a number of occasions, and while it's ok, it's nothing to write home about.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there as heard some rave reviews. Eh....salty, but crispy and decent. I prefer Popeyes....or KFC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent food but poor service while dining in on 2 occasions--once during lunch time and once during dinner time.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of my neighborhood go-tos when in the mood for Thai and don't feel like driving to Cobb or downtown ATL.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have moved next door! IThe $2.50 margaritas keeps bringing me back. It is pretty standard Mexican food. Not ming Blowing, but not mind numbing either. I will warn you that you might go into a food coma soon after consumption...and a few margaritas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very decent deli! I enjoy their tuna and the chips that they provide aren't bad at all. The free ice cream is a great addition!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is tasty here but I feel like it always takes forever for my party to get our food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad. Nothing fancy, fairly run-of-the-mill Mongolian. Owner is very friendly and there are lots of options to experiment with. Good value if you are starving. Little to no ambience....this ain't a date place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great selection for vegans and a fun, relaxing environment with friends. Loved the presentation of the food and it's easy to tell that all of their vegetable selections are fresh. However, wish the service was better and that they can create a more efficient process for waiting times.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the baked chicken, mashed potatoes, and greens. The meal was ok. Highly over priced. Would probably prefer not to go again except for the atmosphere and the live band. Next time would only order appetizers and dessert.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid lunch spot in Ansley Mall. Service and food is always on par and the pricing is solid.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great dive....good food good drinks. They recently raised their rates...they used to have a lunch menu but now it's all dinner prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] The mussels in white wine were delicious, and others were just okay, not the best cuisine I've been to but pretty decent in Woburn Burlington area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent portions, but still expensive relative to cost. I got the BLT today and it was okay. Vibe a little pretentious. Server a little too disconnected from the orders and a little in a rush to get us out the door. Nothing special.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's OK. Curry chicken sandwich was good, crab croissant wasn't that great. Decent brew selection and good mimosas. Food just isn't anything special, but I enjoyed the experience overall.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lunch here is really good and the bento box is a good deal but when we got dinner here it was only okay. I would not recommend the calamari either - it was very disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced and overrated! Nowhere near as good as Yeah! Burger or Grindhouse Killer Burgers!!  [END]
[BEGIN] We enjoyed a quiet dinner crispy red snapper with baby bok choy in sweet panang Curry and shrimp stir fry a bit pricey for a former Chinese buffet setting. A bit sparse menu mostly clean lots of carry out  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent food for a pub. Okay place to watch the game, depends on where you sit, not all seats have a good vantage point. A plus is that they usually put the game sound on... which is rare.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good, have eaten here a few times now. Wished I could give them 3.5 stars, can't say I am fan, but definitley better than just ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're looking for Hawaiian shave ice, it's definitely not this but it's a good treat to have when it's 90+ outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] we went for lunch. however we were expecting better food and service as it is a Michelin star restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] What is happening to Nick's? We usually rave about Nick's to everyone as the best pizza around -BUT the last two weeks have been so disappointing. Pizza is extremely well done and gross. We are so sad!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not my favorite pizza - it's fresh and tasty but I don't like sourdough crust. Nice outdoor seating area, though  [END]
[BEGIN] This menu is just weird. When you try to be an expert at everything you end up being an expert at nothing. Guacamole, muscles, Mexican street corn, fillets. Server was patronizing too. Not a lot of help in filtering this menu. Meh  [END]
[BEGIN] It didnt blow my mind! I wanted to be blown away. My burger overcooked. I asked for medium but it was well done! Yuck. My mac and cheese was cold. I want to love it.....  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good pizza and subs but its overpriced. The staff are also jerks and not friendly at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is what it is - Chinese food served from steam tables prepared by non-Chinese to recipes. It's decent if you want something quick and reasonably priced, and are not a connoisseur of Chinese food.  [END]
[BEGIN] The pizza was really good but kind of spendy. A little Caesar salad with only lettuce and dressing cost $7, which was a rip off. The people working here can be a little annoying, and get overly upset over nothing. Overall, it was decent but expensive for what it was.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well I was back in town for a customer meeting and wanted something close to the hotel. I have eaten at Tommy O's before and have to say it's okay. I was no overly or under impressed it was just middle of the road.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was good, chicken parm sandwich was good, seemed like a good price but didn't come with fries or anything  [END]
[BEGIN] A fine lunch spot for vegetarians. Long line developed just after we arrived around 12:15 on a Wednesday. Much better than the typical chain restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] My complaint is this place is likean oven. 85 outside and hotter i side! Had fish and chips. Fish good. The Shepards pie is better. Fun band and staff very friendly. I eould return in the winter.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's very OK. We excused a lot for being local owned and fresh. We did not like the thick tortilla soup at all.We do like the corn tortilla tacos  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely busy, and it was hard to flag down our waitress. If you're a germaphobe, this is not the place for you: silverware is kept in a communal bucket on the tables. Portion sizes were very cheap, but we enjoyed the atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lunch is better then dinner - the sushi is pretty good - but it could be a little fresher. Service is inconsistent  [END]
[BEGIN] OK chicken, honestly nothing special. Missing 2 big things in my opinion, pepper gravy for the chicken and whipped cream for the pie!  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the coffee, I live around the corner. But the staff is pretty slow.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok I live here and understand that the residents have been ignored for years without proper maintenance, but Ms Jane the new leasing office manger is trying hard to fix things and already addressing the AC issue vigorously. Hopefully if she stays longer things will improve...  [END]
[BEGIN] Some good food, but generally over hyped and a long wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wish they had an option for thicker crust but the pizza is good and I love that you can put any topping on that you want without extra fees. There's always a small line when I go in. Most of the workers are friendly!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the first restaurant I visited in Boston. I had dinner here with my family. The ambiance was really nice. The service was really good. The servers where very attentive. The food was good but could have been a little more creative.  [END]
[BEGIN] Helpful. You can call the store to check stock for an item and they will put it aside for you. Gladly. Decent selection and prices. Watch for sales. Excellent return policy, which they honour. Hassle-free.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lots of people working on their laptops. Love how they serve coffee by Intelligentsia. Love the natural lighting of interior. Great baked goods variety and breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh. Just meh. Their rice is pretty bland and the egg rolls taste funky. If you want some quality Chinese takeout go a few blocks down the road to Chin Chin. Pretty disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, a little bit hard to find, and a little pricey, but I really liked what I got. The staff was kinda grumpy when I came in to get my take-out. Dunno why, maybe they're just kinda curt generally. It wasn't offensive, just not friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ordered a bunless burger and thought it was good. Wasn't cooked to medium rare as I requested. Cooked well done. Didn't notice since it was ordered to go. At least it wasn't dry. Pricy since it was 10 bucks for just burger. Really prefer fudruckers but better than MacDonald.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small mall offers only a few stores but has a decent food court and movie theater.  [END]
[BEGIN] everything was fine except my main dish,i ordered medium rare steak but it was dry like a cracker,my appetizer was humus and it was great.the hostess was polite and very quick.the place is fine and not noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the jerk chicken meal. It included the chicken, rice, beans and plantains. The meal was decent. It wasn't great, but not bad. The tres leches cake was pretty good. The staff was very friendly and I'd go again if in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] The burger and the bread were great. I would've given it four stars however they forgot the bacon on my bacon cheeseburger. Overall I would go back being sure to check my burger before I leave.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place could be amazing if the service wasn't horrible all the time. I live close so I frequent shenanigans often. Reggae night is fun. Their food is great but service is painfully slow and no one is friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] CLOSED. I've been going to Elsy's for about five years. I liked going there because the prices were reasonable and the blow dryer wasn't too hot. I recently called the shop because I noticed she had moved. When I spoke with her she said that she no longer does hair.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good spot for friends and family. Kids enjoy an open restaurant with the food on a merry-go-round. The wait staff was very patient and helpful since it was our first time. The food is average.  [END]
[BEGIN] Crispy chips and good guacamole they had. Ghostly was the cheese dip and beans. Never thought I would want a bean to taste bean-y, but somehow they only managed to capture the fragrance of bean and cheese and not the flavor. Good margaritas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Since I last wrote a review, all Starbucks (including this one) have settled on a price for my "Customized Tea." Cheers all around!  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is not bad nor is it mind blowing. It's basic Americanized mexican. You may have to find your server or you may see your server hanging out with their friends in a booth while serving you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the Pad Thai & it was really good. Can't wait to try a few other dishes. Service was a little sketchy, kinda felt like I was putting them out but I will go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Donuts were very tasty, BUT bathrooms were NASTY toilet paper and trash everywhere There wasn't even soap or paper towels!! The tables were just as gross. And (homeless)druggies were coming in and out getting drinks whenever they felt like it!! So be cautious. Oh. And NO AC! Line was miserable  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent regional chain (ok..only 3 locations but I expect they will expand). I've only been to, and probably would only frequent, the Newton location. Honestly, I think Legal has absolutely nothing on this place. I also like the bar which is chill and works pretty well for an after-work cocktail.  [END]
[BEGIN] these cupcakes are OK. it's good for a sweet fix. the service is excellent...everyone is really friendly. good for a gift.  [END]
[BEGIN] The women at the speaker on may 22 around 323pm Sunday was very rude and snappy. Her customer service skills are horrible and she didn't want to be at work. If I felt these negative vibes so have other folks! I'll never come to this s&s again. #ever #getto #alllivesmatter  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for drinks after work. Can get crowded. Ok for a not too expensive sit down lunch. Food is nothing special. I wish they had more beer specials that werent simply Miller High Life or the beer tower of domestic swill.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great sub shop. Clean, friendly staff, and quite filling.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thom Ka soup was way too rally and the salad rolls were all lettuce falling apart. I would not go here again  [END]
[BEGIN] - Our server was very warm and attentive. - Appy hour only avaliable if seated in the bar area, not sure how this is justified. - Main courses very plain in terms of ingredients and flavor. Ended up needing a lot of salt and pepper.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent BBQ, Decent iced tea. Decent service. All around the good neighborhood BBQ place. The green beans are a must have. The ribs are always a good go to. If you're in the neighborhood and in the mood for BBQ. Pay them a visit. You won't regret it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Food... A little expensive... Try The PFX, it is a great drink. All the food we ordered was of high quality and tasted great! Just gasphed a little bit when we got the bill!  [END]
[BEGIN] I didn't have a very good experience here. The service was fine, entrees were good, but the see food, especially the bigger cherry storms, very fishy. I came here because of a friend's recommendation, extremely disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very big portions. You'll get a HUGE bowl of ramen so I'd suggest sharing with a friend. I didn't like the broth very much though I only tried on of their four types of broth. The miso broth I had was flavourless.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, but just ok food. For Midtowm, I have high hopes, but not my favorite. Nice, but.....  [END]
[BEGIN] Awkwardly small and can get crowded. Food was good, but didn't blow us away. Don't have much bad to say, but there's better Italian places out there. The service, for whole small it was, wasn't great.  [END]
[BEGIN] A very good so-so restaurant. Not the worst Ramen I've ever had but definitely don't want to spend time eating it again. I don't want to be negative about this so I'd say this restaurant is just so so. Still better than I can cook it though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a pretty good haircut here. The atmosphere of the barbershop is pretty cool, in a great location, with a very cute dog hanging out. They need a bit more seating for people waiting to get a haircut. I would go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Trendy place for hipsters. Service for food was delayed. It's not friendly for little kids. Cups didn't have lids and straws were breaking apart fast for kids. My duck melt was good. My wife's eggs were delicious with nicely seasoned potatoes.  [END]
[BEGIN] They get an extra star for the management reaching out. That shows that they care about their clientele and that speaks volumes.  [END]
[BEGIN] I called the manager to report my experience and he was very receptive. He asked me to come in and corrected the issue for me. I appreciated his efforts. My order this time was right. While I'm pleased with management's response I'm still skeptical of the drive thru.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stick with the deserts. Eggs were spongy and breakfast items were just ok. No major complaints and the place was clean. Not like I remember from Europe. A near miss.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's convention-y, that's all. The banquet food is meh to drab. But the parking is free, it's connected to a mall, and their remodel is looking fab.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered from here last night it was last min and me and my gf didn't feel like leaving , so we placed a delivery order I must say it was very quick about 12 min to be exact , the food was average for Chinese, and will order again  [END]
[BEGIN] Great customer service. Hal (the owner) is a nice guy and I have found and bought so cool stuff from there!  [END]
[BEGIN] The price is right. The location is good with the lions gate just a couple blocks away. Some of the rooms are musty and aging while others are much cleaner.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a chain. None of it's fresh, but it's good enough if you don't know any better, and you won't get sick.  [END]
[BEGIN] This food is pretty good. I wish they had more options/variety on the menu. Other than a variety issue, its a nice place to eat for lunch and to get full off of.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was average. Prices were average for the food options, but it lacked in quantity. Long wait and order came out wrong and had to be sent back. I would only return if I was with someone who really really wanted to go.  [END]
[BEGIN] I found this restaurant to have really small portions and expensive food for mediocre taste. The rolls barely had any fillings. The waitress was very feiendly but dissapointing food. One of the dishes, a chopped scallop roll barely had any fillings that the rice was rolled in  [END]
[BEGIN] I got confused on the order form and ended up with cheese only pizza. Not that good, but the caesar salad was awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everyone I work loves this place, but I can't see what's so special. The teriyaki is always just on the wrong side of burnt. It's nothing terribly special to me. Just another teriyaki place. That said, it's very reasonably priced and quick.  [END]
[BEGIN] What the fuck, man? No sample cups?! Otherwise, it's a pretty standard yogurt place, standard flavors and toppings, but selection is pretty minimal. The yogurt was also kind of "drippy"/melted coming out of the machine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hello, I am going to check out the place this week. My male friend is getting man's haircut by Mario. the price is 20 bucks. Update: My friend liked how Mario did his haircut but I thought that the style did not suit well his face shape.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was great, but food was a bit over-priced and I didn't really think it was worth it in the end. Glad I went this once but I don't anticipate returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here. We ordered online to pickup. Our order wasn't ready and had to wait around 15minutes. Everything was fresh looking and the taste was good. The cauliflower salad was mostly onions but the flavor was good. My falafel was good. Gyro was small but also good!  [END]
[BEGIN] The food overall wasn't too bad however some of the chips were uncooked, the salsa and the chicken enchilada were a little bland, I was definitely expecting fuller flavors. I could taste the beans more than the chicken.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good burger and location.....however, not a fan of the loud "cut me"/heavy metal music. The music was just too much, had to leave.  [END]
[BEGIN] Basically, food is good and pretty cheap. If you are not Asian or they don't know you, you'll get really slow service and shitty looks.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am going to temporarily suspend my 5 star review until can confirm that my experience today was just a disturbance in the force.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent food, attentive waiters. Low score because hostess and cashier plain ol' rude. Need lesson in politeness.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice and friendly. Food was good, generous portion on the combo plate. Very reasonably priced. Service was kind of slow, even though only two tables were occupied including us. The place seemed very clean and was quite quiet and comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our waitress was really nice. But the sushi honestly wasn't that amazing. They also messed up my order terribly. They also messed up the table next to us terribly. They tried to make up for it with free dessert. Nice inside though. Quaint.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food here is pretty basic. I had the shrimp and lobster sauce and all it did was diminish my hunger. The taste didn't woo me and I probably won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is not as neatly presented as compared to the Richmond location, but taste is still good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: - Great services and friendly - Great layout in a narrow space - Noodles was tender. Cons: - Soup was blend. - Pork was not tasty. Notes: - The waiting time after you took the order is around 20-30mins for two Raman. Not a place for fast food.  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried the Boulder Cut prime rib. It was very tender and soft and a pretty big cut. I thought it was pretty good but a big bland so had to add salt. We also ordered crab cakes and shrimp wrapped with bacon for appetizers. Overall a good meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been visiting this place since I was a child. The sandwiches can sometimes be hit or miss (not fresh lettuce, soggy tomatoes and hard bread) but overall, they are good. The owner can be a bit rude at times but the lady is sweet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was ok, maybe a little bit pricey, not bad though. Service was good. This place was a little boring and I don't think I'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Medina feels cozy and has good service. I'd say it's a good place to take your mom, but my mom isn't the type of lady who appreciates hour-long line ups and paying a premium for mediocrity. What's with the hype?  [END]
[BEGIN] Disappointed. Nothing spectacular. The guy at the register was very nice though. Went on a thursday at 11am. No line at all. Make sure to bring cash!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Diamond Tailors is ok, but not spectacular. Good tailoring, but expensive and long wait times.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros : Sea bass was amazing Nice selection of wines to choose from. Cons : Inattentive service, poorly mixed cocktails, disappointing poke and sashimi Overall: Too expensive for an average experience  [END]
[BEGIN] Asked for spicy, got a totally bland Tikka Masala Paneer.....  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried the plain bagels and the marble ones. Right out of the oven, the plains were tasty, but the marbles were eh. The next day, they were both eh. My boyfriend commented that they tasted like Lenders. I'm still in search of the perfect bagel...  [END]
[BEGIN] I was overcharged for my pasta, then refunded the wrong (lesser amount), and I was not offered a free treat for my trouble. It wasn't a big deal or a big amount, but if you're going to put it on the receipt then you should DO IT. Just saying...  [END]
[BEGIN] this place is authentic Mexican burrito portland style world being snotty obnoxious portland. love these people. they remember who you are and ate super helpful when you don't know what you want.  [END]
[BEGIN] Order out and get it delivered, the food and the bar are awful. Staff is nice, rooms are ok. Relatively close to the airport. Nothing nearby to walk to.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing really wrong with the pizza. It just wasn't my thing. Generic dough that was slightly undercooked, sauce was too sweet and overwhelming, and cheese was similar to something you might find in a hospital cafeteria. Breaded chicken was good though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kung Fu Milk tea is ok. Grapefruit green tea didn't really have grapefruit flavor. I checked in to get free topping but was still charged for regular price, so I didn't really get the free topping. Service took a while to get our drinks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good appetizers and tastey brick oven pizzas. Definately more of a date place than a girls night out location. Dim lighting and closed quarters cater more to romance than loud gossiping.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stinky place! Not clean. Dosas are ok. Bad service. They are served with chutney and sambhar which is not good on taste here, we ordered idli which was hard not fresh at all. We won't be returning to this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good, I recommend you split your meal it is massive, coffee is hot, and the staff is friendly. This is the kind of place my Dad would have loved. Nothing worth driving across town for but I wouldn't turn my nose up at this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] For a cheap and quick snack, T&T has a cafeteria inside their store. With most Asian cuisines available on the menu, it's great if you're in a hurry and just looking for a cheap snack.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overhyped. The staff is great and friendly. Voodoo offers something different than what you see in your typical doghnut shop, however the actual doughnuts don't blow my mind or anything. Texture and dough is just ok. Definitely a fun experience, but will be looking elsewhere for my go-to doughnut stop!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great spot to grab a beer, and a steak on Wednesday nights  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty typical New American fare. Nothing mind blowing, but decent. A bit over priced for what you are getting. You can definitely find better restaurants in town with more innovative food choices at the same price point or cheaper. Staff and servers were very professional.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sat in the window- very pretty and a lovely place to be. Food was reasonable. Not good, not bad. There are probably better Italian restaurants around. Service was so so. All round, I would probably go back, not not necessarily the first place I would on my return to Boston.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok selection, awesome bakery and decent hot bar. Can be very low on their inventory sometimes and they don't have all the goodies that the WF on Ponce has. The parking lot can be tricky and people have road rage while entering & exiting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely Loved Seaworld. Never managed to get on any of the rides - son too little - but that's okay as we really enjoyed all the shows. The Killer Whales were breathtaking. It was worth it just for that!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good portion size, not too pricey. The smoothies are a great way to finish off a meal. The cuban is a solid choice and the chicken soup is great. The tres leches dessert was very good!  [END]
[BEGIN] I've only had the sushi here for quick lunch orders and I've been pleasantly surprised with their sushi. My favorite is the Philly roll made with smoked salmon, cucumbers, mayo and I think avocado. Really good, and very refreshing. Definitely a must try.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's breakfast. Service wasn't great but it beats making breakfast at home when you want to get out.  [END]
[BEGIN] best kobideh kebob ive ever had.. but other than that rest of the food is mediocre.. get coupon off of restaurant.com if you'd like to try it.. does have live Spanish music performers 2x a month which is pretty cool..  [END]
[BEGIN] Four stars for the area they are new and are kind of slow and unorganized but the cuban empanada was great the guava and cheese pastrys were terrible however.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing at all wrong with this place. The server is a salty woman with an attitude and a great sense of humor. Pretty darn good pizza; crust is nice and thin and crispy. I love their Gyros! Sunday football is a great excuse to show up.  [END]
[BEGIN] A very average restaurant whose only merit is that it has a nice view by the wharf. There is nothing special about the food here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Over-prices drinks, limited parking, they keep the humidor locked and the cigars have no prices. As we were leaving a few Atlanta rappers came in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quick pho place. House special beef pho #7 was quite flavourful. The salad roll is solid. Bun Bo Hue was decent, broth not too spicy. Parking in the area is a bit tough if the back parking lot is full.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's okay. Could be seasoned more or at less have seasoning that has Flavor to it. I wouldn't return. The service is excellent! But the food is not that good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the bread and oil. Food is okay - but $12 for an ahi tuna salad, when every other salad is $10 or less? Doesn't make sense. Good service when were there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Typical sports bar with lots of TVs, beer choices, and tons of unhealthy junk food. They're good at what they do, and my beer was never empty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered crawfish & cajun shrimp and the the food was not bad nor great, it would have been a little better if it wasn't salty. The service is also average. It is a hole in the wall with average food.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went here for a party on a Tuesday night. The food was good. Drinks were ok. Atmosphere was very nice. But the customer service is lack luster at best. They should consider switching up the management because the employees are pretty terrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tons of beer, decent wings compared to Buffalo standards, plenty of tv's, decent food otherwise. One question...why $6.00 for a pint of Guiness??  [END]
[BEGIN] Sat at the bar. Tamala not exactly good at multitasking. Tends to have too many distractions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome set up to watch the game. More than enough tvs. I didnt like the food too much, but good to go watch the game if you cant get in the park.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was ok. Mixed drinks lacked alcohol. The food as good but I thought there should have been slightly more food with each meal. I'd try a different hibachi before coming back to this one...  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good semi-fast food. It brings me back to my childhood. We ordered Kobe burger dinner and curry pork.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad, but nothing exceptional. I'm going to try other Indian places before I think about going back here. The lunch buffet had a lot of good options and the naan bread is never ending. I enjoyed it.  [END]
[BEGIN] accept AMEX  [END]
[BEGIN] Still love coming here, one of the nicer Asian restos in DT, even a touch of higher end modern decor. But still think their Richmond locations are better. Ordered the ma po tofu, still good but a tad light on the flavour. Good service. Thumbs down on credit card minimum.  [END]
[BEGIN] The sandwiches here are pretty good. However, since I now live in Boston, and have tried Sam Degrassa's, I can only give this place 3 stars. It's definitely a place to go if you are in Southie, and I would recommend, but it's not amazing, like Sam Degrassa's.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small shop near The Law Courts and Sheraton Wall Centre, clean, neat with good service and free WiFi. Food was normal standard. My son had Tiger Prawn Udon - Shrimp, broccoli, udon in broth without onions, garlic, or soy sauce as we specified. Tasty enough to return again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good restaurant, but I felt like it was a bit pricey. I don't mind paying for a good meal but with all the options in the area, I don't think I'll be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice pub grub and the pizzas are good Its not the culinary experience that will leave you longing for more though. Pub grub at tis best.  [END]
[BEGIN] 2 people has boiled lobster which they enjoyed very much. Other person had fish and chips, Very disappointing, Received 3 small pieces of fish with littler flavor and a bunch of fries. Way over priced for the porton that was received. Go for the lobster forget the other food  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been eating here for years. Always been my favorite breakfast spot In town. The past couple times I've had to wait for over a half hour for my breakfast. It's not busy. The restaurant is half empty. I won't be coming back for a while.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the greatest but it worked. Hopefully they finish their pool soon. Restaraunts and stores close by. I'd stay here again for the price only!  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly shuttle driver, gave good tip on where to gas before returning car. However, they only had one agent for check-in. After a long flight having to wait 40 minutes is frustrating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too over priced. Small pizza that was 4 pieces was 13 dollars it was too muck did not even fill me up. Food was good tough.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the worst Thai food I've I've tried, but definitely not the best. If you are in Kenmore, and are craving Thai, go for it. But if you're up for a walk, Chili Duck on Boylston is pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for a few oysters and couple of drinks. Oysters are at a premium of $3+ each. Higher than downtown Boston. Menu prices very expensive and wonder if worth the cost. Presentation of some dishes being prepared looked quite nice. Friendly oyster bar staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately have to downgrade a bit - last visit was pretty disappointing. The macaron had great flavor but was incredibly dry and chewy. The cupcakes were rather disappointing as well (and also dry).  [END]
[BEGIN] Servers were attentive. Food was mediocre overall. Gnocchi is really good. Duck was chewy and tasteless. Lobster buns are overrated. Oh the donuts were terrible. They were way too sour.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'd love to give this place a higher rating but I've been 4-5 times and the staff is clueless. I've waited for service, numerous times passed by our eventual server without acknowledgement. They need a new management team!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here on April 16th to fill gas (company truck) at a total of $95.20. Bathroom smelled.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was too loud to have a conversation in here. The service was slow. The food was delicious but expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] This dollar General is ok for a quick buy if you are needing something quickly! Be sure it get ready to wait in lines because they are always long!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location to downtown shopping area. It is a big hotel with two towers. Clean and updated room, though there was loud music from outside (not sure on whether there is nearby club) where you can hear the bass inside the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've used these guys several times. Great service and never a problem. I'm sorry to see that there have been so many negative reviews.  [END]
[BEGIN] So so .. food was okay. Service was okay. I wish it had more sazón. Restaurant ambiance was blah.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mixed reviews when I've been here. Eggplant chips are great. Queen of Sandy Springs pizza and red sangria mediocre. Friendly staff but, when my outside tent blew my food over and moved my table in the wind, they acted as if nothing happened.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there for the restaurant week as it was one the most recommended place to try. Food was good, not excellent, and service decent. I guess I was oversold on it. It's a good place, you can have an intimate moment with someone, but not the best restaurant in town.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have eaten here several times ... very clean , goid easy parking , above average food , efficient wait staff ... nothin fancy or special ... good for a quick breakfast  [END]
[BEGIN] Photo Texas was very considerate and refunded my money.  [END]
[BEGIN] cheap stuff sometimes easier than hitting a grocery store  [END]
[BEGIN] I've used Mears over the last several days to arrange private car service to/from the airport and throughout Orlando. They've done a good job for us and the price is right. I also like their website, which is well designed and super simple to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prices were high and they didn't have what I needed. I had to go to the grocery store to find exactly what I needed. The help was amazing though, they know wheat they are taking about.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great rides and the staff is outstanding! But the food is abysmal. Don't get the all day food pass. It's just not worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Outside looks like a strips club, but the inside looks great. Take a chance and see if this place is for you. The food was really good and TV everywhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] been here for years; good pho at good prices, just not really a clean place in my humble opinion. Could be a lot better. Classic family-run without much regard to furniture and decor. Only pho in this stretch of fraser so easy $$$.  [END]
[BEGIN] The business never got back to me regarding the missing item from my order, so I am knocking off a star for lack of response.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as good as usual. Lychee martini was excellent. Spider roll not as good as usual. Waitress was outstanding!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just an update, got a call from the manager a few hours later to let me know they're comping the meal. Not sure if it's my yelp review that made the difference, but regardless it's definitely appreciated. I think I'll try their lunch buffet next time...  [END]
[BEGIN] okay nice place to come grab some fast food, ppl begging for money this is not a mall what a stupid name, located by the peachtree marta station  [END]
[BEGIN] It was fast, but the guy at the front desk was a little mean.. Not towards me, but just his personality I guess. No worries though! Food was good, but everything is when you're hungry. I would go back because it's walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] I go to the Parish Cafe for the drinks and the sidewalk seating. While it's gimmick is the menu of sandwiches created by different Boston chefs, I don't know anybody who thinks of that when you say "Parish Cafe." But for foofy drinks and people watching, it's great.  [END]
[BEGIN] This restaurant is perfectly fine. We went for a quick bite in the early evening. Service was really, really slow (and it wasn't busy) but the food was pretty good, all things considered. Parking is a plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was pretty pricey. I got the chicken fried rice was good, but I've had better for less money. the pad tai was dry, barely any sauce.  [END]
[BEGIN] Walked in and ordered a large pepperoni, banana pepper and extra cheese to go. Service was fast and friendly but the pizza itself didn't knock my socks off.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's ok, I was happy with my lunch. Lunch menu was a little limited but it looks like it allows them to execute those dishes extremely well.  [END]
[BEGIN] great atmosphere, a little less the service! the tacos not bad  [END]
[BEGIN] The Italian sub was nothing special. It tastes like something that can be easily made at home. Their vegetable selection is lacking (lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and a few pickled items). I also wish they had a whole grain bread option. I prefer Subway to this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm not from the area, and I've heard rave reviews about their pizza. It was average at best. My pizza had spinach, roasted red peppers, green olives and garlic. Maybe I'll try a little meat next time. While it was edible, there was nothing special about the pizza.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummy desserts! Different than any other shaved ice cream places. Rich, soft, and yummy!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a lot like Angora Cafe right down the street. But there's better seating at Angora's. Food is pretty good, esp the frozen yogurt.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small iced, milk and sugar. What? Iced coffee - small... With milk and sugar. OK. And a chocolate chip muffin. Muffin, ok, what kind, blueberry? Chocolate chip. OK... Sorry hon, how do you take your coffee again? And they didn't offer to toast the muffin!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fine donuts but surely service and it took 15 minutes to get a new pot if coffee. I don't understand why a place which says they serve donuts and coffee only would ever run out of coffee.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super good sushi and all you can eat BUT horrible service. Other people after us got asked how they were doing. Waitress forgot to put my sons order in after we got our sushi  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is good, although I admit I don't come here often due to another Mediterranean place in the very near vicinity that I consider much more authentic. The food is ok though, and it's quick and cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was subpar but they had a great beer selection and the loaded tots were great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Idk. Been there several times. Just not excited about it after going to firehouse. Last resort sun place for me although I will have to try a cheese steak and see was it super good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tables were dirty when I came in to sit down. Customer service was good the employees are nice.food was cooked well tho I saw the broccoli beef it looked like it was under the lmap for too long.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cash only. We arrived just before last call and there was already a long line. It was worth the wait to feed our donut craving! The donuts were pretty average tasting to say the least. The flavor combinations are fun, but nothing to brag about. Fun experience considering  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad lighting. Cafe closes early. Some cool architecture. I think sometimes they have musical performances. That might be worth checking out.  [END]
[BEGIN] My coworker brought some of these into work - the burger and cheeesesteak donuts are crazy-looking! Pretty tasty too. Also tried a bit of the jelly-cream filled one - really good. Beats Dunkin any day.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was okay and the service was good. However, the portions were very small for the price of the dish. We were charged around $40 for just stew and had to pay extra for rice. Will not be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really just an average shop for froyo and ice cream. The flavors were pretty standard and the place felt a bit like it needed a really good cleaning. The prices were reasonable and it is away from the bar crowd on 6th, we liked that.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't know the reason people love this place. They have good waffles and various syrups but, the dishes were disappointed. Their foods tastes very unique which people who haven't try here should know. If someone who loves to try new world, then I recommend here.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have great pizza here, but the service is always super slow. Don't come here unless you have several hours to spend getting your meal. Mall 205 seems to be better managed in terms of service and management. I love this place. But it certainly needs some improvements.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered chicken buckwheat. Oh no it's just not good for the price you paid. The chicken thigh is dry and bland. I'm going to give other stuff a try next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered the cuban sandwich special. It was delicious except the chicken was full of grit. Made it a mediocre experience  [END]
[BEGIN] Yo I like the name. Reminded me of my favorite coffee shop back in Dallas, Crooked Tree. Definitely a different experience than a Starbucks (in a good way.) It has coffee and a cool name - win.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's always COLD inside. Good burgers usually. Last time they undercooked the Bison. I guess they were nervous because "Ted" Turner was sitting right next to me on the Patio for lunch!  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not order the wagyu ribeye. It's not tender or marbled as expected and is better elsewhere. Everything else - it's great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Waitress was great. Food very pricey for the amount you receive. But food was good, what little you got. Salad was extra. Has been taken off my return list, sorry.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a South Boston gem. Known for great comfort food with a variety of steaks, seafood & appetizers. Prices are good & there is parking in the lot next to restaurant--hard to find in South Boston. Good food at good prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid, is a very apt description of this place. Filling, well priced, the desert looks good, even though I never have room for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Basic Indy Coffee coffee chain. Drip is good. Baked Goods A-OK. Tip they have a few tables outside in the back of the cafe are relaxing and have a bit of a view. Good Bike Rack in front of the store to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] We served ourselves today by going to the counter every time we needed something, and they included tips in the bill for such poor service since we had a party of six. One of the lamb screwers we got was blue inside. otherwise it was good  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty much what you'd expect for the price, although it is definitely not a resort so the extra fee is unreasonable. Nothing was horrible and nothing was great except for the location. I would stay there again if I got a great price like I did this past time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Closed on Sunday?? Argh. I bought my first mountain bike at Buck's in 1994 (I think) so it's of historical importance and all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too much of a frat-bar atmosphere for me. Went there to see a show and it was too noisy from the crowd. I give them props for having a large beer selection, but it's expensive for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was OK. Specials were interesting. Staff was great. Price was a little high for what was received.  [END]
[BEGIN] A bit overrated, nice german food buffet, how much sausage can you really eat? Creampuffs bigger than your head, really it's either sausage or a creampuff, both is too much.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were told the wait was 20 minutes... over an hour ago. There are a dozen other breakfast spots on this street, I wish I hadn't wasted my time waiting for this one. The food is fine, but in this neighborhood, not worth the wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Generic ice cream. Cute set up, lots of flavors and a decent price. Just nothing spectactular  [END]
[BEGIN] The store has a lot of great things and is in a great location. Don't come to the printing dept if you are in a hurry but they will get it done for you. Know exactly what you want or this could take even longer.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's alright! I wasn't impressed. I think this place is highly overrated and overpriced. I had a catfish sandwich that was more bread than anything. The little tiny piece of fish that was hidden inside the roll was so small I could barely taste it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was just okay for me, meat was dry and not very good. Very nice people though. Wouldn't go back to eat but would stop by to say hello.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's Chili's! You should know what to expect. ...get your two for ones and chocolate volcano.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lamberts has a great deli but if you purchase the produce make sure to use it within three days. Same quality as the stuff at Quincy Market. The outdoor seasonal plants tend to be more expensive than most places. Pumpkins and Christmas trees are way overpriced.  [END]
[BEGIN] Salad = Excellent Bread Sticks = Excellent Seafood Portofino = so so...  [END]
[BEGIN] This place delicious donuts and really good prices, I am a severe sweet lover and donut lover so this shop hit the spot :-)  [END]
[BEGIN] I am not a big fan. I think the food is too rich. I do enjoy the soup salad and breadsticks though.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been in contact with the company since my initial review and we were able to come to an agreement. I appreciate how willing they were to fix the issue.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a 3 star steak house. It's between a Longhorn/Outback and a higher end such as Ruth's Chris/Rathbun. Price point is appropriate for the rating. Excellent service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Entrees are excellent. Innovative and delicious. I do not recommend dessert. They have been hit and miss with their storing methods. They do have one of the best brunches around. Lunch is always fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] After the long line, I expected good food (which I got) but it was cold and the atmosphere made us feel rushed. A bit pricey for me, but quality ingredients and unique menu items add to what makes this place popular.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ok, they usually play old and new movies, very clean, nice staff. Just no IMAX and no alcohol  [END]
[BEGIN] We've been back a few times since the time when I reviewed above. It was back up to my original expectations....decent service, decent sushi selection that was fresh enough :-) Glad, b/c it's one of the closes conveyor belt places near our house and my daughter LOVES sushi!  [END]
[BEGIN] Amelia's is definitely a greasy spoon type of breakfast spot but the food is pretty decent and the prices are good. The service is pretty speedy too. It's quite the local spot and I enjoy it way more than going to one of the chain brekky places.  [END]
[BEGIN] I highly recommend the Ahi Tuna burger. This hearty burger has a nice spicy taste from all of the wasabi, with the clean crisp taste of the cool slices of ginger.  [END]
[BEGIN] Drinks seemed a little overpriced, granted I didn't try their food but their description on the menu seemed appealing. Will go again just to try food next time and catch happy hour across the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have take me in for eyebrow appt w no reservation, so that deserves a star. ...but it eyebrow threading supposed to be this painful!? And cash only tips... If it wasn't so conveniently located I prob wouldn't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a pretty typical cafe. The sandwiches and wraps are good but a little overpriced and the food items are the same. The chicken caesar salad wrap is my favorite here but everything else is pretty much par for the course.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great spot. While you pay a boat load for drinks, the pizza is the bomb dot com! Note - avoid the cheese bread as an appetizer. Alexandra was my waitress - excellent service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service. Good selection of flavors. Walkable from many restaurants in the area or if you just want a treat. Good alternative to Salt and Straw if you cannot abide long lines.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mediocre. Not good for one person to dine. Soy drink was mediocre also. This is more suitable for family dine out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not terrible but a little skimpy on the veggies. We got the 9 and 10. Decent flavor on the meat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food staff was okay. The manager skipped my table and asked people on other tables. Maybe Deadphobic?  [END]
[BEGIN] Biscuits and gravy is hard to find in MA. And served with a side of potato casserole? huh! I'm in heaven. Thanks for being right next to the airport. When I have a late flight, I'm sure to stop at Cracker Barrel for some biscuits and gravy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beer is okay. Service is poor. Atmosphere is... odd. Sort of bar-like, sort of not. Lots of regulars. Prefer lots of other brewpubs in Boulder. Their beer is all organic, if you're into that. I'm not.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered take out, service was timely with picking up and food was ready on time. The food was okay, pretty generic Thai food, but the main disappointment was that I ordered a chicken pad se ew and got home and saw there was no meat in my dish.  [END]
[BEGIN] On my quest to re-live the amazing small town ooooey gooooooey pizza this place comes close, real close. Friendly neighbourhood place. Affordable (very), yummy, great helpful polite service. Beer is way cheaper than downtown. Interior has not been up dated, and DON'T!! Perfectly charming just the way it is!  [END]
[BEGIN] Saw Dropkick Murphy's here for the past two years on St Patty's Day. Good sized venue but lots of areas where you just can't see the stage at all. Bartenders were good with the beers but when asking for water they look the other way.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have mixed feelings about this place. Half the time I'm miserable and half I have a pretty good time. Decent beer selection. Come here with friends because the patrons aren't always the most interesting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good selection, but make sure you don't forget your reading glasses. Price on item scanned at $2.00 more. Emailed company, was offered the $2.00, if I come back in with everything. Just wanted them to check their system as it would cost me much more to return than $2.00.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like some of the other reviews I have seen, I agree that the service was lack luster. I enjoyed the food a lot though. It wasn't 100% perfect, but I will most likely give the place another try. Here's hoping to some new employees.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's ok if your looking for a cheap meal. Drinks are reasonably priced. Seafood Mac and cheese was horrible fresh seafood not used. Pizza was ok for Florida pizza  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is really slow and the restaurant needs to be cleaner; seems understaffed. The food taste great though, no complaints here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not much on the room service menu. Nothing to eat in hotel or surrounding area late at night. Rooms are great though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service and fun but was not as unique as I hoped ... think pf changs (sorry) Lemon custard dessert was pretty good but not best in show worthy Best of northeast? We tried five items or so and just didn't come away moved  [END]
[BEGIN] Lustre Pearl at 4:00 pm: amazing. Lustre Pearl at 10:00 pm: my own personal hell.  [END]
[BEGIN] Large bar/pool hall. Pool tables. Velvet. Drinks. Food. I ordered the monkfish medalions which were pretty good. A bit pricy though-- they were around $19.00.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there for late lunch.. Server was nice. I had Chicken Fetticuini with Alfredo Sauce. It was good. Portion was enough but small for the price. Overall good experiece.  [END]
[BEGIN] Generous with its toppings, but the crust was ok, in fact, a bit soft/sogginess...just average, good enough to order again, yet not so bad that one wouldn't return, if that makes sense. free parking in this strip mall by Blundell Centre.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent pizza at a good price. Be warned the tomato sauce contains a little bit of spiciness. Will probably order from here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food i enjoyed my visit the food was well prepared.The problem that takes a toll on the restaurant is that it is too small and cramped.you are real close to strangers sitting next to you.other than that they have a variety of Ethiopian dishes you can choose from  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Vietnamese-Thai food here, I definitely recommend the vermicelli. Although I don't care for the new redecorations, it's all about the food there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good, though the burgers were smaller than I thought they would be. The fries were just average, but the onion rings were great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was quick and delicious, fresh tasting fish. The set up decor looked great and there was a good amount of people at the restaurant. The hostessing and customer service could be better but overall it was a success coming to eat seafood from this restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good if you are looking to save a few bucks and don't mind waiting a long time for services.  [END]
[BEGIN] Slightly better than Cosi (which isn't saying much). But the service is nice and fast. Would recommend getting this if you're in a hurry and near South Station and need something edible and kinda healthy. Meh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here for Dropkick Murphys every year and a Flogging Molly show. Definitely an improvement over Avalon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice rooms but pricey and distant from the night action,  [END]
[BEGIN] Was super excited to check this place out and it was just ehhh. The prices were kinda high and the service was just ok. I ordered the chicken kababs and it wasn't bad just average.. off of my list.  [END]
[BEGIN] The place is a typical college taco joint. There emphasis is on beer and alcohol than food. The place is extremely loud and serves mediocre tacos. I haven't tried any of there other foods so maybe those are better than their tacos.  [END]
[BEGIN] Why why WHY must their parking be terminally stuck in SUCK? Alas, you can't order anything in Alon's and go wrong, but I'll only visit if: a) I'm already in the area b) parked elsewhere (legitimately) and c) someone else goads me into it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Affordable but taste wise much better options in portland. Even food trucks in Downtown are a much better option  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a great donut shop, but I actually preferred the plain donuts over the fancy decorated ones. It had an outrageous line (though it had just opened) and it did not move fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is amazing. Service is absolute crap. Came in today with literally no one else in the restaurant except for us and didn't get checked on once. Ambiance is awesome. I wish the service was better ... Then would be a 5 star.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool stuff but I am from Salem... lol it seems like a over priced and improved pac sun and the people working there treat you like your the one working there but they do have the best gimmick and little gifts  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing special about this place, terrible service at the outside bar last time I was there. I saw the bartender taking out the trash more than she was behind the bar. Overall pretty average but a good patio to hang out and have drinks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tasty food. I had quiche made to order. Mushrooms very good. Kids Mac & cheese is Kraft, but good for the 5 yr old familiarity. Service is friendly and attentive, if not precise.  [END]
[BEGIN] Target is certainly a step up in it's genre. This "Greatland" location is a poor example though. I think it's the amount of traffic coming through that keeps things out of stock here. While this one may be bigger than most, don't think that automatically equals better than most Targets.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is just ok. The outside is so bright it's unbeatable. The deck needs some sail covers so as not to be so exposed to the sun's rays.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dated old, needs reno's or updating. If you're a Sheraton or Starwood fan then you can stay here. There are a lot of hotels in Vancouver and this wouldn't be my first choice. Views are spectacular as at one time in Vancouver's history was the tallest building in the city.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel service was great. The property is starting to show a little age. Elevators are old and gym area kind of so so. The service made it worth the stay. Room was cleaned good every day. Staff was especially nice. I recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped in for a quick cocktail before heading into downtown...small, comfortable and interesting. Divey but the atmosphere is thoughtful and you can smoke inside. We sat at the bay window and sipped. They also have underwear with 'the bside' written on the butt. Cute!  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent burger - nice selection of condiments. I'd say better than Mighty Fine but about as good as Five Guys (but pricier). Casino el Camino still has the best burger in town...still miss Becks Prime though (used to live in Houston). Will go back to try the bison, lamb, etc...  [END]
[BEGIN] There is really NOTHING in Beaverton. But there is El Pollo Loco. Concentrate on the dollar menu. Get heaps of thighs. You will not be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The tacos here are pretty good and cheap--I can usually be in and out in under 5 minutes during the mornings. However, it is very small and can get very "cozy".  [END]
[BEGIN] the student was nice, the reception area and greeting desk were not receptive to me as a walk in It seemed they tried to talk me out of coming in for services.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok, nothing special. Friendly service, the burgers are good , but the menu could do with some variety. Three of them differ by only a single ingredient. Would go back maybe once or twice more to try other offerings, but that would probably be it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The shows are nice but that's about it. Everything else is extra. You have to schedule time in advance for the dolphins major attractions are closed. Not really worth $99 a person at full price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing to get excited over. I don't think the coffee tastes as good as starbucks, but I'm also only ordering the girly drinks. Overall an OK alternative, but I would rather go to SB or TexExpresso.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'd written a review some time back about La Parilla and somehow it transferred to Tkilas. I don't see a delete option and I don't want malign Tkilas because I've never been there. So sorry.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm glad this wasn't canceled by the rain, but I was disappointed in the number and variety of vendors. It seemed to be more of a farmers market than anything else, and I didn't have as much fun as I remember having in previous years.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good overall...but make sure you order extra. Maybe extra extra cheese on Any of the grilled cheese sandwiches because they are SKiMpY on the cheese! This is their only short coming... but I think that's a big one!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Im much closer to Publix but this Kroger has some good prices and I can get in and get out with what I need.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is great...but DON'T eat in! The dining room always smells like cleaning products. ALWAYS!!! Seriously, it is overwhelming. After about the 5th time I realized this is the way it is. And you know....I like the guy behind the counter!  [END]
[BEGIN] First time here but I think I'll be back. The everything bagel I had was a little harder than I like, but everything included with the lox was delicious and the place is perfectly clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was pretty good. Service could be better. It was busy concours weekend. Salad presentaion inside slice of prociutto was different.  [END]
[BEGIN] food is great, just order about 3 weeks ahead. the service is sooo slow and the staff is lifeless and disengaged.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, delicious oysters. Service took forever and they had the nerve to bring our check 5 minutes into our meal. That is just rude. The kitchen deserves the tip, not the servers.  [END]
[BEGIN] My first experience here with a Groupon was uninspiring as there was basically no pressure, but the manager very kindly offered me a free massage to make up for it, which was better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this location, convenient pit stop & nothing much in the area in terms of Vancouver Liquor store but parking sucks in the day time. cool that you can buy a 6-pack after you leave their pub too, provided that you're walking home ;) and they do deliver!  [END]
[BEGIN] Yogurt was delish but the staff was a little on the downer side. I understand it was the end of a holiday weekend but we got out into the rain to grab yogurt there! In their defense... They let us try all the flavors we wanted and it was late  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid latin offerings here, great spot for an authentic cuban sandwich. Love the cuban chicken dishes. Or ask what's good that day and go for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Memo to self: avoid calamari in Irish bars... Chewy (frozen), no lemon slices? No sauce? 3 stars for cheap beer and parking.  [END]
[BEGIN] I agree with the rest of the Yelpers on this one: you could definitely do worse than The Sevens, but don't bother making it a destination. There's nothing particularly bad about it, there's just not anything particulary outstanding about it either.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rustic handcrafted noodles are earthy and chewey. However menu selection isn't too deep. I was hoping for Japanese pub food like karaage or okonomiyaki.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent Pizza a bit pricey but still ok for the first rate ingredients they use... Will def go back  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a bakery and rude staff -- very popular with locals though. The place was clean and food was fine, but this should be labeled restaurant. Good location, but you may have to park a few blocks away.  [END]
[BEGIN] ok...so this is pretty good pizza. not greek...italiano  [END]
[BEGIN] The quinoa burger is tasty and a great option for veggies in ATL. But the sweet potato fries are the real jam. It's a fun environment but can get crazy busy. I'd recommend going for lunch when you can really enjoy the food and aren't cramped among the crowd.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yeah. Unmmm. They'll get to your order when they get to your order. Don't expect to be in and out on this location.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't have a ton to say about Wang's. It gets a third star for the pricing. It's cheap. The food fits right into the generic fast Asian food mold. I haven't found anything on the menu special, but everything I've had has been ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the restaurant. I Enjoy the potstickers and they keep me coming back. The menu is large and all the BBQ meats are good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Winter Garden chili's has the same menu. Service and food are pretty standard. Affordable decent food for lunch or dinner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just don't look around or up or elsewhere....but food is good fer sher! Fire Marshall must eat free here....no proper egress for emergencies and not disability friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] For a place called Hong Kong, this place is pretty American. Otherwise, the stars are for the scorpion bowl-sweetness. Everything else is just dirty and grungy. =/  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm not a huge fan of this place but it does have charm. Definitely different than most pho places. It feels authentic because it's run by Buddhist nuns who speak little English.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price it is amazing ! Service was great but the salad bar and side table was lacking. Not as clean as I would have thought for the area- could keep better maintenance on the salad bar and side table.  [END]
[BEGIN] Selection is hit or miss-- but I expect this from this type of store. Can be expensive. Definitely worth stopping in!  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a burger with goat cheese and it was amazing if not a little sloppy. I couldn't finish it and unfortunately was unable to save it because it was doomed to be soggy in an hour.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was great and the coffee drinks amazing. The food was just alright. Don't go hungry, but do go if you want a quaint place to read the paper and drink some good coffee.  [END]
[BEGIN] I personally didn't like much The hamburgers regular sweet potatoes is not that great so to me didn't worth going  [END]
[BEGIN] WAX focuses on natural beauty treatments and is environmentally friendly. The aestheticians and staff were knowledgable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was ok. Just like average Boston seafood restaurant. The oysters were mediocre. But, the roasted Maine lobster was delicious. If you come here, I def recommend the roasted lobster as a main dish. Service was mediocre. Nothing special.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sushi was good, volcano roll was great and so was the sweet and sour soup. The waitress was not so great and I think it's a bit overpriced for what you get.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great house tequila shots, but overall this was an extremely noisy experience. Music was absolutely blasting by the bar and I couldn't hear myself think.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sea World is fun but too expensive. Parking. $15 Stroller rental. $19 Popcorn (2), hot dogs (2), colas (3), snacks (2) is $37 Carnival game $5 On the bright side, iris not as crowded as Disney.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food has always been good, but the price for the amount of food is crazy. To top it off they have started giving you your food in smaller container and pretending its still the same amount when its not  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was sub par. Didn't enjoy our meal. I had the Gnocci with meat sauce but there wasn't any meat in it. Wife had the veal and it didn't have any flavor. On the bright side service was attentive. Ambiance was underwhelming.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad. Spring rolls had more rice than I generally like. The pho was tasty but could have used more herbs- like basil.  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried the shot it was good nice pick me upper the line wasnt long at all and the prices are a nice steal  [END]
[BEGIN] Only have 2 free lunches in Austin. Wa seeking the best. This wasn't it. Pretty good. Not the Texas BBQ I've heard so much about. Meat had been sitting there a while. Beans and Mac n cheese also sitting a while. I'm going to keep searching today. Going to franklin.  [END]
[BEGIN] lunch - good burger and good salads. At night it's scary when the cougars are on the prowl hunting for young men.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think Jillian's is overrated. It is really expensive and you can drop a ton of cash before you realize it. The pool tables are nice though and it is kind of a cool place. It's worth going once in a while, but I couldn't be there all that often.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only had cocktails at happy hour... Dishes that went by looked great and atmosphere is young and fun! Would like to go back and eat there.  [END]
[BEGIN] BBH - Meh. Regular pho (rare steak with beef balls) - Decent. Spring Rolls - Amazing! Get the spring rolls. It's the only item on the menu worthy of 5 stars! PS. They have a (small) private parking lot at the back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food and plenty of it. Wife loved her omelette. Good French toast and bacon. I asked for crispy hash browns and bacon and unlike most places they served me crispy hash browns and bacon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very expensive but good gym attire. I come here to look fabulous at the gym and it works great. The only problem is this place is very expensive and I hate parking at legacy place. Other than that great store.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chopped brisket sandwich was okay. Potato salad was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] ordered the Steak Sandwich, very tough steak. Location is very small, arrive early for lunch. Service was attentive  [END]
[BEGIN] Someone was nice enough to reach our to me and offer me a refund and free pastries, I'm giving additional stars for good customer service and I appreciate the owners for considering my opinion  [END]
[BEGIN] The place is not bad, but just the way it works is weird. The food takes a little while to come out, and there is order to it or at least that is what it felt like. I like the food but it's not great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Average place food-wise, but the staff is friendly and the decor is beautiful. There is no parking directly out front, but metered spots down the street, not too far away. - absolute best guacamole around - I recommend the pollo a la crema  [END]
[BEGIN] BBQ is good. Not exceptional nor distinctive. Only one sauce offered. Ordered 1/2lb of brisket, pulled pork, and ribs. But was less than 1/3 lb servings each. Mac n cheese side was good. Very noisy in the inside dining area. Rooftop would have been better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mehhhh everyone raves about this place but I don't see the big deal. Staff was too busy gossiping to be attentive, food was ok. The only "good" thing here is the coffers, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Disappointing. I am a Red Robin lover but find the service at this location to be terrible. The food quality is inconsistent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cream corn, fries, chicken & waffles were good. Meatloaf melt did not impress. Bacon in it was good. Bread had a nice sweetness but meat was dry... Inside is cute and kitschy. I'll stick with 4 Rivers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sorry! I really wanted this to be my go-to place, but the last two times I went here, the service was very slow, and the lady was somewhat dismissive. In my first review, I gave an extra star for cheap and quick service, but the inconsistency drops it back down.  [END]
[BEGIN] The portions for the sashimi are small compared to the high prices. The service is excellent but the consistency of the hamachi / yellowtail is disheartening. Although the sashimi is passable the prices are too high considering what where you are and what you are paying for.  [END]
[BEGIN] I can't say I've ever been very impressed with a meal here, but yet I continue going back. I guess that says something, right? It's decent Mexican, though I could recommend better. Great location though, and the drinks selection is pretty fun. Sans the bloody marys. Holy horseradish.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty average Shane's. Lots of seating and of course ample BBQ sauce! Went with the Big Daddy. When I received the dish, was skeptical due to the somewhat small appearance, but ended up being a pretty filling dish.  [END]
[BEGIN] A good spot to check out once. The servers are friendly and fun atmosphere. You really pay a premium for that atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic service, excellent lamb and chicken schwarma roll ups. The falafel was crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside. It was very tasty. Excellent tahnini sauce, what more could you want? As a reminder: hungry customers might think about getting two roll ups as they aren't the biggest.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are going to get anything from here, go for the gyro! That's the best thing on the menu and the only place I know of where you can get a good gyro....and I've been in boston for 11 years!  [END]
[BEGIN] Parish offers sandwiches created by local celebrity chefs. The prices are outrageous, but you are going for the experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty cool spot. You will usually hear some awesome ambient music from Moody right upstairs. Reasonably priced menu and a substantial wine selection. Pizza and wine are usually my goto here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't get the shrimp and grits for $9. It is served in ramekin dish. Wife got chicken and she was happy though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place in downtown for lunch. People craving for a spicy dish try spicy chicken pot and ask them to make it extra HOT!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was a little cold, shredded chicken was dry but salsas were delicious and were able to mask the dryness. My kids liked the carne asada tacos. Convenient if you are staying at the Marriott. Closes by 2 though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wanted to love it but felt like a factory riding on a wave. Good food; sucky service. No full bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bun tom ga nuong. Meh Vietnamese food. The nuoc mam is so diluted, but the meat is seasoned fine  [END]
[BEGIN] Really nice food but service was incredibly slow. Came in with an hour to go before I had to leave and didn't get anything until 45 minutes after I came in. Really nice people though, and the food seemed very nice. I'm sure it will get better on speed... hopefully!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good had no flavor. I added plenty salsa and cilantro It didn't fill me up either. My food got to my table before I even sat down. I was getting my soda and salsa and the lady said here's your food. Less than 2 mins after I ordered.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yea it's pretty good. Best fried chicken I've had in Austin so that's something. Had a to go order for two breasts and a wing, only got one breast... for $15 that's pretty disappointing. Check your to go orders people.  [END]
[BEGIN] Airport cafe. Not bad overall for a cafe in an airport- clean and well stocked with tasty looking food items. Good help got me my order quickly and on my way just as fast - nothing spectacular but decent overall. Worth a shot if in this terminal!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food. I love the atmosphere. Awesome location. You can sit out side with a roof on the sidewalk  [END]
[BEGIN] A place to get alcohol. A few sales here and there to keep me coming back. What I enjoy are wine and whiskey tasting events they hold at their stores.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not what I was expecting, so the third star is for the benefit of my doubt. The burrito was tasty; think Chipotle but not overly cilantro'd. The ambience was meh, and the lack of beer was distressing. Hopefully when the beer is actually present, I'll find everything else better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just had drinks here, great beer selection. This would be a great place to come and watch football on Sundays or any other big sporting event.  [END]
[BEGIN] It may not be nearly as popular or offer as many services as its neighbor in Allston, but if you want a clean car it will only cost you $8. They usually don't have a wait and you'll be crusing 'round Brighton in your clean car in a jiff.  [END]
[BEGIN] The price is fair, decoration is cute, and service is fast. However, the food and drinks aren't very outstanding, but it's a nice place to chill and hang out with friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's alright. We went after the club in Boston. Price is more expensive than nyc. The person got our orders wrong. One of the rice didn't come with pita bread and the other one didn't come with veggie..... Prob just gonna get it from nyc..  [END]
[BEGIN] Yummy, cheap, great hungover food. Inside is very small - but they play great music. I've been here a few times and would go back again - as long as you aren't looking for anything amazing. It's a cute little diner.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wasn't really impressed. The food wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked and it was a little too pricey for its quality. Nice environment though.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place used to great....now it is a little less than average. The service was extremely slow. It took more than an hour and a half to get served. They ought to rename this and call it " very slow and below average sushi" :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Just had brunch here today. They have work to do. Service was slow in both taking our order and getting our food. Food was just OK. What we didn't like were the number of flies hovering around our table. Ugh!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] UPDATE! Nothing's coming.  [END]
[BEGIN] My first time here and the service was absolutely fantastic. The food, not so much. I got the fajita burrito with beef and the beef was very bland and slimy. I'd be willing to give the food another chance if for nothing more than phenomenal service I received.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad, very fresh, cheap and fast. Can't say it is the best but definatley not the worst. Fairly enjoyable for a quick lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dunno why nobody is mentioning the live music this place has. It's usually good. It's worth just having a beer and listening to the band. You can also smoke. I've never eaten there, being poor :) and working till late so I have no comment on the food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a bad venue for a band. Really small setting, so you will be very close to the action. Im' not sure how many big bands play here, but you'll get plenty of local and small bands making their rounds here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wasn't very impressed with my latte or the speed or quality of service. Plus is that there are a lot of comfier wing back chairs but even those had holes in them and were falling apart.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lamb with cumin was ok, not the best I have ever had. Also not very impressed by their cold dishes. The two dishes I would recommend are dry fried beef and dry fried chilly chicken. The beef especially worth trying.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very average. My wife's Cuban sandwich had very little extras on it. My chicken fingers were OK but there was a nice selection of sauces to help. Good service and the food was quick, but overall the food was just average.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was ok. Had a living social coupon so thought we would give it a try. The chorizo was good but a little oily. The home made bread was great. Stay away from the octopus. Too slimy. Clams in tomato sauce was above average  [END]
[BEGIN] The chicken was great; crispy, moist and flavorful. Waiting 35 minutes for a two piece snack though was ridiculous. They have a few kinks to work out.  [END]
[BEGIN] To their credit Kimberly called my wife today to deduct $50 from the bill. Her rationale was that she wants happy customers. I commend their behavior and appreciate this.  [END]
[BEGIN] Watershed announced today that they will be closing August 6th. Sad news for Decatur.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros - Affordable Location Clean Rooms Friendly Staff Free Wi Fi. Cons - Construction. Hotel is going through a remodel. Parking Lot. Beds in Queen Suite looked more like a Full. Elevator If I knew the construction was complete, I would probably stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome food...poor service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Local coffee shop. Nothing particularly noteworthy. If you're in the area, a good shop for the expected selection, but not worth going out of the way.  [END]
[BEGIN] It smells great from the outside, and it pretty divey inside. They need more outdoor seating. Our kids liked the pizza, and the gluten-free pizza was very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was good but food was very mediocre, but taking in consideration it's a restaurant in UBC it taste better than most restaurants here  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice for a small place to grab & go. Nothin g really made it stand out for me. I'm sure if I'll be coming back any time soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I had an anniversary dinner here. Nothing about the restaurant stood out. Atmosphere was a-typical. Service was quick and friendly. Food = over priced for quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped here for a few drinks before dinner, there were some hits and misses and some ingredients that ran out pretty early in the evening. The appetizers were nicely done though.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was pretty good, and the price was fair. We came in for breakfast, and enjoyed eggs Benedict and an omlette. Both were tasty, but the coffee was awful. All around decent experience and will most likely return.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is alright. I used to love it but they've changed their menu and the food is pretty mediocre. I think I'll try other places before returning to this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think the coffee tastes great, but not $5.35 for a 12oz alternative milk latte - great. Prices are too steep but otherwise great taste and cool vibe.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice food (bit more expensive than i thought it would be), friendly staff, fast service.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was fantastic and the ambiance was cool, but the food was cold and average at best. Way over priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] My nail tech was constantly interrupted by the phone, other walk in customers and the just disappeared for a bit. I just wanted to get in and out. I think her work suffered due to distractions. Otherwise happy they were open on Memorial Day.  [END]
[BEGIN] My preferred Thai take out restaurant. The brown soyed noodles are very filling and the crazy noodles are crazy spicy with thai basil.  [END]
[BEGIN] Strong staple in Austin. Have had lots of great good here over the years. Good food if you are into greasy stuff. Ordered potato crusted tilapia and it was a grease fest. I mean I knew it was fried but wow its overwhelmingly gross. Note to self: stick to salads!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Took some clients to Tucci's for a lunch. We had a nice private room, and the food was nice for a lunch. The service was excellent, and I'm excited to return and try more items on their menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing fancy -- just a decent, friendly neighborhood pizza joint. Has a full-bar but family-friendly. Nice patio seating in the heart of Oakhurst Village.  [END]
[BEGIN] What can you say... its a CVS... has everything I need for a quick stop... even drugs!  [END]
[BEGIN] BRING BACK HONEY WE SHRUNK THE AUDIENCE. captain eo didn't wow me and I didn't really enjoy it. Hwsta however was amazing, please disney bring it back.  [END]
[BEGIN] A bit gimmicky, but there are some cool flavors. But be warned, if you eat more than two, you're stomach will punish you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well-organized clean store with helpful staff and beautiful merchandising of sport and regular bras... I only consider shopping there during the semi-annual clearances due to their pricing.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was great and it was at a reasonable price. The only reason why I'm giving it 3 starts instead of 5 is because the person serving the food was NOT wearing gloves.  [END]
[BEGIN] Two slices and i was stuff. Hearty toppings, almost deep dish style, thick crust. It was good but i am the pickiest pizza person. The leftover piece was almost better the next day. So filling though so if you are insatiable, go here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was delicious but portions were small. Waitress was friendly even got me another drink I didn't like the first one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pricing and presentation of food are spot on. The cleanliness and service were also quite admirable. The food...just okay. Lacked some seasoning and there appeared to be a lot more "freezer than fresh" options. With a little finesse, I'm sure this place could be a neighborhood staple.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing that's going to blow you away. The food is good and that's the best part. Recommend for a quick Chinese meal. Haven't had the Pho here, which I can assume is their specialty, but I've heard it's great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was not impressed with their cabbage rolls it was very bland but the cream puff is delicious  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the food and environment. SUPER friendly staff. Would give 5 stars if I could go there Sunday afternoons, they didn't run out of everything I am craving the day I m craving it and the prices were a tad better. Really do love it, though!  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is good and so is the staff. Not very impressive food options though. Pizza was sloppy Tried two different types of pizza but it was just ok. May be its more focussed on bowling than food. Reasonable priced and suitable for all age groups!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I think you go more for the scenery was a very nice place right in downtown Austin we went in the evening the place was lit up the staff was friendly but the food is just kind of bland.  [END]
[BEGIN] Annoying loud babies should not be taken to coffee shops. And certainly not two of them. For fire roasted coffee, it was pretty bland. I found the coffee at Thunderbird much better and flavorful...  [END]
[BEGIN] Was just ok. I thought it would be a 5 star walking in but the service and food was just ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] This store is a trip. Used to be really sketchy but not so much since the re-model. Still a good store to shop at.  [END]
[BEGIN] Something for everyone type of shop. They constantly get new stuff so I love stopping by when I'm in the area. Prices though are a little all over the place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was underwhelmed. We had the Reuben, Tuscan Garbanzo soup, and the Oatmeal Cream Pie. Everything was okay but nothing was yummy. And it was fairly expensive. I might comeback if I was having lunch with a vegan but not otherwise.  [END]
[BEGIN] Maybe my standard is too high? Or maybe the beef noodle soup is just better in LA. I could taste the msg.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had made reservations for diner at a really early time because there were none for a later time but they were completely empty. Food was good but not great and I wanted great!?  [END]
[BEGIN] The ambiance was nice, but the food was really inconsistent. The calamari was bland and uneventful, but the pear crostada dessert was downright lovely. The cod with lobster risotto was nothing special, but the tortellini with butternut squash was to die for. Overall, it just fell short.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like most Burtons location, the food is good and the service is fine. BUT, dishes and silverware are consistently dirty...how does that happen and how does the person setting up tables not notice? Eeghaad!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Really tasty food. Nice atmosphere SLOW service. We waiting 50mims for food. The table beside us waited 20 mins for their bill.... 2 servers on for the whole restaurant which is quite small. But obviously they cannot handle it! Good food, not that convinced if its worth the wait  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall is good, is worth the line up I don't think so, mainly Instagram addict's go here. Believe me the food is great, service is ok, the hype about it I still dont get it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've usually had good service at this place. When it first opened the service was impeccable but over the course of the time the quality of the service has dropped. I am definitely a returning customer but sad that the service isn't what it was supposed to be. : (  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is ok BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY HAVE FRIED TWINKEYS!!! holy crap i had an orgasam in my pants.... sorry try it also beer on taps are pretty good  [END]
[BEGIN] Music was really nice, but I think it may be this place's only saving grace. Drinks are overpriced, and their bathroom is disgusting. Nice people though, and I would be back if my friends made me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just Ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich No Onions , with 10 pc buffalo wings all Flats combo lets see how it is as the delivery man is on his Merry Way.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the Jerk Chicken Sandwich and I thought it was okay. It was hoping for a 'kick' in the flavor, but I didn't really get any of that. I'd like to give this place a second chance and try out their other items!  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a lot better and cheaper then the old golds gym that used to be here way back. It is good for cardio weights , women classes, it has daycare, flat tv everywhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good, nothing to write home about. For me Mod Pizza tastes better and have better salads you can customize. I would eat here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place tastes so good, but the price is too rich for our blood. It is worth treating yourself with a coupon. It still wont be like paying for Round Table...but it WILL taste much better. Again, gotta treat one-self on occasion, right?? Love the Bike T Shirts.  [END]
[BEGIN] thin ramen noodles lacks the chewy texture, prob needs more egg, broth is good not overly salty, egg was good, portion was super small for the price, good but not wowed  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is always great and the service is fast, friendly, and intuitive to your needs. Lost two stars for dirty spoon atmosphere & the fact that they don't accept credit cards.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went there expecting scallops and other food , but they changed the menu they day before I visited. It was disappointing. I tried A burger and mushroom cannelloni. Stout of the day, drought of the day. Food was okay. Beer was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food isn't great but it's not awful, either. It's the perfect spot if you've got a hangover or want a casual breakfast without an insane wait. I also love all the ladies who work there.  [END]
[BEGIN] 3 stars for the donut holes but everything other than that is horribly oily and super sweet. Definitely overpriced for average $3:50 a donut this quality. I wonder those who gave good rating never had a decent donut.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food a little bit too much salt in the food service not very good washrooms are filthy. Price is reasonable. Portions are good size.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a fan of Coast. I'm not entirely sure why it is such a popular place, to be honest. I find the food to be bland, lacking flavor and mostly taste of butter and salt. Quite disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] 2nd visit. Scotch egg just as delicious. Salmon hash had salmon to potato ratio approx. 1:10, so that was a bit disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was just ok. The atmosphere was nice and felt cozy but the food wasnt the greatest.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'll agree with most reviewers in that this is just an average neighborhood haunt, good for a few drinks on a weeknight. Doesn't take many people to make this place crowded. Closet-sized bar area. Seven's Ale tastes suspiciously like Harpoon Munich Dark.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food selection isn't much to talk about. It mostly revolves around a buffet option which includes most of their menu items.  [END]
[BEGIN] Usual Chipotle. Same food and service as all the others. Building was clean and kept up nice. Very nice patio. It was a perfect weather night so we ate out there. Will visit again when in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Laughing goat's Cappuccino was not very good, Ozo dose a much better job  [END]
[BEGIN] I was underwhelmed. Maybe there was too much hype? Maybe the donuts in my hometown are just exceptional (Chicago)? I bought 5 different types to share with friends. I thought they were all on the dry side. My friends agreed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place for lunch. Take my daughter here for lunch here regularly and sit outside. Service is good. Pizza is great...... I am a regular here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really great view/location. We sat outdoors. Mediocre food. A bit pricey. Server not very attentive. Don't order the apple crisp... more like cold stewed apples. Not worthy of a return visit in my opinion.  [END]
[BEGIN] The bun bo hue has the same broth as the pho. That's a pretty strong sign as to the authenticity of the place. Luckily, the pho broth is decent, but not worth the drive. Atmosphere upstairs is decent, but downstairs is a unimpressive. I won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the prices, you would think it would clean. NOPE, car was still dirty and left marks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, nice portions, good service, and reasonable prices. A solid choice for dinner in the North End.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is our favorite to go to Italian restaurant, we love the shrimp Alfredo. The service has never been the best, either they are overwhelmed, irritated, or just not happy to serve you.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been to the Blue Ox three times. I live in Lynn so it isn't very hard for me to get to. The food was OK. The decor and service is great! I love the atmosphere. I would recommend to anyone who wants to have a nice night out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Same old chipotle as the rest. Thankfully this location is on the larger size, meaning lots of tables and chairs. The only downside is when the sun is setting if the blinds are not closed, u WILL be blinded if sitting in the wrong spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had chicken breast. Taste really good. Only the small plate size is too small. A good place to eat not a good place for eat full.  [END]
[BEGIN] One.of my favorite pdx Starbucks. The staff is always friendly and courteous. For the area its really really clean and the.drinks are nice and.strong. Love it!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good sushi, but really unfriendly and the price was not so good for sushi in Vancouver as well...not gonna be my favourite sushi place here  [END]
[BEGIN] Good main courses and friendly, though understaffed, service. The banchan is less than average though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kinda dead for a Saturday tbh. The sauce on the prime rib was good. Can't say the same thing for the prime rib tho. Employees were nice. The barrel theme inside got a little old tho.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is the slowest chick fil a on the planet. I feel like they could possibly be understaffed??? Idk all i know is every time i come, it takes 15 + minutes to clear 5-7 cars causing the line to be wrapped around the building consistently.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is more cozy than the food is good, but it's an interesting change of pace and has a nice atmosphere. I'll probably be back here on a nice day to hang out under their ivy-covered outdoor-seating terrace and get some work done.  [END]
[BEGIN] There's always a long line although the meat is delicious the bread is too hard and doesn't compliment the sandwich as a whole  [END]
[BEGIN] customer service ehhh, 3 star because pretzel was fresh out the oven.  [END]
[BEGIN] The green beans mixed with spaetzle and bacon may be one of the best side dishes ever devised. The Reuben made w a big pink slab o' sausage was just OK. Good service and tasty beer. Worth another visit next time I'm in Columbus.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service sucks! The woman at the register is rude and has a very poor attitude! The food was very good, but it took long for the food to come out & when I asked how long, the woman said "I don't know".. super careless.  [END]
[BEGIN] Agree with previous reviews, great BBQ but little pricey. One side, two slices of brisket, 2 ribs and my husband had same but with potato salad and 1 drink it was 30$ bucks!! Whoa. Patio seating is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] I first came here when my sister was in town. She loves this place, but not somewhere I would think a guy would shop at. To my surprise they do have guy stuff here. I managed to pick up a wallet and some readers here at a reasonable price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent food, it's more on the expensive side though. If you're vegan watch out for some of the options, as the thai options have fish sauce in them. They were giving out samples and it was not marked as having fish sauce.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is fine, alcohol is decent and the service can be great or awful. The bouncer is ridiculous.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went on a theater night so of course it was packed and noisy. Food was 4 stars, maybe even higher, but service was pretty average.  [END]
[BEGIN] Started off pretty good. The food was good but a little too heavy on the cheese and salt. Service started off good but then it slowed down. My marker for good service is when there is no empty drink on the table for another round.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean but service wouldn't crack a smile. Ordered egg flower soup which was bland, and egg roll wasn't too bad but not great. Might go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Slooow service and have already run out of products ie. chai and pumpkin syrup and they are a new facility. I'm sure they will improve, the more experience they have.  [END]
[BEGIN] I found cool vintage bracelets, but most of the vintage clothes/boots I easily found in the local thrift stores around town. Doesn't hurt to check out what they have in stock.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good but nothing special. I was drawn in by the hype. Unfortunately the cappuccino was nothing special--the coffee was ordinary, not robust. Also the advice to get the chocolate croissant "warmed" did not work out. They microwaved it and that made the pastry chewy... Oh well, still a fun place.  [END]
[BEGIN] The drinks are creative, tasty, and classic. However, the service here is unfriendly and pretty much pretentious. I'd rather have another greasy dive in the neighborhood over this cocktail closet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fancy restaurant right at the conner, next to The mall. Food was alright, but where I sat was to dark for me :( The service took quite long on each process. Especially, the waiting time that I had to wait for my food (It was not busy at all)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. A bit pricey but all the food is great and they have an original menu of bevy's to please everyones taste buds. Some of the rif raf tend to float on through from the nearbye E.Hastings district  [END]
[BEGIN] Food wasn't as great as the Newton, Ma location. Plus the seafood didn't taste fresh. Will give the place a try again in couple of months  [END]
[BEGIN] It kind of gives me the creeps but it's fascinating all the same time. It's too dark for me in the evening. The place is really busy, but totally worth a stop if you have time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Typical Indian lunch place where you would like to eat once a month if you work in the same/one of the nearby buildings. The food is just average, which is not a bad thing..  [END]
[BEGIN] Known for chefs around town donating a signature sandwich Beet Salad- doused in balsamic dressing and had an odd combo of tomatos and blue cheese. decent but too heavy on dressing Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich- potato salad good  [END]
[BEGIN] Our server cassandra was so nice, friendly, and patient! Ask for her when visiting Joes  [END]
[BEGIN] Ambiance : Ummm...not so good. Dark, stale cigarette smell, and sometimes a bit dirty. Service : Average Food : Amazing Cabrito (Come on, order the goat.) This is reason enough to drive down to Manchaca  [END]
[BEGIN] * I appreciate them having some vegetarian options. The veggie chorizo is delish and their award winning enchilada with salsa verde was ok. Not a place I'd come back to personally. * My friends ordered meat dishes and they looked incredible. They seemed pleased and cleaned their plates.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful supermarket always find something I always have good deals hope it just get better and better  [END]
[BEGIN] good atmosphere. Like the seats ( usually it's hard to find one)! can get really crowded ( I don't like the crowd). But fairly a good bar around MIT campus. I go there often. Most Grad MIT students hang out there. Some djs are good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great atmosphere (if you don't mind the smoke), but the whiskey is absurdly expensive. You must be paying a premium for being allowed to smoke your cigar there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Is nice place but to small place with of high loud. The service is good. Is expensive  [END]
[BEGIN] I was not overly impressed with the rooms at Animal Kingdom. They were outdated and the bathrooms were extremely dark. I would have liked an option of adjoining rooms. The grounds were beautiful and my son absolutely loved the playground and water slide.  [END]
[BEGIN] I dropped in once with some friends for a casual dinner. This is one of those open-air picnic table places where you get buckets of sea critters. Not a bad choice when you have a big group of friends, especially if the weather is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value. $2.25 per selection. I spent 8 bucks and had enough to take home a snack.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute place, ok staff. Food was average, nothing special. Tried fish tacos, pick and chips and wings. Tacos were lacking flavor, pick was ok , wings meh. Decent drink  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food but they don't use gloves. Order breakfast and watch the cooks bare hand your bread and bacon. Just not sanitary, but no complaints on the food.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Harvard Coop is your typical university bookstore, except that it's owned by Barnes and Noble. Great selection of books. Textbooks are overpriced, but they are at every college bookstore. I like just wandering around in there and looking at the books.  [END]
[BEGIN] Veggie cigars were five star great, but veggie tagine was artichokes, peas, and carrots in sauce. The sauce was great, but the veggies weren't substantive. This place I'm sure is better for meat eaters.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really love the eggs here and the bottomless pancakes cannot be beat for the value (about $7 an order)! Since its close by our home, we go here often. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the waitresses leave a little (or a lot) to be desired!  [END]
[BEGIN] Maybe I was in a good mood but this place seems to be seriously underrated (I had never heard of it). The food here (that I tried) was all good and the place is very cumfy and family-friendly. I wish it was in my neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] While the food was GREAT... it was so packed, and crazy and chaotic... that it made it difficult to enjoy.  [END]
[BEGIN] More expensive that hobby lobby. First time in a JoAnn Fabric in a long time. I think I will stick to Hobby Lobby or Michaels  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was delicious, though over priced for the portion size. The restaurant itself is in a beautiful location and the ambiance is wonderful. Service was great!  [END]
[BEGIN] The lunch entry is good but not worth the price. The appetizers and salads are about average. I give a three star because the server is really nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has a good ambience and good food (specially sashimi), however, a little bit pricey compared to other good sushi places around the area. I might come back to this place, but probably not sooner...  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for a nice dinner. The food was delicious but service was subpar. Waitress didnt check on us after food came until it was time to bring us the check.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good but the chick working today should fix her attitude. You're probably gonna lose customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank you to FedEx. They refunded me for the insurance. I didn't have to go through all the paperwork. I feel much better about this company.  [END]
[BEGIN] CPK is a great place to eat at the mall (especially when given the other alternatives). The food and staff is always consistent. I have no complaints. Try the Thai crunch salad and the wild mushroom pizza.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its all you can eat sushi, don't expect high end sushi but its not bad if your hungry or have really hungry friends  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is slightly above average as I have tried almost all of their pizzas. However, I believe its a bot overpriced if you'd like to get it delivered. I can't convince myself to give this place more than 3 stars as their service is too average too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent but not great Mexican. Didn't finish my chicken chimi because it was so bland and lacked seasoning. Our waitress struggled with not basic orders as her English was not strong. Will probably return because family loves it here but wouldn't recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a bad place to grab coffee and a pastry late at night. It's cool that they are open late and their prices don't break the bank either, for a downtown establishment. Having said all that, they're nothing to write home about. Just another coffee and dessert kind of place.  [END]
[BEGIN] OK food for an OK price. If you're hungry and cheap, go here. You may stuff yourself silly, but you won't spend a fortune. For all the haters who can't handle good old fashioned American obesity and lots of kids, what else do you expect at a buffet?!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's okay but just okay. Food was okay, nothing too special. I felt like it was overpriced. The service was good and the atmosphere is nice and the place is nicely decorated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Could be better. Not many people inside and food too along time to get to me. Waitresses were nice. Food was OK. Being used to truck stops it is close to it.  [END]
[BEGIN] 3.5 stars...like the food and am usually patient but 25 minutes for eggs on a Thursday seems crazy. Service always nice though and atmosphere enjoyable. Will come back but may limit to the Mon thru Wed timeframe when hope of meal turnaround better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great range of products, good prices too. Perfumes, hair products, nail products, and skin. Girl that is ALWAYS there is informed but kind of fakey friendly--just a pet peeve. She just seems burned out and bored but does answer any questions pleasantly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Generally ok experience. Check in was a little slow. But the front desk is very friendly. A little smell in the corridor and the room though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great selection of bubble tea. Taste good. Price is not bad. Just a bit slow on service. When we came place is packed and it's 9:15pm. Not enough space to sit. Great for take out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Your shrimp po'boys are heavy on the shrimp and light on the bread and sauce. Strangely the same motif for the cheesesteak, lots of meat, less cheesy greasyness that is so desired. Killer tho: sweet potato tots with the myriad bbq sauces. I could eat them shits all day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got the chicken enchiladas with ranchero sauce. Spicy good! Buy 1 get one free enchilada plates on Sunday an Monday.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is always good, but service is suspect. Waitress delivered a bubbletes and flicked the straw down onto the table like it was a dirty napkin.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lamb laffa was ok. I think the wrap had too much going on and ended up muddying the flavors.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is good overall, the sushi not so much but for the price of lunch it is worth eating there.  [END]
[BEGIN] The pork and veggie pancake is still my favourite of anywhere I've been but all the rest of the dishes are similar quality to any other korean restaurant you would go to. Good if you are in the area and don't want to spend too much.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is packed after hours so I decided to try the food. Overall good food and everyone speaks Spanish. Cashier didn't speak English but he understood I wanted sauces. Greasy food but fast with lots of sauce options.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like Greek Style pizza, this is a good place to go. I personally am not a fan of this style, but I still found their pizza enjoyable. 2 slices and a can of soda for under $4 is hard to beat for a quick and inexpensive lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is generally good but the service... Took 25 min for the main course after we got out appetizer, server never refilled our water glasses (no other drinks ordered). It wasn't all that crowded either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Exspensive for what it is, good options, decent food.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is better than good. The lunch menu is tasty and reasonably priced. Dinner menu is silly overpriced. But what really kills this place is service. Maybe if you sit at the bar and order(?)... otherwise forget it. The wait is not worth the frustration.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wait staff had little knowledge of the seafood and menu in general and as I am a die hard fisherman of our great NW it didn't settle well with me. Come for the happy hour specials and then split  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to like this place a lot, but recently they have gotten sloppy with consistency of food/flavor and service. I'm a frustrated customer - I will continue to go, but wish they would get their act together  [END]
[BEGIN] They use soy sauce to marinate their carne asada.... They use paper napkins... Nice atmosphere though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall still very good. Steak was a lot fattier than it should have been and service was a little forgetful but otherwise good Cajun food and desserts. 3.5 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went here yesterday after being turned away from a couple other nail places in Stoneham as a walk-in for a pedi. Nice people. Turned out decent. No hard sell, no anything as others have said. A bit more expensive than I had hoped but, overall a good experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] My egg sandwich was delicious, but the gravy was SO salty. They had a christian station on loud the whole time I was there, which was a little confusing. Cute place with nice cooks.  [END]
[BEGIN] We finally had the chance to drop in for dinner, we went with the all you can eat sushi we ordered 1 of each (2-3 limit at a time of each) food and freshness is not the best, service is slow but it was a good experience  [END]
[BEGIN] Tad overrated.. the Chocolate Crunch had a weird berry which I am not a fan of.. Good for folks who like flavors mixed up in the name of fusion but call me old fashioned.. Will stick to Pips donuts  [END]
[BEGIN] Service, atmosphere were all very good. However make sure you have lots of beverages to accompany the meat - if you like salt - lots of salt - then you will love it. If you don't, stick to the salad bar  [END]
[BEGIN] I only come for the buffet, but it's a great buffet as long as you get there closer to noon.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a really cute place and the food I ate was average. I had potato leek soup. I should have tried a sandwich instead.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fine beer. Nothing special for Portland. Slow and and your typical PNW passive aggressive service. Seems hard to be courteous and give and shit in this town.  [END]
[BEGIN] The #1 without pork blood and feet is my favourite! The dumplings are delicious as well. The spring rolls are perfectly crispy. Will def come here more often.  [END]
[BEGIN] Enough though this place looks like it hasn't changed since the day it opened, they do a great job. There was a stain on my dress that they were not able to get out so they discounted the cleaning. The employees were kind as well. I will us them again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Orange leaf has a good selection of toppings and yogurt and everything is delicious but they are expensive. There is no AC either which is not fun on a hot summer day. Sometimes parking in salem can be a pain as well  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place, enjoyed the tasting menu, but our experience just was a little short of deserving 4 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is okay...I got the jasmine milk tea and asked for less sugar and less ice. I got a watered down no sugar drink. It is also cash only. For almost $4 a cup, the portions are quite small as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their pizza is just okay. But the slices are large, and after a night drinking next door at Wally's, you'll think it is the best in the Boston.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a typical Japanese steakhouse with nothing separating it from the pack. If you absolutely love Japanese steakhouses, this is your place. If you are craving true Japanese food or sushi, find another restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried Stella now for brunch, dinner, and late night. Late night proved the winner with reliable cocktails and a funky vibe perfect for a nothing crazy night out. Stella is a restaurant with fun background music and a casually elegant flair.  [END]
[BEGIN] The chicken was pretty good. I overheard a waiter saying that he didn't know how the chicken was prepared and the restaurant only cooked it. A little sketchy as far as chicken places are concerned. Also, my waitress was very stubborn about providing too much water. Little less water please.  [END]
[BEGIN] The assistant GM called to help me figure out the credit card situation - he was much more helpful than the first person I talked to. I appreciate the time he took and his desire to make it right.  [END]
[BEGIN] Large selection of sandwiches and salads. Decent food, but not as good as it reads. The main reason to go is the outdoor seating on Boylston.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice latin Ambience. Corner-of-the-room singer dude and other patrons were loud as hell. Service all kinds of slow. Mofongo is basically offspring of mashed potatoes and unripe bananas. Pretty good. Chimichurri with the steak lacked tang. It's alright. Probably won't take the wife there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the best chipotle. Something about this place seems very minimalist and not in a fun cool art way. It's ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ok. Tables too close, too loud music, service was ehhh, too aggressive when getting settled, then long wait for food, which was adequate. Nothing special.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn't meet the hype for me either. Salsa is a standard measure for me on Mexican and it just wasn't that great. Overpriced to top it off. Service was ok but just not worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent calzones. Not the best ever but if you're craving one it's not too bad. Also got delivery via the Yelp app and provided instructions which either weren't read or didn't get relayed to the driver. A little annoying but ultimately he found us. So that's a plus!  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm not a fan of walking through cemeteries but this one was interesting. There's a lot of benches to rest on and the landscape is pretty. A lot of people seem to walk their dog around there. Probably the most prettiest cemetery I ever been to (so weird to say).  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location downtown and an awesome little refurbished warehouse feel to the bar out back. I just wish they'd had a more expansive selection for their happy hour beers. Pretty limited. The beers I had were pretty good, though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Suggestion to management: to alleviate "hogging" of tables during profitable lunch and dinner rush, which keeps steadily paying customers out, and you're providing free wi-fi, eliminate the wi-fi from 11:30 - 1:30 p.m. and 5:30 - 7:00 p.m.  [END]
[BEGIN] They finally brought back some of the old menu along with the creamy balsamic dressing. Yay!  [END]
[BEGIN] I would give this 3.5 stars if I could, better than average, but the hot and sour soup was corn starch heavy (and overly thick as a result). But otherwise excellent meal, good service, and a wide variety of atypical items on the menu (tea smoked duck, jellyfish, etc).  [END]
[BEGIN] The crab cakes were very good. Ahi ok. Wings over cooked. Salmon very good. Creme brûlée very good. Coffee room temperature. Mixed drinks were not great. Service was pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food and atmosphere. Better when not crowded, like on a weekday when everyone else is working. Gets crowded other times and can get loud. Seafood omelet options, yum.  [END]
[BEGIN] The whitefish salad was disappointing, it tasted too much like tuna fish and was too wet and salty. Even Acme whitefish salad from the supermarket is better, with a more pronounced smoky flavor and less liquid-y. The bagels are good though.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went on a Saturday afternoon and they only had the buffet option which wasn't good at all. I went there before on a weekday and enjoyed my time but the buffet was not fresh, didn't have my fav dishes.  [END]
[BEGIN] My family and I love love this authentic chinese restaurant! Service is fast and accurate. Our drinks are never empty which we love :) Lunch specials are excellent in price with a generous serving. Most definately will be returning. * The Brisket or Fish Hot Pot is my favorite.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great friendly staff and a very neat facility with a lot of equipment plus a pool and basketball court.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was told this was the best and honestly it's about the same at Pho Van. The service is abysmal, but that's to be expected at these Asian joints. I'm not convinced that this is the best just because I came from Philly where Pho was awesome. I'm stlil looking...  [END]
[BEGIN] Not my favorite HEB as I prefer the one on Slaughter and Escarpment. Decent place, but could use some housekeeping. People seemed friendly enough. I think Yelp has the address wrong a bit but will check that out!  [END]
[BEGIN] The waffle cone shattered when I bit into it. Decent taste and consistency but not destination ice cream. If they were open earlier in the day I might try the Cuban coffee offerings  [END]
[BEGIN] Dear Dennys, Your banana caramel french toast is balla! Love Always, Rosetta  [END]
[BEGIN] same concept like its Robson location, find your own prices by surfing on their gorgeous iMacs. A lot smaller store though, so means less traffic and more attentive service. Located across the lululemon store.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not great. Decent, but I would recommend going somewhere else. Steak was chewy. Kids tacos were a little different than kids typically expect but ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] The pricing of the food is reasonable; however the portions do seem a little bit small. However, the beer selection from Germany more than makes up for it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Tasty little pizza. Brought it home and enjoyed. Prefer Napoli much more. Got to have pizza once a week so checking out all  [END]
[BEGIN] Prices are higher in the saloon and they would not honor prices online. 35 for a 30 gel manicure is a bit pricey in my opinion.  [END]
[BEGIN] My Ethiopian friend recommends this to me. The decoration is fun. They have authentic Ethiopian food and the price is so cheap. The only complaint is that the parking is not very convenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pro: Interior decoration Good service Cozy atmosphere Con: No wifi No laptop policy The coffee and food all taste so so Good for groups to hang out, not recommend to come alone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty overpriced for what they offer to be honest. Thankfully though, the chicken fried steak was big enough that it was reasonable to split it between two people. That made the cost a bit better. The food was good though.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a super self-aware place trying extremely hard to disguise itself as a dive bar. It's not a dive bar, it's a gourmet gastropub that grew a beard and threw on skinny jeans and a meticulously chosen flannel. Once I let that go, it's A-OK for beer & pool.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just cause they are open late doesn't mean they serve alcohol late. They stop super early! And you can only use cash unless you sit down. If you get water they only sell bottles  [END]
[BEGIN] I had lunch here today and was just okay. The chicken was dry and underwhelming. The whole ordering system is unpleasant to watch because it looks like they are making a mess. The service is OK. I will most likely not return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice little dive bar type establishment. Nothing to fancy, but the bar was nice looking and clean inside. The tonic was completely flat in my gin and tonic but stuff happens. Heard them say they do burgers as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] good service, friendly bartenders... I just expected more selection from some place called an ale house lol. at least they have arrogant bastard, but I wish they had a double or triple IPA  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems they stepped it up a bit! The ribs I just had here are really good. Tender, falling-off-the-bone, nice sauce. Baked beans (Daddy's Best BBQ Beans) were delish, too. Reeealy tender smoked BBQ HOT wings good potato salad to soothe the burn.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the chicken panuchos, especially with the pickled onions. I am not big on the tacos as they don't have cilantro on them, and the meat is not that tender. They also are sometimes closed when their hours say they should be open.  [END]
[BEGIN] thought at first truck fed the SoWa market staff, until i read MC Slim's piece on the Phoenix. tried the panini of meatloaf, chorizo and pickles. good, tad salty. so spiked it with more pickles. solved. will def. try others on offer next sunday.  [END]
[BEGIN] 3-1/2 Stars. Friendly, local vibe and staff. Sat at a tall communal table, chatting - and exchanging tastes- with our neighbors, who were regulars. Next time we'll order the mussels with sausage, which were amazing. Black pappardelle with blackened shrimp was delish! Lobster bun was tasty. Cottage fries were overrated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Foods pretty good but pricey as expected for the location. Only thing is service was bit slow when we went with group of 6.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good sports/dive bar. Cheap prices, regular pub food. Had to lower the rating because always seems understaffed, or at least service is slow even when not busy. Often have to flag down your server if you want anything else. Fun spot for any CU games or other sports events.  [END]
[BEGIN] A-ok but not 4 stars. Fried oysters were small and lacked flavor. Food was good but not worthy of a four star rating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried their salmon don and it wasnt so bad. Beef tataki was decent but overpriced for the amount served! It's a tiny place with poor sound control, but their food is pretty decent quality. The only thing about this place is that the waitresses aren't very accommodating..  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is excellent. Customer service is lacking. Little parking for a well known place. Avocado margarita is awesome. Shrimp cocktail is delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] We ate dinner here last night. The hostess was great, the waiter not so much! He was very unprofessional, awkward, and slow to attend to us when it was not very busy at all. Luckily our food was pretty good so overall our experience was okay.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had brunch there. The steak and eggs was good, a little on the chewy side but the portion was a little small. We also got the chilaquiles, it was more like brisket with yuca chip nachos. Not exactly what I expected but the meat was cooked to perfection.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for little steamed buns. Result, stay with steamed buns only because other stuff like soups and tofu dishes are horrible. The owner is pretty grumpy too. But it is a normal thing in Vancouver area Chinese places.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had expected a wider range of sushi lunch options, so i was a little disappointed with the menu, but the bento I got was pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good pool and good food (since it came from the Sunset) in a neighbourhood filled with college types. I didn't find it too offensive or meat-market-ish despite some of the other places in the square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Happy hour specials were great and give you an opportunity to try a lot. Great options for someone who is a vegan or vegetarian.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was a good hangout in downtown Richmond for Greek food. Now they are closing their doors forever as the owner is retiring. Last day open is June 11, 2016  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing spectacular for the high costs. Drinks were okay. Clam chowder soup was disgustingly cold with weird chunks of meats. Crab cakes were very good. For the overall high price, steer clear of this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] The atmosphere is great for drinks but I'd say its a little overpriced for what it is. The poutine is good and worth it. I got the rabbit tacos and the rabbit was a little grainy and the tacos were basic. I think they could have been better.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think they can do a lot better. The laffas are served cold which was disappointing. I will stick with the bowl next time which looks easier to eat and healthier.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was good but over priced in every respect. Why do we we support snobbery. I would go to No No's Italian over this ... sans for Beautiful Katy in the Grill. Gorgeous and sweet lady from Amarillo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everyone tells me this the best pizza, but I am just not convinced. Sure, its cheap. For $2, you get a big slice. Its open really late too. But the best is really stretching it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tired and didn't feel like walking too far from our hotel. Stopped for dinner and we are not big on Franchise restaurants. Soup and salad with salmon. Soup was very good and salad was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool bar, great atmosphere... liked the multiple rooms with the old paint peeling off the wall and the aging mantle. No beer on tap here, only bottles. Otherwise a laid back place with cool bands.  [END]
[BEGIN] Average ramen noodle place. The spicy soup is not authentic; just a blob of paste in the center of dish.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was good quality and cheap prices- plus they deliver! We got the lamb vindaloo and it was tender and delicious...The service was excellent too.I'll def go again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Burger is decent, location is good and drinks are fine. Would get more stars is they had a more knowledgeable bar staff who were able to make drinks not featured on the set menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good property with a freidnly staff and large, clean rooms. Not really close to any great dining options and the ones on the property are mediocare at best. Fitness center was large, clean and well appointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great staff and location...food was just ok. Highlight was the steamers, large & fresh! Naked lobster roll disappointed as the meat was very shredded, no chunks..kind of dry.  [END]
[BEGIN] We saw a good amount of Portland, and the Segway ride was fun. But the guide gave almost no information on the city, and we just got a lot of info on segways. Book with another company.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely setting - the fruits de mar was outstanding the rest was ok but not spectacular. The presentation was impeccable but for the $ I would rather have spent it on something else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service wasn't the best, but the food was good. The fried shrimp was great and the coleslaw was an unexpected surprise.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had dinner here tonight. Food is pretty good. The space is big and open. Good for a quick bite to eat, but not really my scene for drinking. Maybe I am not a thinking woman.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is okay and I never seem to get good service here. Most of the time our server forgets we exist-- even if there's only five tables with people.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small Thai restaurant more suited for some good take-out in the Quincy area. Great service with really friendly people. Great Pad Thai.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's ok. Pretty good flavors but they can't decideto be Thai or Vietnamese. Fusion equals we don't do any one style wrll  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place! Only 3 stars because it is very casual (which was just what I was looking for). Cranking music, outside tented with picnic tables. Great food, atmosphere, and local beer. So much vacation fun!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pro tip: A great place to pick up unique sale items. When items are on sale here, they're really inexpensive. Also go late at night before they close and you'll avoid the pitfall of a small store packed with other customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Frustrated this time.. they were out of everything. Made a special trip and ended up being a waste of time  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this place, I do. But would come more often if: - Lighting was better (after the sun sets, plenty of natural sunshine otherwise) - Music didn't include advertisements - The iced green/black tea was made with less hot water, so that the green tea didn't get so bitter.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oh, the Atomic Cafe. Home to funky art students, cute boys with glasses, french sodas, memories of acoustic folk/rock/funk shows and fine retro decor. It's a fun place to stop by if you're in Bev'ly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Standard Golden Corral fare. It's a clean, very busy place to eat and the servers are good.  [END]
[BEGIN] My friend had a birthday party here Saturday night and it had a great crowd. They have two levels and it's a standard pub with several full bars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent convention center. Staff was helpful, building was clean and well lit and the center itself is conveinetly located.  [END]
[BEGIN] Portions are getting smaller and prices are higher. Not worth going all the way there if you live far away.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is ok. Good customer service. Great lemon chicken. Salad roll was average and peanut sauce needs to be improved....beef noodle soup was decent. Kids enjoyed their strawberry smoothie tho.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm not impressed at all. Home slice has bigger and better slices. The space is small but really small. The price is ok. This is a good l I've been drinking and nothing is open - food." The host was nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Jacks has some of the best pizza in town. We recently walked out after standing around ignored by the careless staff. Choose takeout.  [END]
[BEGIN] We've heard good things about H&F so my hubby and I were really looking forward to a good burger. Sadly, the burgers we got were dry. We like our burgers juicy, so we were disappointed. They were well-seasoned, though. Fries were delicious, well-seasoned and "meaty."  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is great but the servers are always so rude, please hire a manager to keep your service in standard.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hard to communicate with the staff here (language barrier). The pedicure treatment was nice but wish my server would have messaged a bit deeper in the feet and calves. No complementary wine?? Is it just because i'm from Texas?  [END]
[BEGIN] Good muffins and wide selection of pastry options make this my usual stop on a weekend morning. Lots of seating inside and outside (on a nice day), and you can spend hours there. However, my roommates were more impressed with the place when it was Carberrys.  [END]
[BEGIN] not bad for a deal and if you don't mind looking like every other asshole on the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cute store with a outstanding mix of hipster friendly items! The store is tiny. The staff not friendly at all. Not a hello, not a welcome or a thanks for coming. Strange.  [END]
[BEGIN] I found my new sns spot I love holly she take car of you. Usual nail spot though. Nothing to spectacular and they slick rude and talk that ish  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved Gigi's the first and second visit. We had the Kookarella. The last time we picked up Kookarella and they changed the bread. Instead of crusty French bread, they used very soft ciabatta bread which had way less body, and it really spoiled the sandwich. It was very disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] The dishes are not quite worth them due to the price and quality especially the pork woodong.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the garlic bread but I'm very particular with my pasta , I had the tortellini alfredo it was very soupy not delicious at all didn't look like the chef took his time on it Hopefully another time is the charm  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the hotel. Breakfast was good the first day. After that and other meals left quite a bit to be desired. We would come back to the hotel, but not the "restaurant".  [END]
[BEGIN] 3.5 stars! I got the avocado margarita and it was delicious! Customer service was OK, but they were busy. The food was better than expected and the meat wasn't overly salty. I will definitely return!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I went to Alameda Cafe with a couple friends for lunch. While the food was fine, none of us were extremely wowed by the salads or sandwiches. It would be a fine place if I lived in the neighborhood, but not a place to go for anything super tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] The waffles are pretty small. The sauces are good. The fries are rather slimy. The side salad was surprisingly good!  [END]
[BEGIN] i work in the area and frequent this place pretty often for the chicken noodle soup. it's generally good (not too much mystery meat) but there is an off time every once in a while. portion is huge for the price and service is pretty quick.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice selection of plants but FYI, fertilizer is cheaper at Breed & Co. Also, I found it difficult to get assistance from their staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service is hit or miss. The food is good and the portions are generous. The tacos are big!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was delicious but portions were way way too small. So ultimately a bitter sweet dinner because the food being good makes you want more of it! Seriously wouldn't go again because we left very hungry after spending $50 a person.  [END]
[BEGIN] food was good we sat at the bar I recommend sitting elsewhere if you are not a regular the bartenders ignore you. good luck getting served  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the best pizza, it fell apart when i tried to pick it up. I did like the breadsticks but yeah portland has better pizza places, check them out. Staff is very nice though.  [END]
[BEGIN] waited in line for an hr outside and another 30 mn inside nice burger but not worth 1:30 wait  [END]
[BEGIN] It is just a standard hk style restaurant. However it is the best one in town compare to the others. Only thing I don't like is they charge u $0.50 for each take out box. Bring your containers for the left over next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the Hakata Ramen at lunchtime and found the broth to be tasty and noodles very disappointing. I expect to eat homemade noodles at an "authentic Japanese" place and these were decidedly not. I'm definitely not going to make the trek from Portland to this sub-par establishment again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kudos on being one of the few places opening in the late evening to grab (limited selction of) bagels! You'll find its a bit slow, but at the end of the wait, you'll get your standard Panera Fare. Also, fresh bread is cheaper here than next door at Shaws.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tin Shed is pretty delicious. The prices are way out of my budget, so I don't eat there often. I don't really feel like I get my money's worth most of the time. For example..$4 for a side of bacon. 2 pieces of bacon.  [END]
[BEGIN] The burgers are ok, not great. The place itself is pretty dirty so I would not advice eating there, but take out would be ok. The only reason I went there is because I had a groupon for it; I would not go out of my way for it again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the location- dont love the bathroom situation- have to use the lake eola public restrooms which are not usually clean at all. Food is just ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this store and everything they offer but hardly buy anything due to the extremely high prices. For the quality of the items the price does not match. The whole house would be bought here if their prices were lower.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute bar with nice outdoor area. Huge beer and cocktail selection. Reasonable prices. Minus points for dirty ladies room- very icky.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tacos a la carte were excellent!! But service was not very friendly, I am not Mexican so I asked questions, my waiter was bothered about it! (rude). For that reason I wouldn't go back!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The corned beef was ok. I should have gotten the german pancakes. Those looked delicious.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered take-out from Little duck. I had the pad tai and spring rolls. I thought that both things were just okay. Nothing that I would rush back to have. My food was ready when they said it would be, the staff was friendly, and the portions large.  [END]
[BEGIN] All I can say is the guy at the counter and making food needs a serious attitude adjustment, The food is great and predictable. That being said, you would think customer service would be a best foot forward scenario.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a really pretty place, thier sushi is ok, the sea-weed was a bit tough. I found that odd while eating. I did the brothy noodel dish that you cook at the table.. It was ok, not enough noodels, loads of veggies.. So all in all not that memorable.  [END]
[BEGIN] AMAZING food and drinks.... waiter personalities kind of dry and ambiance could be more inviting. Service INCREDIBLY SLOW. Might come back but wouldn't bring friends again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Called at 7am and was able to get an 8am appointment on July 4th! I have extensions so they charged a little extra. Would have been great to have a sit under dryer for 20 min or so. Overall great experience. Would go back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] We live to EAT here but not necessarily like to be served here. Service has been so bad the last three times! We have continued to come back for the food but after tonite, will likely not. Spent 165 and would. Have had better service at Panera  [END]
[BEGIN] A little on the pricey side, but the pizza is really good. Nice, thin crust and quality ingredients... no big greased mess here. We had delivery, so I have no idea what dine in is like. We liked it and will eat pizza from Rebellious Tomato again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here for my friend's birthday dinner. The customer service was ON POINT, and the waiter even got someone to sing happy birthday to my friend! 5 star for customer service and ambience, but 2 stars for the food, as it wasn't great, but just okay. So, averagely, 3 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fairly par for indian buffet. If pressed I'd say a bit below average. 2 1/2 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Every time I come into this place...I'm overwhelmed with the smell of cleaner. The cheesecake is very overrated. Very basic cheesecake you can find in any restaurant etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service. Ok food. I have eaten a lot of german food and i wanted it to be more flavorful. Worth a stop for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Over $30 for 2 burgers, 2 drinks, fries. I know it is a trendy hipster spot. The burgers are good, and I like their eco-conscious business model. However we had a less than attentive server, and just were not wowed with the overall experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was extremely clean!! I didn't like the hidden resort fee of $17. If I know that was added on I would have found another place  [END]
[BEGIN] I like how this frozen self serve yogurt has many different flavors to chose from as well as toppings. Took my family here & they have yummy smoothies as well. The actual frozen yogurts with toppings you create go sell by however many pounds it weighs which is pretty cool...  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a decent place for delivery but the actual location is really small. The staff is always nice and the food is mostly okay. The Indonesian fried rice is good but I'm not a fan of their Thai iced tea.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pad thai pretty good. Once was a little salty. Tried sweet sour pork too. Was ok. Not best or worst I've had. Crab puffs good. It's decent food. Cooked fast for delivery and pick up.  [END]
[BEGIN] My favorite slices here are the Tomato Basil. But they run out quick, so be sure to ask!  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was very good along with the service. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the food and Turkish traditional food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the best place to have breakfast but the food is ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] The check-in attendant had the wrong date for our return, so they failed to wash the car as we requested, but they made it somewhat right. I just prefer the other option, Airport Fast Park.  [END]
[BEGIN] We came by at midnight because their hours are supposed to be until 2am, and go figure... they are closed! What the heck! I need my pearls and what now ??? Lol  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped in for a quick stout while out perusing the neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] The coconut cream bao is a nice alternative for those who want a warm not-too-sweet dessert  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm feeling sad. I just got two ricotta cannoli, and neither of them were filled in the middle. It's not like it used to be. The Modern was my go-to for many, many years, but I'm not sure what I'll do now.  [END]
[BEGIN] Place is small, and always need to wait a line. A good place to have lunch nearby, but it doesn't worth coming all the way. Better than the one in hmart  [END]
[BEGIN] It was okay... I had asked for pineapple on my pizza and was given a delivery time of 6:30. 7:30: pizza shows up. No pineapple. No notice pizza will take over an extra hour. I will give it another try, however I will go and order there!  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is not good, waiters come slowly and food comes slowly too. It's awful for hungry people to wait that long and it's not a very good experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] The frozen yogurt and smoothies are really good. I like the ambiance and the decor of the place is pretty unique. However the service was not the best... not very friendly, that's why I'm giving it only 3 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] this place is awesome. if you know the deal, you'll bypass the stuff on the shelves and go to the back of the store where they have the home-cooked sweets and food. go for those. p.s. park in stop and shop parking lot for free and walk down tremont  [END]
[BEGIN] I wanted this to be better. I love wursts and I love Texas. Just didn't work out. Wursts were pretty good, not great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been going to Le's (formerly Pho Pasteur) for a few years now, and I've only ordered one dish: Chicken Bun. It's delicious, inexpensive, and I can get 2 meals out of it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food and drinks were really yummy. Came in for happy hour and enjoyed the bites. It was hot outside (90+ degrees) and felt about 90 degrees inside as well. Hope they fix the AC so we can go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Close at 6pm during summer time and cash only you kidding right? But there drink is not bad I will recommend my friends to hang out there but please exert your business hours.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is always a decent spot for casual dining. Decent prices, service, and sushi. Nothing exceptional about this place but it'll do.  [END]
[BEGIN] wayyyy too sweet. The plain old fashioned one is heaven. the rest arent worth the trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rode one of the newer planes back to Bmore that was equipped with wi-fi But did they have to make the seats smaller to do so. Not the most pleasant ride I have had on southwest. The flight attendants were pleasant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good empanadas. That's all I had. They have a Spaniard (Spain) taste. So if you are not Hispanic you may not be used to the flavor.  [END]
[BEGIN] 20% restaurant added gratuity plus an "additional tip" line, which I find presumptuous and insulting. Lightweight cocktails, and no dessert or coffee. One knockout main (Arctic char), one uninspired (halibut).  [END]
[BEGIN] The food and service was decent. We had to wait a bit longer than necessary (about 1.5 hours) to get a table. I'd go back, but be sure it was a less busy time  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizza: ok for Boston area. Go to Julianna's in Brooklyn NY, and then compare. Pro's: crust is decent (sometimes they overcook it). Parking across the street. Cons: Tired wait staff who where shorts and think it is cool to be grumpy. Dirty floors. Time to change it up.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great shoes. Great prices on shoes. Lots of colors and styles. Not top line quality but the price is right. A step up from payless, but not quite DSW, but again, they have tons of shoes for $7, $9 and $14. Located right near Macys and Filenes in downtown crossing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not much on ambiance but a perfect little neighborhood spot to grab a bite even if you are in your sweaty workout clothes! Margarita pizza is small & good! Tricolor Insulate is yummy too! That's all I ever get. Bad wine selection, good iced tea! I like it here!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good appetizer / wedge salad. The halibut is decent. Great service and friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good "hero's", yup still call them that. Freshly sliced meat and cheese, but i still prefer Boars Head brand deli meats,a Long Island thing i guess, which i can get at Publix. If your in a hurry for a quick sandwhich i would stop by.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gotta agree with Katie G. - I go because it's near home and has decent parking options. My biggest complaint is that their chicken tends to be really dry. Otherwise, the food is filling and you get a decent value for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food and drinks were fine, this place is loud but I think that's their thing. The only thing that I really was t into was the fact that their popcorn shrimp was probably about 5 pieces of shrimp and seasoned popcorn... Very misleading.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stop at this location on the daily. I order the same thing. And everyday, something is wrong. This is the only chickfila location where they don't go above and beyond. Pity  [END]
[BEGIN] Location: parked in publix lot. In viet town. Easy to get to 5/5 Atmosphere: loud and chaotic 3/5 Service: went on the server reccomendation. Pretty good 4/5 Food: slimy tofu. Needed to use firm tofu 2\5 Value: inexpensive and huge portions 5/5 Return: yes  [END]
[BEGIN] Super super super busy. Real busy grocery section and almost need a traffic cop for the shopping carts. Cash register was quick though and packed my eggs nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] The server was friendly but it took forever for the food to show up, and when it did, it seemed to be cool the fries were cold.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a bad bar. Stopped in for a bit just before a Janes Addition concert and had some good beer and very decent bar food. The only down side? The bathroom situation was a bit of a disaster. Long wait for everyone, not a big fan of that.  [END]
[BEGIN] You can't go wrong with a Papa Murphy's pizza when you want a pizza, but don't have time to wait 30-45 minutes for delivery or carry out. I've been a fan since they were Papa Aldo's!  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately, nothing to write home about. The food was fine, but nothing stood out, and it wasn't worth the price. To boot the waitress was rude, which doesn't help the experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good but not great this time. Usually we are extremely happy. This time it lacked a litttle in service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went on a first date here,made reservations. The hostess blonde female, was very rude. Our server was better though,great food.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great breakfast spot on Hawthorne. Caryn and I were craving waffles this morning. Something we don't crave often. So, we decided to go here because we heard they have great waffles. We heard correctly. It was good stuff. The waffles were pretty awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Reasonable happy hour prices for a spendy place! I was pleasantly surprised with my sweet potato fries and frosty beer. However, you won't catch me dead in this place after happy hour, I think at that point it's full of people with jobs!  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent cheap beer, mediocre bbq. I wasn't a huge fan of the place. It's also very hard to find coming east on Ponce. A tree blocks the sign.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap, Friendly. foods are ok. Be aware you need to bring cash because they don't take credit cards.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautfiul grounds. Can view all of Portland down below (this part is free). Didn't go inside. Limited time, and long line.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not that many options for gluten free vegetarians. Great cocktails. Nice ambience. I bring my little dog and we sit outside. Staff is happy to tell you all about their very special menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good work thank you Boston audio design very satisfied here.....  [END]
[BEGIN] Chicken Kabob platter was great, but the hummus and pita bread were gross. Way too much tahini on the hummus and the pita was as hard as a rock.  [END]
[BEGIN] I didn't like this place at all but my friends did. I found the food to be very heavy. There was only one healthy veggie option. All the others were fired. I did not like the atmosphere at all. But my fiance said she really liked the stir fried noodles.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beer is really good. Food, not so much. Burnside, this is not NY! No need to charge top dollar for mediocre food. Fries are terrible, portions are small, taste is bland... Step it up!  [END]
[BEGIN] What happened to your mozzarella sticks? I don't like the new ones. Too much like Same Old Place. Please get the old ones back...please?  [END]
[BEGIN] Cocktails are somewhat overpriced at this Back Bay / Hynes establishment but otherwise a fine place to meet for a drink.  [END]
[BEGIN] The upside: You will NEVER leave hungry after a visit to Maggiano's, and it's definitely a destination spot if you have a large party. The downside: Food is ok, but not anything special that will leave you craving it on a Saturday evening.  [END]
[BEGIN] What expected of the chain. Bartender was nice and friendly - they offer a 2 for 1 drink special that everyone in the bar seemed to take advantage of - it's also offered all day.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would eat there every week if they'd fix that fucking screechy pizza oven door. Great food. Unique attitude and set up.  [END]
[BEGIN] The choices, environment, and quality is all fine. They are bit pricy compared the the neighboring bars and the service really isn't good, they impatient and rude, often.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good breakfasts, but always a line which takes this down one star for me. If you're walking by and theirs no lineup, I would definitely jump in for brunch. It is quite good, but not good enough for a 20 min wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good seafood but never been blown away.  [END]
[BEGIN] The climbing is good here - but I would say that Boston Rock Gym has a better selection of climbs. The two main advantages of Metro Rock is that it is T accesible and they will pick you up from the T and that it's slightly cheaper than BRG.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dine out menu is a ripoff for $40. A signle lamb lollipop for a main entree was not enough to enjoy. That being said food quality is above average. Would definitely order off the regular menu. The lack of respect for customers was very disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] We visited on a Thursday evening. Portion was good and the food was typical. My experience wasn't bad but nothing out of this world. I would try it again with a different meal because I believe in second chances.  [END]
[BEGIN] Atendimento ruim. Serviram um café gelado e o atendente não se mostrou interessado em ajudar  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, ordered London Broil which is 8oz steak overcook outside but raw inside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Large, store with plenty of parking, seems to always be busy. Clean, organized, but not a lot of staff around. This store has the usual Target stuff...electronics, clothing, home, children's...and it also has food & pharmacy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not sure why Tex mex is so hard to pull off? My enchiladas were exceptional, the rest of the table was mixed reviews, the margaritas were terribly uninspiring & I tried 3...their "top shelf", a "scratch", and the tamarindo which only smelled tasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'll say it: it's not what it used to be. New menus, new prices,... less exceptional food?  [END]
[BEGIN] I've never ate the food here, mostly due to price and people telling me it is not worth the cost for what you get, but I can tell you there is the best bartender in town there! Delicious drinks, somewhat reasonably priced, and good conversation!  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was excellent. Spinach dip was dry and served with kettle chips (not a good pairing). The wine was excellent. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Haven't been there..but wanted to go...went to their home page and that has to be the dumbest home page I have ever seen. No idea what the place has except for you guys and your reviews...so thanks!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I was excited to eat here, and the food was tasty, but there was only one tiny sliver of tofu in the vegetarian noodle bowl. The red noodle bowl was quite tasty, too. Also, we'd have preferred more veggies in our selections. Good selection of tap beers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Holy S*%@! They have a statue commemorating the Confederacy!!! AAAAAK!!!! THAT IS NOT NORMAL!!!! Texas is considered a weird state by any self-respecting Northerner and my visit to the Capitol Building confirmed this suspicion.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this place a lot but the last time I went had a bad service and the fries weren't that good like they usually are. Every time I come to this place I have the feeling that they want me out as soon I sit down to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Holiday weekend. Crowded. Noisy. Not a bad atmosphere. I was a little surprised at the price of a lobster roll. Shame on me for not fully realizing the market price. Good service for a busy day.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is ok, but the service is horrible. Waited forever to get drinks and then twice as long to get the check.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time visiting here, my date and I had the salmon, it was a tad tough though. Not the best but then again this is a tex-mex maybe not the brightest idea to go with the salmon. I shall try something else next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] It looks spectacular but you have to be affiliated with the school in order to use it. What a shame.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've tried leaving this place because they're not so clean, but I always end up coming back. Why? I don't know, all I know is that they're the ONLY ones that never mistreat me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does satisfy your Pho craving, and it was quick. Service was good, and the price was reasonable.  [END]
[BEGIN] One amazing thing is that they have duck tongues here and that dish is delicious. In addition, the dumplings and buns are just fair. They open to 3:00am which satisfies my late night appetite. The food is not fantastic, but is still acceptable.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stopped here for a quick bite in Ponce Street Market. My companion had a burger and I had pie. They have both a take out area and counter service. We were there right at lunchtime and the service could have been a bit better but it wasn't awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Basic Irish pub bar food. I ordered a Reubin sammy & it was super dry. I think the bar would be fun with a group, but I was here for lunch, so no drinks!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great burgers, but wayyy to high on prices i spent 15 on a burger and shake! I will go back if someone else pays lol  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad, a decent little Italian restaurant on the ground floor of the Park Plaza Hotel. Generous portion sizes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Normal coffee prices. Parking lot. Easy in. Easy out. Ample seating if you want to hang around. Staff aren't the best conversationalists, but in the morning all I really want is coffee anyways.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food here is good, and in small portion. I love the poori here, it is fried perfectly. I went there on Friday night around 6pm and we were the first customer, so no need to wait, which is very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sandwiches are pretty good, but I think the prices are a little high for what they are selling. Definitely go to try some frozen yogurt!  [END]
[BEGIN] The atmosphere was awesome as well as the service we got. The chicken fingers were a little dry but the sides were really good. Loved the baked beans and Mac & cheese  [END]
[BEGIN] We found this place rather boring. Uninteresting sushi and the noodle dish was bland.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, could be a little bigger portions for the price. The chicken and waffle were served hot, the chicken crispy! Eggs, bacon, andoullie sausage and grits were wonderful, plus the bacon jam n biscuit! Clean and organized, convenient parking in the back off the street. I would come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried two Arepas and they both disappointed. The meat, sauce, and fillings were all good but the Arepa was too thick and wasn't crisp  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is nice and all but not my type. It is a fancy place, great for going out when you wanna dress up and look posh. Pros: Good food, Cons: Can be pricey,  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is pretty good. Service isn't bad. Can be really busy so plan ahead when you go. I would rather eat here than Denny's or Ihop. you can leave those places hungry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for a quick lunch! Usually get 4, they are not overly filling so expect to be hungry in a few hours. I would come here if I had a taco craving for sure or if I was walking way. Basically the same consistency at both locations.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is ok, however I rarely visit venues at night due to crowds as to wait times for drinks, food, or bowling. Nice place to go but again be aware of the time you go which will dictate your service.  [END]
[BEGIN] The usual chipotle. This one seems a little busier than some. Perhaps a little dirtier... The lines are long but it goes by pretty fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was slow. Asked for our steak "rare" and all 3 of us had well done steak. The kids meal was good. The maki roll was good. Just disappointed the steak was over-cooked.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good draft selection and service was solid. We just wanted a little snack and beer before dinner tonight. Cheese fries use liquid cheese on bottom layers and was not that pleasant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ive eaten here a few times and it's pretty consistent. The sauce on the pizza is great! Toppings are less than desirable. Sausage tastes funny and forget putting garlic on anything because you will get huge chunks of it. I wish they had apps...  [END]
[BEGIN] Small portions but damn their pad Thai is the best in town. Food is delicious here but prices are ridiculous for what you get. Unfortunately had to take two stars off for poor value.?  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place for drinks with colleagues or friends Food is ok nothing to brag about Good for large groups  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast food place, all vegetarian, always seats available, pretty cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Expensive, but it is in Newton, so what do you expect. Very narrow course, not ideal for beginners, must call ahead for tee times. Very convenient to Boston. Staff was nice enough. Fast greens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Aweful food here, no idea what the previous reviewr is thinking but its pub grub at its worst. After trying Devlin's I was really disappointed in the quality. Lots of BC kids during the school year and the crowd could be much better than a typical meat market.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice pub with decent beer selection and pretty good food. I had the pancakes and my wife had the burger. Not bad. Would go back as a hang out spot more than for the food. Read the wings were good so maybe we'll try next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Edit. Went here again and it was much better Terrible, slow service. Subpar food. Fake atmosphere. I love mellow mushrooms but this location is awful. If you're planning on going here skip it and go to the Brookhaven location 10 min up the road.  [END]
[BEGIN] Underwhelmed and feeling unlucky after reading the great reviews. Everything was just OK. The service the clenlinece the music the ambiance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Eye mart has the best prices Walked in got help, didn't wait. Got my glasses 2 pair of 3 line progressive lens $200.00. People if the frames or lens are to expensive just go to the dollar buy 5 pairs and you will be fine  [END]
[BEGIN] 6March16 @ Noon quick friendly service. not busy. Music could be turned down a bit. Big mama enchilada and bowl of Pozole Rojo de Puerto. Pozole was bland. Big mama enchilada was large and tasty with a nice sauce. prices are a bit high and we will probably not return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was okay, but not great. Everything is very a la carte, and the service was subpar. Food was okay, but weird interpretation of "BBQ." Very small with not a lot is seating.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lunch buffet is the best part. Decent food for a good price and a friendly wait staff. The dining room doesn't have the highest capacity though.  [END]
[BEGIN] When shopping at Fubon it's a nice stop in here to get a hot pot of food. The bibimbap is okay. I don't think the food here is very memorable but it isn't terrible either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service can be slow since this place is so big. The food is not the greatest (is any on international drive?) but its not bad; our items were fine. Prices are affordable.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a good Mexican place. It is huge so there we never wait long for a table. The food is pretty good! Some of the best Mexican in the city and the prices aren't bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast but definitely not worth it for small jobs. It cost me $7 to scan 5 pages to USB...  [END]
[BEGIN] The space is setup awkward which makes the whole flow strange and cumbersome the food is so so.  [END]
[BEGIN] The movie theater staff was super nice and helpful with the menu. Plus the seats were comfortable and the sound in the theater was very excellent!  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to love this place (2003-2015?) until they changed owners/cooks. It's just not the same anymore but I heard they just opened up a new place near by.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would call this papi's Puerto Rican rather than Cuban. bland, blah, nothing special, I won't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Confusing to find right building and specialist and they are always running late. Arrive early so that you can find a free parking spot around the hospital perimeter. Construction makes things even worse  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is good. I don't think my stomach agrees. I had the pokè bowl. The fish may not be as fresh as it could be. I've eaten here twice with the same result. I want to rate it higher because it does actually taste good. But...  [END]
[BEGIN] It was good but not great. My egg dish was too salty for my tastes and came out lukewarm. The waffle was not fresh either. I don't get the hype. I would not wait outside in a lineup to eat here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to get some quick Asian cuisine. Whether you are sitting in or taking out, you will not be disappointed. The prices are great and the customer service is good as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its a "meh" Irish pub thing with mediocre food and a weak beer menu. We were just there for the band.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's ok. The owner is super nice, but the food is nothing special. It's good for an "I don't want to cook the family dinner" take away. I probably wouldn't eat here if it wasn't so close to my house.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great comfort food, Decent beer list. Always REALLY smokey. You don't have to ban smoking, but how about an exhaust fan or something?  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was good the food is ok but the place is dirty could somebody please vacuum the carpet.  [END]
[BEGIN] The ceviche was really, really good - but I wasn't 'wowed' by the other dishes, so if you're coming just for the a light snack that's fine, but otherwise I would head to Mochikas for my Peruvian cravings.  [END]
[BEGIN] This location is not that big in space, however, I came here to have some tea and to do some homework as I needed a sense of different scenery around me. I had a tea with hot water, hard to mess up. Very good customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a good time. The crowd was vibing and had a good flow of drunks. The shots and adult capri suns were good. Bathrooms could be kept better.  [END]
[BEGIN] We sat at the bar for dinner and drinks. An impressive beer menu and very nice bartenders. The food was pretty generic, so I will not be returning for that. Even the waitstaff was eating pizza from All-star pizza bar next door.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food good. Didn't really care for the menu or the self service beverage situation. Waitress was super friendly though. Probably wouldn't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The place is nice, people are friendly and the drinks are good. But whatever that annoying, super loud beeping noise is completely ruins the ambience and ability to concentrate on whatever you are doing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Standard neighboorhood pizza delivery. Much better in Portland available - but in a pinch this will do.  [END]
[BEGIN] Average experience. Kinda small inside but nice and bright. This place Can get crowded and there isn't much xtra room once that happens. Service was cool. Really wanted this place. Been years...  [END]
[BEGIN] I"ve been here twice and both times were for a small party bash. I have nothing but nice thing to say, but not enough data to write about. Good drinks, good appetizers, and good services.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really wanted to like this place b/c it's cheap, but the Singapore noodles I got were only so-so--greasy and not half as flavorful as at Tamarind House. Good-sized portion, but still a portion of meh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good tuna salad sandwich but the sandwich maker doesn't wear gloves when prepping food. Places needs a good cleaning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took my son here while on vacation at Disney for a sinus infection. Waited 2 hours and he fell asleep in the waiting room. They do have an attached pharmacy but for me the wait was too long Doctor seemed very competitent and caring.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is BRAZILIAN!!! Like some people mentioned it looks like a high school cafeteria, LOL. If you want to eat healthy, and cheap food, you should go there, the food is decent, but is not a place to take a date...  [END]
[BEGIN] Decided to get takeout after a long day and found this place great because it delivers Indian food. Ordered chicken tikka masala and butter chicken. Both were excellent but the portions are very small. The dishes were mainly sauce.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love love love that dark meat. But most sides are hella salty. Good place when you're desperate for decent food  [END]
[BEGIN] Food pretty good but service is slow. Even when you order and pickup. Don't say 10 mins when it's not ready after 20 mins Cheese dip good and tacos  [END]
[BEGIN] It's trying to be a chick-fil-a you don't feel bad eating at. Everything is fine but not as good. I've eaten here twice and will eat here again if I'm in the area. It's good but for the prices/idea you would think they could beat the veggie tales crew.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here twice for dinner with Groupon, once with some friends, once with my mom. The food here is okay, a bit on the salty and greasy side. The service is slow and the servers are not particularly polite nor attentive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here on a Friday evening with my fam. The place is lovely inside. Always heard of the restaurant but never been. Good food a little pricy I really love the lamb and plantains.  [END]
[BEGIN] for a chain restaurant this place is decent value, atmosphere and service....if you like chains.  [END]
[BEGIN] Atmosphere is good for meeting up with some friends, but the food was not the best compared to its price point. Would go again just to hang out but not necessarily for the food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location to spend drinking and mingling with friends. I ordered a burger , medium well to be specific, got a well done. Manager replaced it , no questions asked. He was polite enough and kept saying sorry. Would come back for drinks, not for food def.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm always waiting even though I make appointments. My second time I had to wait 30mins. Robyn the tech is really nice and does a great job, but I'm hesitant to return due to the long wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Free WiFi ... a great place to read, surf and catch up on correspondence while having a cup of coffee. Lots of old school house seating out in the front and in the back room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad tacos but the only thing going on for this place is that they have a liquor license. You can watch the Canuck games, drink and eat $3 tacos.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty decent restaurant for large groups. They turn the tables fairly quickly and have a full bar. Food quality is fairly average but better than some of the other high volume breakfast spots in town. Nice kids play area outside which is a bonus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is friendly here but the food is over-priced for what you get. They don't even give you chips and salsa when you sit down. I believe there are many Mexican restaurant alternatives nearby that I rather try.  [END]
[BEGIN] Steak Tips are good Pizza is good chicken cutlet is good Scicilian pizza is awesome. Deliveries are speedy employees are courteous it's your average sub shop. Decently priced, good food.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was staying at the Lowes so I popped down to the bar for a quick meal. I got the flat bread and calamari. Both were good but neither were stand outs. Service was great, and the bar had a classy low key vibe.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is WAY overpriced for the quality of the food. Pretty bad actually and lacking fresh flavor. The margaritas on the other hand are ON POINT. I got some spicy One and it was incredible. Vegetarian warning: I was told that the tomatillo salsa has chicken stock in it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is delicious but the service is piss poor and the building is filthy. It's like walking in wet tar when you step into the restaurant. Enjoy the ham, hopefully the lack of cleanliness doesn't kill you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Go for the Roasted Chicken Breast, great meal. Avoid the beef, not worth the cost. Overall good place if your at Wilderness Lodge  [END]
[BEGIN] It looks cooler driving by than it actually is when you stop in. My advice, stop once to satisfy your curiosity and at least buy an orange to support this Mom-and-Pop shop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow, 20+ years since I'd last been and it's exactly the same. I guess that's good? Had a business meeting with an Alston Bird lawyer and the ambiance was actually more suited to meeting that my Houston's meeting! Kick ass peach cobbler!  [END]
[BEGIN] Highly priced and not that great...just a donut, I've had better at mom and pop places. Not knocking the attempt, but for as much effort they put in, it seems you have to apply the same to eat one...if it's not sold out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good!!!! Waiters are very very friendly and attentive! Their soda fountain is bom!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute place, and adequate Gelatto. But certainly not the best in terms of flavor or quality in town.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was okey for the price. But seems the chief was so amateur. Big pieces of herbs and peppers. No balance in spices. And no nuts in biryani or kheer. Worth to try it only once!  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was good, but the service was not so good. We always come here and normally have had a good experiences. The server today appeared more into her conversation with the other staff then making sure the customers had what they needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Go for the after-work for the 3-for-3 appetizer specials. 3 tasty lamp chops, 3 nice-sized cocktail shrimp, 3 sliders... plus others, all for $3. But stick with those, they were the best ones. Not a fan of this place as a weekend/night-time spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great bagels and friendly staff. Would have given 4 stars, but it wad wsy too chilly inside so hsrd to enjoy food when you are cold.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good place for a quick in and out wax. Clean environment, nice ladies that work there and a great no tipping policy. You can book your services online and price depends varying on the level of experience. I've been happy with the outcome after each visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] I only ever get the slushees here WITHOUT boba - their tapioca balls taste very very meh. If you want chewier, tastier options, you might have to make the trek to Kung Fu Tea in Allston. Also this place is cash only.  [END]
[BEGIN] I want to like this place a little more but it can be damn uncomfortable sometimes.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is decent, I got delivery here a couple times, I have high standards for my pad see ew, and let me say that it's not one of the best I've had. Tried their appetizers but it wasn't anything memorable, but their delivery was real quick.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a hostel people, not a five star hotel. You get what you pay for, plus free complimentary breakfast(s). Who can say no to free breakfast?  [END]
[BEGIN] The happy hour here used to be amazing, but it has since changed. It's still good, but I'm no longer enthusiastic. While this used to be the first place I took people from out of town, now it doesn't even make the list.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sushi is OK. My wife's only sushi experience is the Bubba Roll and won't try other places, so we keep going there.  [END]
[BEGIN] The steak fajitas were awesome. Our server was nice and helpful also. The guacamole was fresh and tasty. The margarita wasn't the best in the world like the menu says but it was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was quite good as was the ambience. The service was very slow which was odd because it wasn't very busy. It was a little pricy but not to pricy for what you receive. Try the eggplant brownie it was the best part of the meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a terrible Hampton. Not the best though. - On the old side... hallways / elevator are dated - Bathrooms were tiny - Staff was not the best, rather slow for check in  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was fair. The service was fantastic.the price was fair. The atmosphere was excellent for a Thai restaurant  [END]
[BEGIN] Some days you feel like eating A LOT. Well, this is the place to go on one of those days. It is not really a sophisticated gourmet option, yet a reasonably good all-you-can-eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really liked the atmosphere, great place to stop at for a bit. A good variety of games and decent drinks. I'd give this place 4 stars, but several of the games were out of service or had broken/missing controls. I still recommend checking it out if you haven't been yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Alcohol, beer .BC Liquor Store is not a bad little bottle shop. I'd suggest with the addition of condiments for mixes (lime, lemon, olives etc) .. you could well be visiting a one stop shop when adding "nuts, chips" etc.. Cheers Big Ears  [END]
[BEGIN] The people are always nice. The pizzas were fresh. The brownie was stuck to the bottom of the pan but all in all it was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice presentation and service. The americano is nice but I prefer a stronger/ bolder taste.  [END]
[BEGIN] They forget to put milk cap on my honey green tea. However I have try the Kung Fu Milk tea and it really good. The service and and store decoration is pretty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meat-market galore...and no, it has nothing to do with the ribs and wings.  [END]
[BEGIN] I suppose most stores have downsized their inventory with the tanking economy, but this Best Buy is pathetic. I live really close, so I've been there more than once. I've never left with what I went in to buy because they don't ever have it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Have been there a few times. Food is good, service is attentive, but the noise level on a busy night is unbearable. Last time I went could not stay!  [END]
[BEGIN] I see all the Facebook post about flip burger and everyone saying they are good... Ngeeeeh it was alright...not that great...  [END]
[BEGIN] Good looking establishment sans quality. I did not like how red wine was refrigerated and served cold like beer. I could understand if it was super hot outside, but it wasn't.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's alright, nothing too special with the exception of the evening ride when fireworks are going from the theme parks. Worse Thing: THE FOOD COURT!! It's dirty and horrible up keeping. The food is worse than mall food courts. Don't waste you money in the food court. Trust!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good place to get tuna sandwich and a cup of soup I like their tomato soup. Their coffee is not great but they also serve cookies and some breakfast sandwiches.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good staff however the wait time is out of this world. We were here 2.5 hours today and spent only 20 min with staff. Last time I was here spent an hour here before even being called. A good Industrial Engineer can help.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is just ok. The BBQ will never compare to K-town in Los Angeles, but the rest of the dishes are ok. They weren't amazing but they weren't too bad. It's a convenient location if you grocery shopping at Fubonn.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not great :/ Cute atmosphere but food was just ok to me. Grits had no flavor and the muffin on my Benedicts were soggy. Also the potatoes tasted like they were cooked in a dirty pan. Not a fan. It looked good though...  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good burgers and fries. They are a bit stingy with the fries. I would expect a little more because they food is so over priced. I only gave them 3 stars because while the food is good, it is not worth the outrageous cost for burgers and fries.  [END]
[BEGIN] I find it a bit overpriced for the food, but overall, I do recommend it, especially for visitors who can afford to eat at the full buffet. A really good place for a casual date on a lazy Saturday or Sunday.  [END]
[BEGIN] 3.5 stars. Couture Ultra Lounge would have received four stars if their bottle service was more then just a bottle of champagne. Pros: Fairly crowded with good looking people, simple clean layout and good DJ. Cons: $250 gets only a bottle champagne?  [END]
[BEGIN] Was a cool spot, food was just "ok" for the price. The Pesto spaghetti was good and off-menu burger too. The Breakfast of Champions drink was good but is more of an after dinner drink!  [END]
[BEGIN] Have to look for this place as its off the beaten path. Kind of dark and dingy, but I usually order take-out. Food is good but not exemplary. Not too pricey, even at dinner. Good options if you have a vegetarian in your family.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the idea of this restaurant. I like that you can choose your sides, however, the sides don't always look appealing. Additionally, I've eaten the fried chicken multiple times and each time the seasoning is different.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's tiny and feels a bit crowded if you stay for a long time. Some items get strangely overpriced. The staff is really nice and my matcha chai latte was super good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the tropical waffle which was on their special. My husband didn't like the regular one thou. Their coffee was good too. However, it took almost an hour wait for our orders to arrive which we thought was a total time waster.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm the obviously pregnant, with the band, designated driver - and I was just charged for soda refill.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the concept more than the execution. As a huge fan of noodles, I had high expectations but found the noodles to be too thick, hard, and starchy. I'll be back again to try the lamb skewers!  [END]
[BEGIN] The guy at the register was friendly, but after a ten minute wait, they brought us the wrong sandwich, a shake instead of a smoothie, and tiny chicken strips. I'm used to better from one of my favorite restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a bowl with chicken rice beans cheese lettuce pico and guacamole sauce on side. Small portion that came with very little chicken(marinated thigh chopped) flavor was good(at best). Guacamole sauce seemed to be made without avocado. Different$9. Meh  [END]
[BEGIN] One of my favorite burgers in town when find myself with 30+ minutes to kill. Employees are apathetic, food times are sloooow! Good burgers tho.  [END]
[BEGIN] I checked this place out based on the reviews and the jerk chicken was decent wish it was more season/flavorable like the fact it wasn't served with white bread. I would check it out again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I heard great things about this place and perhaps, it that rose my expectations too high, but I didn't find the food to be as good as the reviews. The food was good, but not exceptional. Reasonably priced, which is always a plus. Overall a fair bet!  [END]
[BEGIN] I know that us big city folk are always disappointed by ethnic places in Boulder but... Just ask the owner about basmati, ghee, and chaywanprash, and you'll discover where the 3 stars came from!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an interesting place. I enjoy the big seats to sit and people watch. The most interesting people o watch are the baristas- they would be great characters on Portlandia.  [END]
[BEGIN] The cappuccino was good, the staff was friendly, the ambience was pleasant, but... there was just something missing. I can't put my finger on it, but it lacks something. Unfortunately, not at the top of my list as far as coffee destinations go.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was ok, but the service was excellent. I appreciate their offering bread, especially since we were unusually hungry. All three orders (different pastas) were slightly overcooked, but still chewy. I'd visit again only because it happens to be close to home.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered Pad Thai for delivery. Very disappointing, it had no sauce in it? No flavor, no spice, very bland. I was really looking forward to their food based on the great reviews. I'll have to give them another try next time I'm in town.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food, excellent service once seated! Fun atmosphere, great for a relaxing time out. Only downside, wait time was quite long and someone had to run around yelling your name to tell you your table was ready. Also bar service was slow.  [END]
[BEGIN] Liked the ambience. Can't complain about the regular day buffet. Customer service was good. There could have been more varieties of dishes, though the price was reasonable for number of items. Good place for lunch once in a month.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good sports place near back bay. I come here to watch games from out of town. The cocktails are pricey and food is ok but the service is good and they have plenty of TV's  [END]
[BEGIN] Pastries are excellent! If you prefer a chewy, dense macaron then this is your place. Don't come here for the coffee... it's not so good. I recommend tea instead.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent but there are better options in terms of service  [END]
[BEGIN] I haven't been here in a while, and I couldn't find it at Crystal mall last week. They've relocated to 4462 Beresford st and have not yet re-opened  [END]
[BEGIN] Enjoyed the ambiance but the sushi was just ok. I liked the coconut crunch roll the best but the other roll we ordered tasted fishy. I like oudom better but my husband disagrees. All depends on your taste for sushi!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered the fricassee on 2 separate times and both times were sodium overloaded. They need to go easy on the salt. $1 waffle topping is over priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] love your minimalistic clothes, but please, install mirrors in the change room! even thrift stores have mirrors in their change room so that should be a good indication that it is important to the shopping experience, right? also wish you have a return policy (store credits only).  [END]
[BEGIN] Lots of ice cream choices. They're all good. I just don't think the price to quality was worth it though. And the waffle cup my friends and I got was sort of a failure? It just wasn't as good as we thought it'd be.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a pretty cool show but very outdated. You can actually see the lines on the flying cow.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced, food was sub par, more of a joint to meet up and drink than eat a good meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Are here today. The food and presentation was good. However, we got our food 50 minutes after we sat down!? The excuse was that they were busy, and they didn't know my party was in a rush. On the flip side they did comp some items on the bill.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was probably expecting too much because of the hype. The food is decent, but not authentic. Lot of cilantro which is weird for sushi. I would eat here again but probably just for dessert.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Tom Yum soup here is amazing! I would go there again just for that! OK Thai food for a local joint. Great Thai food for delivery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fabulous chicken. It was definitely on point. The service was also great. However all the non fries goods were gross. No one at my table liked them. The mac n cheese tasted old and reheated. The coleslaw felt partially thawed and flavorless. The fried rice was oily.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty average place. I got the biscuits and gravy, it wasn't terrible, but it didn't seem like anything other than from a can. Everyone in our group had potatoes and none were impressed. Very friendly wait staff for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] I can't say I have ever found anything here that I wanted to buy. That doesn't stop me from going in every time I visit Newbury though!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an "ok" Kareoke bar... You can only really hear the person singing if you are in the bathroom because that's where the speakers for the microphone are loudest. Ok prices for beer/drinks.  [END]
