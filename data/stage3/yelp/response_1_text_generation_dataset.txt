[BEGIN] Average food and atmosphere. Good service. Basic Asian food. The ramen was nothing special although the noodles were good. Probably good if you live at Mueller but not worth a trip from further away. There are far better options in Austin these days, especially for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Having to walk down an alley to what felt like a basement was very odd. The food is ok, but their prices are too high. My margarita was tiny and they wanted $5 (or maybe it was $8) for a refill of chips?!  [END]
[BEGIN] Went to the lunch buffet today and was extremely disappointed.Service was good and it was clean. But the food was not as good as it used to be. Will try them for dinner but no longer my lunch go to when craving Indian food.  [END]
[BEGIN] They never have any open check stands. I always have to use self checkout which gives me issues and then I have to wait forever to get help.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looooong wait for Denny's quality food. No explanation for a 40 minute wait for 2 kids meals and 2 salads. Restaurant was not even half full, a Wednesday night. Will not be returning. Definitely not your average Joe's... far below it.  [END]
[BEGIN] too many people working there walking around and asking if i need to be helped. pay attention and realize that 6 other of your co-workers have surrounded me asking if i need help. i am fine. go away. let me peruse the booze.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a fan-felt rushed, pad thai was just odd (had whole eggs and tomatos?). Wouldn't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mary Chung is OK. Only go here if you don't feel like going further off Mass Ave to get to Mu Lan. For what its worth none of the Chinese people I work with like Mary Chung.  [END]
[BEGIN] Experienced the Mango/Carrot smoothie. Will not waste another $5.95. The after taste is bitter. The size is huge, so I feel guilty to throw it away. Suggest a smaller size.  [END]
[BEGIN] Here is my suggestion for the owners. Go to Press Club wine bar in San Fran. Try to duplicate by the glass quality and value, and then you'll be able to call your establishment a wine bar. Mediocre wine at premium prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not impressed. The food was not so great. The service was not upbeat or fast. I was really disappointed. The prices were way too high for then quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely hot!! One of the reason I got a gym membership is because is too hot to run outside.. This place is ridiculously hot.. Don't get a membership here!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is good here, but I have had nothing but bad experiences with their waitstaff. I will not sit down to eat in this place, but i still really enjoy their food. Great for take-out, but I wouldnt come here for a dinner with my friends or family.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not impressed with the burgers at all. There was absolutely no flavor in the burger. The only reason I gave them 2 stars was for the quickness of the service. There also several option to add to a burger that has no flavor. I was so hopeful.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak without bell peppers. It was a $10 sandwich, tiny and dry. The meat was chewy and overcooked and there was barely any cheese. I was expecting a cheesy, juicy sandwich on a nice toasted roll. What I got was nothing close to my expectation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great coffee. But staff has a "Too cool for school" attitude. Completely distracted by each other and careless resulting in orders being forgotten and drinks taking way too long to be made even when quiet. Maybe drop the attitude, keep the smiles and laughs and step up your service game.  [END]
[BEGIN] First visit will be the last visit. Bartender was friendly, fun environment. Tab was $25.44 for 4 beers. 2 Pearl Snaps and 2 Stash IPAs. Over $6 for one beer!!! No thanks.  [END]
[BEGIN] After being seated, we waited over 40 minutes for our meal. Watery coffee didn't help the wait. Considering how small the restaurant is (maybe a 30 top?) It shouldn't be this difficult to eat breakfast. Especially scrambled eggs. I won't be returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had brunch here... and it was just okay. Over priced. Too long of a wait. They are doing well because of lack of competition. A place like this would have to step up their game if its located in portland or nyc or sf.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only cool thing about this bar is the roof that can open at night. The drinks are exorbitantly expensive for Dirty Sixth and unless you want to listen to nonstop EDM, this is the wrong dance club for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered a kathi roll to go. Very undercooked veggies were almost raw and crunchy to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] You can always find a seat in here, perhaps because everything is so pricey. The WiFi is a complete ripoff: $5/hour and it is super slow. Coffee is okay but not as good as the pretentious baristas would lead you to believe.  [END]
[BEGIN] $41 for a medicore mani/pedi. I'm newer to the Chestnut Hill/West Roxbury area.. does anyone recommend a better place. One that actually CLEANS your nails?  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably one of the worst ones I go to. The ONLY Starbucks that makes you wait 25 minutes to pour an iced coffee....all other Starbucks have their cashiers pour it to mitigate the wait time....and it makes sense.  [END]
[BEGIN] How could you have stale bread on the second day after opening? HOW?! The burgers looked so good on that banner before it opened.I wouldn't have thought it was possible to replicate paying to see The Blair Witch Project with Burgers and fries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty nasty. We ordered sweet and sour pork, scallion pancake, noodles and hot and sour soup and... It was all bad and tasteless  [END]
[BEGIN] This restaurant has great food, but music is way too loud for the lunch crowd. My husband has sensitive hearing and we were told the music has to stay at a certain high volume or turned off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ran out of food pretty quickly You have to be there early or you wont get food only sauce Food its really greasy  [END]
[BEGIN] The food here is great, but this is the second time that I've eaten in the bar area and been so massively disturbed by outrageously drunk, loud people who are admitting out loud that they're driving home that I had to leave. Where are the Dublin Police?!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] In 2006, had an emergency take out dinner here and it was ok. Not my sort of place, but it did the job. I'm surprised to see that it's still up and running in the same location years later.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has gotten worse with time. The pizza used to be really good, now not so much. Pizza taste rushed and the ingredients are poor quality. Nice people but terrible pizza  [END]
[BEGIN] I''ve never been impresed with Maggiano's. I don't think I"ll revisit. The food is boring, seems like the sauce is of the "out-of-the-can" nature.... The service is great though. I had the funniest (yet unobtrusive) and prompt waiter there on my last visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here for drinks and bubble waffle. Ordered the oreo bubble waffle but it didn't taste like anything except the icing sugar on top. The drinks were ok, a bit pricey. Probably won't come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used to Love going here! Last 2 times it was not good! New owners a few months ago, now very slow service, hardly anyone working, wasnt busy and still had to WAIT and wait.makes me not want to back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was kinda good , but overpriced. Service was slow. Would not recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unimpressed and slightly ticked off. The house ramen was ok at best, and apparently if you do take-out they give you half as much food for the same price. Won't be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The reason I gave it 2 Stars is because the service was fast and not bad BUT the food is NOT Good. Today I had the Worse Cuban Sandwich ever, I will not return. The restaurant itself had a funny smell. No Way I would be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] During my recent visit I ordered a blackened tilapia and it arrived to my table soggy and undercooked. Also it was certainly not a blackened.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't buy the blueberry wine- it's rotted to vinegar. Strawberries ok this year.  [END]
[BEGIN] Alright food. Cool weird atmosphere. But apparently they no longer take reservations. Guess I'll have to find somewhere else to have my birthday dinner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Update: Recently ordered the stuffed shells, which come with a side of ziti. It was more like Ziti with a side of stuffed shells. It's not like stuffed shells are expensive to make, just give me more of what I actually ordered!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The bread in the grilled cheese sandwich was mushy and the sandwich was flavorless. The butternut squash soup tasted like it was from a can. The pumpkin seeds were stale. Won't be eating here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] In the past two weeks, I've had two things come back to me dirtier than when I sent them in. Hopefully they'll improve their dry cleaning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Average at best. Been twice second time definitely shame on me the second time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing special. You get a over priced burrito full of rice. Kind of gross. Not authentic. Not even as good as chipotle. Won't be coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are not sitting at the bar then you probably will have a bad experience. For whatever reason it takes 10 minutes to be seated when the place is empty. This used to be a nice looking place now it looks dingy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was so disappointed. The vegetables were overcooked. Sauces bland. Meat like shoe leather, shrimp like leather. We will not be ordering from them again.  [END]
[BEGIN] They only have two people working. The line is about 40 people deep, and each person demands about a dozen samples before the decide what to order. If you come, bring lots of patience. I have no clue why they would be so short staffed on a Saturday afternoon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rowdy atmosphere. Mediocre food. Bad service. Any questions?  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice coffee, 15 minute wait not acceptable. Great setting however the whole operation feels very amateurish. Needs some life in there too! Staff half asleep.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wings and burgers are on point. Here's the problem, I had 6 draft beers (Sam Adams). Price per beer?? $6!!! Yep, $6 per beer. Draft beer!! Who in the hell pays $6 for a draft beer?? $36 for six draft beers!! WILL NOT BE BACK. RIPOFF  [END]
[BEGIN] Food isn't the best but nice waitress. Being on the water is nice. It fun to see the boats coming and going and watch boats going by. Went for ambience more anything.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent, but not great. Even though Sushi Town is closer, my boyfriend and I prefer to go to Marine Polis Sushiland down by Beaverton Town Square instead-- their dishes are something like 25-50 cents cheaper per item and the food is better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overrated, overpriced, with only so-so service. Why does this place get such rave reviews? Perhaps the expectations made by everyone RAVING about this place ruined me, but honestly, Farm Burger is 100x better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Is you would like to leave a bar smelling like anything other that cigarettes, this is not the bar for you. Drinks are fairly priced, but no real deals here. Okay place to hang out for a few, but don't make a night of it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kid's cheeseburger with fries and a milkshake cost $15.29. The milkshake was good but the cheeseburger was horrible. Not worth a return.  [END]
[BEGIN] breakfast was alright and the rooms were clean. microwave didn't work and neither did the fridge. they charge an extra fee for pets so be aware of that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friend ordered a well done burger. It came out medium rare; took them another 20 minutes. The entire table was through eating by the time her burger returned.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fresh food, but just not my flavor. Doesnt mean bad, but not my type of cuisine. Giving a couple os stars becaus e others like the fresh element  [END]
[BEGIN] This was ok. The sandwich is cold the cheese was not melted and the meat was cold as well. The fries tasted like dirty grease and the soup was lukewarm. It was edible but will not go back. Better choices to eat nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Can't imagine why anyone would think the buffet was tasty. It all seemed bland, overcooked, and a little greasy. Luckily, I spotted the sriracha sauce, ginger, garlic, and other condiments adjacent to the steam tables. Even the hot and sour soup seemed underpowered. Guess I'll have to trek to Chinatown.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had great anticipation... But highly dissapeointng. The are not many ingredients in the ramen.... Most dishes taste the same, there is not any dishes were made with thoughtfulness. Not wanting to go back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Slow service. Very loud. Not a venue for a nice dinner with your significant other. Steaks not as good as advertised. Have had much better at Morton's and other steak houses.  [END]
[BEGIN] the food is OK. sushi is small and not that fresh worst service i've encountered in a long time.  [END]
[BEGIN] For a few years, I had seen this place with a packed house and assumed they must have great good. Let's just say it was a waste of my $15. They put absolutely NO seasoning (ie. Salt) or oil on my food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Disappointment! Disappointment! Disappointment! Too few varieties of dish. Only pipeapple and orange no other fruits  [END]
[BEGIN] Not super clean. Meals use to be a value. Stopped by for lunch... Meal didn't include plantains like in the past. M $ 28 for lunch?:(  [END]
[BEGIN] Had lunch in Saturday. Sat at the bar. Food is ok but service was very, very slow. Slow to get a beer, slow to get my food. Make plenty of time if you decide to go here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfriendly service, didn't take American express. The bread was stale like it was made 2 days ago. Not a good place to study the music was so loud.  [END]
[BEGIN] They sell similar sounding drinks as other coffee shops but they don't taste as good! Iced Mocha tasted like brown colored milk without the flavor or sweetness of mocha! On the positive side, the staff was very courteous and friendly!  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here twice. Food is mediocre at best. Service was poor both times too. Definitely won't be back  [END]
[BEGIN] This place used to be good, my friends and I ordered from there regularly. This hasn't been the case for over a year now. I ate there last week, my opinion remains the same.  [END]
[BEGIN] Two times in a row the driver could not find me. On phone with them telling them exactly where I was. These were major landmarks. Cost me an hour and 36 to cancel and get a new driver. Very soured on uber.  [END]
[BEGIN] Place was not clean Chicken Shawarma was good. Their tamarind juice was horrible. I wanted to try this place because I had a coupon. However, they didnt accept the coupons It should not have been featured on the site if they dont use it. They didnt apologize either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Underwhelming pastry. We were late in the day but frankly the 6 options we took home were for the most part so so. My friend used the team?"mass produced" and I have to agree.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered a house special pho. Broth was horribly heavy on MSG and beef was so over cooked that it was hard and chewy. There is much better place nearby so I am not coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The restaurant was filthy even for even those used to going to high turnover places. They advertise the use of Apple Pay but none of the machines work. I've eaten and many fuddrucker's and none where quite like this.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too many smokers on the porch. Supposed to be 15 feet from restaurant entrance and this is not enforced here :( yuck.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't bother with this place if you're a vegetarian. The only vegetarian thing they have that could be an entree is spaghetti in tomato sauce. And forget about being able to share appetizers, those are also overwhelmingly vegetarian unfriendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really Disappointed by the food. Felt like these ppl didn't care about the food they're serving. Food was tasteless.  [END]
[BEGIN] VERY disappointed my last several visits. The food was greasy and tasteless, they didn't have want I wanted, the severs were rude. I don't go anymore  [END]
[BEGIN] It wasn't horrible, but I don't like these big, corporate bars with subpar food and overpriced activities. Maybe I'm just not adjusted to Boston's cost of living and drinking options, but give me a dive with a shuffleboard table over this any day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is bland, beer selection is ok if you like wheat beers, always crowded, poorly trained staff  [END]
[BEGIN] Mozart is clean, and the staff is friendly, but the Oreo cake I had was flat. It wasn't particularly moist, and it was unimpressive. The Americano, however, was better than mediocre.  [END]
[BEGIN] I LOVE the Boston Globe as a paper, their articles, sections, etc. However, ever since I cancelled my subscription over a year ago, they call me at least once a day to re-subscribe. I understand the newspaper industry is in trouble but don't push away your supporters by harassing them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did I just pay $5 for a burger??? Not really sure, I took three bites of something and it was gone. Way too small for what you pay, and an average tasting burger at that.  [END]
[BEGIN] So here it is short sweet and to the point! Go for the " I've been there!"............ Burgers - Greasy $8-$9 burger Sweet Potater Tots - Hmmmm? Let down Frap - Thick -Suggestion bigger straws? $33.00 mediocre at best! :-(  [END]
[BEGIN] 2 stars because my partner loved his dish, and we were able to take it to go. Also, service was super friendly. Sadly they had absolutely no GF options, not even for appetizers. No reason for me to go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this place for Taco's, but today when I opened up my tacos I had store bought crunchy corn taco shells and not the glorious ones I had come to love. Anyone know what happened?  [END]
[BEGIN] Only accepts cash and doesn't like you bringing your Starbucks  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirty tables, dirty salsa bar. Vomit in the bathroom. Employees talking and doing nothing while restaurant is empty instead of making sure the location is clean. Would not eat at this particular location. It's gross.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a "regular" size pizza which is a little smaller than a regular small pizza anywhere else. It was so soggy I could only eat half of it. And it cost me $18 :(  [END]
[BEGIN] A little on the greasy side. Certainly overpriced for the quality and selection. With so many options in Vancouver, this wouldn't be in my top 10. Did several appetisers and the pairing menu that was suggested. Pairings were unimaginative and not well explained. All wines were local....Service was average.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the views from the trail but it smells like crap throughout the whole area. You can't get away from it! If I had a dog I would fit into the scene.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizza was average for brick oven, very slow service for a "lunch special". Employees don't seem to know the meaning of customer service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely not as good as Ghiradelli square in San Francisco. Hot fudge sundae was $12 and I could've made a better one at home myself. Overpriced for "okay" dessert  [END]
[BEGIN] I want to like this place but I always leave feeling ripped off. $8.99 for that tiny burger and "bottomless" fries (I never got a refill on drinks or the fries). I've had better elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst service. This is our second time here, with the same server. We waited over twenty minutes just for our drinks. The food took half an hour, and the order was wrong. And my tacos were cold. Our server didn't even apologize. Don't waste your time or money!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Too bro for the east side in my opinion. Big screens with sports and cheesy pop country music. Not to mention overpriced beers. The roof view is nice, but the music, prices and touristy pretentious vibe kind of killed it for us. Just didn't feel like Austin, more like Dallas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Trivia nights are cool but other than that this place is, yet again, an over priced over pretentious bar. $13 just to walk through the door and $7.50 pints. This place was in it's prime before the Dummy Donnelly group took it over. Get over yourself, Lamplighter.  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely average experience. I ordered the gnocchi and it was extremely bland. Even the soda was flat. Definitely not worth the price ($20-$30).  [END]
[BEGIN] Tooooo many flys in the bar!!! Food, mehhh. The place is pretty dirty. Disappointed but our waiter was really nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Store was clean enough. Food was ok. The girl at the front counter taking our order was pretty disgusting. While taking our order she was putting her fingers in her mouth and digging out junk from her tongue ring. Eww! Whats wrong with people?!?!  [END]
[BEGIN] Couldn't get over the offensive SMELL! Cool gym but disgustingly stinky. Had to cut my workout short.  [END]
[BEGIN] Made a quick stop at Jack on my way home. Ordered a large meal and light sauce on my sandwich, when I get home my sandwich has mayo and ketchup coming out of everywhere and my LARGE FRY seems to be a small in a large container. So disappointed  [END]
[BEGIN] I was expecting much more from the Orlando location. San Diego and San Antonio are much better. There isn't a whole lot on the way of rides and show variety here. It seems very small. They could have done a lot better with this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok, I only ate in the bar but.... My server got mescuto confused with presecco. Service was very unpersonable the crab and sprimp spring rolls were greasy and did not mat h the description on the menu. This place is for tourists with no culinary awareness.  [END]
[BEGIN] Twice I have attempted to eat at this place. The service is atrocious. The non existent hostess or host would definitely help this hole. But service is subpar in Atlanta, so I shouldn't be to hard on these guys.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ate in and ordered lasagna a few times, which was accompanied by garlic knots. Went in today for take out, came home to discover the garlic knots were not included. To make things worse, the lasagna wasn't fully warned/heated to the center. Disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like Greek food, this is not the place to get it. I'm sorry, Al. It won't happen again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yuk! What happened? Cinnabon is consistent everywhere else. The only thing consistent is the presentation and that lovely smell when you walk in. But the under-buttered taste of this doughy tasteless mass is not worth your $5 bucks. Go elsewhere. I promise you'll be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The setting is perfectly adequate, and the food comes close. The dining chains like Chilis and Victoria Station do barbecue better. It's no surprise you can always pick up coupons for Linwood at restaurant.com.  [END]
[BEGIN] sooo i went in around 7 for a curry chicken.. and wtf, a piece of my chicken was literally COLD, not cool not luke warm cold.. so i assume they are rewarming food. probably wont go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The workers were super nice, but the food was not so much. I had a really dry cupcake, moist but odd-tasting GF brownie, and a hard-as-rock GF cookie (which was also odd-tasting). With there being so many other incredibly awesome bakeries, I don't see why I should go back here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Menu looks great. Probably organic ingredients. Would be tasty if you got enough to actually sustain human life. Stingy with everything even lettuce. The staff is rude and snotty. Spent $22.00 on a sandwich , chips and a tea. Was hungry when I left ! Don't do it !  [END]
[BEGIN] Yikkity!!!! I love the Mamo subs!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] They are handy and helpful but they aren't cheap. Got a refurbed Dell CPU on line for less than half of what I would have paid at the store. I was shocked. But I still go there for the small stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not my favorite burger. I tried the sliders and they were oily, the server said that it comes with one side but they charged me the side separated. The hostess was not very friendly. The decoration is great but does not match the food or music or the people.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mediocre at best. General tso chicken was mushy, lacked flavor. Brown rice was bland. Looking in the rearview mirror we should've passed On this meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is tasty, as you'd expect from most pho places in Vancouver, but has a habit of overcharging. Watch out!  [END]
[BEGIN] Slow service mediocre food and steep prices. A waiter started to bring my dinner about 90 seconds after my salad was finally delivered. I saw him put it under the heat lamp for 10 or so minutes until I finished the salad. Great idea. In a fish restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok this place claims they just had a multi million dollar renovation, but alls it looks like the got new carpet and put the cheapest fixtures and furniture they could find. Oh and the walls are paper thin. I will not be revisiting...  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is fine. The location is fun. But this place is vastly overrated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small but not busy in morning. Staff do say hi and bye which is better than most of their gyms. Equipment needs to fixed better. They have only 2 bikes and one doesn't work. Overall not bad because so slow. When I go anyways.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product but the service at this location has to be the worst I've seen. 20 minutes at the drive thru is completely unacceptable Unfortunately, they don't have much competition in Johnstown........yet. The day will come and this place will struggle  [END]
[BEGIN] I got take-out noodles. They were piping hot and placed in a styrofoam carrier. When I opened them at the office 15 minutes later the noodles had the strong flavor of styrofoam. I imagine that eat-in meal would have been must better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Compared to the Sandy Springs location, this is in every way inferior--much smaller, much less selection. Same high prices. I'll pass next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beer: - Harpoon UFO Entree: - Chicken Ranch Salad: Came with a good avocado ranch dressing. Not enough avocado or chicken, salad was a little soggy and lettuce seemed mostly iceberg - Friends said pulled pork sandwich and steak were not so good - Curly fries were a plus  [END]
[BEGIN] This was disappointing. Portions were just way too small. It is pricey and at $30 for an entree, it's ridiculous how small they are. To be fair, some pros: - Service was prompt - Outdoor patio seating is nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Hey guess what? I have a job too. Way late. Called after the service window to let us know they were on their way. Overpriced and pressuring us to spend money on work that does not need to be done. I don't have a great feeling about this company.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was fine....worse parking ever as it has like 10 spaces. That's just cray. Poor location and will opt for a different one in the future.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yelp removed my photo of my dog eating the gross food they sent to my house. Hey Ginger Exchange instead of wasting your time reporting my photo how about refunding my money to my credit card or simply apologizing? Nah that's not passive aggressive enough for you maybe.  [END]
[BEGIN] A few years back a guy offered to take me here for breakfast....... I"ll give it two stars because it was better than a walk of shame. Miss college  [END]
[BEGIN] Is it just me, or is the shop owned by 19 year olds? I never see any older adults. Ever.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only good if you are an NU student Just basic American bar with decent appetizers. Have TV to watch games.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was pretty disappointed in the ramen. I had read the excellent review in the Willamette weekly it definitely did not meet my expectations. I will definitely stick with Boxer Ramen as the best ramen in Portland.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location unless you stop on your way to work. You will wait until they decide they are ready to open! This is just reviewing the Amazon locker location. I wouldn't shop this time of morning, but it would sure be nice if I could have picked up my package  [END]
[BEGIN] food was bland, and meats hard. Drinks wonderful but small. Don't see any reason to run back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cake wasn't bad but service was terrible. They need a healthy serving of better customer service. Plus the box the cake came in looked used. Won't be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lo mein was good. The pepper steak had onions in it, which is a travesty. Not only that, but the onions were not thoroughly sauteed! Egg roles were so-so. Not going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I called to order a pizza for delivery and they just said no. They were backed up. Good for them but I had the time to wait and they wouldn't do it. Bummer.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was excited to try this place... however it fell in disappointment as their XLBs were juicy but lacking that flavor. Please do not get their tiny a$$ portion lunch special. I left hungry... I could've went for another lunch. Their desserts that come with the special weren't anything appealing.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place service was horrible but the food was good and the prices are great. We went one Saturday they said that the serve was running late so the cooks were serving the food in their dirty apron, just unprofessional. I will say that the shrimp and grits are delicious!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not really fresh food, salsa smelled stale.. chicken is dry and not grilled fresh. The waiters were not awake at 8am. Not going to this place again.  [END]
[BEGIN] A small joint, I could see it being a great place to hang out in the right company. Easy access from the subway. The beer selection could use some diversification. This is my main reason for the low review. Also, it took a little while to get served.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is delicious, but one lady works over there and she is quite rude. Qdoba should definitely consider terminating her job. She was there working at Monday 21st April 10 pm and I went there and she was very very rude.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just a normal breakfast. Service is SLOW!!!!! They seemed more concerned about socializing with 'the locals' than taking care of everyone else. Eggs were getting cold before the toast was brought to our table. Probably won't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I hadn't been to A Fuddruckers in years because there aren't any close by. We were on this side of town and decided to take our four boys. The condition of this location is pitiful. Service slow. The food still just as good as I remember. I wouldn't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tradewinds restaurant in Marriott's Renaissance Orlando Sea World has friendly staff and tandard chicken order was good. Small portion and extremely slow (over 30 minute) food delivery time for lunch was disappointing. Approximately $15 a la carte dish.  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought this would really be better. They have a nice selection of sauces, but in all it is lacking in quality and overprieced for what you get. The kids meals are expensive as are the vegatarian options. I would not come back here and prefer Benihana's over BD's anytime.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did takeout on a Monday nite. Food was poorly prepared and cold. Nothing like reviews. Hopefully caught it on a bad night. Definitely will no return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not worth it! Dry! The pizza is underwhelming. $60 for 3 1 foot!!!! The Margherita pizza \ has very little mozzerella, basel, and sauce. Same with the other two pizzas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Simply over-priced compared to the many other cold-pressed juice places i've been too. I'd say their price is nearly doubled!  [END]
[BEGIN] First of all, I was disappointed. Very pricey for a Jenny Craig portion size of food. Food was tasty but I have tasted better. Never again. But if you have Money to waste then please do.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lamplighter is your typical pub and one of the few places that open late on a weekday. However, service can be a real stinger.  [END]
[BEGIN] A word of warning: do not buy polyester Benetton suits. The wool suits are lovely and well made (in Italy). The polyester ones are terrible - look great when you try them on, but then move all over the place when you walk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Okay place, Terrible wait time. Good atmosphere, decent food. I don't understand a Saturday brunch menu until 3pm. I won't be back  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing to rave about. Ordered a pizza with white sauce and mushroom and red pepper topping. We could count how many veggies were on there as topping. Not appealing! Find a cici's pizza, their topping and cheese covers the pizza for LESS money and way better customer service!  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything was too salty. Tom Yum Goong soup and pho--all too salty. Spring rolls were bland. Surprisingly, fried rice was pretty good. But my taste buds for Thai food have been spoiled living in LA so yea--it needs to step it up a bit more.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wasnt very happy with this restaurant.. Ramen was a bit bland, I still ate it, but I wasn't very happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their ramen is mediocre and expensive. The noodles were really good, broth was meh, the egg was slightly overcooked and bland, the pork was excellent, but overall this place is way to expensive for what the offer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dismal food, service leaves something to be desired, and it's pretty dark in here. Ah well, it's a bar. I didn't expect much more.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered ramen for takeout. The vegetarian ramen was particularly lackluster, but the regular ramen also didn't blow me away. I also had difficulty communicating with the staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here twice now. Not recommended for the food but the environment is fun being that its a sports bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place used to be a hip, trendy place...lately not so much. Just another Atlanta pretentious little boutique. Go to Hand in Pocket better selection, nicer staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Over priced. $10 for an hour of pool. $4.00 for shoe rentals,and $4.50 per person for an hour of bowling. Are you kidding me??? They rob you.  [END]
[BEGIN] We used to love the pizza they had here but tonight's pizza fell short of our expectations. I don't know if it's new management or budget issues but the pizza is no where close to what it used to be.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has no customer service what so ever but if you get one of the barbers who don't have ego, you'll be taken care of.  [END]
[BEGIN] Crazy crazy high prices. Stunning, really. Breathtakingly high. $3 donuts, anyone?  [END]
[BEGIN] Delicious pizza but ordered (and paid) at 4:41P with an ETA of 50-70 minutes. It's currently 6:34P and no pizza. Called to confirm they have our address correct and was told they should have given an ETA of 70-90 minutes. 90 minutes have come and passed. So disappointing. Still waiting...  [END]
[BEGIN] I absolutely despised these donuts. We ordered three different kinds and didn't finish any of them. Each was far, far too sweet. Almost inedible. Can you imagine? Waiting for an hour and then not even wanting to finish the donuts? The tragedy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice bar, but a little too "disney" faux showplace and that detracts from the "reality" of it  [END]
[BEGIN] The pineapple buns looked sad and mushy, the cream buns looked sad, the scallion rousong swirly buns looked sad, the coconut raisin buns looked sad... And they all tasted sad too. Poor texture, stale ingredients, limited selection. Simply not a good bakery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Over cooked duck with plum sauce served with attitude by a waiter. Yuck. I tried two white wines but could drink neither because they had gone bad. I've tried both locations, downtown and north. Both equally terrible dining.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's the definition of a bar in Allston. Cheap, greasy food and Bud Lites. Better in the summers when the college kids are out of town.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for dinner and a drink not a booze lesson. Plus the food is just so so. Staff should just serve dinner not give pointers on drinking weird stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bourbon bar great. Valet was awful. Waited forever for our car. Literally in slow motion as if they could care less. Made us late for a surprise party we were going to.  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to love love his theater. HOWEVER they haven't put any money into their theater, seats are terrible my butt and lower back are in miserable pain after sitting through a 2 your movie. Most other theaters have luxury seating now and much cheaper prices. Never going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Manager working the register was grumpy, and verbally complained about the difficulty of our large order. They forgot many items from our order, he blamed that in us. Took fifteen minutes to get one iced coffee.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recommended by an associate for there boil. Although it was quite a few customers, I didn't find it very good. The calamari was superb, but the catfish and chicken were not.  [END]
[BEGIN] This chicken is not all that. It's just lightly fried chicken. The sides are bland as well. Go to Lucy's fried chicken instead, that chicken and sides are the bomb!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food, always satisfied.. But the people who work here are rude and extremely lazy. Lots of employees standing around, chatting, while literally every table in this restaurant is dirty. Will be getting my food to-go from now on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Average shrimp scampi. Overpriced and service sucks. Not good enough to be fancy, and not cheap enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was friendly but it may have been one of the worst meals I've ever had in my life. Everything in the chicken burrito tasted as if it had been sitting out all day. This place does not stand a chance against Chipolte.  [END]
[BEGIN] This location is really hit or miss. The couple times I've been here, the service has been slow more often then not. They seem to get overwhelmed easily which happens often. To add insult to injury, my sausage tasted burned today.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here several times with friends. Food is pretty good, but the building is something else - if you want to have conversation, it's a challenge. Low ceiling, hard surfaces all around, and close placement of tables create"background noise" that is overwhelming.  [END]
[BEGIN] Is not worth the money for the taste and quality. Sushi garnish with fried onion on top? The wasabi doesn't taste hot at all. Price is to high for the quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] is it good? yes- is there far better around?YES. service: mediocre-fine food: lobster was good but a little overdone (we did the whoel lobster grilled), the BBQ shrimp were luke warm, and lacking a little in flavor but still ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Gone 2 times 1st time it took 45 minutes to be served in the evening on a Thursday. Flautas were ok but not the best. 2nd time was for lunch on a Thursday. Tried Thier enchiladas they were served cold and so were the plates of my coworkers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food but I will NOT give them 5/5 stars until they implement compost & recycling bins in their stores! Also, I will not recommend them to my friends until that happens  [END]
[BEGIN] Good tapas but not that cheap. Excellent service. Weakest drinks in Atlanta! Do NOT order an overpriced mixed drink. My buddy & I spent over $60 each on mixed drinks and what a waste. I will go back but will only order bottled beer. I recommend you do the same.......  [END]
[BEGIN] Can't understand the hype, but it might be that we also didn't go during the brunch time like everyone recommended. Quail was not good and neither was the bisque I got. I might have hit an off day, but I would not come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Places is living on it past reputation....Food,service and atmosphere nothing really special... Over priced and really stuffy... Enough said  [END]
[BEGIN] Visited Bagelville in 2010 and what an amazing place to grab a satisfying breakfast. Unfortunately after the growth of the company the quality has dropped tremendously. Old bagels, gallon orange juice advertised as fresh, watery cream cheese, not to mention the lack of alternatives now. What a failure....  [END]
[BEGIN] good food but very bad service. i said thanks never heard it back from them. really arrogant owners.  [END]
[BEGIN] In theory, this should be a delicious, wholesome and quaint place to eat-- in reality, it's completely mediocre.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were excited for sushi and noodles, but we ended up very disappointed. Our sushi (the coconut shrimp roll) was topped with rotten avocado. The chicken noodle soup dish had dry, tasteless chicken. And the beef hand-pulled noodles dish had mostly fatty beef. Be careful what your order here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor quality lunch all you can eat. Tempura is not fresh. BBQ Chicken is not too bad. Not recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] The bad reviews are true sadly. I went there hoping they weren't. Sausage was so hard and dry I could not cut it with my fork. Gravy on my biscuits was cool, but thank goodness there was barely any. My partners chicken fried steak looked like they'd fried up cardboard.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pricey and rude. I've been here 3 times and the staff hasn't always been very pleasant. Don't think I'll visit again.  [END]
[BEGIN] -1 food, which was uninspired and overrated. -1 for atmosphere, as the ratio of screaming toddlers to adults was 2:1. -1 for staff, who were absent, disorganized, unfriendly, and indifferent.  [END]
[BEGIN] The jewerly department was mostly empty. The cases were papered over and the displays were very minimal. It was like a closed out department. Wasted space. Needless to say I didn't find a simple pair of silver earrings. Target you need to rethink your jewelry department.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing really stood out here. The food wasn't bad but it was nothing special either. I had the worst dinner roll I ever had here. Completely tasteless and bland.  [END]
[BEGIN] There was too much sauce on the pad thai. There may be other items that they do better.  [END]
[BEGIN] I know this sounds silly, but I got the taco salad. Yes, at a burger joint. I'm not surprised it was pretty basic. I picked steak as my protein and that was pretty good. Young lady cooking and taking orders was nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a dump, I went in a couple of times. Will not go back, for all the beer in Portland. You walk in and it gives off a bad vibe  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here a couple times, but I still haven't been impressed. Fries were soggy, chicken was too dry, and the tables were sticky and a bit dirty. Everything seems to be covered in grease.  [END]
[BEGIN] Other than the bagels. Not so much. Feel ripped off $9 for tiny sandwich and small soup. $2 for tiny apple juice. Quality so so. Bagel and cream cheese is nice but they should really consider more appropriate pricing or portion.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately this was an overpriced breakfast for pretty terrible food. The hollandaise sauce sat on the top of my eggs like pudding and the hash brown was loaded with undercooked onions. The coffee was the highlight.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is great on and off but had a bad experience with the staff many times. I like the chicken biryani in this place but decided to switch to a diff restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a chicken sandwich with fries it wasn't that good. Had 2 drinks paid 40.00 dollars.  [END]
[BEGIN] The place was really loud for a dim lit, lounge-type place to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Made an appointment for 10am, for an alignment. It's now 11am, and my car just went into the dock. Don't expect timely service here, especially if they already have your money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Boulder location. Tasty option in the fast-food category. But I wish they would play quieter music. The hard surfaces and loud music leave me a headache. If 5onBlack is supposed to be Brazillian, how about playing some pleasant Brazillian Jazz?  [END]
[BEGIN] They only gave me two tiny pork buns that cost them like $1 to make and they charge $9 for it. Total rip off, avoid this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Buffet is less than impressive. In fact, their buffet food almost tastes like barf. Their non-buffet food is average. There is far better Indian food in Austin.  [END]
[BEGIN] The reason for my low reviews is simple "Quinoa Burgers". The price of my favorite Quinoa Burgers have just doubled in the past two months? Why such a steep hike? Management: Please bring the price of all good Quinoa Burgers down ( not those Soy ones).  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not recertify or refill aviator oxygen cylinders. Did not disclose this on phone, made an unnecessary trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced and nothing special about the meats. Wanted some good corn bread but theirs jalapeños in it.  [END]
[BEGIN] generous portions. mediocre food. indifferent wait staff. decent machacado. tacos eggs were cold. ok margarita. salsa from a bottle. decent atmosphere. music on sundays at 11.  [END]
[BEGIN] I work in Tech Square so I'm always looking for places nearby to grab lunch. Here's all I have to say about my first time at Señor Patron: Bland/mediocre Mexican food: check! Whatever.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun to look. LOTS to look at. But, checkout takes FOREVER! And the $14 of fudge I bought, the lady said would be perfect for 3 weeks unrefrigerated; it's been 4 days and are now little bricks. Little hard bricks of sadness.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love their clothes but this location has the worst customer service, I have stood at the register trying to check out and return stuff and staff walk by ignoring me or they just stay in the back room leaving no one in the floor to help.  [END]
[BEGIN] The sushi was okay, almost right below average. The waiter took for eveeeeeeer to take our order and to get our checks. We also got no fortune cookie!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty sure my boyfriend got roofied here. Yep. Seriously. 2 stars for the 33-tini though; that thing's yummy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Run of the mill New York pizza. If you have never been to New York this pizza won't ruin your day. Other than that its a weak bland version of the pizza you know And love from the north east. Skip it, there are better options.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wir waren selten in einem Hooters in dem so wenig Stimmung herrschte. Die Bedienungen waren auch nicht besonders attraktiv. Nach einer kurzen Einlage mit Hula-Hup-Reifen wurde ohne sich die Hände zu waschen Essen serviert. Das Essen meiner Begleitung kam verspätet. Insgesamt war es geschmacklich nicht besonderes. Die Begrüßung war freundlich.  [END]
[BEGIN] One had breakfast with over cooked eggs that were rubbery. I had a burger that was served cold that I sent back. Expensive for bad food.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was expecting MUCH better after reading reviews. Dumplings were good and green onion pancake. But sauce on stirred fried noodles w lamb lacked flavor. Wonton soup was ok. Atmosphere is hole-in-the-wall in a non-charming way. No bathroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered takeout around 9pm on a Friday night. I received my not-so-hot food approximately an hour and a half later. The Chicken tikki masala was bland and lacked flavor, as did the naan. Disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered the two piece fried chicken. Delivery took over an hour food was freezing cold. I warmed it up in the microwave but the chicken had good flavor would of been better if it wasn't soggy from the microwave. Fries were soggy of course they were cold.  [END]
[BEGIN] We ordered two dozen oysters, they were shucked at least 30 minutes before we got there. Super dry, slimy and not good. Could tell they had been sitting for a while. Super bummed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is sloooowwww. Waited on wings to go for over 45 minutes Must be affected by the government shutdown. Will update the review if the food proves to be worth the wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was OK. Soup was a little cold for my taste. The Clam Chowder was not what I expected for a Boston restaurant. As a dining experience, it could have been better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lousy service, margarita tastes like it came out of a gun and food tastes like another corporate chain that puts profit ahead of ingredients and creativity. Oh wait, that's what they are now. Pass.  [END]
[BEGIN] Waiter was the best part of our meal. Pleasant and friendly. The food was very salty. Not a great meal. Have heard good things about pf chang. Not this time. Maybe we'll try another location some day??? Maybe not??  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible food. i read plenty good comments here so i went and after first bite i regret that! Good service. Great but dark ambiance.  [END]
[BEGIN] cute place, WONDERFUL STAFF (ask for Carolina), but giving a low rating because of the gendered bathrooms. will happily change to 5 stars once the space is more inviting for all folks  [END]
[BEGIN] Breakfast bar is terrible. Dry eggs, undercooked greasy bacon and no one around to help satisfy the desire for fresh eggs and crisp bacon. And by the way..OVERPRICED!  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered the Seafood Po-Boy and Miss Shortcake. The po-boy was stuffed with fried oysters. Fried on fried? Not very appetizing to me. There was way too much oil. Miss Shortcake was better, but I couldn't help but feel like my insides were submerged in oil after the meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Waiting 25-30 min because I have a child and there e empty tables by the bar. Terrible customer service on that  [END]
[BEGIN] I only come here for an oil change, they always try to encourage additional services but I refuse to give them any additional money. The staff isn't very friendly at all with the exception of William he is normally very helpful and informative.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is good when they get it correct, but beware take away orders. They can't seem to distinguish between corn and flour tortillas.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've only eaten here twice. It's good but you will leave hungry. I also didn't think the price matched the quantity. I probably won't return now that Chicken Salad Chick is open right around the corner. Much better food, choice and price.  [END]
[BEGIN] The sushi is okay and I haven't been poisoned, but I only get egg or vegetarian sushi and additionally the staff are rude and honestly have no knowledge of standard sushi roll types and names. Its cheap and in a pinch its fine, but I'd never recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] My friends keep dragging me here...this place seems more like a hang out for locals who like to judge and make rude comments to non-regulars. The beer is average and the variety is limited.  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to LOVE this place when I lived in Arlington but I just went back today and it was not great so now I'm SUPER embarrassed that I've been telling everyone how great it is. SORRY!  [END]
[BEGIN] Week business traveler. Will not stay again. Staff was nice and friendly. Hotel was outdated. My room was physically clean, but smelled old and moldy. If I wasn't so tired I would have found another hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] An hour and a half to deliver a salad and a slice of pizza. The pizza was ice cold and the salad was wilted. Maybe just an off day? Not very impressed.  [END]
[BEGIN] We ordered three donuts and when we opened the bag, one of them was the wrong kind. There has been so much build up and the donuts were pretty mediocre. They were all chewy except the cake kind. And all for quite a high price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is great but delivery is a nightmare. On two occasions my order has either not been delivered or taken close to two hours (I.e. They forgot the order until I called and complained.) If you are going to try Noor, go to the restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't recommend this mall. Too many cheap stores in here. I have two words for this place. "KEEP DRIVING". Yep, I have to admit. Camp Creek Marketplace is a GEM compared to this dump!  [END]
[BEGIN] Disappointed with the food but everything else was fine. Good staff, nice set up. I've been twice and the food just wasn't tasteful. I don't like writing negative reviews but it was disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went to play poker here and it was not a good spot. If you are not a regular the service is poor. The food is typical of a bar so nothing special.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is excellent, chicken saag is very good, goat curry is horrible, lamb vindaloo is not good, meat platter is average, naan is good and the quantity of food per dish is disappointing according to price...  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to love the roast beef from here but lately it has not been as good, hopefully they will overhaul the menu and add quality ingredients soon. At least better buns.  [END]
[BEGIN] Way overpriced, severely bland and every server seemed to actually be in pain having to provide service. Would not ever recommend except for their outside patio which is cool if you're already drunk and won't notice the service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Can't say I enjoyed this. The food was bland. The other customers were loud and obnoxious. The gin and tonic was pretty good though. I was relieved to leave though I found the staff very friendly indeed.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been a few times, and each time something has gone wrong. (Either they gave me the wrong part, or they couldn't fix the problem but another shop fixed it in a matter of minutes etc). I wouldn't recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only good for lunch or if I am not paying. I like the RI calamari, but that's about it. I've never been impressed. The $6.95 clam roll down the street at Ma Magoo's is better than Jasper's (which is twice the price).  [END]
[BEGIN] I never post but had to share so that others didn't make the same mistake. Got a flank steak Bao. Steak was cold and inedible. Many delicious places in china town that you should try instead  [END]
[BEGIN] I agree with Will P. (other reviewer), the cake was very sweet, low on flavor. Depends on what you like, I guess.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was excellent but we had to wait over 20 minutes for chicken tenders. The rest of us were well through our meals before my son went back to the counter to get them.  [END]
[BEGIN] the food was good but my husband and myself were not feeling well after we ate i needed to send my hamberget back becuse it was not cooked all the way  [END]
[BEGIN] So much for my tuna burger. IT has started to suck now. I couldn't eat beyond two bites. Highly sad and disappointed! I loved this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wasn't impressed, and have fun nearly getting smacked in the head by trays of Chinese food whizzing inches away. Dated interior and typical Central Sq jackoff clientele. No thanks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent burger. Thinly shaved red onion, cheese and two patties Pickles as well. Had this small burger not cost $12 I would have given an extra star. $12 for one small burger-no fries or drink is just crazy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Canned olives and flat flavor for everything else. I did like the crust, but the toppings weren't worth the price. When I can taste metal in the olives, something is wrong. They use canned ingredients. Massively disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Burnt americano, dry muffin, light piano music like a delta hotel lobby but without the wifi. Thankfully the staff was friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately you have to ask the owner/cook to wear gloves when cooking. I have been here numerous times and they have yet to improve there sanitary practices. So needless to say I am again in search for a Philly cheesesteak spot near my home...  [END]
[BEGIN] I cannot recommend this place. Scrambled Eggs were powdered, hashbrown are cheap pre-pressed patties. Nothing is made fresh except my BFs easy over eggs (he enjoyed them). No decaf coffee. Very little seating. No table service. All this mediocre food came at a high price of almost $30 for two.  [END]
[BEGIN] Store is very nice and clean and overall very efficient. My two star rating is because the manager is a robot and needs to be more personable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too much anxiety for one shopping center. Although, pink berry ta die for. We weren't exactly sure if we were still even in the right area at some point. Too much pressure. I bought a Vera caddy tho.... Love it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't come here. None of our food came out right after it came out room temperature. Fixing the problem took over 15 minutes. I've been here several times hoping for a better experience and continually am let down.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is nothing great. Been here a half dozen times or so. Food is meh, loud as hell inside, drinks and service are sub par. Find other mexican, although Boston doesn't have much  [END]
[BEGIN] Very slow service and frustrated servers. This is not a good choice for lunch on a work day. The restaurant was mostly empty, but we still waited an hour for lunch. I was with a group and the server was rude when we asked to split the check.  [END]
[BEGIN] The building is really cool and the cheese sticks were awesome but the pizza itself taste like a pizza kit you could pick up at Walmart. The wait staff was cool and super nice but the main thing you come here for is pizza and it was bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ughh... The limited menu and bad service do not add up to a good time. The steak is good as is the fish but the menu does NOT have enough seafood choices or sides. What is up with the sides??? Not worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small, cluttered, not that clean or organized. The food was good, the people friendly but not super service oriented. This place is worth a try - if it works for you great, but I can think of three other coffee shops more worthy of time and dollars.  [END]
[BEGIN] There are better options for good Indian food in Atlanta, but maybe not that many in the Perimeter area. Tikka Masala was ok, Chicken Jalfreze was bland, the bread was good. The service was not great. Overpriced.  [END]
[BEGIN] The How to Close a Business Equation Poor Customer Service + Overpriced and Run-of-the-Mill Merchandise = 25% Off Going Out of Business Sale, 50% Off Books and Synthetic Yarn It's still expensive, so bring your cash so you don't blow your recession-strapped credit.  [END]
[BEGIN] While I liked a particular cleaning professional I made a follow up appointment. Less than 24 hours later I was given a new one professional. I would have preferred an opportunity to reschedule with my preferred professional. Now I've cancelled, my house isn't cleaned and I've rearranged plans. Such inconvenience!  [END]
[BEGIN] This has the feel of a total tourist trap. The service was nothing to rave about and the food was bland, especially for the price. Boston has so much more to offer. Save yourself the trip and go somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good taco pizza. Not impressed with staff but its not called The Magabite and Friendly Staff. Bring quarters for games.  [END]
[BEGIN] The smoothie was good but it was small and $10. Really $1.50 for a tablespoon of peanut butter? I could have gotten at travel pack of Justin's for $1... Wouldn't recommend it just because of the prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ugh. I'm slightly disappointed in the quality of the cake that I bought from here. Picked up a pre-made birthday cake. (Small green tea, $18), and although it does look very nice, I wasn't a fan of the flavor or the texture and I'm unconvinced to come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Would've given it 4 stars if the staff were courteous ! Lame workers in kitchen !  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to love this place but recently quality and taste of kabobs here have recently gone down for some reason. Kabobs are either broken and burned or raw! And they always mess up your order.  [END]
[BEGIN] St. Patrick's Day. Crowded (obviously) but good staff and music! However. My drink, whiskey and ginger, was TINY!! Awfully small plastic cup. About 1/3 the size of s normal drink.  [END]
[BEGIN] My first visit last Tuesday the Chicken Special was great, moist and tasty so I decided to try it again this Tuesday and the chicken was dry and the mashed potatoes were room temperature at best. Both visits were at 6 pm. The service was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great desserts but the service is unbelievably slow. Order immediately and ask for the check as soon it arrives otherwise you will be waiting awhile.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its ok. Big weirdly configured room, nice service. Full service restaurant/bar. Its ok. Close to the airport, and won't break your wallet  [END]
[BEGIN] Where can I get good fried chicken? I thought with a name like Famous chicken I would get good chicken. Well the service was good and the wait was not long. But the food was not up to par. I'd say if you're looking for famous chicken go to Popeyes.  [END]
[BEGIN] customer service COMMUNICATION needs to be improved. If you can order online then someone should be monitoring those orders and not wait an entire day for an email that states "we can't fill your order". We want to try the cake but can't :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast delivery... But the food was not that great very oily. I ordered the lo mein and was just not appealing and ended up throwing it away. The chicken wings as mentioned in previous reviews are huge but they lack in taste also.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was just ok, very pricey for breakfast. Inside is dated. Gravy didn't have much flavor or pieces of sausage. Would not eat there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh, indeed. I *want* to like this place. I really do. I *try* to like this place. But it's so generic. So bland. So blah. They could do so much better. But it's like they're not even trying anymore. I'm bored just thinking about it.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Naked Fish location, while once decent, has been closed for months and has been replaced by "Lucille's Fine Chicken"  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff one star, location one star. Chai tea $4 for medium I've had way better. Pastry dry & half the size of the one in the case. Cookie a few days old. Coffee of the day good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cash only. The food was mediocre. Service, other than seating, was non-existent. This place is known for their broth, which I found just OK. Not worth the 30 minute wait to get a seat. ~$10 a bowl...Personally I'd rather have Pho.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh. I've experienced better. Not a very memorable meal. It was similar to Panda Express but worse... :(  [END]
[BEGIN] The internet here at the laptop stations is slower than 3G. DSL reports showed 784 kbits/sec download, with a half second latency. That's insanely slow.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bummed my steak was cold and the fries were soggy on my steak frites. The pigtoberfest beer was good and the bacon old fashioned is a hit. The food just didn't seem as good as the last time I was here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not worth the money... everything was salty and they weren't happy that we had kids with us. The ribs were very charred on the outside with little smoke flavor. The rotisserie chicken was salty and a bit dry.  [END]
[BEGIN] I will not return. The injera is terribly disappointing and the rest of the food doesn't make up for it. I brought two friends here telling them how yummy Ethiopian food is, only to say after "Please don't judge Ethiopian food on this."  [END]
[BEGIN] Sheets are super scratchy. Heater unit very noisy. Thermostat not accurate, I do not believe it was 94 degrees in my room. Why does my room smell like body odor? FYI, breakfast is extra even for honors members.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad. Pretty tasty, fast and hot. I would have given a star extra, but they got rid of the saté sauce! Not cool! The sizes are small for the price you pay (another star missed) plus the staff isn't very friendly, making it two stars from me.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has been so many different places over the years they dont have any identity. The bathrooms are filthy. The staff are the best part of this place. Although he large outdoor patio is nice as well. You get what you expect for a college town dive bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap clothes. Unexpensive and made cheaply. In a crunch, if you are in need of something, go here but do not expect great quality. If you just want a t-shirt, you might consier Tello's over the gap because the quality is basically the same and Tellos is cheaper.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was ok, the food was poorly put together and they didn't include my fries. Only good thing was burger. Also took 30 minutes.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm not sure what type of cuisine they're attempting here but it's not sze chuan. My dumplings came out with soya sauce and Dan Dan noodles came out with satay sauce. Not sure if the chef was drunk or not. This place was terrible  [END]
[BEGIN] Not sure what the rave is, coffee was watered down and meh. The cold brew with nitrogen seems okay. Overall, there's better coffee elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was nice. But the bed was so uncomfortable. It will be my last choice the next time I'm on. international drive  [END]
[BEGIN] Called in my pizza order an hour ago... I'm still waiting for it. Guy is super nice but they need extra help.  [END]
[BEGIN] 12$ for mediterranean omelet with coffee (1$/refill). no olives, barely any spinach, not real feta (felt like melted mozzarella), lot of milk in the omelet. Staff is very friendly. Not going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The sandwiches were great and the coffee was good and strong. But I'm amazed at how clueless the kids working here were! They had no clue what they were doing and the ear pieces made it so the could not talk to us or each other. They could do better  [END]
[BEGIN] Positives included the burrata and lobster ravioli. Negatives include the chewy calimari which in the North End is inexcusable. Overall it was a good restaurant, but not exceptional.  [END]
[BEGIN] The pizza is fine but the service is subpar. We ordered takeout, were told to pick it up in 15-20 minutes, went and bought ice cream at a nearby Publix, returned 15 minute later, and were told to wait 15 more minutes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the oyster po' boy, nothing to rave about...oysters were ok and the bread was a little hard and extremely dry.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place used to have great pho. Went last wed for the $6 special and place had 2 tables occupied. The pho was water down and noodles tasted like they were out of .15 ramen noodle pack. Try Tan Mi.  [END]
[BEGIN] What happened?! The food is great but service is horrible and the restaurant is filthy. The bussers were just using towels from their back pockets to wipe the tables?! Therefore, our menus stayed on the tables because they were too sticky to be removed. Overall experience: GROSS.  [END]
[BEGIN] Walked upstairs...the downstairs and pool hall were both deserted.....bouncer couldn't find my name on the list and wanted to charge $10 to get in.....but the place was empty so we left.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's not up to Hampton Inn's normal standard. Fridge didn't work and I found a tick crawling in the sheets. That somewhat ruins a stay. Staff was friendly and the price was about right for what we got...... I just hoped for more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Never order Hot Pot here. Too much vegetables and not enough meat. The broth was so plain.  [END]
[BEGIN] The restaurant looks very nice, I had high expectations for this place but it was a disappointment. I ordered ham eggs Benedict, the eggs were overcooked. Pricy for small portions. The coffee was good tho. Service was OK  [END]
[BEGIN] Took an Uber from the other side of town only to find out that they were closed at 4:00pm when their sign and Yelp said 6pm. Was looking forward to spending my money here but left extremely dissapointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] So sad! Had meeting space rented with dinner. Food was just a bit warm sure not hot. They put tea out but no hot water. Room was very cold, we all had our coats on. One star because the room is clean and one because it's easy to find.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not like the food at all ... we tried appetizers, lassi and main-course but nothing impressive at all .... have certainly had better Indian food in Boston  [END]
[BEGIN] Thursday 11/14/13. Went to Ginza on Colonial for dinner. Service was horribly slow. They forgot to turn on the grill. One couple had to wait 30 minutes for their drinks. The food was so salty we couldn't enjoy it. Will not go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Screw this theater. Every auditorium has a table on the seat, whether the showing is dine-in or not... and the seats in IMAX that don't have tables are small and don't recline. The concession stand is basically self-serve, with stale popcorn and overly-overpriced items. I won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] New location with poor service. Very disappointed with our lunch today The salad was over priced with one small dollop of goat cheese, the Shrimp tacos tasted frozen and the Brisket dip was forgetful.  [END]
[BEGIN] $10 cover for standard bar scene with a dj. Major ripoff. Find a different spot without the profiteering.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here for about 2 years. The staff recently changed and has gotten pretty bad. The manager, Katie, actually parks in the handicap spots when it's cold out. Maintenance is new and sluggish. Will not be signing a new lease here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't go on Monday night. Steak sandwich,our reason for going ,was dry as a bone. Onion rings burned. That said the service was excellent. Spaghetti meals seemed ok. 4adults, 2 sandwiches,2 spaghetti meals, 1drink,1 salad,1app.,2 ff upgrades with 10$tip....62$us.  [END]
[BEGIN] Environment is nice, staff is ok, fish and chips was a total let down. Nice fries, tartar sauce was plain, fish was bland, killed it with malt vinegar to make it edible. Other menu items look promising, may try again at a future date.  [END]
[BEGIN] Maybe I'm just a hard to please customer but the stay was rude and the fried rice i ordered was bland and the rice was undercooked. The red curry tofu is good though. Even though the portions are something to brag about. Not very much parking.  [END]
[BEGIN] This company is way overpriced and takes way too long to get to the destination. Honestly, pretty disappointing since you pay so much and expect it to live up to its price but it definitely doesn't. Too bad...  [END]
[BEGIN] Oh man. The gyro was good, but my tabouli salad was brown lettuce and brown mint and hardly anything else. The spanikopita was inedible, and the samosas were soggy and greasy. I'm kind of in awe that I spent 43.00 on this.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rehabilitation hospital looks like a VA hospital. Drab, not well maintained visually, room needs a paint job, holes in drapes. Not what I'd expect from a world class hospital.  [END]
[BEGIN] Today i saw them making my chicken kebab wrap without wearing gloves so am not gonna go there anymore ...  [END]
[BEGIN] The octopus and corn came with barely any octopus, the waitress was nice but the service was slow, the white rice was surprisingly below par (didn't know you could do that wrong), and the fried rice tastes like crotch. Very cramped, will not be returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Completely unremarkable experience.. The menu was extensive, but it was very difficult finding anything interesting to eat. I tried a tuna salad sandwich, and it was boring. Our waitress was annoying and kept trying to upsell additional appetizers, which is absurd given the portion size..Definitely won't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service good. Nice atmosphere. Portions big. Fresh vegetables, but overall food is meh. Almost no flavor. Would not return. Need to add flavor into the food.  [END]
[BEGIN] They were out of rotisserie chicken when I tried the place, so maybe this review is a little unfair, but I tried the chicken kabobs and was unimpressed. The sides were really lackluster. It wasn't bad, but even late at night, there are better options.  [END]
[BEGIN] Walked in and all the employees seem like they're tired. Not greeted by anyone when going into any department. They're all focusing on tasks and not helping people who look confused.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast food. It is good. Don't het me wrong. And very unique. But, as fast as it comes out, it isn't fresh. It is just sand-bagged. They also treat their employees like fast food workers, as well. I am in the industry and can see it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The burgers were disappointing! I personally don't think the burger were worth the money. The place seems like a great concept, but definitely fell short of all the hype that I have read about.  [END]
[BEGIN] Over rated. The original flavors were ok. Super sweet and overly doughy. Even the "regular" flavors were just ok. Won't waste the time or the effort to search these out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Eh? This bar always smells funny to me. It gets packed during most evenings-- lots of locals and college kids and tourists. One of the few places where you can get a 16 oz beer for $1.50!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place reminds me of somewhere my grandparents would enjoy, although on game nights it can get pretty crowded in the bar area. The food is mediocre, the menu is plentiful, but it lacks flavor and originality. It's your typical quincy bar/restaurant. Nothing special about it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The atmosphere was good but the service was terrible. IF the service matched the good food, wine and atmosphere, there could be some potential. Roll the dice....  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered lunch for four people. Not very impressed with the chicken quality very dry sweet-and-sour chicken and almond chicken. Very grisly king pao chicken.  [END]
[BEGIN] Interesting food. Tastes quite enjoyable. Good service. But I have never been served a scallop that was sliced into two. This was a hot spot, but a Thursday night and empty. I can see why.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not impressed. The food was a bit cold and underwhelming for the steep price. And is not kid friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I didn't get what I wanted and was overcharged. I asked for Kim kardashian hair and came out looking like a poodle. Now my hair is just damaged and too curly, I end up straightening it before I go out anyway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ive only been here 2 x. and I dont find myself coming back for a 3rd time. Its crowded and loud..and the service was very blah. If the food was good, I'd have something to rave about.. but alas. Nothing but cheap margiritas that would get your ass quickly drunk.  [END]
[BEGIN] We ordered pizza to go and then decided we might want to sit. Dude at the counter said that was fine but then we were kicked out by some other guy who said we had to go! Service there isn't too good, to say the least.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only thing this place has going for it is it's location and football Sunday. The owner and his buddies are constantly hovering around the bar, I generally ask for a table elsewhere to watch a game rather than be around/listen to them. Only food worth paying for is breakfast  [END]
[BEGIN] $4.72 for a SMALL chai?! Seriously!? It was alright, but too much milk not enough spice. Might as well go to Starsucks for that price and quality. And the seats on the benches are about half the normal size. Probably not going again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ugh, so disappointed! Falafel like undercooked dumplings. This place is a distant stepbrother from the original location. So if you want faster, low quality wannabe Mediterranean this is your place. Felt very Western.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered there version of stuffed hash browns when I went, the sour cream tasted like it had nail polish in it, I couldn't finish my food because of it.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice atmosphere with the comic figurines. tasty food but small portions for the price. I wont be going back because of that. #realfoodforrealpeople  [END]
[BEGIN] Decided to do the "happy hour" and what a disappointment. Be prepared to wait and then wait. Service is slow, slow and slow. The food was ok; not worth the painful wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] The people who take your order are rude. As soon as they take the order, they hang up and do not answer any clarifying questions. Definitely left me frustrated even before I got the food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fine but overrated. However, in a pinch they take all credit cards. The best place in the neighborhood doesn't. Mike  [END]
[BEGIN] chips and onion dip had no flavor and the wings were 'eh' too. headed over to bleacher bar where we had a much better experience  [END]
[BEGIN] Just went to the Taste of Tigard event and though my passport included a sample from Le Cookie Monkey all they had was a banner at their booth - I've wanted to try their products and was looking forward to it. Pretty disappointing folks.  [END]
[BEGIN] This used to be my go to spot grt food cheap drinks! But now the prices are catching up to the neighborhood! Very disappointing I probably won't be going back!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered from Saus today. The fries were cold and tasteless and the chicken and waffles weren't that great either! Tasted better!  [END]
[BEGIN] Our table was ready, and the hostess wanted to seat us. However, the manager refused to seat us, because someone sat down in our section less than 5 minutes prior. 2 stars only because the server said it was a dumb rule and took us to the seat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is fair. Can be harsh at times. Kitchen was clean. Food is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Call in to schedule a same day appointment. left message for nurse, no call back. Called 5 days later, spoke to nurse, replied " we don't recall have a message from you". Sounds like not my problem it is your problem. Looking to move to a different primary care.  [END]
[BEGIN] So so buffet. I've had better chinese buffets but for $5.99 - $6.99 per person, you can't really ask for top quality. The food was kind of greasy. The sushi was nothing special, and the dessert was also very normal. The green tea ice cream was really good.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has been taken over by bros. It's a real meh or miss. The Security is also a real buzz kill, you're telling me people can smoke their cancer sticks in the smoke area but not vapes?  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was OK but I've definitely had better Dim Sum that was at a more reasonable price. This was the most expensive Dim Sum that we've experienced so far. Service was slow but staff was friendly and pretty funny.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is very bland tasting. Had oxtail and it had no seasoning. Ask for a fruit punch and they looked at me like I had 2 heads...What Jamaican restaurant doesn't have fruit punch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Slow. Waited 30+ minutes. Must still be working out the kinks. Hope the food is worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The beef shawarma was pretty dry. Felt like eating rubber. Flavors were decent. Cook needs to take grilling leasons.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thai Lunch Haiku #1 I ordered Pad Thai, But this tastes like spaghetti! Why use tomatoes?! Thai Lunch Haiku #2 I paid thirteen bucks. Mediocre food-court food. Such disappointment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a good place to see a movie. I actually had to tell someone to start the movie after it was already 20 minutes late starting to begin with.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered Primetime which cost around $13 with the hope to eat something great. The burger was very small and the meat did not have any special taste. I think it is fine but Not Worth the money that you pay  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn't live up to the hype. I was looking forward to this place after reading the reviews but the sandwiches were bland.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would rate this hotel a 7.... Between a motel 6 and a Super 8. Staff struggled to answer simple questions. No hot water.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food but the cashiers are very condescending! I have encountered several ladies who treat us very unprofessionally. Overall it is a friendly place but I hope training be provided to its personnel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took my kids here for dinner on a Saturday. For 4 people our bill was about 170 before tip. I got one drink and so did my husband. Our dinner entrees we're about $25 each and one appetizer. I didn't think the food was any difference from Apple bees.  [END]
[BEGIN] The place is ok. But nothing special. The lady could not speak any English and I couldn't understand a word she said. Pretty frustrating. Not coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I dont get it. Always packed. Never had a meal there better than 'meh'. Nice deck, though.  [END]
[BEGIN] 1.25 for specialty tacos 1.00 for regular tacos who can honestly beat that kinda price Pro: Good tacos with a balance of spice and flavour and known for there tortas for a good reason Con: Leaves you with an upset stomach  [END]
[BEGIN] Plus side: quick service, big portions, chunks of veggies. Minus side: very little taste, "spicy" dishes very very mild, oiliness. I really want to like this little place, but just can't enjoy the food. It all tastes bland.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn't really feel the NBA themed decor is a good fit. Came here late night for their iced dessert. Price point is high at $13 for one shaved ice. Taste was good but not amazing. Overall value for money rating is low for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their staff at the Portland airport was rude to me. Overall have had decent experiences with Alaska, though.  [END]
[BEGIN] They have a lot of options to choose from. The inside is nice and roomy. The food is not that good nor does the food seem fresh. I wouldn't come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food took an hour and a half. They were out of pineapple. Pizza was cold. No real explanation offered, except traffic, you know. Food was awful, even for Pizza Hut. Skip it, order somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] The wings were soggy, as repeated in countless previous reviews. They did however fix my order quickly. I got the Thai chili 8 piece... The wings are a good size but not steroid injected!  [END]
[BEGIN] MEH! Over-hyped and over-reviewed. My BLAND meal wasn't worth the effort.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had dinner here during their grand opening, so perhaps things have changed since then. The food tasted like it came from the grocery store, and they did not serve alcohol, or beer and wine, so it's not good for a date night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was so hoping for Indian food, was very disappointed. Drinks are half ice, no wonder they offer free refills.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just sat at the bar at Bonchon for 10 minutes with employees checking out the first aid kit...no service...chicken is awesome but is clear why the place is empty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Picturesque but not my style. Food is good but I think it is a little over-priced if you consider how they serve it and the location. A good place if you like an informal atmosphere to eat typical New England food.  [END]
[BEGIN] The tea is good, but the operation is so slow. The wait time is unbelievable. It's like they can do only 1 drink per 5 minutes. So disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Two words...well five. :) Jackalope Casino El Camino Both have better burgers and you don't have to wait in a line full of tourists. This place is overrated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great coffee however badly let down by the super slow service as constant errors with orders - I think my last 5 or 6 visits my coffee order has been wrong!  [END]
[BEGIN] Incapable or unwilling to analyze basic tests, Dr. Marroquin has a nervous and furtive manner that doesn't invite confidence. The clinic is a madhouse of activity and inter office communication is lacking. Not recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] get prepared - he likes to talk. you could be there for up to two hours, most of the time just sitting around waiting for him. he's good for back and leg injuries, but if it's something specific like your foot or your hand, look for another physiotherapist....  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is nooooo bueno. I live down the street and am sad to say I can't go back! How can food be super salty and bland at the same time??  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful setting. Lovely vibe. Amazingly average food. Crazily overpriced. Heady aspirations without soulful execution.  [END]
[BEGIN] ABIA Airport, 14 people in line, 1 person taking orders, iPads turned around & not in use. Very Slow process but not like anybody has to be anywhere at a certain time.  [END]
[BEGIN] More of a cantina than restaurant. Place is so loud u need to yell your order to the waitresses. Most patrons are drunk yelling with the mariachi not enough space for people eating let alone two bands playing. The food is very cheap and okay.  [END]
[BEGIN] They really need to shut this place down. With ACC Highland open it serves no useful function....except to show how rinky-dink the school 'used' to be. There is no custodial staff actively monitoring the building. So PLEASE remember to bring along your own toilet paper. You've been warned!  [END]
[BEGIN] The cost to food quality ratio at this restaurant is poor. Shocking that it's so busy. Will not eat here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not so good and not so much fun. However it was open on Sunday morning which was nice. Cappuccino was the best part but the food and ambiance were the worst. Very boring and many other choices like Mothers or Morningstar. Kind of nerdy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice rooms but for a big weekend (SEC championship and Falcons game) under staffed and and room service keeps extending the wait time for food. We just cancelled humus and chips because it take so long to cook.  [END]
[BEGIN] Asking thousands over MSRP for a car that is temporarily in short supply is a pretty unacceptable behavior, IMO. Kind of like demand pricing with Uber - it makes sense in a mercenary kind of way, but its not the sort of thing that engenders long-term relationships.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very disappointing. Everything is being made from frozen or dried things... Nothing is home made...  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced, my drink tasted horrible like artificial mix, our food took a long time and the table that came in later got their food first but it was cold, my food was ok but the chicken was dry. Not worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't come here unless the place is empty. It took 18 minutes to make my pizza with 4 people ahead of me. I could have called Giovanni and picked up my pizza in that time. I still have to cook this thing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank you for the response Eric. We stopped in last week on November 4th. That night my boss had bistec de pollo empanizado with a Modelo. I had chuletas fritas with a shiner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Reasonable North End fare. The menu is standard Italian (something picata, something marsala, sides of pasta) and the service reasonable, but nothing to be swept away by. The ambience is quiet and good for conversation, though decorations are slightly overdone- dark red lighting, hints of volcanoes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Today was the first time I've visited a shake shack and had a single cheeseburger and french fries. Burger very greasy and I didn't particularly care for the sauce. French fries were all right but not great. I feel the prices are a little expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ugh the goat cheese and bacon omlet someone drove 35 miles for I'd do the opposite drive 35 miles not to have to eat it. Go to Annie's cafe for a much much better brunch. It's on congress and 3rd  [END]
[BEGIN] So loud! Nice staff. Mediocre food. Overpriced. Won't go back. So much better food in the Easton area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ridiculously slow service. DO NOT GO during your morning commute to work!!!!! They'll make you late.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only reason this gets 2 stars is that the line before ride is pretty immersive. The sheer boredom that the ride brings is immensely dissapointing. If you are looking for something exciting and thrilling look elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think that if you're like me and have lowered your fat intake over the years, you may not enjoy this place. I do enjoy a deep fried dinglebob every once in a while, but I left here feeling heavy and greasy. The sides were OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent food; do not expect any type of good service or you will almost surely be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not my cup of tea... Rice and peas were bland, veggies and Mac and cheese were too salty. But my bf enjoyed his meal of ribs and fish...  [END]
[BEGIN] Absurdly over-rated. Overpriced with tiny, greasy, salty portions. Sloooooow service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dry wings, soggy fries, slow delivery. Won't be ordering again.  [END]
[BEGIN] just ok! the menu and the irish breakfast needs work! nice waitress , very friendly.bar wasnt full of drunks, very clean, quite, I may go back for a drink.  [END]
[BEGIN] They cheated us on the chicken and didn't give our takeout order the rice and beans. We ordered 1 1/2 chickens and they came without the white meat. You can't run a restaurant with only teenagers. Good food but service stinks.  [END]
[BEGIN] This location moves very slow on Saturday mornings. Also, the poor cashier's had to give a full monologue to every customer about some charity they were collecting money for, which just prolonged the wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went there for lunch with my son. Got the baked potato fries, unimpressive at best. I've gotten more better tasting fresher fries from McDonalds. Skimpy on the toppings too. Will not eat there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think that if you want authentic Mexican food, you should go elsewhere. If you want Tex mex, you should also go elsewhere.. unfortunately it just wasn't good.. but they have good drinks. So I gave them a few stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool effects but not worth the 1 hour wait. Also, its not a jarring ride. I don't understand all of the ride warnings. Lawyer s being too cautious  [END]
[BEGIN] It was JUST OKAY. Basically you're paying for the location and atmosphere. The food is equivalent to steak n' shake except smaller and pricier. The burgers are EXTREMELY GREASY, I probably wouldn't eat there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went here for a gyro, not very much meat, WAY too much lettuce, and you could tell the tzatziki sauce was made with sour cream and not Greek yogurt. The best part about this place was the fries. Would not suggest if you want a good gyro.  [END]
[BEGIN] Burger was okay but not the "world's greatest". Topping bar looked like it belonged in the Haunted Mansion. Sweet Potato fries were good. But the place definitely is not worth the price. Paid $24 for 2 lunches.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff is very friendly. The steak and fish were great. However the ahi tuna was just sad, I didn't even take a second bite. They should just remove it from the menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for lunch. The food is okay and you get charge for the location that it is in. I got the chicken teriyaki box. The portions for lunch is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced. Dumplings are ok, but their soups are pretty bland. Overall disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chicken and beef teriyaki combo. Veggies were mushy, chicken and beef were ok-- at least they tasted different from each other. Ended up feeding most of my veggies to the ducks. Iced green tea was mostly flavorless.  [END]
[BEGIN] One meal was enough here. The food was ok but very salty, even for chinese. The service was good, if not overly helpful. The best part is they have homemade noodles that are pretty good. But steer clear of the moo shi...get it some place else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Shanes is NOT a great BBQ joint. The pulled pork taste as if it has been frozen and lacks flavor. The service at this location is poor compared to other locations I've been to.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice atmosphere but long wait for food and bathroom is one toilet per sex. Bathroom not clean, yuk  [END]
[BEGIN] Was disappointed at the blueberry Napoleon, the puff pastry was so soggy and chewy that you couldn't cut through it. It was a mess to eat. The matcha red bean cake was average.  [END]
[BEGIN] Owner seems nice but very disorganized. Lost my paperwork, never called me with updates, had to keep calling him myself even after the car was finished. Work they did was ok, but it took them way too long. I wouldn't go back there.  [END]
[BEGIN] The restaurant is loud. The food is complex but lacks depth. I don't recommend for the cost.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are looking for a traditional Irish pub this is not it. If you don't smoke, this is not a place for you. If you want a local hangout off the bitten path, this is for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] While the staff was incredibly nice and friendly, just as we got our food our server told us about a giant fruit fly problem the restaurant had had the previous night. Maybe not the best thing to tell your customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sauce was a bit thin and the pasta was undercooked. The service was great. They recooked the undercooked dish with no problems  [END]
[BEGIN] I've frequented the US Cafe in Smyrna many times, and it's always been really good. This one was just not nearly as good. I probably won't be returning, even though I've moved nearby. :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Customer service needs to be friendlier! Tomas from food didn't even say excuse me to my mom and almost pushed her. So not nice. I love that the restrooms are so clean and everywhere is clean. People need to smile more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Look to the left. Suckered me in for the last time. Boy has this place gone down hill. You've brought be a cold dish - one that should be hot - once too many times, guys. Sorry - life's too short.  [END]
[BEGIN] The general tso's chicken was not great, it was very fatty like not quality meat. The rice was good and the crab wontons were good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used to come here all the time. No longer a fan. Got food poising after I ate a burger. Wouldn't want to or recommend for anyone to come here. Plus all the menu is just burgers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was below average. Our waitress was rude and annoyed by her job. The ugly burgundy carpet was dirty and sticky. Food was overpriced for a below average restaurant in Revere! The manager was nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is mediocre. I don't understand how they have such great ratings. Their steak with special sauce was bland, super chewy(couldn't eat some pieces), and really lacked flavor. The flan was good and their tres leches cake was alright. The waitresses were kind of rude. Wouldn't return here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place but not so much on the food I had beef fired rice ... got fired rice and some small pieces of beef more like rice fired rice dont waste you money Go to twin lion up 183 @ breaker ln much better  [END]
[BEGIN] Although the food always tastes good, the price keeps going up while the portion size keeps going down. I bought the grilled honey chicken salad for $12.99 It came with 3oz. Of chicken.. It used to be worth the money.. Not so much now-a-days.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very average kung pao chicken, should have passed on the pork fried rice- didn't even finish it, Waitress asked how was everything, seeing uneaten PFR, said it didn't taste good, she kinda smiled an uncomfortable smile, still charged me for it. Won't be going back anytime soon  [END]
[BEGIN] Mediocre food and slow service makes for a very overpriced and disappointing Disney dining experience. Would not recommend and will not come again. The bison Is worse than a poorly done tough and chewy sirloin, not at all as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was average, drinks were overpriced but good, the servers came and went and disappeared, we sat at our table an hour and a half before our order was taken. It was horrible service for over priced, underwhelming food.  [END]
[BEGIN] We paid $9 for a very small amount of chips and a trio of small sauces. We were charged $1 for each refill of chips. ~20 chips.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've had Emma's pizza a few times through work lunches and I have never enjoyed it for some reason. Maybe it's because the pies are thin and the toppings aren't your normal toppings. I dunno, I just prefer pizza that's more substantial and normal, for lack of a better word.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not very kid friendly, the manager was a little rude to kid. The girl with long pink hair does NOT know how to cut mens short hair. Just as warning.  [END]
[BEGIN] The ambience was good Service was good I was hungry when I left .. I'm 6 foot 185 lbs package of Ramen with a small 4 oz max of chicken , very bland $ 12.99  [END]
[BEGIN] Not my favorite place, I had to go because so many people told me it was the best place for hotdogs, not the case, I sometimes think I'm too critical, but I have had better hotdogs at Fenway Park.  [END]
[BEGIN] The atmosphere would make for a great date night. But the food wasn't all that great. Dry. Flavorless. I had the salmon sandwich with a mashed potato. Eh. We never got our drinks. Service was slow.  [END]
[BEGIN] It tastes great!... But I got a plate to go and I've never been SO disappointed in the portion size for $12. What a joke! Each side item only gave me three bites.  [END]
[BEGIN] Olive Garden.....it's good on the wallet when you should be getting breadsticks and soup. I have an issue with this being my job's go-to retirement dinner spot. Therefore this may be a bit bias. Maybe. Too Carbotastic for my taste.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the following with my friend Caroline: -Samosas -Saag paneer -Chicken makhani -Small bread basket -Rice -Sierra Nevada (me) -Harpoon IPA (her) Fairly standard food, with slow service. The Sierra tasted a bit off.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wouldn't waste my money here, visited in January for brunch, poor service, mediocre food at best.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you have a lot of money and like $8 waffle powder from a box and microwaved eggs, then this is the place for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good concept but not if food is served lukewarm as it was on my visit on a not so-busy Saturday afternoon. To restaurant's credit we were offered desserts on the house. Still, a big disappointment to be served food that tastes like it had been sitting out for 20-odd minutes.  [END]
[BEGIN] I loved the service. Bartender was nice drinks were yummy. I order Mac and cheese to go. As I sit here eating it kinda sucks flavor is good needs more sauce. I added bacon and it's almost raw I barely ate any cause I was scared of almost raw bacon!  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was good but they nickel and dined us about everything. $1 extra for cheese on top of the French onion soup, $1 for extra condiments, etc. and the waiter didn't tell us ahead of time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Subs are not great quality. Meatballs are huge and would be better cut in half. Also, chicken parm sub is always so dry. I don't love bobs!  [END]
[BEGIN] Over priced Over rated. Nice place but you paying to stand in line and wait to sign up. Then it's hours away to play.  [END]
[BEGIN] I order from this location about once a week. 60-70% if the time there is an issue of some kind with my order. Love Papa...crap location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got the gyro dinner plate. You're paying mostly for skin and fat mixed up with rice. Really bad quality food and extremely bad quality meat even for a food court. Skip this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am sad to say I was not impressed. I guess I am just a traditional sushi lover. The food was ok:( but their sauces were really good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Service and food slow. Food was nothing to come back for. Beer... (shrugs shoulders) You have one time to make a first impression.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was good same with service. This is the first "Mexican" restaurant that I've been to that ever ran out of HOT sauce.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got to try finally after all these years. Haven't been to the one in Eastie since I was a kid. It tasted good but thought the size was kinda small. Price was decent but could get a larger size for same. Not completely disappointed though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gross. Would not recommend. Used to be better. Saturday night and food was cold, unflavorful. Honestly not a single dish was appetizing. Large selection though.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food wasn't good enough for a 2hr wait and poor service. I wouldn't recommend this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mediocre food with no interest. It seems the only reason this place is one is inertia. Bad decoration, huge menu without clear focus and uninspired food make poor use of a very nice space.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very expensive and machinery is not top notch for the cost.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is slow, tables are sticky, and the condiments at the table needed cleaned off. ( dried on the caps and down the sides of the bottle) I just felt gross being in here. Potato salads were very good, but other than that, good luck. Yuck.  [END]
[BEGIN] OK buffet, food is fresh enough but it's a dive with a lot of old people and rednecks. If your on a diet, pass on this place. Nothing healthy to eat, mostly fried foods and very oily vegetables. Read it got 100 points from health department (almost a closing score)  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried again this week, gave it another shot. Same results, greasy bun, so-so fries and a relativly neutral tasting burger.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pedicure was good, polish lasted. But very unhappy with Shellac mani. Used the same brand as usual (CND) but technique was not good. Shellac is chipping and separating from my nails after only one week. Usually lasts for three weeks. I would stick to basic mani pedi services here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is ok but the service is not that great some employees are kind of rude.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food: Awesome live band for brunch. But it was hard to get enjoy the music while plucking soggy fruit off my soggy french toast. Nightlife: Fun on Friday and Saturday nights; good music and dancing. Probably will avoid the food to avoid upchucking on my friends- drinks are enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] False advertising for the wine section. The years are not accurate. Glasses for wine are very dirty. Gave us plastic utensils. Otherwise great service.  [END]
[BEGIN] I always want to like this place but they're way too expensive for the kind of restaurant they are.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used to love the rabbit here... really. I think something has changed and the menu looks like it took a detour from southwest to Italy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Try the "killer" drink has good flavor and comes in a shark cup with a plastic mermaid. Tacos were good but expensive at $12 for two.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really wanted to like. Close to home and perfect for Sunday after church. The tortillas and chips did not appear to be homemade. Queso served cold and was bland. Service was slow and inattentive. Not a terrible place just not any place I will plan to return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went in to check for vegan options. No crepes available for me. All have eggs and dairy in them. But they do gluten free.  [END]
[BEGIN] Happy hour margaritas from a mix, bartender seemed miserable. Left after one drink but food looked pretty generic and in huge portions to satisfy tourist clientele...  [END]
[BEGIN] A little too touresty for my taste. Food is so-so. And waits are too long. There are way better establishments in German Village.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wasn't a fan and almost slipped on the greasy floor. They were to busy to get good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately this location is very slow and looks dirty. You wouldn't believe you are in the Heathrow/Lake Mary.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've come here before and it was really good, but the quality was definitely gone this time around. Left all the beef shanks uneaten because I couldn't even bite into it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Average wine, average food, average service and average atmosphere- the price is above average for what is provided. Although I'm very disappointed and will not be back, it was one of the only places that didn't have an hour wait to eat, hence the 2 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] They had no forks!!! This was 2 hours before they closed. The fries were pretty good though, and the shrimp was decent.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place always smelled good so I gave it a shot. I was disappointed in everything I ordered. It was all edible but none of it was enjoyable. Service was meh as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was surprised at the small number of non food booths. Very crowded. Some of the food looked interesting but very long lines Especially with an entrance fee I was expecting more. Less interesting then a trip to Granville Island  [END]
[BEGIN] Any one with dietary restrictions beware. Good luck trying to substitute or modify any menu item.  [END]
[BEGIN] fuck - I just want a donut - I dont need a "gourmet" twist to one - just a donut. I feel like its overdone - glad they exist - i mean - sure why not - but yah - once ya had one you've had the experience. YAWNNN  [END]
[BEGIN] Crepes were super yummy! But the girl behind the counter is rude as hell! She made a mistake and scream at the customers telling them it's not her fault if they took the wrong order when the customer wasn't complaining but telling them that they got all their order correct.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big plates of food for VERY LOW PRICE... but don't expect quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very rude people. Mis-leading on shipping info but for additional$$ you can get them to tell you a straight answer on when your product will arive  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice decor. Typical small coffee house menu. Had Philly cheese steak panini. Toasted bread, melted cheese and ice cold beef. Way too salty and quite garlicky. Would try again for drink and soup perhaps but not for lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place appears to be closed. Too bad too, cuz I thought it was delicious. Oh and their answering machine isn't setup and they have no notification of closing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent comfort food, but the service is lacking. Ashley helped us and had an attitude the entire time acting like she was going out of her way to do her job.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wanted to like this place. It's a cool little spot to get a bite. Outdoor seating. Lots of people around. But the food didn't have the depth of flavor I was hoping for. Better spots to be found  [END]
[BEGIN] Here Thurs. PM with a friend. Poor waiter. Appetizer took a LONG TIME and dinner came about 5 min. Later. Food was fair at best 4 shrimp in the shrimp scampi...4 ! Probably won't return.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really have nothing nice to say Expensive, Parking is Hard, Food is lousy, bowling is a joke.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lobster roll was nothing to write home about. It had almost no flavour. It is a cabin-like place, but the bug plus is it's right on the water so the view is wonderful. Would not go again though.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is what you would expect from a Baja Fresh. The problem I had was they missed half of the ingredients. I ordered a roasted veggie burrito with chicken, which comes with beans and rice. They forgot the rice and the chicken! That being said, the veggies were good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for $1 domestics on Tuesday. Definitely have had better service. Mostly a college crowd.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was decent. The service, however, was, pardon the French...a s&#t show. Enough said, because I don't even feel like spending the energy to write this review.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here 3 times. Food quality is ok. Food quantity is impressive. Waiters are less than impressive Building itself is cool. A happy hour drink might come half full. It's a chain..what can I say.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't sit at the bar. All they do is service bar. Weak at best. Burger is great, but doesn't hold a candle to Chattanooga  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor customer service. Soup was delivered in very chipped bowls. The food itself was pretty good but not anything notable. Portions were decent other than the egg rolls which were tiny. The price for the overall experience was a touch too much.  [END]
[BEGIN] Would not recommend the clam chowder unless you like big pieces of potato with the skin on. The seafood pie was heavy on crackers and light on seafood drinks were good service was good location is excellent  [END]
[BEGIN] Shit. Trains are delayed unapologetically. NEVER on time. How can both directions be broken you ask? Well there is no way to know. Hope they fix it before it spreads cause it's been shit for years now  [END]
[BEGIN] Unimpressive. The pub was empty and service was as slow (as a turtle). t Vancouver has wayyyyy too many awesome places (Guilt and Co) for me to go back to this place. If you are walking down the street, keep walking my friend.  [END]
[BEGIN] You know what you're getting when you visit Kilwins because it's the same in every location in every state. So, they are consistently okay when it comes to their offerings of ice cream and fudge.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just dont care for pizza but my bf loves theirs so I guess its good since he ate 3/4 of the napolitian in one sitting. I liked the antipasto plate of different grilled veggies and stuffed face with their awesome dinner rolls.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is really just one-star-worthy. The reason I give it two stars is that the waiter was really friendly, and price is good....... Won't go/order again...  [END]
[BEGIN] Love Joes Crab Shack, but have to say the company has been sold to many tines in the past few years. Good items dropped from the menu. Went last night and my steam pot came to me cold. How does that happen. Pretty expensive food for it to be cold.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had an urge for flame broiler. Got there on a Thursday at 7:20pm and they were closing shop. They advertise closing at 8. There's clearly no management , the employees just wanted to get out of work.  [END]
[BEGIN] The fact that the white chocolate cake here is much-lauded is a testament to how weak the Atlanta standalone dessert game is. The kinda-snappy guy behind the counter didn't help either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went in to check out the hot food items, but they seemed to have been sitting there for a while. Didn't seem to have the same turnover as say Yaohan down the road. Decided to take a pass.  [END]
[BEGIN] Basically, the same exact merchandise as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, only about 20% more. The stuff is laid out better, and the Market Basket next door is great, so if you're doing grocery shopping anyway, it's worth checking out. Otherwise, save the trip and do your off price shopping elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mediocre at best. Austin is a very cool food city- go find a place that does what they do really well!!! This place has a menu that's all over the place (hamburgers, bolognese, enchiladas?!) and none of it is more than mediocre. Service was quite slow. Meh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dime a dozen lounge near the Douche Ranch. Meh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not what I expected when I go to a Marriott course. Not in good shape. They charge for range balls!? No beverage cart because the "tee sheet was light". Did charge less than most resort courses around here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks to a number of reasons, pricing, douchiness and others, this is no longer a hangout for me. It's still fine if you're 20 and drink vodka sodas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ok. Ginger garlic rice had a strange fishy taste. Curries were simply sweet without any other flavors. Service was very, very slow. I don't know if we will try them again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Maybe my view would change if I tried another time, but I doubt that will happen. Have only had take out. Meat is good, not great. Sandwich poorly made, skimpy portions, though bread pretty good. But the price...fugeddaboutit!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a bad place to read a book or get your work done, but the owner often kick you out or turn off the wifi before it closing time and kicks you out. The coffee also is not fresh...  [END]
[BEGIN] A sports bar!!!! Cold beer, good bar food. Apps on point but hands down the slowest wait staff in west orange county. If you plan on getting out of here in under an hour dont come  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is simply atrocious. Should be zero stars but the food is their saving grace.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ive had an ok meal here , tonight we gave it a pass because as we were about to go in ,then saw a dog on the table ? I love animals but this was someones pet on a table hanging out.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Safeway isn't awful, just meh. Pros: Wheat free section At any given time stuff is on sale, a lot of stuff Discount card just uses your phone number (I'm looking at you Save On) Hours Cons: Staff Produce Selection of juice Location Moderness  [END]
[BEGIN] Let's play a game of word association. Flavors: decent Price: okay Space: tiny Facilities: dirtyish Customers: Harvard Boba: inconsistent Rewards card: crappy program TV: ABDC/SYTYCD/UFC Service: hit-or-miss. usually miss. Boston Tea Stop: meh Overall: I want Lollicup.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was craving wings so we ordered from this place as it is conveniently right down the street. Cajun, hot and lemon pepper. Man, these are the SALTIEST wings ive ever had. Im full since i had to kill two bottled waters to rehydrate.  [END]
[BEGIN] There are several factors in my 2 star review. 1. Theater is next toy house and plays a lot of 3D movies - 5 2. No refill on a $6 cup of soda - 0 3. No recycling of any kind - 0  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh. Everything tasted the same. 3 types of curry (Beef meatballs, chicken, paneer) were all in similar tomato base. Not what I'd call good Indian food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was decent. Service was very poor. Ordered egg rolls that never came out but they appears on the bill. Benefit of doubt, they were "busy." Will not be returning anytime soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good egg roll. Egg drop soup tasted good but was so oddly thick. Cashew chicken and chicken w broccoli both tasted almost exactly like how I remember lean cuisine tasting. The quest continues.  [END]
[BEGIN] Third time here and the food needs more seasoning The new place looks amazing and the food looks very good But it has no salt or flavor The meats are ok But if you're paying that amount of money they need to seasoned better the customer service was good  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice and crispy outside but since you start eating it there no flavor inside and is not even cook right  [END]
[BEGIN] Very disappointed with our dinner tonight. Our salmon was raw inside. We weren't treated too well which seemed to be directly related to us not spending money on drinks. We won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Two stars for rude, unwelcoming staff. I appreciated the food. It was beautiful, curious, and incredibly delicious. But a $300 experience is easily ruined when every person that interacts with you makes you want to retort, "do you even want me here or should I just leave now?"  [END]
[BEGIN] So bad. I don't where to start. How can Mexican food be that bad? Service is great but everything else so bad. Casa de matador is right down the street if u want to over pay for crappy Mexican food... At least they have atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing spectacular. Tasteless. Maybe that's a bit too healthy? Even the smoothie with banana (which usually adds to the sweetness) was on the tasteless side.  [END]
[BEGIN] Waited over 45min and being from Cali I expected more from this place. Sides were very bland. Ribs were not the best. However the peach cobbler was very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly service, but the nachos were medicore, piled too high instead of wide, and very soggy and inedible as a result. The atmosphere is fun, and I would definitely come here for drinks. Food? Not so much ...  [END]
[BEGIN] Late night goooood. Reminds me of pizza places back in NYC, although slightly less seedy if you can believe that. Thin crust that is probably better when drunk than sober...but good nonetheless. 'Nuff said.  [END]
[BEGIN] After moving back to the area from Phoenix, I was super excited to see Chuy's!!! Not the same. No lobster tacos, no bike night and meh service. I won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] don't get why everyone thinks this place is so hot - atmosphere's lacking and they don't serve hard alcohol.... the people make the place, but honestly ther are fun people at better places too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered from foodler because it had a lot of decent reviews on there. I am not sure how... Pizza crust was reminiscent of a school cafeteria, spanakopita tasted weird, greek salad OK. Only reason for 2 and not 1 stars is the fairly low price tag.  [END]
[BEGIN] Second visit, food was good but OVERPICED........this is Medford with a view of the Mystic River not the Boston Waterfront. Will not be returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and atmosphere but what a disappointment. The menu is limited and the food quality is poor. Beer selections are limited to local brews, no national or intl. brands.  [END]
[BEGIN] well, its a classic, country style diner, and i can make everything on the menu at home, so why go out? but if you loooove corn beef hash like my boyfriend does, you may end up doing a happy food dance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Treacly. The beet dish, the drinks and the Brussel sprouts. More sugar than a family of 4 should consume in a month in those three items, my order. The server was sweet, too, but genuine. I left wanting potato chips for dessert, salt and vinegar. With extra salt.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not my favorite breakfast place. We love breakfast food and were very unhappy with the taste of food from this place. My husband and I tried 4 different things and none of it worked for us. Service wasn't friendly either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there with a group of friends for the restaurant week. The food was good, not great, even if the portions were small. However, despite the numerous waiters, it was difficult to have them taking care of us. Clear disappointment on that front.  [END]
[BEGIN] The tacos are great, but the patio area is constantly filthy and thus swarming with flies. Having to swat away flies after each bite is quite unappealing. Clean up the patio area and I'll increase my rating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been here for take out twice. First time the food was mediocre. Second time I just order lo mein and it was also mediocre. Finding a good chinese place is so hard to do.  [END]
[BEGIN] High-end American. High prices but unimpressive service and taste. There is better in Harvard Square (try Upstairs on the Square instead).  [END]
[BEGIN] Burger was okay, fries sucked. Smallest menu I've ever seen. Gave me a small drink with my order...didn't like that. Staff was very friendly, but why do people hype this place up so much again????  [END]
[BEGIN] First of all, they lose a star for not having a full liquor license. You can get beer ... but no hard alcohol. The food is fine - not great... but I think it's a little on the pricey side for what they offer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came here for a Halloween event for work. Chips were a bit greasy but edible. It is an ok place for small gatherings and/or student gathering. Conveniently located near the Northeastern campus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not sure I would go back. The food was forgetful and I could never identify the employes. All the wait staff wore normal street clothes. No uniforms if any kind. The nice bar is the only reason I gave it 2 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably better if you make the drive to Blaze at Disney Springs. The dough was undercooked, the red sauce was bland, and the toppings weren't fresh at all (soggy and wilted). Spend your $10 elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delivery to my place (I live about 5 blocks away) took more than an hour. Naan is soggy. Korma is luke-warm and mediocre. Price is steep. Wish I would have just walked my ass to Teji's. Won't be ordering again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered delivery. Timing was accurate; however, the pizza was almost cold by the time it got to my door. Also, I had asked for Italian sausage as one of my toppings. There were about 10 pieces. Not acceptable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food is ok and service is fine. It's really kind of dirty. Sticky tables, dirty chairs and walls. Oh yeah, I also ate an entire meal with no coffee and it wasn't even busy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is usually very slow. The food is sometimes cold by the time it reaches your table. I enjoy Tin Lizzy's and I love many of their options, but at this specific location, my experiences have been awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Depends what you order. Not a hot lobster that's for sure. Beer and steamed shellfish? Sure. Nice atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] some people prefer quantity over quality and im not to judge them ... i should just not listen to them. to my friends who suggested and took me to this place and will potentially never read this review. you guys blow.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped in for lunch after picking up stuff for work. We wanted to try the jalapeño chicken fries. Well I was disappointed with them. They was way over fried so tasted like jerky. They smelled good coming out of the bag. At least I enjoyed my whooper.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hard apple cider fritter... Yum, right? I thought so with all the bites on the periphery of said item. Unfortunately, all the middle bites contained raw dough. Pretty gross. I wish the promise of the external bites could have been fulfilled.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love hot pot and this place definitely delivered on a semi-authentic taste and fun atmosphere, however the service was terrible! Our party of four waited and waited on our waiter to come take our order, bring us water, bring us the drinks we ordered, etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] Drinks are amazing the food was not that great. Ordered a New York steak and it was probably the worse quality meat available all marbling and no meat. I would go back but only for the drinks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was okay. Nothing to brag about. Small portions. Won't go back there anytime soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mediocre at best. I really wanted this to be a good experience. We had various small plates for the dim sum brunch, and everything missed the mark.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service and the food is barely above average. The pad woon sen barely had any noodles in it. The waitress was useless. We asked to split the check when we sat down but she at the end she said she couldn't do it. Not coming back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took forever to get our bubble tea made and then it was meh at best. I'm going to guess the froyo experience is better as we were the only ones there getting the bubble tea.  [END]
[BEGIN] Correct me if I am wrong ( and I very well could be ) but the Beaverton area seems to be void of awesome sushi places. This place was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The service was quick! I would come back...but I wouldn't mind if I didn't.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really wanted to like them... but food was blah, not cooked well. Seemed too rushed. The environment was loud and chaotic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Urban Outfitters is an evil anti-gay company with poorly made clothes. http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4110344  [END]
[BEGIN] Matcha green tea boba with salted cream topping was disappointing. It tasted like coffee creamer. I usually try to drink the boba even if I don't like it but this was too much that I had to toss it. Maybe getting it without the topper would have been ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Came to try this place out, always pass by it on my way from shopping. No big deal ..... When I come to eat BBQ I have high expectations. Short on staff , won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big restaurant in South Austin offering fast Mexican fare. Restaurant can get really noisy and is often very busy. Food is just ok, service can be lacking (esp. if they're busy). Not much on atmosphere. Hmm...not much else I can say, wouldn't go back if I had a choice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location , room spacious, but the aircon/heater very noisy !.  [END]
[BEGIN] Downtown Historic Sanford is cute and has lots of cute cafes and antique shops, but I was disappointed with the Farmer's Market.....very few vendors, not a lot of variety.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hostess was terrible. Did not want to be there and obviously wanted everyone to know. Food was okay and only good thing about that restaurant was the free chips.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good, atmosphere is amazing but service is consistently bad. We have felt that they wanted customers there. It's such a strange thing!  [END]
[BEGIN] Watch out for the mice! They actually have a name for one- Jerry. Beer is good though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meager toppings, poorly made. Employees did not seem to read online order. I asked for extra sauce and light cheese. I got extra cheese and light sauce. This is not the first time, so I am unlikely to go back to this location.  [END]
[BEGIN] We went in during the farmers market, which the place was slammed. I think the drip coffee had been sitting a while, really tasted watered down or not very strong. Otherwise a nice, pleasant little spot. Just didn't enjoy my coffee flavor or strength.  [END]
[BEGIN] The beef noodle soup is very light , not very good local taste, need to improve the broth. And the price doesn't worth the taste, I would recommend to go other restaurants if you are craving for some Taiwanese or Chinese food. However, the service there is great!!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's pho but kind of on the expensive side. Spring rolls come out fast but are kinda soggy sometimes so they don't always make to order.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very disappointed! I ordered the 3 shrimp and 1 crab cake. The food was bland and the prices were high for what you got. The crab cake was the size of a silver dollar. I won't be going back to this restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] super over priced. i ordered a grilled cheese sanwich for my son and it cost over 7 bucks. its just cheese and bread!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Employees should wear gloves. They come from back room and don't wash hands. Manager was not customer service friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was pretty disappointed. Granted, we went for the lunch buffet. So maybe the full-service menu is better. But the food here was really lacking a wow-factor. It was fine, I'm not sad we went, but I won't be going again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great food. Rarely open. Inconsistent hours and when I inquired about that I was told to call before I come. I like to know when I'm craving something good that I can count on my favorite places to be open.  [END]
[BEGIN] Okay place, unexpectedly decent wine. It was empty when we went, so it felt nice to have such a huge space to ourselves. Other than that, nothing particularly remarkable.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm really sad that my mocha was not a mocha at all and I got a mouth full of espresso grounds in the middle of a meeting. For the money there has to be more than just pretty foam designs  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was ridiculously slow for lunchtime when almost no one was there. The pizza was just ok and the temperature was warm but not hot. I wouldn't recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Apparently I've been making grilled cheese sandwiches in my own house in record breaking time... for years. The place was almost empty, yet it took like almost thirty minutes for a very expensive grilled cheese sandwich. They also forgot the tomatoes.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have a Cuban place I love but it's too far away so I was excited to find zazas right around the corner. Unfortunately I still need to make the drive as the food was a major meh, not bad but not worth spending money to go out to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Order a Jasmine milk tea one time and it's was just milk with barely any jasmine tea taste in it. Gave it a second try months later and it was the same. I had to threw it away both times.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst outback steakhouse I've ever been to. They continually have bad service and the food is never cooked right. Drive a few more miles down 192 to Kissimmee and go to that outback instead.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is simply overpriced. Food is good. Service is marginal. I had a standard breakfast today for $28.64 before tip. (Coffee and OJ was $8.50 of that)  [END]
[BEGIN] Flooring installers more than 3 hours late due to the store not telling them then vinyl and boards had been delivered the day before. Fantastic installation team. Day one down and one day left. So far so good, will update after install complete.  [END]
[BEGIN] The place is really charming in the German Village. The food was so so. Nothing on the menu was authentic German food. I'm German and nothing would fly as German food back in Germany. The taste and food quality was subpar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good, authentic food, but get it to go; it's kinda sticky & dirty inside, and not in the fun way.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terribly staffed and mediocre food. Combine that with a filthy restaurant and you have a stereo typical indian restaurant. Check out biryani pot instead  [END]
[BEGIN] I had paid for the rental car ahead of time and was forced to get the insurance for it. Along with that cost there were hidden fees that caused my bill to double. This was especially frustrating since I travel on a tight budget.  [END]
[BEGIN] CLOSED!! http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/food/dishing/2008/12/circle_in_the_s.html?p1=Well_MostPop_Emailed5 ttyl ;(  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm rarely one to think a server was being rude, but the guy at the register definitely was. It wasn't even busy. Food was ok. I'll hope for better if theres a next time  [END]
[BEGIN] They started very nice, but slipped to just less than mediocre coffee shop. I haven't tried their chocolate, but a custard croissant I had yesterday wasn't fresh at all, obviously wasn't made the same day. Shame. Won't come back. Won't recommend to others.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good burgers but very expensive. Tasty onion rings. Nice location but not worth waiting in line for this food. Staff is friendly. I would go to 5 Guys for a fraction of the cost  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought we had stumbled on some kind of old-time gem based on all the newsclippings inside the entrance. Boy was I wrong. It was like a mall restaurant's Greek food. I am wondering if we hit it on an off night?  [END]
[BEGIN] Waitress wonderful personality, but service was slow. Ordered blackened mahi sandwich which had absolutely no taste the fries had more taste than fish. The other guests with me were also unhappy with their food. Nice atmosphere, but expensive for quality of food. Will not return  [END]
[BEGIN] They don't call me the Taco Mac-Daddy for nothing! Just kidding, lol! but in all seriousness my wings were cold when they came and our guac was brown. The service took really long as well. Just an all around non-optimal experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] While the amenities and flight seemed nice, this airline lost MAJOR points for putting us in the seats that didn't recline on an overnight flight, while charging us for regular cabin fare. VERY disappointing... Watch when you book and anything in row 25-26 should be avoided  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was meh...over priced. Service was ok, but nothing special. Can't help but think that Man vs. Food caused this decline in service since traffic probably just gets handed to these guys. Don't plan on coming back. Lobster roll on sweet bun...why???  [END]
[BEGIN] Queso fundido = solid, salty. Nice salsa. Enchiladas mixtas sauce has a BBQ sauce tangy quality. Three meats within very dry. Corn tortillas on flautas were soft throughout. Sauce on these also weird. Bartender solo. Overburdened.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is spacious but so chaotic. They need more staff and more procedures. I like dave n busters much better!  [END]
[BEGIN] Egg scramblers. Rubber pancakes with hard, dry, chewy blueberries. Sausage wasn't served hot. Hash browns were ok. The syrups were horrible. The server was nice and the coffee was decent. I've been to other ihops and enjoyed my breakfast. Skip this one and hit the 50's diner nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was alright...quality was OK.. I was done eating by the time my wife got her meal..... No apology.. Was just told that kitchen lost her order and they will get it in... I know things happen... But on the second visit... Service was still lacking....  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm sitting in this Krystal right now, waiting for my to-go order. It has literally been 20 minutes since I ordered and the ppl who were in front of me are still waiting. TWENTY MINUTES AND COUNTING. What could possibly explain such a long wait?!?!  [END]
[BEGIN] I must admit, I've never had a Cuban before, but my first experience with one at Papi's was underwhelming. The combination of meats had a weird foul taste. The waitress was nice enough to replace my Cuban with a talapia fish sandwich. It was also underwhelming. Bread,lettuce, cheese nothing special.  [END]
[BEGIN] The walls are too thin, so if you have a noisy neighbor, you're outta luck. Pillows are paper thin once you lay on them. Breakfast buffet is not worth the $12.99 they charge. Staff is friendly, but that's all the hotel has going for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] In town for a conference during spring break. Sheraton is usually a reputable hotel brand. Unfortunately, this location missed the mark in cleanliness and comfort. Hopefully a renovation is in the near future.  [END]
[BEGIN] Generally clean, nice staff, but there was an intense musty smell that lingered in the room and hallways. Probably would not be staying here again. The damp carpet was especially worrying, but the beds were comfortable and clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not really sure why a restaurant that presents itself as Pacific Northwest inspired cuisine serves Atlantic farm raised salmon. Wild salmon is available year around from different suppliers and is much better for you. Don't be ripped off by a $45.00 piece of cheap salmon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Waaaaayyyy over-priced. We went for New Year's Eve- $60 prix fix menu. Three TINY courses. I mean, hilariously small. If you have money overflowing your pockets, bring it on. Aside from that, nice atmosphere and cool Spanish-only wine list.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't know why so many people gave high scores here. But for me, it is definitely not wroth that. It's even not as good as Pavement Coffee. Very few tables, bad services, and the food and coffee are just very so so. You'd better go to Thinking Cup.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is OK but wow how slow can they be. Really 10 min to get my bill so j can get the help out of here!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was good but food not. Shrimp tacos had two little shrimp in each. They toasted the tortillas which made them rubbery. Also husbands blacked mahi was big but the fish was very dark inside and dry. Very little curly fries on side. Best thing to order is wings. Safe.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Blue Moon was once something At least so I am told The look of the 50s Does the food have to taste just as old?  [END]
[BEGIN] I hate so simply just pile on but what a terrible experience. You guys need to automate your systems better.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little pricey--my Aloha Bowl did not come with avocado, and the portion sizes are meager relative to the prices.  [END]
[BEGIN] After talking to quite a few people around town and reading other negative posts about this store, my suspicions are validated. The staff is the rudest you will find. I wonder what the owner of the store is like? Maybe take inventory of your staff and review customer service!!  [END]
[BEGIN] A couple issues as we sit here... Wrong price on menu so was charged extra. Service was rather unfriendly. Ordered cheese and fruit plate, no fruit. My wife pointed this out after we finished. She did not want another problem after the pricing issue. Good coffee and cheese.  [END]
[BEGIN] My first time there was great, then my second time was terrible...then I try again and again. But your food quality is so inconsistent that I gave up.  [END]
[BEGIN] Booooo...drove back to work with my order only to find that neither sandwich MEALS had the chips that go with them...paid $21.00 for this!  [END]
[BEGIN] **updated after 4th visit* Very small bowl of average haleem for $15 !! Ridiculously expensive and there is no intimation about the price either. Customer service and quality are going hand in hand but in wrong direction. Will take time for my next visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dive-y bar, not much for atmosphere, or quality of drinks, or accomodating staff. Probably only still in business due to proximity to Fenway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used to enjoy this place for a quick lunch, but it's absurd customers are forced to purchase water. This is the only restaurant in Austin I've been to that does not provide free water, especially because this place also sells alcohol.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fried. Cheap tasting. Very disappointed for the price. Sorry, Koy.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had the steamed chicken which was good. The other dishes, broccoli with garlic sauce and pork lo mein, were below average. Slow service, but that maybe due to only one wires and she was busy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very bland noodle dishes...I got the noodles with two vegetables and a protein and nothing was seasoned  [END]
[BEGIN] Lamest chinese buffet I've ever been too...seriously how can you call yourself a buffet? Better off going else where ugh  [END]
[BEGIN] the machines in the place work, so i mean i have to give it SOME credit. but i find this laundromat dirty, dingy and sketchy. not exactly where i want to be hanging out while my clothes wash. so many other options around, i opt for them before this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chill, laid back kind of Div-y bar. Staff is really nice. They have an upstairs outdoor patio and bar which is great for the summer time, when it is summer time here. I didn't get to eat here, so all i can say was drinks were good. Average price.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a hit or miss. There are times when I have a good time and other times I have not. I think in the past year I have had more misses than hits.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pour manger vite à un prix raisonnable. Salade pas trop mauvaise. Sandwich ok. Frites ok. Un fast-food quoi..  [END]
[BEGIN] I am sorry to say, it was a terrible experience. The masala was good but the chicken was dry (very very dry, like it was old). We ordered online but we were very unhappy. Not eating here again  [END]
[BEGIN] The service from waitresses in this place is terrible. They purposely avoid the tables of people of color (this has happened multiple times). I sat for over an hour without being served and counting. The only things that saves this place are the good music and talented bartenders.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was not impressed. I was pretty disgusted by the ambiance of the place, and should have left when I felt that way...but decided to give it a shot. I felt like I was inconveniencing the staff by being there. The food wasn't good.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is understaffed. One poor woman is serving at the bar, all the tables and the patio. Management shouldn't put someone in that position.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time at a hooters restaurant. Customer service was good. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. The food on the other hand wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  [END]
[BEGIN] Over priced mediocre food. Poor slow service. This is my third and last visit to this restaurant. The food was cold. One undercooked. Total rip off.  [END]
[BEGIN] You couldn't ask for a better location & view. The hotel however needs stripped to the studs if not bulldozed completely. This is the first hotel I've checked into & out of within 15 minutes.  [END]
[BEGIN] The most terrified I've ever been that a crazy person was actually going to cause real bodily harm was on the #1 bus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came last week for dinner and was extremely disappointed. The food was nowhere near good and the service was even worse. Too many other great options at this price point to visit in Orlando instead of Taverna Opa.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great until the end.... Waiting like 20 mins for our check! By the time it arrived Christ had risen... Or was that the bun dough???  [END]
[BEGIN] We had breakfast and it was pretty mediocre. I had the Chipotle polenta eggs benedict and my husband had the huevos rancheros. Both were lacking flavor and nothing special. Positives- coffee was strong and service was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're looking for a light breakfast- skip this place and go to Corner Bakery. Jamba's muffin was dry- almost inedible. It was a complete waste of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] We ordered this place all the time and it was decent until our roommate and I both had stomach problems after eating the chicken  [END]
[BEGIN] Five guys is a better burger joint. The fries were not good the Lockhart burger was not good either. The onions on the burger tasted like an onion with oil. The bun was the best part of the meal and that is not saying much.  [END]
[BEGIN] Posted star rating is inaccurate. Service was exceedingly slow on a Sunday evening due to understaffing. Our server was the only one. Tea is superb. Food is unremarkable. Stir-fried broccoli had a sour tinge to it and thus remained uneaten. Noodles taste like Americanized fast-food Chinese dishes.  [END]
[BEGIN] 1st half - the service has been forgettable. The mac and cheese has mayonnaise in it and the sangria had sprite. They can do better  [END]
[BEGIN] Went to the carts about 7 last night. I ordered a bubble tea taro flavor. The lady used about a gallon of high fructose syrup, rotting half and half, and the drink tastes like the back side of an old washing machine 5 bucks to get a tummy ache.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rolling bones is alright. Their beef is a lot better than their pork. Their spicy sauce is the one to get. Their potato salad is ok, not great or bad. Service is so/so as well. Overall it's an okay place to grab a quick, cheap bite.  [END]
[BEGIN] Music is Live and awesome food is HORRIBLE. Meat under cooked and bland, fish tastes nasty everyone at my table could barely stomach eating.  [END]
[BEGIN] I guess for Portland these donuts are good, but comparatively to bakeries in New York or Boston they really arent that impressive. Sorry, I know they have a cult following but I just wasnt impressed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Avoid this location - operations are a mess, you have to go to the top floor of a garage to get the car then drive it back out  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this Whole Foods because it is the personification of life in Boston: bitter competition with too many people for overpriced resources. Treat yourself to their parking lot - especially on the weekend - I dare you. #CursedOutByAMomInARangeRoverInFrontOfHerChild  [END]
[BEGIN] I had to pay seperate for noodle for tomyum soup and total came to 14 dollars before tax for tomyum noodle soup. Not a lot of vegetable in it either. Over priced. Will not be returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad restaurant for such a great historical building. Food mediocre at best. But it doesn't matter because of the waaaaay too many 65" tvs. Really takes away from dinner. Not a place for date night. Yuck.  [END]
[BEGIN] We finally tried Hounddogs because everyone talks about it. Not sure if they were having an off night but we were not impressed. The crust was very dense and hard to chew. The cheeseand sauce were alright but nothing stood out. No real flavors.Very bland. I have had much better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, small place. Great to get a quick lunch but you pay too much for what you get. Sandwiches are average, side dishes are ok. But I like the friendly staff very much! Go check it out!  [END]
[BEGIN] Massage was just ok. And I dislike a facility that does not have a hot tub... too many other great options in Austin.  [END]
[BEGIN] The noise level inside is so loud that my boyfriend and I had to ask each other to repeat everything we said. Sit on the patio.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was terrible. The wings were suspect. Did I mention the service was terrible?  [END]
[BEGIN] I came here twice for lunch and the food here sucks! I ordered this beef stew and it was cold, the beef was dry as if it was out of one of those Campbell soup cans This place is more of a bar than a restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] we have had uneven experiences with this chain. the pioneer place location has had good stuff both tines my wife has gone there. today though she tried the lloyd center shop. i will let the croissant she picked up for me speak for itself...  [END]
[BEGIN] +: Love me some big windows that open up during the summer! -: Everything else is forgettable so let's change restaurants and everything will be great! !: Hello indoor fireplace! ?: Second location is so awkward.  [END]
[BEGIN] I came in during the evening there were lots of open tables and lots of staff. Staff took a long time to serve the patrons and they spent most their time talking to each other. The food was mediocre, had the calamari and salad.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has dead dogs all over the floor. Also they subject you to watching the Disney Channel at loud-enough volume, and when you walk in you can almost see clouds made of nail polish remover and acrylic dust.  [END]
[BEGIN] We are not a fan! Found the food to be boring and not a great value...decor was gross for this area, maybe in Montana. Found the portions to be small too.  [END]
[BEGIN] An ok place, staff are friendly but we were placed in an area that our server had with 2 large parties. Food came out at best warm and had to be sent back. Looks nice in presentation, fair in taste and a bit too salty.  [END]
[BEGIN] $9+ sandwiches and only chips as an option for sides. Lack luster at best. I'm sure if you're drinking it is a pretty cool place to go as the bar inside is large and the indoor/outdoor bar would be nice for summer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Being cash only makes this place a hard sell. I happened by once when I did have some cash and found the donut toppings stale and tasteless. The donut part was good, but not enough for a return visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its good but the portions are tiny.. $8 for the avocado fries... 6 little pieces which amounted to literally one avocado..  [END]
[BEGIN] Make sure you tally your order yourself. Last couple of visits they have charged me $3-7 dollar extra on my bill!!! I'm sure this happens a lot and it's very unfortunate especially when they write your receipt in non English format.  [END]
[BEGIN] FOOD IS GOOD SERVICE IS POOR. Walked in and ordered food. 35 min later (and 12minutes past closing time) still no food. I ask about the food and employee asked what was ordered -_- she then leaves returns with the food. No apology, no remorse, just hands the food over.  [END]
[BEGIN] Placed an online order. In the instruction box added that we needed ketchup, utensils and a specific dressing. They delivered with none of that. One dressing for two salads too. No ketchup for fries and no forks for our salad. Thanks -.-  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place and friendly staff, but $6.50 for an iced latte? Yikes.  [END]
[BEGIN] I never got into this grease fest little place. The sandwiches were ginormous but not in that awesome way that makes you want to fight the capacity of your stomach until every last bite is gone... They are just big and greasy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Total "HYPE" and overpriced! Not terrible but many on the dishes and sides dont go together well. For example: Scallop wrapped in prosciutto with kale chips and tomatoes? Kale and tomatoes seem like after thought adds nothing. Food under seasoned!  [END]
[BEGIN] Historically a good automatic car wash, but lately the quality of the wash has gone down tremendously. The bugs on the front of my car look like I never went thru the wash when I go through it. Hope it gets better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Place is ok. Food is ok. Its pretty much a bar that serves some food. Very young crowd. Lobsters are surprisingly good- and their price can't be beat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Alright bowling but rude service and gross bathrooms. I came with my family but they just didn't seem to care about us like other bowling places  [END]
[BEGIN] Expensive - $160 to replace a battery? I went for a pre-purchase inspection and they barely told me what was going on - definitely not worth $95. I regret trying to go here before work and not just going to my regular mechanic.  [END]
[BEGIN] The decor is TIRED and the food is overpriced. It was good food, but $20+ for fish and chips? And you charge for fries and ranch? No thank you. The beer was good, I'll give them that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Expensive food, minimally presented, cooked as an afterthought. Had the burger and it had what looked like microwaveable bacon, and my GF had a salad with a rancid tasting cucumber. Also, the shake was ok, but no straw that would work with it so you could actually consume it. Disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] We arrived in the afternoon before first night. We decided to sit on the bar, but were consistently ignored by the bartenders... After waiting a few minutes, had to stand up and wave in order to get noticed. Two stars for the service.  [END]
[BEGIN] The bagel was bland, which is rare for an everything bagel. Didn't finish the coffee and washed the taste out of my mouth with a mint. Sad to give this review because I had such high hopes for this place on account of the warm atmosphere and friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was as marginal as the service. Despite a bounty of available tables, we waited for 20 minutes. The burger I got was over cooked. The pizza was adequate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pizza is pretty average. $5 for a slice is about a $1 more than other pizza places in area, so thats minus 1 star. It's got a cool name, but not much more going for it. Disappointing overall.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely chewiest Mongolian Beef and Cashew Chicken I've ever had. C. Chicken sauce also oddly cloying. General Tso's chicken was okay though. Might try soup and appetizers next time. Try Asian Taste's (less than mile away) scallion pancakes.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was formulaic, reheated and mediocre. Spanish rice appeared to have only paprika for color. The service was good on our visit, has the balance swung the other way?  [END]
[BEGIN] Usually great service and fun environment. Must have just hired a new staff, because the service is all of a sudden very poor. Short and moody. Come on Jamba Juice  [END]
[BEGIN] Atmosphere was hot and walls had old food splatter on them. The guy at the counter overcharged us and was not gracious when my husband pointed it out to him. We will not be returning. Food was good but not exceptional.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pho was good size, broth ok. Grilled pork chop rice: they did not use broken rice, flavor was't great. Grilled shrimp vermicelli was decent. Server was very attentive. Decor better than most.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food lacks flavor. It's just "meh." Table's general consensus is not worth the money.  [END]
[BEGIN] These donut sandwiches are good but they are too expensive to be on a mini donut. If you're looking to spend 10 bucks on a drink a mini donut sandwich go ahead  [END]
[BEGIN] Hmmm... Not the best but not the worst. Average at best. I'm not sure what to say other than it felt like just another knock-off with OK yogurt. Props for the great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool atmosphere and great location, but the food is just not that good! We didn't think anything we had was good or flavorful. Hope they improve because that's the only thing holding back this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Someone needs to come and fix this place up. It's in such poor condition. There is water leaking everywhere. The staff was not very helpful. I gave it two stars because the buses come by every 15 minutes and literatly right in front of the station.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything looks good but it's dry: the bread the beef the fries. I asked for a to go bag and the guy just took the lining of the tray and stuffed it in a fry box so the sauces spread over everything rather than just boxing the burger and fries  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok food, good service, nice TVs. I dunno I can't explain it, the atmosphere just kinda sucks....my boy Huy put it best "Its like the Chuck E. Cheese of sports bars"  [END]
[BEGIN] Service: crappy Fries: stale and salty Burger: ok but not worth $7 I spent $28 for 3 types of burgers and 3 types of fries. Fries came out stale and salty as hell and the burgers were good but not for what they cost. I'll take farm burger, thx.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would suggest only pancakes here. Other items were average. Not worth the 45 mins wait time.  [END]
[BEGIN] When you come in for the 2nd part of an oil consumption test, all they have to do is check the oil level, and you STILL have to wait 1 hour?!? Really?! Very bad communication with the customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Although I enjoy the atmosphere and dessert choices here, I have been so consistently dissapointed by the quality of the food that I do not go anymore. It just doesn't taste all that good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Another iconic eating establishment myth debunked. Not worth rhe hype. Neither one of the vegan or cheese pizzas did anything for us. Vegan was bland. Cheese was non descript. If you like thin crust it gets another star. I preferred mine w/o fixins.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not impressed. They have the overly Americanized style of Chinese food that I despise. The sauces were thick and gravy-like. Nothing had much flavor. There are much better Asian restaurants on Hawthorne (Fujin / Pho Green Papaya, Thanh Thao, Veggie Thai)  [END]
[BEGIN] Was a big fan of the taste but not the biggest fan to the aftermath. Was sick for 2 days after eating here and I won't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was okay, but overpriced. Plus, I got charged extra for carne asada on the quesadilla, even though the menu does not indicate that it is extra.  [END]
[BEGIN] Smash fries were swimming in oil. My burger was dripping oily mayo. The overall taste of the Georgia was pretty disappointing. They did use good ingredients, hence the two stars, but everything started to go downhill from there. After having Smashburger in other states, this is no bueno.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kate the bartender ruined his whole experience. It was good until I ordered a drink from her and she treated me with such disgust for no reason! Won't be back thanks to Kate!  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor ambience. Very flimsy furniture in a cramped room. Our furniture moved and shook each time someone at the adjacent table moved. Food was average.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want some authentic Japanese food, don't come here! All of their dishes are not anything near authentic. On the up side, the service is great! It's the only reason this place gets a two stars from me. Overpriced and unauthentic.. Not recommending and will not come back!  [END]
[BEGIN] 1. Great view, especially late in the afternoon or at sunset. 2. Food was overpriced, and taste/quality were entirely underwhelming. 3. Service was OK, but not attentive, especially when not very busy. 4. Went on a Living Social coupon - without that discount, I might have rated it even lower.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ambience and decor are nice. Food is below average. Semi soggy tempura. Over-cooked filet mignon. Average service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced. My scallops were overdone, the tortellini was undercooked and the dessert was bitter. Great presentation and ambience but short on flavor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad food. Service was fine but food heavily negated it. Many other better restaurants around Boston to go to. Basically was a high-end Olive Garden  [END]
[BEGIN] Very disappointed in the menu changes. Use to be one of my most favorite restaurants in town. Seems like they are cutting costs rather than providing great food. Not sure that we will be coming back anytime soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] The ribeye was poor quality meat, the mushrooms and onions had no flavor, the mixed vegetables also had no flavor. The service was good. Fair price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good shop. Use to go in quite a bit....then I found they are owned by William David Lindholm. Google the name....A RAT !!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This mall is a ghost town. Lot of shut down spaces and mostly one-off stores. The department stores and Foot Locker/House of Hoops the only things keeping this place above water. Needs a complete overhaul/remodel and probably new ownership/management.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love to support local minorities but I must say....the food was good but I found a hair in my food which is cool, I can git over it, but when u offer no kind of compensation nor compassion, I take offense.  [END]
[BEGIN] Note: They changed their value Chicken Sandwich. It tastes more like pastrami, I could not eat it. Sorry.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little disappointing. The sales woman reeked of alcohol.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went to the Barking Crab this summer with some family from out of town who saw the restaurant on food network. While the food was good, it was grossly overpriced to have picnic table-seating, where they plop you next to other parties. I won't be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bang for your buck: 6.5/10 Quality: 8/10 Service: 4/10 Ambiance/Location: 4/10 Overall: 6/10  [END]
[BEGIN] Really understaffed making it hard for our waitress to serve us in timely manner and the food was not good for the high price... we only ate it because we were starving after waiting so long for it! Can not recommend unfortunately.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything is premised and repetitive after you go more then five time you have practically had it all. There are are places close by that make fresh made to order lunch and coffee. Staff is very friendly. This is in my building and I choose to go down the block.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was pretty crappy and service was very very slow on a night that was ~75% capacity. I understand some nights are busy but you gotta come by my table more often than every 30 mins.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced and small servings for Pho. This restaurant may satisfy the taste of tourists and those inexperienced with Vietnamese food. Another Steveston disappointment. There are many other options to satisfy my Pho cravings throughout Richmond.  [END]
[BEGIN] Famous for the sandwiches, which are very good. The secret is the bread. Yummy. That said, the long line ups and the latest price hike have taken this place of my recommended list. Food is good, but not good enough to compensate for the wait and the cost.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is alright but they charge way too much for what you get. The sushi is not even fresh and the atmosphere and service is sort of awkward.  [END]
[BEGIN] there very slow in there dirty as well foundca hair in the breadsticks last time we went dont think we will go back the one in medford square much better  [END]
[BEGIN] Stella is okay -- I like brunch best -- but the dinner options are over-priced and the menu has not changed in over a year. It feels really tired!  [END]
[BEGIN] chips were stale and wet. margs strong. food dece. and cheap. margs expensive. if u want fajitas, go to the border cafe! kristas plankin!  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad experience today. I go there often and usually have good service. The person today was very rude and argumentative. She rushed and did a bad job. My polish looks horrible. Wonder if I should go back. I filed complaint with Better Business Bureau. Plan to go forward.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was decent, not worth the 20 minute wait, and then another HOUR wait for food. Overrated, and a waste of time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Been a member for over a year. Tried to ignore my friend's comments about how dirty or underservice this gym is. Locker rooms always smell, however, what lead me to write a review is the fact that the water fountain has been broken for over 3 weeks. Come on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality of food and service very disappointing. Workers never smiled, looked at you or even acted like they cared. I ask for burger to be cooked med. he said they are too thin to cook to a degree of doneness. WHAT!!!!! I'VE BEEN THERE TWICE MY FIRST AND LAST TIME.  [END]
[BEGIN] Asked for a blueberry muffin. Got a raspberry muffin. An honest mistake, but the muffin also had a big chunk of what looked like either an apple or a pear in it. Not sure as I didn't want to eat whatever it was.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very disorganized for a Starbucks. Used to a level of precision in the service at Starbucks that was seriously lacking at this location. Product quality was as expected but service was lackluster and significantly worse than I am used to here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Shoddy service. Merely decent food. In a neighborhood of great restaurants, why would you eat here?  [END]
[BEGIN] I have noticed a trend of food consistently coming out of the kitchen terribly over seasoned. Dear Greet Street; please keep trying because I want to love you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prices are good, good location. The food is just ALRIGHT. Half way through my passable burger, I found a piece of metal in my cheeseburger. Won't be ordering from this place again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is usually decent but if there is a problem or they get your order incorrect don't expect them to fix it or adjust your bill. Tourist trap. Lots of street trash around back. Not clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been back to Jade Bistro several times since I wrote my review in 2012. I won't be going again. The quality of the food has declined giving "bland" a whole new meaning. Every dish I've had tastes the same. Oh, and did I say bland?  [END]
[BEGIN] Large dinner salad with added ($8 steak) and this is how it came. I have gotten this several times but this is a joke.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a fan of this location and the bathrooms are nasty and the service was slow. It just wasn't the quality and standard I'm used to with tin drum.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food at this restaurant used to be very nice and delicious, but the quality and taste of food are getting worse now compared to the the time when they first opened. I would not go there anymore....  [END]
[BEGIN] Took my son to get a fade with long on top. The guy cut his little sideburn in a weird round type cut. They just don't know how to do fades or work on "edges" if you need a fade, go elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was not terribly impressed with this place after reading all the good reviews. It was nearly empty the night I went. Some of the toppings are strange, like corn kernels. I did not find their ingredients particularly fresh either. And the rice was over cooked.  [END]
[BEGIN] Coffee was blah. They seem more focused on making dessert like drinks vs. any true coffee. A friend got one of their specialty new ground mocha that had no espresso flavor, only sugar. Staff was rude and impatient.  [END]
[BEGIN] OMG. The lobster is horrible. They used to do a good job but now the lobster not even fresh. So disappointed  [END]
[BEGIN] Although the food was good, it was WAY over price--27$ for piece of fish, green beans, and potatoes. And the house musician was god-awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lots of choices and specials Theres interesting yet scary things in the menu, like lychee and peach pork... There's too much sauce for little food  [END]
[BEGIN] Was not as impressed as what was being offered( soft serve ice cream ) still like their other product served in the Salt and Straw  [END]
[BEGIN] Waited 10 minutes before server acknowledged us. Ordered queso which was decent. Got the bill before our entree after waiting 15 minutes for it and entree had cheese on it when we asked for it on the side. OK tacos. Won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bar has gone downhill. Service was slow tonight. Not a big crowd. Ordered Mexican martinis. Sent both back. They were made with a premix that was awful. The bar needs to go back to "pouring" a real drink.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got food poisoning from the food I ate there yesterday. Don't eat their gross over-priced food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ate here for my brother's birthday. Food was awful. Had the bolognese like the reviews recommended it was terrible. The caesar salad was pretty bad too. The calamari was good and the pizza was nothing special. Ambiance and service were nice though. Overall I would never go back here.  [END]
[BEGIN] They did not have a lot of variety and i felt the prices were high for a thrift store. You can get bran new clothes for what they are charging. Not worth going.  [END]
[BEGIN] how the hell this place stays in business is beyond me. out of all of the places in the neighborhood, this one is a headscratcher. While the food isn't awful, it's mediocre, and WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY overpriced. Don't get it. I really don't. Do you?  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is barely average at best. Service was pretty mediocre and prices were way off the charts for what was being served. Absolutely not worth the price of admission. Try Scutra instead if you are set on staying in Arlington.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good but it's way too loud and the wait is often way too long. :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't know whats so good about this place. It has like 4 tables maybe? Had to sit with some strangers, and food wasn't great. It was a lot for the price though, so if you want quantity over quality, this is your place to go to for cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was just mediocre. I tried them twice and I hate to say it, but that pizza sitting in the rotating warmer at the gas station might be better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very disorganized , poor service Not enough servers Servers are sassy Would not come back unless forced  [END]
[BEGIN] The food was really good but my spicy chicken wings... SOME WERE NOT FULLY COOKED!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good food but terrible service. Don't clean the tables, used dishes everywhere. Asked twice for cleanup and was told we will clean up soon, never happened. If you are understaffed, fix it. It's most unappetizing to see used plates all around you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is mediocre at best. Service was horrible (20 minute wait for drinks). Definitely not worth the price considering all the great places in the North End.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beware of the sizing! Much smaller than expected... Ted wouldn't be cool with his name on that baby bison burger!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hour and a half wait , okay food If you want to see dogs and eat , might I suggest the vending machine at the Humane society  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not a good example of a Days Inn. Very uncomfortable bed, small room, fan in bathroom run by an airplane motor and linked to light. Bed was the worst! Room not as clean as we would like. Never again!  [END]
[BEGIN] I should add that I think the Brunswick stew that I mentioned in my review below must have been a fluke, because I have not seen it again at Whole Foods anywhere. Oh, well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is good but not amazing by any means. When they mess up your order they get upset and blame you. NOT COOL. Maybe listen to your customers when they order.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ultimately the food was good. We enjoyed the live music too. But it was not worth the wait, service and price. The decor seems outdated and overall our experience was just soured by how slow it was there!  [END]
[BEGIN] the central square cvs is dirty, disorganized, and employs sketchy security guards who hit on customers. that said, i miss cvs--the name cvs, that is--in this land of walgreens, longs, and rite-aid, we could use a little 'care value service' if it came down to that...  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been sitting in the drive through 10 minutes and literally not one vehicle has moved... I'm behind one car. Ughhh  [END]
[BEGIN] Prepare to wait almost an hour for your food and a very loud atmosphere. Service wasnt good but the food is amazing! (Unless your on a diet)  [END]
[BEGIN] Both Zip lines were broken when we went; a fact they kept to themselves until after we had paid and gotten harnessed in. and they don't make it clear at all that there is a 60 minute time limit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ate lunch here yesterday with a group of 8. It took over 2 hours! Wait staff very slow and forgetful. Food was so-so.  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to love this place. Then the carb to protein portion got to me so I stopped for a while. I craved the green curry chicken today so I decided to give it a shot. I got a couple pieces of chicken and the rice was under-done. Very disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well I must say this was an interesting experience. The service was great. But the food! Well the medium NY Strip steak was tough, grits of shrimp and grits where milky, chocolate Martin tasted spoiled, the Creme Brielle was burnt, but the water was so good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cool building and design, decent service mid-day, but food quality and tap selections well below average. Will not return unless forced to.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Location Drip coffee is too weak Music is too loud 50/50 on friendly staff Open 24 hours  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was just ok. Way outdated and old. The fire alarm went off at 4 am and the people at the front desk had no idea what to do. Stay somewhere else  [END]
[BEGIN] Although the place looks nice, the service is not so nice. the waitress was kind of reluctant to serve, and the food was tasteless.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good: Lettuce Wraps. Bad: Service, Singapore St Noodles. Everything tasted too sour!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The service here left much to be desired. There was only one person working the entire restaurant (others cooking in the back) when we came for a late brunch around 1:30pm. Unfortunately, that one person was not at all friendly or helpful. We were not impressed by the food either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely not the best philly I've had. Their sandwiches are missing quality steak meat. They've got a good location, but have to learn to make a great cheesesteak. Weeyums here I come.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not completely terrible but not authentic flavors. Some items tasted microwaved (they had that rubber feel) and the empanada had a bitter taste, like when you re-use oil to deep fry something. The place is cute the servers are pleasant. $50+ for 3 entrees. Bottom line, I won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Long wait (50 minutes) for mediocre, sloppy looking sushi. Although the server was polite, it would have been considerate for them to warn customers how long the wait would be.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the worst locations ever. They never have any fruit how are customers supposed to get icecream made that's pretty pathetic oh well I better stop going to this location I have family members who own marble slab in Toronto. IT IS A REQUIREMENT..  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent breakfast tacos and selection of grocery products. Probably the most UNFRIENDLY staff in the city though. I've been here a few times and its been that way every time. The tacos and coffee have me reluctantly going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] They forget the salmon on my to go salad every single time!!!!!!!!! But certainly still charge me for it. Argh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was good. Food was definitely lacking. Garlic knots were served without a dipping / red sauce. Pasta tasted like they went across the street to publix and bought a box of store brand and the sauce was extremely watery and bland I won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place can accommodate large groups. The service needs help and the food is decent. The lunch entrees aren't cheap which is likely why the restaurant is never full.  [END]
[BEGIN] The food and service were very good. But 4 Corner Tavern has no character at all! Boring, empty and almost a abandoned feeling! Not really a Tavern feeling or a place to go and have drinks and fun with friends. SORRY  [END]
[BEGIN] If you plan on moving in don't let em put you in an apartment facing the Forsyth Fabric parking lot - you won't get any sleep! The bros gather there and party all night...loud, real loud!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced and unfortunately, not very yummy. Good thing about this place is that they won't kick you out. We each ordered something and stayed to play cards.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took forever to order a drink only to find out that the bar "ran out of red wine." Pretty ridiculous. Also, bring back the large Jenga board.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was bland. Atmosphere was dingy and old. Very dark. Smelled like a cross between BO and mold. Their bragging rights about being around for so long are no longer any good because they need a make over!  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't get me wrong, the pizza is good. There are just NO gluten-free pizza, pasta options. If you cannot have gluten then I do not recommend going there. The local pizza shops would be much better. You can eat a salad and maybe one appetizer if you eat there.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only good thing about this place is the somewhat decent beer selection. My turkey tips were cold and dry and some pieces were burnt. Green beans were wilted. Pretty sad. I've had this entree in Lowell and Burlington locations and it was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good beer. Shitty food. Cover charge. A plethora of college dudes in white hats and North Face fleece vests (or equivalent). Cover bands. Lots and lots of cover bands. Overrated.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've had better. The tortillas are not fresh. I had the Picadillo and the al pastor. The al pastor is WAY too spicy-- and I can handle spicy food. The Picadillo had a gritty consistency. Taco Bell tacos are better. I would not recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] You pay extra for parking. $10.00. The shower was very short and had to stoop. The bathroom only had a half a roll of TP and no backup... Bed was comfortable. Room clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a very disappointing experience. Ordered three salads to go. The lettuce wasn't fresh and the chicken sharwma was dry and the portion of meat.was small. Previous visits where much better. Hopefully this is a one time aberration.  [END]
[BEGIN] First impressions here not really wow at all... chow mein don't feel like it was cooked right portions are very small felt like cattle coming in and out. .. I have to ask for your cookie..lol  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent food. Insanely attentive service. Unfortunately it gets way too loud inside. Deafening. We couldn't carry on a conversation and we left with a headache. And we are not senior citizens! They really need to address the noise level before we would recommend the place to others.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good prices, but rude pharmacist. I'd rather go to another part of town or Fred Meyers. I've noticed this poor treatment several times since the store opened.  [END]
[BEGIN] Literally the worst service I've ever experienced, sure they were busy but none of the employees were even polite and the food was sub par  [END]
[BEGIN] Having an appointment here is useless. I waited 25 minutes past my appointment today and this is not the first time this has happened. Additionally, people without appointments or who arrived after me were taken care of first. A manicure and pedicure took well over 2 hours as a result.  [END]
[BEGIN] Currently staying at this hotel. Although the rooms are nice, the staff seems very confused with multiple miscommunications. There are several restaurants in this hotel but they are never open. It's just very strange that such a nice place is this badly put together.  [END]
[BEGIN] Taking 30-40 minutes every single time to deliver a sandwich right down the street is not even close to "freaky fast".  [END]
[BEGIN] The decor hasn't been updated since 1992. The food is overpriced for what it is. Don't recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok service, if you're not from here. Please makes sure to bring Canadian dollars they would not take us dollars I didn't want to use my card because my bank charges allot.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are looking for a place in nice area of town with loud MTV music playing, a very traditional menu and not-so-exciting food then this restaurant is for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location, slow service and not so great wings. House ipa is good but not great. Tge please is too big and managements is MIA :( not recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] We didn't have a bad experience, it just wasn't a good one. The ingredients were slightly old, the food was spicy but bland, the wantons were doughy, the tofu was slimy, etc. There wasn't any one thing that stood out as awful, but I definitely won't be going back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been here twice and still think it's OK. The first time with my sister from Virginia. The second time with my significant other and a business colleague of his. Forgot what I ordered each time. I guess that means it was a forgettable experience, palate-wise!  [END]
[BEGIN] Our server Chris was excellent except no where to be found when we paid the bill (thank you?). Sorry to say I would not rush back for a meal everything was so so except the drinks. Sorry Tuscan Kitchen won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Coffee is so bad. Period. You're basically going to get coffee flavored water in a grimy, unsanitary setting. Nothing about this place is appealing. I was desperate for coffee so came here but will never be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] when you do a fitting I'd only hope you wouldn't screw up the sizing, but these guys did. the pants were baggy and so was the vest...The only thing that was OK was the Coat...If I had to do it again I'd buy a suit.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stopped getting the dumplings because they are stale by lunchtime lately. Are they day-old? One woman who works there is so spastic that she can't listen to an order. Don't go there with the slightest special instruction and check your food before you leave.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there to get a latte & croissant today.Coffee was very weak & the croissant was stale. What's going on ? This place used to excellent. The new staff seem a bit out to lunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was ok. Amount of meat on my roast beef sandwich was very weak. Cool building though.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was disappointing overall. The view and happy hour was great, but the food was disappointing. I had the Cesar salad and the fish tacos, both were bad enough that I'll never go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was alright, i had the Vietnamese rice but it was just regular rice not broken rice. Beef and pork seemed to be over cooked a bit. The interior looks nice and clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] After waiting over thirty minutes and watching people who arrived after us but seated before us, I learned they failed to add our name to the list.... When confronted, they laughed it off but immediately seated us... Guess they found room for us???  [END]
[BEGIN] Update on review is that I asked them to take everything to the top of the house - one room and they suddenly were able to put the items in the rooms they belonged in.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is so cute. Like other yelpers have mentioned, it was empty. The food was bland and the drinks were horrible. The staff however was very friendly which constitutes the two stars. Probably would never go back. Great space & service, but everything could use a boost!  [END]
[BEGIN] Save yourself some time and effort- just found out- she is only booking existing clients. Maybe time to hire another person. Wow It seems like the massage industry in Portland is booming!  [END]
[BEGIN] Let's see... $13 for a basic burger. Check. Pretty much empty inside. Check. Pretty and fairly attentive bartender (where we sat). Check. Well, that about sums it up. I won't likely be back, the options at Legacy Place, right across route 1, are simply too tempting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Takeout curbside went well, but the rice and beans portion was awful. Rice was hard and dry and barely there. Could not eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am definitely never coming back here. They treat people here like crap. They make up bogus cover charges and treat people in line as though they are animals. This place is highway robbery!!!!!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] bopuke-o the burritos give me major acid...i think it is due to undercooked beans...eaten there maybe 10 times - same result every time.....but...the mango smoothy is great - earning them an extra star!  [END]
[BEGIN] Standard fare. Some items are a hit while others aren't... most are average. More than once I've encountered a chipped glass or dirty silverware. Not really a destination for a foodie, IMO.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the food but we are here now and have waited 50 minutes and still no food! It's a Monday and I have never experienced such slow kitchen service. I won't be back anytime soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not impressed. Taste is ok ( I had lamb tibs), and price is kind of high ($12), and the waitress got several of our bills wrong (all over-charged).  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced. Way too loud. Our server wasn't very friendly. However there is a bar tender who's her the top sweet. Stunning flower arrangements.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mears sent in another bus an hour later with a pretty funny driver to make up for it. Still all and all a poor experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] good portion of meat but not enough noodles and a bit too salty  [END]
[BEGIN] Walking in. It's low light, a little dingy. The servers are nice, they took a while on something and comped us a beer. The food was much better than I was expecting. I really wasn't expecting much. It's not the type of atmoshphere I'm into, so I won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm a big fan of cheap asian food. I'm not a fan of this place. Pad Thai was not spicy at all. Fried rice was boring. Even the spring rolls are kind of subpar. Meh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very dated. Nice location. Would recommend staying on the premises at WDW. Not a great hotel, staff was nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced. Slow. raw home fries every freakin time. omelets are not that big. pretty good french toast. A couple of the waitresses are nice once they get to know you. Owners are low on social skills.  [END]
[BEGIN] Besides for location, ot really isn't worth the time or money. Charging $2 extra for g free pasta is ignorant. If you are stuck in the area and need something close, it is ok, but plan ahead and eat somewhere good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Please turn your music down at the bar. Came and left after a beer on a Friday night, can't hear the person next to you at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went specifically for Italian beef. Served on a toasted roll - not traditional. Beef was not sliced thin enough and there wasn't very much of it. Not a whole lot of flavor. Did not meet Chicago standards, disappointed. And the fries were some battered garbage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Made an appointment, the front desk attendants were nice but unnatentive and it was 15 minutes before I could even check in. Then waited another 35 minutes to see a doctor...there's no point in making an appointment...didn't save me any time.  [END]
[BEGIN] The items that are for sale were extremely high, you can get it brand new for the same price. I didn't find any good deals at this Goodwill.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, well-presented salad, and delicious french fries. I just wish Kitchen offered more vegan options, like so many other restaurants do these days! Maybe a tofu scramble or vegetarian sausage for breakfast?  [END]
