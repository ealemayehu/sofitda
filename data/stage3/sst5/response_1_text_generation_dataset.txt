[BEGIN] the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries  [END]
[BEGIN] the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run  [END]

[BEGIN] the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...  [END]
[BEGIN] wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own  [END]
[BEGIN] lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded  [END]

[BEGIN] more trifle than triumph  [END]
[BEGIN] it 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before  [END]
[BEGIN] murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote  [END]
[BEGIN] the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing  [END]
[BEGIN] this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream  [END]
[BEGIN] when the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails  [END]
[BEGIN] klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed  [END]

[BEGIN] there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer  [END]
[BEGIN] possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio  [END]
[BEGIN] time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable  [END]
[BEGIN] what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark -lrb- dark green , to be exact -rrb- , sour , bloody and mean  [END]
[BEGIN] it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs  [END]
[BEGIN] there 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes  [END]
[BEGIN] the movie does n't generate a lot of energy  [END]
[BEGIN] it squanders chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt !  [END]
[BEGIN] pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two  [END]
[BEGIN] a singularly off-putting romantic comedy  [END]
[BEGIN] nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here  [END]
[BEGIN] kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious  [END]
[BEGIN] like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six  [END]
[BEGIN] the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil  [END]
[BEGIN] with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd  [END]
[BEGIN] despite juliet stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs  [END]
[BEGIN] what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time  [END]
[BEGIN] wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime  [END]
[BEGIN] the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie  [END]

[BEGIN] it just does n't have anything really interesting to say  [END]
[BEGIN] while you have to admit it 's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out `` when you 're a jet , you 're a jet all the way , '' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` tonight ''  [END]
[BEGIN] a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the bollywood films  [END]
[BEGIN] a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita  [END]
[BEGIN] how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?  [END]
[BEGIN] sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip  [END]
[BEGIN] with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity  [END]
[BEGIN] lisa rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension  [END]
[BEGIN] this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell  [END]
[BEGIN] maybe leblanc thought , `` hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse ''  [END]
[BEGIN] full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life  [END]

[BEGIN] russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers 's title-bout features  [END]
[BEGIN] the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she 's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard  [END]

[BEGIN] time out is as serious as a pink slip  [END]
[BEGIN] director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself  [END]
[BEGIN] american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone  [END]
[BEGIN] the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue  [END]
[BEGIN] if you recognize zeus -lrb- the dog from snatch -rrb- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one  [END]
[BEGIN] parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place  [END]
[BEGIN] woefully pretentious  [END]
[BEGIN] mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money  [END]
[BEGIN] godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks  [END]
[BEGIN] no surprises  [END]

[BEGIN] just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay  [END]
[BEGIN] instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?  [END]
[BEGIN] not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches  [END]
[BEGIN] the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters -- but it 's smooth and professional  [END]
[BEGIN] its one-sidedness ... flirts with propaganda  [END]
[BEGIN] ` synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree  [END]
[BEGIN] too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash  [END]
[BEGIN] the château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera  [END]

[BEGIN] it 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting  [END]
[BEGIN] things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content  [END]
