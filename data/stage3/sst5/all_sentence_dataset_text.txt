1 a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films 
2 apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap 
3 they presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes 
4 the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments 
5 this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce 
6 um , no. 
7 jonathan parker 's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films 
8 campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful 
9 a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down 
10 béart and berling are both superb , while huppert ... is magnificent 
11 a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium 
12 the film is strictly routine 
13 a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world 
14 the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore 's the scarlet letter 
15 for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -lrb- sci-fi -rrb- rehash 
16 this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force 
17 may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done 
18 there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane 
19 if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special 
20 as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr. lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline 
21 final verdict : you 've seen it all before 
22 blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling 
23 you ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone 
24 a slick , engrossing melodrama 
25 a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man 's quest to find an old flame 
26 eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso 's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable 
27 will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic 
28 one of -lrb- jaglom 's -rrb- better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love 
29 lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience 
30 the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be 
31 the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once ... a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller 
32 too bad 
33 a strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man 
34 gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance 
35 you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that 
36 a well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility 
37 analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film 's successes , with a few new swings thrown in 
38 there 's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings 
39 a fun ride 
40 what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film 's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song 
41 an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch 
42 ` what 's the russian word for wow !? ' 
43 you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible 
44 many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short 
45 otto-sallies has a real filmmaker 's eye 
46 lurid and less than lucid work 
47 a portrait of an artist 
48 once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle 
49 with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families 
50 many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , -lrb- yet -rrb- are worthwhile 
51 with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake 
52 i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay 
53 overall , cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone 
54 you live the mood rather than savour the story 
55 the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled 
56 here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably 
57 some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves 
58 it 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary 
59 while american adobo has its heart -lrb- and its palate -rrb- in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even 
60 unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck 
61 and it 's a lousy one at that 
62 it 's not too fast and not too slow 
63 it 's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space 
64 it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients 
65 compellingly watchable 
66 despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire 
67 he may have meant the internet short saving ryan 's privates 
68 though jackson does n't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape , it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees 
69 not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again 
70 it 's worth taking the kids to 
71 the movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength 
72 without shakespeare 's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish 
73 dense , exhilarating documentary 
74 ... feels as if -lrb- there 's -rrb- a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something 
75 poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures 
76 a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie 
77 methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , secret ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain 
78 this is amusing for about three minutes 
79 though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors 
80 superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen 
81 a metaphor for a modern-day urban china searching for its identity 
82 it 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can 
83 the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms. ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting 
84 admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form 
85 not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh 
86 ' 
87 an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental 
88 becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't 
89 at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best 
90 could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? 
91 this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it 
92 more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine 
93 cho 's timing is priceless 
94 criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama 
95 there 's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers 
96 what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish 
97 greengrass -lrb- working from don mullan 's script -rrb- forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation 
98 nicholson 's understated performance is wonderful 
99 the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story 
100 it 's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson 's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue 
101 jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder 
102 jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth ca n't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting 
103 ... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes 
104 over and over again 
105 nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure 
106 this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better 
107 ... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself 
108 the drama discloses almost nothing 
109 a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis 
110 isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol 's most intense psychological mysteries 
111 but ` why ? ' 
112 like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest 
113 perhaps the best sports movie i 've ever seen 
114 this pathetic junk is barely an hour long 
115 ou 've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane 
116 this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life 
117 playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity ... bisset is both convincing and radiant 
118 the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun 
119 it treats ana 's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film 
120 leigh makes these lives count 
121 igby goes down is one of those movies 
122 ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints 
123 the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring 
124 i could n't recommend this film more 
125 an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn 
126 you can taste it , but there 's no fizz 
127 a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either 
128 a moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places , unexamined lives 
129 it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing 
130 why ? 
131 and that is where ararat went astray 
132 vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role 
133 clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up 
134 sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff 
135 it 's mostly a pleasure to watch 
136 a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be 
137 its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing 
138 a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces 
139 i did n't find much fascination in the swinging 
140 this is no `` waterboy ! '' 
141 but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment 
142 a witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking 
143 baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within 
144 the name says it all 
145 the kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of 
146 it 's been 20 years since 48 hrs 
147 uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year 
148 the irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts 
149 it 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni 
150 he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither 
151 funny , though 
152 by turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic 
153 the re-release of ron howard 's apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages 
154 unofficially , national lampoon 's van wilder is son of animal house 
155 it never is , not fully 
156 it 's just a little too self-satisfied 
157 i 've never seen -lrb- a remake -rrb- do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra 's classic ... 
158 those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi 
159 post 9\/11 the philosophical message of `` personal freedom first '' might not be as palatable as intended 
160 mr. deeds is , as comedy goes , very silly -- and in the best way 
161 this amiable picture talks tough , but it 's all bluster -- in the end it 's as sweet as greenfingers ... 
162 my little eye is the best little `` horror '' movie i 've seen in years 
163 the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents 
164 it may ... work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns 
165 suffers from a flat script and a low budget 
166 the movie is well done , but slow 
167 the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel 
168 the master of disguise is awful 
169 it 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones 
170 same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse 
171 the film is one of the year 's best 
172 that the chuck norris `` grenade gag '' occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is 
173 frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for 
174 one of the year 's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces 
175 the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why 
176 the three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling 
177 `` looking for leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something 
178 the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters 
179 ... one resurrection too many 
180 oh , look at that clever angle ! 
181 warmed-over hash 
182 no , i hate it 
183 for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them 
184 the casting of raymond j. barry as the ` assassin ' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger 's impressive fake documentary 
185 the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables 
186 the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed 
187 a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending 
188 an hour and a half of joyful solo performance 
189 contrived pastiche of caper clichés 
190 a triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light 
191 steven soderbergh 's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life 
192 kinnear 's performance is a career-defining revelation 
193 not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made 
194 the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you wo n't be disappointed 
195 if you 're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver 's license , you should be able to find better entertainment 
196 for devotees of french cinema , safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it 's like dying and going to celluloid heaven 
197 scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle 
198 really dumb but occasionally really funny 
199 this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama 
200 by the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular 
201 ... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project ! 
202 largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers 
203 the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals 
204 essentially `` fatal attraction '' remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 
205 it does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events 
206 ` opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down 
207 even though it 's common knowledge that park and his founding partner , yong kang , lost kozmo in the end , you ca n't help but get caught up in the thrill of the company 's astonishing growth 
208 lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings 
209 every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you 're on the edge of your seat 
210 the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation 
211 coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings 
212 as pedestrian as they come 
213 why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? 
214 sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness 
215 that 's fun for kids of any age 
216 raimi and his team could n't have done any better in bringing the story of spider-man to the big screen 
217 a colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters 
218 frank mcklusky c.i. is that movie ! 
219 a rip-roaring comedy action fest that 'll put hairs on your chest 
220 the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable 
221 the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones 
222 chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe 
223 the cast ... keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired 
224 plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike ... a cult hero 
225 -lrb- the kid 's -rrb- just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow 
226 contradicts everything we 've come to expect from movies nowadays 
227 there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out 
228 the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock 's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal 
229 the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre 
230 the kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away 
231 and a very rainy day 
232 with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work 
233 the film has a childlike quality about it 
234 a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film 
235 gone are the flamboyant mannerisms that are the trademark of several of his performances 
236 funny , somber , absurd , and , finally , achingly sad , bartleby is a fine , understated piece of filmmaking 
237 every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be 
238 unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either 
239 schrader examines crane 's decline with unblinking candor 
240 count on his movie to work at the back of your neck long after you leave the theater 
241 that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin 's film serves up with style and empathy 
242 you would n't want to live waydowntown , but it is a hilarious place to visit 
243 the bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they 've told a nice little story in the process 
244 there 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue 
245 translation : ` we do n't need to try very hard 
246 ' 
247 return to never land is reliable , standard disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages 
248 it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations 
249 in many ways , reminiscent of 1992 's unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue 
250 caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose 
251 a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving ... 
252 oversexed , at times overwrought comedy\/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single 
253 the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese 
254 the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in -lrb- the characters ' -rrb- misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it 
255 the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling 
256 the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful 
257 i also believe that resident evil is not it 
258 if only there were one for this kind of movie 
259 offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film 
260 it may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate 
261 meeting , even exceeding expectations , it 's the best sequel since the empire strikes back ... a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth 
262 while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they 'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds 
263 not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season 
264 ... may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence 
265 death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke 
266 spielberg 's picture is smarter and subtler than -lrb- total recall and blade runner -rrb- , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences 
267 hart 's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character 
268 smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy 
269 offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life 
270 i 'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking 
271 the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice 
272 the characters are more deeply thought through than in most ` right-thinking ' films 
273 these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i 'm all for that 
274 with a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of the longest yard 
275 the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious 
276 you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm 
277 cho 's latest comic set is n't as sharp or as fresh as i 'm the one that i want ... but it 's still damn funny stuff 
278 much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words do n't really do the era justice 
279 one of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while ... 
280 the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment 
281 light the candles , bring out the cake and do n't fret about the calories because there 's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it 's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat 
282 it 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart 
283 sayles ... once again strands his superb performers in the same old story 
284 high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue 
285 nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending 
286 bogdanovich puts history in perspective and , via kirsten dunst 's remarkable performance , he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy 
287 the gentle comic treatment of adolescent sturm und drang should please fans of chris fuhrman 's posthumously published cult novel 
288 shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was 
289 this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie 
290 there 's some outrageously creative action in the transporter ... -lrb- b -rrb- ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it 's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman 
291 for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough 
292 it might be ` easier ' to watch on video at home , but that should n't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience 
293 new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ... 
294 -lrb- reno -rrb- delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion 
295 rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust 
296 more good than great but freeman and judd make it work 
297 it 's nice to see piscopo again after all these years , and chaykin and headly are priceless 
298 never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction 
299 if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows 
300 she is a lioness , protecting her cub , and he a reluctant villain , incapable of controlling his crew 
301 this is an interesting movie ! '' 
302 it 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical 
303 might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people 
304 the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction 
305 are monsters born , or made ? 
306 the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for damon\/bourne or his predicament 
307 only at the prospect of beck 's next project 
308 consider this review life-affirming 
309 like a can of 2-day old coke 
310 this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short 
311 yes , i suppose it 's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i did n't 
312 rodriguez ... was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight 
313 jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability 
314 that the film opens with maggots crawling on a dead dog is not an out of place metaphor 
315 if the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that 's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in ... and making you sweat 
316 drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band 
317 the entire cast is first-rate , especially sorvino 
318 it 's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding 
319 nothing about this movie works 
320 a solidly entertaining little film 
321 if the movie were all comedy , it might work better 
322 -lrb- `` safe conduct '' -rrb- is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage 
323 although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel 
324 a hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped 
325 this is an exercise in chilling style , and twohy films the sub , inside and out , with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery 
326 hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? 
327 it makes compelling , provocative and prescient viewing 
328 a flawed but engrossing thriller 
329 never comes together as a coherent whole 
330 a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies 
331 what sets ms. birot 's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents 
332 like most of jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand 
333 it 's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout 
334 one of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm 
335 not only are the film 's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were 
336 i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x. 
337 the film gets close to the chimps the same way goodall did , with a serious minded patience , respect and affection 
338 a rip-off twice removed , modeled after -lrb- seagal 's -rrb- earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat 
339 ms. seigner and mr. serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters 
340 that 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` dragonfly 
341 '' 
342 but the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences 
343 if you answered yes , by all means enjoy the new guy 
344 generates an enormous feeling of empathy for its characters 
345 the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love 
346 those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up 
347 now he makes them 
348 an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves 
349 would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed ` the french lieutenant 's woman 
350 ' 
351 if you like quirky , odd movies and\/or the ironic , here 's a fun one 
352 no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half 
353 woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody 
354 kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing 
355 the most consistently funny of the austin powers films 
356 it 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen 
357 the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible 
358 paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks 
359 the plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling 
360 most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant 
361 the redeeming feature of chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine 
362 amazingly lame 
363 not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow 
364 but when it does , you 're entirely unprepared 
365 garcía bernal and talancón are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you 'll want things to work out 
366 -- but certainly hard to hate 
367 finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed 
368 earnest but heavy-handed 
369 parker can not sustain the buoyant energy level of the film 's city beginnings into its country conclusion ' 
370 ali 's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier 
371 the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me 
372 bacon keeps things interesting , but do n't go out of your way to pay full price 
373 a cockeyed shot all the way 
374 clare peploe 's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence 
375 a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai 's vaunted empathy 
376 a cutesy romantic tale with a twist 
377 about one in three gags in white 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook 
378 it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting 
379 give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works 
380 enough said , except : film overboard ! 
381 a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre 's most enabling victim ... and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers 
382 while we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen , we had no trouble sitting for blade ii 
383 a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films 
384 combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why did n't hollywood think of this sooner ? 
385 if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about 
386 the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter o'fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt 
387 i 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment 
388 not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes 
389 an elegant work , food of love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing 
390 the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze 
391 ... a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off 
392 if you 're a fan of the series you 'll love it and probably want to see it twice 
393 maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans ' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection 
394 shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage 
395 cynics need not apply 
396 ' 
397 the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long 
398 suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands 
399 it 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture 
400 it 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ... 
401 the film is bright and flashy in all the right ways 
402 a brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel 
403 pure of intention and passably diverting , his secret life is light , innocuous and unremarkable 
404 a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters 
405 does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background 
406 a fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system 
407 ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on 
408 a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial 
409 quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance 
410 i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes 
411 in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate 
412 mildly entertaining 
413 ` men in black ii creates a new threat for the mib , but recycles the same premise 
414 it 's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original 
415 it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes 
416 boomers and their kids will have a barrie good time 
417 wow 
418 if disney 's cinderella proved that ' a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio 's wallet makes 
419 been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better 
420 an infuriating film 
421 seeing seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but 
422 a film with a great premise but only a great premise 
423 seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof 
424 a backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship 
425 the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier 
426 by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop 
427 soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence 
428 what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama , suspense , revenge , and romance 
429 sweet home alabama is n't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts 
430 it 's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look 
431 a party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid 
432 though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore 
433 the movie is ... very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes 
434 while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it 's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle 
435 originality ai n't on the menu , but there 's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller 
436 like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal 
437 the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland 
438 a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing 
439 the cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing 
440 a grittily beautiful film that looks , sounds , and feels more like an extended , open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story 
441 ruh-roh ! 
442 strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild 
443 a few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies 
444 yet it 's not quite the genre-busting film it 's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe 
445 the biggest problem with roger avary 's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything 
446 i ca n't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail 
447 the movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in 
448 peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the dogtown experience 
449 i prefer to think of it as `` pootie tang with a budget 
450 '' 
451 manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it 
452 the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump 
453 it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action 
454 despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn 's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship 
455 that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies 
456 a fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion 
457 australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them 
458 `` mr. deeds '' is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought 
459 lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned 
460 one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters 
461 rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories 
462 it 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic 
463 yet another iteration of what 's become one of the movies ' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally `` superior '' friends , family ... 
464 you may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie 
465 mr. scorsese 's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated 
466 more intellectually scary than dramatically involving 
467 the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast 
468 '' 
469 fun and nimble 
470 and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen 's men 
471 as home movie gone haywire , it 's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i 'd rather listen to old tori amos records 
472 when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame 
473 ' 
474 the movie is a desperate miscalculation 
475 what they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge 
476 plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp 
477 what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story 
478 polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style 
479 with its jerky hand-held camera and documentary feel , bloody sunday is a sobering recount of a very bleak day in derry 
480 the main story ... is compelling enough , but it 's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish 
481 the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing 
482 it 's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke 
483 if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising , it 's still a sweet , even delectable diversion 
484 top-notch action powers this romantic drama 
485 roman polanski 's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than ` shindler 's list ' - it is more than merely a holocaust movie 
486 an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of don simpson 
487 confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris ' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture 
488 the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror\/action hybrid 
489 takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights 
490 ` moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism 
491 ' 
492 the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style 
493 the star who helped give a spark to `` chasing amy '' and `` changing lanes '' falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` the sum of all fears 
494 '' 
495 a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor 
496 a good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera 
497 a marvelous performance by allison lohman as an identity-seeking foster child 
498 a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally 
499 since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche 
500 leigh is n't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love 
501 any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years 
502 the master of disguise represents adam sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe 
503 i ca n't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies 
504 -lrb- a -rrb- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain 
505 once one experiences mr. haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else 
506 with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine 
507 about schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year 
508 it does n't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received 
509 it may not be history -- but then again , what if it is ? 
510 - i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
511 the work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them 
512 exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named kaos 
513 for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league 
514 i had more fun with ben stiller 's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever 
515 juliette binoche 's sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile 
516 most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots 
517 but not a whit more 
518 a powerful performance from mel gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an m-16 
519 woody allen has really found his groove these days 
520 the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a `` dungeons and dragons '' fantasy with modern military weaponry ... 
521 delirious fun 
522 what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles ' book does not translate well to the screen 
523 ice cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin 
524 director david fincher and writer david koepp ca n't sustain it 
525 displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver 
526 sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery 
527 -lrb- the digital effects -rrb- reminded me of terry gilliam 's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together 
528 mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative 
529 what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map 
530 it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions 
531 entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn 
532 does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
533 what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance 
534 with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out 
535 it 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly 
536 for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1\/2 - hour running time 
537 most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes 
538 as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? 
539 with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins 
540 clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable ... 
541 happy times maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it 
542 tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen 
543 a compelling film 
544 the film 's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths 
545 the same should go for movie theaters 
546 it certainly wo n't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time 
547 most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there 
548 cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth 
549 a ` girls gone wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that 
550 the entire movie has a truncated feeling , but what 's available is lovely and lovable 
551 ... the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies 
552 with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , hélène angel is definitely a director to watch 
553 aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me 
554 a deft , delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph 
555 a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun 
556 an uplifting drama ... what antwone fisher is n't , however , is original 
557 men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic 
558 there 's nothing to gain from watching they 
559 debut effort by `` project greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish 
560 your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , madonna 's cameo does n't suck ! 
561 an absurdist spider web 
562 a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it 's potentially just as rewarding 
563 rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations 
564 an entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the bard 's immortal plays were written by somebody else 
565 `` me without you '' is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades 
566 stay away 
567 contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii 
568 skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source 
569 beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics 
570 if you 're burnt out on it 's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you 're looking for 
571 the film 's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations 
572 the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes 
573 the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list 
574 it 's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat 
575 should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie 
576 decent but dull 
577 get out your pooper-scoopers 
578 humor in i spy is so anemic 
579 at least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii 
580 try as you might to resist , if you 've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson , this movie will worm its way there 
581 if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on 
582 there 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale 
583 this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success 
584 this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still 
585 technically and artistically inept 
586 ... overly melodramatic ... 
587 you 'll get the enjoyable basic minimum 
588 trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it 's hard to like a film so cold and dead 
589 ... stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier 
590 in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant 
591 allen 's funniest and most likeable movie in years 
592 highly uneven and inconsistent ... margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within 
593 weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes 
594 the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable 
595 earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock 
596 blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological 
597 the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters 
598 a big-budget\/all-star movie as unblinkingly pure as the hours is a distinct rarity , and an event 
599 an enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we 've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar 
600 even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached 
601 as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital 
602 deepa mehta provides an accessible introduction as well as some intelligent observations on the success of bollywood in the western world 
603 a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life 
604 not once does it come close to being exciting 
605 it 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s 
606 the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters 
607 ... standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added 
608 a noble failure 
609 much of what we see is horrible but it 's also undeniably exceedingly clever 
610 there 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy 
611 any rock pile will do for a set 
612 the hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight 
613 a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us 
614 marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue 
615 the film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments 
616 this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch 
617 in addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , changing lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight 
618 sitting through the last reel -lrb- spoiler alert ! -rrb- 
619 in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses 
620 while the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo ... broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity 
621 the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms. bullock 's best work in some time 
622 unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party 
623 if the very concept makes you nervous ... you 'll have an idea of the film 's creepy , scary effectiveness 
624 an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it is n't 
625 a compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds 
626 a rumor of angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness 
627 mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects fest the mummy returns 
628 what 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy 
629 stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation 
630 ` alice 's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie-land ' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures 
631 late marriage is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love 
632 remember it 
633 thoroughly enjoyable 
634 begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish 
635 it 's a fanboy ` what if ? ' 
636 the best comedy concert movie i 've seen since cho 's previous concert comedy film , i 'm the one that i want , in 2000 
637 the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically 
638 you 'll end up moved 
639 i 've yet to find an actual vietnam war combat movie actually produced by either the north or south vietnamese , but at least now we 've got something pretty damn close 
640 while it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own 
641 a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects 
642 it 's always fascinating to watch marker the essayist at work 
643 a pure participatory event that malnourished intellectuals will gulp down in a frenzy 
644 the film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun 
645 but even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic 
646 narc is all menace and atmosphere 
647 there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time 
648 -lrb- stevens is -rrb- so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits 
649 kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business 
650 it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum 
651 occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring 
652 being unique does n't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke 
653 strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing 
654 that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film 
655 hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u.s. -- a major director is emerging in world cinema 
656 when -lrb- reno -rrb- lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w. bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al. , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture 
657 never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance 
658 even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , east-vs 
659 despite its visual virtuosity , ` naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it 
660 while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you wo n't care 
661 paul bettany is cool 
662 collateral damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it were n't 
663 it 's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother\/daughter pair 
664 the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point 
665 when you 've got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed 
666 the problem with all of this : it 's not really funny 
667 oops , she 's really done it this time 
668 one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin 
669 there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film 
670 a modestly surprising movie 
671 it 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard -lrb- eileen walsh -rrb- when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant 
672 as the movie traces mr. brown 's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times 
673 to others , it will remind them that hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking 
674 with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool 
675 confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve 
676 it 's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism 
677 a heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope 
678 this franchise has not spawned a single good film 
679 a taut , sobering film 
680 ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action 
681 just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting 
682 what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material 
683 claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem 
684 surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it 
685 woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the `` saving private ryan '' battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
686 although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful 
687 makes 98 minutes feel like three hours 
688 the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense 
689 shame on writer\/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull 
690 spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but `` spider-man '' certainly delivers the goods 
691 de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter 
692 i survived 
693 like the hanks character , he 's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed 
694 a poignant lyricism runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem 
695 thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces do n't quite fit together 
696 ... is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness -lrb- the way chekhov is funny -rrb- , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality 
697 does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon 
698 disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical `` bedknobs and broomsticks , '' which also dealt with british children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime 
699 paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 
700 the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them 
701 in xxx , diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep 
702 there is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye 
703 it 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true 
704 special p.o.v. camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense imax screen 
705 taken outside the context of the current political climate -lrb- see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! -rrb- 
706 a little weak -- and it is n't that funny 
707 writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon 
708 a forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself 
709 one of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved 
710 an almost unbearably morbid love story 
711 a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia 
712 if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn 
713 there 's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls ... 
714 we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting 
715 implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most american of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all 
716 very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience 
717 impostor is a step down for director gary fleder 
718 moving and vibrant 
719 jacquot 's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself 
720 hawn and sarandon form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare 
721 may puzzle his most ardent fans 
722 in other words , it 's badder than bad 
723 may prove to be -lrb- tsai 's -rrb- masterpiece 
724 ... they missed the boat 
725 one of the best , most understated performances of -lrb- jack nicholson 's -rrb- career 
726 it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time 
727 after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long 
728 the master of disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on saturday night live 
729 ' 
730 they 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone 
731 shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , -lrb- but -rrb- the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives 
732 but it was n't 
733 though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression 
734 foster breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill 
735 in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms. shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast 
736 well-acted , well-directed and , for all its moodiness , not too pretentious 
737 one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou 
738 a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid 
739 there 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer 
740 frida is n't that much different from many a hollywood romance 
741 follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun 
742 scott baio is turning in some delightful work on indie projects 
743 keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s.c. , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner 
744 a serviceable euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom -- handguns , bmws and seaside chateaus 
745 the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections 
746 like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you ca n't fake 
747 it 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one 
748 a lame comedy 
749 deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate 
750 morvern rocks 
751 a positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera 
752 when ` science fiction ' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience has n't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre 
753 illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller 
754 as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm 
755 a film of quiet power 
756 overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper 
757 wins my vote for ` the 2002 enemy of cinema ' award 
758 it 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but westbrook 's foundation and dalrymple 's film earn their uplift 
759 zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that 's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does 
760 because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we 've somehow never seen before 
761 it 's a very valuable film ... 
762 bad movie 
763 just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense 
764 the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges 
765 the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic 
766 an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic 
767 it 's pauly shore awful 
768 , `` they 're out there ! '' 
769 ` tadpole ' was one of the films so declared this year , but it 's really more of the next pretty good thing 
770 when the precise nature of matthew 's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up 
771 a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set 
772 what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh 's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination 
773 oh , james ! 
774 got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1\/2 - hour , dissipated length 
775 an emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do 
776 an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more 
777 ... tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry 
778 a vivid , sometimes surreal , glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior 
779 it 's no accident that the accidental spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form 
780 a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich 
781 it 's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective 
782 how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? 
783 the film did n't convince me that calvin jr. 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago 's south side 
784 exciting documentary 
785 at its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating 
786 a winning piece of work filled with love for the movies of the 1960s 
787 her film is like a beautiful food entrée that is n't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless 
788 the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill 
789 gives everyone something to shout about 
790 it 's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast 
791 the chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy 
792 but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit 
793 deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant 
794 after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go 
795 as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy 
796 though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted 
797 jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers 
798 reassuring , retro uplifter 
799 the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone 's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america 
800 there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door 
801 this is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that 's as entertaining as it is instructive 
802 i have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out 
803 much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of don king , sonny miller , and michael stewart 
804 a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks 
805 all very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion 
806 what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes 
807 a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow 's car 
808 the film 's only missteps come from the script 's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale 's antics 
809 the best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date 
810 drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story 
811 to be influenced chiefly by humanity 's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god 's sake ! 
812 take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera 
813 the audacity to view one of shakespeare 's better known tragedies as a dark comedy is , by itself , deserving of discussion 
814 the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally 
815 too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper -lrb- and better -rrb- than pink floyd tickets 
816 you expect more from director michael apted -lrb- enigma -rrb- and screenwriter nicholas kazan -lrb- reversal of fortune -rrb- than this cliche pileup 
817 director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning 
818 a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground 
819 a moving and solidly entertaining comedy\/drama that should bolster director and co-writer juan josé campanella 's reputation in the united states 
820 everything is off 
821 working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli ... ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you 'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up 
822 pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws 
823 mordantly funny and intimately knowing ... 
824 i ca n't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops 
825 it 's tommy 's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you 'll feel like mopping up , too 
826 each of these stories has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness , but thirteen conversations about one thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments 
827 there 's ... an underlying old world sexism to monday morning that undercuts its charm 
828 what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted 
829 i liked a lot of the smaller scenes 
830 some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity 
831 beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart 
832 nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin 
833 bring tissues 
834 ... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around 
835 an enthralling , entertaining feature 
836 as a director , paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip 
837 well-made but mush-hearted 
838 labute masterfully balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other 
839 assured , glossy and shot through with brittle desperation 
840 a damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film 
841 filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that does n't always jell with sean penn 's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it 
842 despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny 
843 ' 
844 a surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy 
845 ... begins with promise , but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot 
846 although what time offers tsai 's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films 
847 a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture 
848 a must-see for fans of thoughtful war films and those interested in the sights and sounds of battle 
849 with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill 
850 by no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story 
851 it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ... 
852 it 's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller 
853 i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale 's tale -- you wo n't be sorry ! 
854 what goes on for the 110 minutes of `` panic room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals 
855 if you do n't flee , you might be seduced 
856 in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little 
857 the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few 
858 it may sound like a mere disease-of - the-week tv movie , but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter 
859 this one is certainly well-meaning , but it 's also simple-minded and contrived 
860 the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not 
861 it 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it 's entertaining enough and worth a look 
862 if we 're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she 's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept ? 
863 i 've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama 
864 i 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake 
865 `` nicholas nickleby '' is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there 's no new `` a christmas carol '' out in the theaters this year 
866 if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again 
867 it wo n't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch 's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee 
868 was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
869 how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not 
870 a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains ... crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential 
871 pretty good little movie 
872 if nothing else , `` rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j. 
873 angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale 
874 nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme 
875 even when he 's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work 
876 the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react 
877 -lrb- t -rrb- he film is never sure to make a clear point -- even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation 
878 this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states 
879 amazing ! 
880 the ya-ya 's have many secrets and one is - the books are better 
881 the plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained 
882 a thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant 's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos 
883 kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor 
884 -lrb- allen 's -rrb- best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be 
885 the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble 
886 we 've liked klein 's other work but rollerball left us cold 
887 both a grand tour through 300 hundred years of russian cultural identity and a stunning technical achievement 
888 a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional 
889 clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up 
890 soderbergh , like kubrick before him , may not touch the planet 's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit 
891 there is no denying the power of polanski 's film ... 
892 to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed 
893 though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary 
894 however stale the material , lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny 
895 little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games 
896 the beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet is simple but absorbing 
897 from the opening strains of the average white band 's `` pick up the pieces '' , you can feel the love 
898 empire ca n't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film 
899 the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel 
900 a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination 
901 thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began 
902 director peter kosminsky gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting ` chops ' and they take full advantage 
903 storytelling feels slight 
904 witty , vibrant , and intelligent 
905 while we want macdowell 's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her 
906 despite its shortcomings , girls ca n't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it 's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre 
907 interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen 
908 thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all 
909 for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche 
910 it 's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it is n't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers 
911 we get the comedy we settle for 
912 eerily accurate depiction of depression 
913 schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man 's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness 
914 i 'm not saying that ice age does n't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there 's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life 
915 feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime ... and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work 
916 extraordinary debut from josh koury 
917 it 's not life-affirming -- its vulgar and mean , but i liked it 
918 the pinochet case is a searing album of remembrance from those who , having survived , suffered most 
919 ... a bland murder-on-campus yawner 
920 cannon 's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film 's saving graces 
921 just like a splendid meal , red dragon satisfies -- from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation 
922 not as good as the original , but what is ... 
923 feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening 
924 while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee 's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness 
925 features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer 's block ever 
926 admirably ambitious but self-indulgent 
927 whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us 
928 surprisingly powerful and universal 
929 this rough trade punch-and-judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now 
930 the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive 
931 even murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort 
932 a captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age 
933 an intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist -lrb- not to mention gently political -rrb- meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement 
934 massoud 's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner -lrb- and ultimately the victim -rrb- of history 
935 if hill is n't quite his generation 's don siegel -lrb- or robert aldrich -rrb- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and cliché 
936 and neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are 
937 strictly a ` guy 's film ' in the worst sense of the expression 
938 a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures 
939 irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free 
940 can you bear the laughter ? 
941 `` abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater 
942 the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man 
943 not as good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort 
944 asks what truth can be discerned from non-firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema 's capability for recording truth 
945 audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant 
946 ... a solid , unassuming drama 
947 a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust 
948 ok arthouse 
949 it 's fairly solid -- not to mention well edited so that it certainly does n't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark 
950 the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs. the snowman leaves a lot to be desired 
951 a vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg 's brilliant ` videodrome 
952 ' 
953 discursive but oddly riveting documentary 
954 what 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism 
955 like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen 
956 there 's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself 
957 a little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged 
958 not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time 
959 just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be 
960 though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there 's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting 
961 all the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable 
962 it 's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor 
963 collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence 
964 a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth 
965 payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human 
966 a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing 
967 fierce , glaring and unforgettable 
968 the film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal 
969 there are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers do n't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies 
970 a lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe 
971 miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection 
972 like these russo guys lookin ' for their mamet instead found their sturges 
973 sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely 
974 for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer 
975 an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product 
976 some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and heaven is one such beast 
977 with a `` spy kids '' sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` snl '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
978 muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner 
979 in a summer of clones , harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects 
980 so original in its base concept that you can not help but get caught up 
981 but even then , i 'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes 
982 this new zealand coming-of-age movie is n't really about anything 
983 quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor 
984 mama africa pretty much delivers on that promise 
985 john carlen 's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling 
986 we hate -lrb- madonna -rrb- within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground 
987 much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be 
988 one regards reign of fire with awe 
989 it 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo 
990 the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i 'd care to count 
991 you 've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it 's worth yet another visit 
992 journalism of the 1960s 
993 in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and meat loaf explodes 
994 is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low 
995 to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs. sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement 
996 a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know 
997 my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ... 
998 a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets 
999 throw smoochy from the train ! 
1000 an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom ... you 'd be wise to send your regrets 
1001 none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think 
1002 the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in -lrb- this -rrb- meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot 
1003 watching e.t now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision 
1004 a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction 
1005 irwin is so earnest that it 's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs 
1006 a miraculous movie , i 'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion 
1007 the story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile 
1008 showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again 
1009 by the final whistle you 're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just does n't have big screen magic 
1010 first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb 
1011 and people make fun of me for liking showgirls 
1012 the performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie 
1013 ... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank 
1014 it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame 
1015 brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women 's depression 
1016 if you 're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse 
1017 whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , i ca n't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears 
1018 children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah 's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it 
1019 `` i blame all men for war , '' -lrb- the warden 's daughter -rrb- tells her father 
1020 muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss ... provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex 
1021 has a solid emotional impact 
1022 dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring 
1023 the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste 
1024 one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch 
1025 has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they 're not interested 
1026 lawrence should stick to his day job 
1027 by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy 
1028 buy is an accomplished actress , and this is a big , juicy role 
1029 maid in manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies 
1030 thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic 
1031 a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary 
1032 one of the film 's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret 
1033 jacquot has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs , ideally capturing the opera 's drama and lyricism 
1034 the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten 
1035 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times 
1036 goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse 
1037 unexpected , and often contradictory , truths emerge 
1038 has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope 
1039 even if you 're an elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this dvd 
1040 together writer-director danny verete 's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt 
1041 writer\/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable 
1042 reyes ' word processor 
1043 goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner laurence coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage 
1044 the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors 
1045 even though we know the outcome , the seesawing of the general 's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy 
1046 you 're not merely watching history , you 're engulfed by it 
1047 i am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here 
1048 we 're drawn in by the dark luster 
1049 the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil 
1050 it 's not a great monster movie 
1051 it 's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by kwan 's unique directing style 
1052 it 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead 
1053 the all-french cast is marveilleux 
1054 wanker goths are on the loose ! 
1055 if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` how does steven seagal come across these days ? '' 
1056 the emperor 's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality 
1057 the warnings to resist temptation in this film ... are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean 
1058 that storytelling has value can not be denied 
1059 the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break 
1060 it 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby 
1061 it establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout 
1062 solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke 
1063 deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame 
1064 swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit 
1065 there 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long 
1066 a tasty slice of droll whimsy 
1067 winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars 
1068 in its own floundering way , it gets to you 
1069 behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting 
1070 this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c. walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago 
1071 with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike 
1072 significantly better than its 2002 children 's - movie competition 
1073 you can thank me for this 
1074 this is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that does n't reveal even a hint of artifice 
1075 cox creates a fluid and mesmerizing sequence of images to match the words of nijinsky 's diaries 
1076 the fast runner ' transports the viewer into an unusual space 
1077 with the exception of mccoist , the players do n't have a clue on the park 
1078 no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander 's uninspired story 
1079 everyone 's to blame here 
1080 evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking 
1081 an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy 
1082 ... another example of how sandler is losing his touch 
1083 an awful lot like one of -lrb- spears ' -rrb- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it 
1084 stale and clichéd to a fault 
1085 ... built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids 
1086 zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a 
1087 holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life 's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks 
1088 it 's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it did n't entirely grab me , but there 's stuff here to like 
1089 i still want my money back 
1090 no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest ` tron ' anderson , seems entirely improvised 
1091 it 's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just ca n't take it any more 
1092 narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess 
1093 well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process 
1094 if there 's no art here , it 's still a good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days 
1095 ranges from laugh-out-loud hilarious to wonder-what - time-it-is tedious 
1096 the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge 
1097 its sheer dynamism is infectious 
1098 the film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy 
1099 dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch 
1100 simultaneously heart-breaking and very funny , the last kiss is really all about performances 
1101 start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line 
1102 bogs down badly as we absorb jia 's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance 
1103 jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema 
1104 a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit 
1105 max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve ... as far as art is concerned , it 's mission accomplished 
1106 the power of shanghai ghetto , a documentary by dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s 
1107 in a word : no. 
1108 there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them 
1109 ` punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in 
1110 ' 
1111 a sentimental mess that never rings true 
1112 a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it 
1113 -lrb- janey -rrb- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies 
1114 ca n't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? 
1115 would i see it again ? 
1116 the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care 
1117 a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity 
1118 ... although this idea is `` new '' the results are tired 
1119 remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it 's an adventure story and history lesson all in one 
1120 mike white 's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make `` the good girl '' a film worth watching 
1121 a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact 
1122 this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar 
1123 it 's a treat -- a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score ... grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun 
1124 the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through 
1125 even when crush departs from the 4w formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash 
1126 at its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist 's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood 
1127 nair does n't treat the issues lightly 
1128 ana 's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she 's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique ... 
1129 a compelling motion picture that illustrates an american tragedy 
1130 it 's that painful 
1131 smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play 
1132 there 's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that 's packed with just as much intelligence as action 
1133 ... if you 're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee 
1134 though writer\/director bart freundlich 's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup 's anchoring performance 
1135 the early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us 
1136 but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still 
1137 -lrb- cho 's face is -rrb- an amazing slapstick instrument , creating a scrapbook of living mug shots 
1138 if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it 
1139 his -lrb- nelson 's -rrb- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it 
1140 terminally brain dead production 
1141 it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept 
1142 -lrb- grant -rrb- goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it 
1143 adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio 
1144 the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected 
1145 well-meaning but inert 
1146 bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly 
1147 while most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that 's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world 
1148 one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact 
1149 well-meant but unoriginal 
1150 it 's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it 
1151 it 's burns ' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown 
1152 the real triumphs in igby come from philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character 's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who could n't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron 
1153 the quiet american is n't a bad film , it 's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar 
1154 no. 
1155 kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities 
1156 my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as ' a perfect family film , ' because it 's about family 
1157 even though many of these guys are less than adorable -lrb- their lamentations are pretty much self-centered -rrb- , there 's something vital about the movie 
1158 while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often 
1159 an ugly , revolting movie 
1160 if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea 
1161 the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter 
1162 shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski 's the pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high 
1163 but it 's hardly a necessary enterprise 
1164 ratliff 's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , and this film is part of that delicate canon 
1165 distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine 
1166 it 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow 
1167 as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction 
1168 de niro cries 
1169 leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that 's simultaneously painful and refreshing 
1170 i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere 
1171 it 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name 
1172 the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it were n't true 
1173 really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length 
1174 a breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy

1179 about schmidt is nicholson 's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear 
1180 a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising 
1181 hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie 's political ramifications 
1182 the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it 
1183 this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem 
1184 enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise 
1185 it 's not hateful 
1186 eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you do n't care who fires the winning shot 
1187 as warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated 
1188 godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating 
1189 this ready-made midnight movie probably wo n't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it 's goofy -lrb- if not entirely wholesome -rrb- fun 
1190 hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire 
1191 although sensitive to a fault , it 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken 
1192 several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` unfaithful 
1193 '' 
1194 feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women 
1195 ... a low rate annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school 
1196 this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre 
1197 surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy 
1198 it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary 
1199 directing with a sure and measured hand , -lrb- haneke -rrb- steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology 
1200 directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they are n't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space 
1201 ... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did i miss something ? '' 
1202 wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse 
1203 many of benjamins ' elements feel like they 've been patched in from an episode of miami vice 
1204 ... little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen 
1205 it 's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america 
1206 ub equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of ` black culture ' and the dorkier aspects of ` white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are 
1207 full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature 
1208 ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults 
1209 could n't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ? 
1210 your stomach for heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn 
1211 in the wrong hands , i.e. peploe 's , it 's simply unbearable 
1212 what saves it ... and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice 
1213 like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels 
1214 a strong script , powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being 
1215 an average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son 's discovery of his homosexuality 
1216 miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet 
1217 it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down 
1218 the wanton slipperiness of \* corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art 
1219 the real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it 's really well directed 
1220 instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick 
1221 this tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations 
1222 ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
1223 the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer 
1224 for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m. night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo 
1225 downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' pg-13 rating 
1226 the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody 
1227 in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused 
1228 the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard 
1229 the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well

1241 lee 's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability 
1242 it 's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it does n't take itself so deadly seriously 
1243 if you 're paying attention , the `` big twists '' are pretty easy to guess - but that does n't make the movie any less entertaining 
1244 yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness 
1245 the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle 's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration 
1246 the premise of `` abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess 
1247 shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes

1251 it 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread 
1252 the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack 
1253 the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum 
1254 lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling 
1255 like smoke signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama 
1256 as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else 
1257 the film 's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise 
1258 they should have found orson welles ' great-grandson 
1259 stuffed to the brim with ideas , american instigator michael moore 's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition

1263 imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women 
1264 a grating , emaciated flick 
1265 it 's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless 
1266 with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm 
1267 a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel 
1268 jackson is always watchable 
1269 showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation 
1270 mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything

1285 while cherish does n't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it 's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem 
1286 the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced ... it 's a pity that -lrb- nelson 's -rrb- achievement does n't match his ambition 
1287 graham greene 's novel of colonialism and empire is elevated by michael caine 's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world 
1288 the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory 
1289 my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it 's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss 
1290 an off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world 
1291 this thing works on no level whatsoever for me

1293 one of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme shockers since the evil dead 
1294 we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close 
1295 ultimate x is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to espn the magazine 
1296 an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' 
1297 in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you 'd expect to see on showtime 's ` red shoe diaries

1304 even if you do n't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why 
1305 ... watching it was painful 
1306 mostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully 
1307 the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro ... could n't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment

1331 davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine 
1332 caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness ... but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty 
1333 the rest of the film ... is dudsville 
1334 brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate 
1335 ... a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department 
1336 director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters 
1337 the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery

1341 a bold -lrb- and lovely -rrb- experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams 
1342 a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing 
1343 we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle 
1344 if any of them list this ` credit ' on their resumes in the future , that 'll be much funnier than anything in the film ... 
1345 after you laugh once -lrb- maybe twice -rrb- , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot 
1346 the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork 
1347 there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself 
1348 it is scott 's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph

1353 while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration 
1354 despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless 
1355 it 's one long bore 
1356 if you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young tv actors -lrb- dawson leery did what ?!? -rrb- , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie

1358 none of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny 
1359 ice age wo n't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and i 'm giving it a strong thumbs up

1368 the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups do n't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters 
1369 rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , jiang wen 's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut

1371 despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela 
1372 painfully padded 
1373 the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots -lrb- or cinema seats -rrb- 
1374 a diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of palestinian and israeli children 
1375 highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting 
1376 none of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting is n't , either , and you would n't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ?

1378 a gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn jerusalem 
1379 i had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was earnest

1387 ... an interesting slice of history 
1388 for dance completists only 
1389 it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition 
1390 less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 
1391 it 's uninteresting 
1392 bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie

1395 confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it 
1396 road to perdition does display greatness , and it 's worth seeing 
1397 ultimately , sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness 
1398 an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time 
1399 one of the worst movies of the year 
1400 like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz 
1401 too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle 's carpets 
1402 it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline 
1403 a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller 
1404 it 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick 
1405 manages to delight without much of a story 
1406 ... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler 
1407 may take its sweet time to get wherever it 's going , but if you have the patience for it , you wo n't feel like it 's wasted yours 
1408 ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms. paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability 
1409 in the book-on-tape market , the film of `` the kid stays in the picture '' would be an abridged edition 
1410 it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment 
1411 it 's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun 
1412 high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd

1420 fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees 
1421 everyone 's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships 
1422 seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors 
1423 it 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget 
1424 do n't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action 
1425 the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies

1447 majidi 's direction has never been smoother or more confident 
1448 i did n't think so 
1449 there 's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies 
1450 fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz ' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique 
1451 falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie 's reality and stifling its creator 's comic voice 
1452 bland but harmless 
1453 like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions 
1454 judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller smart women , foolish choices for advice 
1455 in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar 
1456 freundlich 's made -lrb- crudup -rrb- a suburban architect , and a cipher 
1457 it 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction 
1458 not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens 
1459 the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters ... 
1460 adolescents will be adequately served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service 
1461 ' 
1462 about the best thing you could say about narc is that it 's a rock-solid little genre picture 
1463 an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity 
1464 star\/producer salma hayek and director julie taymor have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character 's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own 
1465 what -lrb- denis -rrb- accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned 
1466 to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved 
1467 a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive 
1468 judith and zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics 
1469 with an unusual protagonist -lrb- a kilt-wearing jackson -rrb- and subject matter , the improbable `` formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger 
1470 this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness 
1471 though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan -lrb- a first-time actor -rrb- , writer\/director achero manas 's film is schematic and obvious 
1472 its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists 
1473 the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year 
1474 the determination of pinochet 's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director patricio guzman 's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop 
1475 a beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder 
1476 hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script 
1477 who needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this , the final part of the ` qatsi ' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music by philip glass ? 
1478 the 1960s rebellion was misdirected : you ca n't fight your culture 
1479 disjointed parody 
1480 typical animé , with cheapo animation -lrb- like saturday morning tv in the '60s -rrb- , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names 
1481 you ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff 
1482 the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times 
1483 twenty years later , e.t. is still a cinematic touchstone 
1484 lohman adapts to the changes required of her , but the actress and director peter kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects 
1485 angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately 
1486 gondry 's direction is adequate ... but what gives human nature its unique feel is kaufman 's script 
1487 though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we 've seen before 
1488 one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years 
1489 glizty but formulaic and silly ... cagney 's ` top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel 
1490 makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases 
1491 -lrb- a -rrb- soulless , stupid sequel ... 
1492 with a large cast representing a broad cross-section , tavernier 's film bounds along with the rat-a-tat energy of `` his girl friday , '' maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes 
1493 unpretentious , charming , quirky , original 
1494 -lrb- a -rrb- rare movie that makes us re-assess the basis for our lives and evaluate what is truly ours in a world of meaningless activity 
1495 humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention 
1496 told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings 
1497 if you have n't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg 's work 
1498 at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary 
1499 dogtown and z-boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become `` the punk kids ' revolution 
1500 '' 
1501 any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look 
1502 it 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue 
1503 a dull , dumb and derivative horror film 
1504 how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
1505 a wordy wisp of a comedy 
1506 an energetic , violent movie with a momentum that never lets up 
1507 even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser 
1508 an affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 's previous collaboration , miss congeniality 
1509 it really is a shame that more wo n't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet ` evelyn 
1510 ' 
1511 caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely 
1512 i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing 
1513 see it 
1514 as played by ryan gosling , danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction 
1515 the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting -lrb- and funnier -rrb- than his 
1516 few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry 's terrific performance 
1517 oh , and more entertaining , too 
1518 the genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates 
1519 austin powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later 
1520 a worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions 
1521 if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though ... you will likely enjoy this monster 
1522 it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see 
1523 how inept is serving sara ? 
1524 a thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy 
1525 -lrb- caine -rrb- proves once again he has n't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film 
1526 the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get 
1527 a vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it , my big fat greek wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , colour and cringe 
1528 the film , like jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs 
1529 like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely 
1530 but once the falcon arrives in the skies above manhattan , the adventure is on red alert 
1531 you can see where big bad love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there 
1532 the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers 
1533 as antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community , the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion 
1534 the film 's heady yet far from impenetrable theory suggests that russians take comfort in their closed-off nationalist reality 
1535 this is n't a new idea 
1536 on a cutting room floor somewhere lies ... footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire 
1537 that haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace 
1538 avary 's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis ' book 
1539 smothered by its own solemnity 
1540 just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
1541 but first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort 
1542 for all the dolorous trim , secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop freudianism 
1543 a bright , inventive , thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy 
1544 just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer 
1545 those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one 
1546 a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel 
1547 greg kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior 
1548 this action-thriller\/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage 
1549 metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story 
1550 the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay 
1551 its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up 
1552 a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone 
1553 a melancholy , emotional film 
1554 the film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? 
1555 both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded 
1556 the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie 
1557 a rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means 
1558 the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises 
1559 the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes 
1560 there 's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms is n't it 
1561 i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject 
1562 you could put it on a coffee table anywhere 
1563 a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be 
1564 changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it 's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say 
1565 ... flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags 
1566 passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats 
1567 whenever you think you 've figured out late marriage , it throws you for a loop 
1568 the story 's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr. day-lewis roars with leonine power 
1569 one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time 
1570 nair does n't use -lrb- monsoon wedding -rrb- to lament the loss of culture 
1571 barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference 
1572 the story the movie tells is of brian de palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career 
1573 miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it 's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images 
1574 made for teens and reviewed as such , this is recommended only for those under 20 years of age ... and then only as a very mild rental 
1575 the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface 
1576 it 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie 
1577 when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best 
1578 if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright , then blood work is for you 
1579 great dragons ! 
1580 proves that some movie formulas do n't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie 
1581 the powerful success of read my lips with such provocative material shows why , after only three films , director\/co-writer jacques audiard , though little known in this country , belongs in the very top rank of french filmmakers 
1582 most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river 
1583 it 's jagger 's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite 
1584 a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs 
1585 kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers 
1586 a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort 
1587 pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other 
1588 `` one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? '' 
1589 kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie 
1590 an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it 
1591 david spade as citizen kane ? 
1592 but fans of the show should not consider this a diss 
1593 director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime 's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks 
1594 when mr. hundert tells us in his narration that ` this is a story without surprises , ' we nod in agreement 
1595 although barbershop boasts some of today 's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ` 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom 
1596 director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place 
1597 like kubrick , soderbergh is n't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way 
1598 the very definition of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure 
1599 '' 
1600 sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end 
1601 i can imagine this movie as a b & w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless 
1602 at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope 
1603 a brutally dry satire of middle american numbness 
1604 it 's too bad that the rest is n't more compelling 
1605 more vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it 's inoffensive and actually rather sweet 
1606 it is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events 
1607 this is one of the year 's best films 
1608 the wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough 
1609 sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -lrb- ahola -rrb- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation 
1610 mild , meandering teen flick 
1611 this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang 's forte and it shows 
1612 while guzmán frustratingly refuses to give pinochet 's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable 
1613 life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities 
1614 the strength of the film lies in its two central performances by sven wollter as the stricken composer and viveka seldahl as his desperate violinist wife 
1615 absorbing character study by andré turpin 
1616 unfortunately , that 's precisely what arthur dong 's family fundamentals does 
1617 instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions 
1618 an odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it did n't try to 
1619 a headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar 's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity 
1620 the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness 
1621 an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years 
1622 a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children 's television 
1623 despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity 
1624 coppola 's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema 
1625 so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter 's the thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat 
1626 with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s 
1627 among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations 
1628 a reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz , spielberg knows how to tell us about people 
1629 collapses under its own meager weight 
1630 does n't deserve a passing grade -lrb- even on a curve -rrb- 
1631 white oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that does n't mean you wo n't like looking at it 
1632 at once disarmingly straightforward and strikingly devious 
1633 if you 're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de sade and what might have happened at picpus , sade is your film 
1634 i do n't blame eddie murphy but should n't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
1635 the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people 
1636 a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse 
1637 this in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come 
1638 this is n't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work 
1639 the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair 
1640 this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences ... and it 's all the stronger because of it 
1641 so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic 
1642 solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous 
1643 collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly 
1644 here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior 
1645 `` catch me '' feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark 
1646 `` solaris '' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work 
1647 in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh 
1648 -lrb- t -rrb- his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen 
1649 it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it 
1650 while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket 
1651 meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull 
1652 pacino and williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film 
1653 this is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom 
1654 sa da tay ! 
1655 by the end you ca n't help but feel ` stoked

1658 half past dead is just such an achievement 
1659 on its own , it 's not very interesting

1661 the performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart 
1662 peter jackson has done the nearly impossible 
1663 the movie enters a realm where few non-porn films venture , and comes across as darkly funny , energetic , and surprisingly gentle 
1664 less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle 
1665 director chris wedge and screenwriters michael berg , michael j. wilson and peter ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time 
1666 and it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting 
1667 evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet 's `` house of games '' and last fall 's `` heist '' so much fun 
1668 ... the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught 
1669 one of the most original american productions this year , you 'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state

1672 there 's a lot of tooth in roger dodger 
1673 a brutal and funny work 
1674 ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , and based on three short films and two features , here 's betting her third feature will be something to behold 
1675 we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity 
1676 director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great 
1677 a biopic about crane 's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video 
1678 blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation 
1679 melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold 
1680 it 's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend 
1681 a great companion piece to other napoleon films 
1682 it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one 
1683 however , it 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome 
1684 between bursts of automatic gunfire , the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism 
1685 kinnear ... gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life 's ultimate losers 
1686 it has plenty of laughs 
1687 beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing 
1688 it 's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true ` epic ' 
1689 but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources 
1690 and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch 
1691 transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games 
1692 what 's left is a rich stew of longing 
1693 -lrb- denis ' -rrb- bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product 
1694 snipes is both a snore and utter tripe 
1695 suffice to say that after seeing this movie in imax form , you 'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of tom hanks ' face than his wife is 
1696 the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect 
1697 the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film 
1698 not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise 
1699 shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ... 
1700 ` sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates 
1701 stephen earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type 
1702 77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does 
1703 a colorful , vibrant introduction to a universal human impulse , lushly photographed and beautifully recorded 
1704 a droll , bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small-town pretension in the lone star state 
1705 full of surprises 
1706 whether or not ram dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness , fierce grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one 
1707 the whole thing 's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels 
1708 vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop 
1709 one of the best rock documentaries ever 
1710 as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them 
1711 a picture as erratic as its central character 
1712 somehow ms. griffiths and mr. pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy 
1713 if the film 's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start 
1714 while somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you 've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out 
1715 if anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans 
1716 boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie 
1717 claude chabrol 's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements 
1718 the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise 
1719 anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film 
1720 it 's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic 
1721 nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows 
1722 precocious smarter-than-thou wayward teen struggles to rebel against his oppressive , right-wing , propriety-obsessed family 
1723 ` unfaithful ' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory 
1724 yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling 
1725 much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché 
1726 the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on büttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history 
1727 derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone 
1728 i like it 
1729 birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters 
1730 ` god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves 
1731 ' 
1732 poignant japanese epic about adolescent anomie and heartbreak 
1733 a little uneven to be the cat 's meow , but it 's good enough to be the purr 
1734 -lrb- there 's -rrb- quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin 
1735 it 's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! 
1736 giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun 
1737 the film is insightful about kissinger 's background and history 
1738 it makes me feel weird \/ thinking about all the bad things in the world \/ like puppies with broken legs \/ and butterflies that die \/ and movies starring pop queens 
1739 with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment 
1740 a brilliant , absurd collection of vignettes that , in their own idiosyncratic way , sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium 
1741 beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that 's there to scare while we delight in the images 
1742 it 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film 
1743 charming and funny -lrb- but ultimately silly -rrb- movie 
1744 this is n't a stand up and cheer flick ; it 's a sit down and ponder affair 
1745 this story still seems timely and important 
1746 a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise 
1747 jae-eun jeong 's take care of my cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the south korean cinema 
1748 the film 's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth 
1749 like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being , the hours is one of those reputedly `` unfilmable '' novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right 
1750 you 'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you 'll laugh 
1751 as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good 
1752 the footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with suge knight are just two of the elements that will grab you 
1753 -lrb- f -rrb- rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels 
1754 it 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction 
1755 it is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished 
1756 quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year ... a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that is n't afraid to admit it does n't have all the answers 
1757 your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit 
1758 although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it 's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film 
1759 you can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed 
1760 feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen 
1761 definitely funny stuff , but it 's more of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with 
1762 ' 
1763 ... pray does n't have a passion for the material 
1764 resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter 's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings 
1765 plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood 
1766 the increasingly diverse french director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history 
1767 the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama 
1768 lush and beautifully photographed -lrb- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -rrb- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered 
1769 instead of using george and lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george 's haplessness and lucy 's personality tics 
1770 it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera 
1771 one of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years 
1772 sometimes this ` blood ' seems as tired as its protagonist ... still , the pulse never disappears entirely , and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game 
1773 the piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control 
1774 kenneth branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles 
1775 the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy 
1776 enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts ... what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage 's best acting 
1777 it is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged 
1778 too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work 
1779 this romantic\/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in 
1780 visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it 's the very definition of epic adventure 
1781 full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters 
1782 the movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten 
1783 if you 've the patience , there are great rewards here 
1784 devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects 
1785 those of you who do n't believe in santa claus probably also think that sequels can never capture the magic of the original 
1786 it 's the type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least 
1787 remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? 
1788 perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis 's wall of kitsch hard going 
1789 real women have curves does n't offer any easy answers 
1790 weird , vulgar comedy that 's definitely an acquired taste 
1791 the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line 
1792 writer\/director alexander payne -lrb- election -rrb- and his co-writer jim taylor brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look american angst in the eye and end up laughing 
1793 if you can push on through the slow spots , you 'll be rewarded with some fine acting 
1794 chris columbus ' sequel is faster , livelier and a good deal funnier than his original 
1795 this is the stuff that disney movies are made of 
1796 what 's invigorating about it is that it does n't give a damn 
1797 it 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny 
1798 the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers 
1799 it 's makes a better travelogue than movie 
1800 it 's a masterpiece 
1801 ... will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks 
1802 been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional 
1803 i have to admit i walked out of runteldat 
1804 a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls 
1805 -- but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i 've had in a while 
1806 the unexplored story opportunities of `` punch-drunk love '' may have worked against the maker 's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer\/director anderson 
1807 there are now two signs that m. night shyamalan 's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs 
1808 films are made of little moments 
1809 if cinema had been around to capture the chaos of france in the 1790 's , one imagines the result would look like something like this 
1810 this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking 
1811 what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else 
1812 what `` empire '' lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart 
1813 the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard 
1814 it 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one 
1815 this starts off with a 1950 's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast 
1816 standing by yourself is haunting ... -lrb- it 's -rrb- what punk rock music used to be , and what the video medium could use more of : spirit , perception , conviction 
1817 a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless 
1818 all in all , a great party 
1819 a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it does n't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world 
1820 lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it does n't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for -lrb- and misses -rrb- 
1821 about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life 
1822 -lrb- seems -rrb- even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels 
1823 credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic 
1824 it 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary 
1825 it 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good 
1826 -lrb- l -rrb- ame and unnecessary 
1827 while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel 
1828 i 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche 
1829 a mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book 
1830 ... the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning 
1831 or that the battery on your watch has died 
1832 as hannibal would say , yes , ` it 's like having an old friend for dinner ' 
1833 it 's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime 
1834 imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor 
1835 vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order 
1836 the whole affair is as predictable as can be 
1837 see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion 
1838 always destined to be measured against anthony asquith 's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation 
1839 try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns ' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde 
1840 hoffman 's performance is authentic to the core of his being 
1841 chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them 
1842 the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache 
1843 the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites 
1844 nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks 
1845 bad and baffling from the get-go 
1846 the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm 
1847 i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all 
1848 the filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching 
1849 walsh ca n't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice 's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm 
1850 harmless fun 
1851 astonishingly skillful and moving ... it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one 
1852 feeling to it , but like the 1920 's , the trip there is a great deal of fun 
1853 unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes 
1854 what 's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? 
1855 eight legged freaks is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and leaves you feeling like you 've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer 
1856 the bottom line is the piece works brilliantly 
1857 purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons 
1858 tends to plod 
1859 succeeds only because bullock and grant were made to share the silver screen 
1860 eric byler 's nuanced pic avoids easy sentiments and explanations ... 
1861 pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle 
1862 indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions 
1863 the one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded 
1864 i have two words to say about reign of fire 
1865 the pace of the film is very slow -lrb- for obvious reasons -rrb- and that too becomes off-putting 
1866 stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish 
1867 the film grows on you 
1868 though its story is only surface deep , the visuals and enveloping sounds of blue crush make this surprisingly decent flick worth a summertime look-see 
1869 this chicago has hugely imaginative and successful casting to its great credit , as well as one terrific score and attitude to spare 
1870 first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people 
1871 an often unfunny romp 
1872 a whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking christian-themed fun 
1873 this odd , distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film 
1874 during the tuxedo 's 90 minutes of screen time , there is n't one true ` chan moment ' 
1875 it 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable 
1876 the date movie that franz kafka would have made 
1877 plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas 
1878 ... pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism 
1879 features fincher 's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity 
1880 bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie 
1881 the movie should be credited with remembering his victims 
1882 before long , you 're desperate for the evening to end 
1883 watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen 
1884 what bloody sunday lacks in clarity , it makes up for with a great , fiery passion 
1885 `` red dragon '' never cuts corners 
1886 an ambitious movie that , like shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do n't come off 
1887 although shot with little style , skins is heartfelt and achingly real 
1888 cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals 
1889 the results , if not memorable , are at least interesting 
1890 it looks good , but it is essentially empty 
1891 young everlyn sampi , as the courageous molly craig , simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film 
1892 that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion 
1893 a knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite son of the bride 
1894 sure , i hated myself in the morning 
1895 but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr. de niro 
1896 the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -lrb- and no one -rrb- 
1897 it 's a great performance and a reminder of dickens ' grandeur 
1898 not at all clear what it 's trying to say and even if it were -- i doubt it would be all that interesting 
1899 a movie where story is almost an afterthought amidst a swirl of colors and inexplicable events 
1900 real women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way 
1901 what i saw , i enjoyed 
1902 lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking 
1903 it appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making 
1904 the dangerous lives of altar boys ' take on adolescence feels painfully true 
1905 witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image , but it 's dench who really steals the show 
1906 spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units 
1907 the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor 
1908 how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood 
1909 at its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture 
1910 there are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it 's going to be a trip 
1911 i 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : this erotic cannibal movie is boring 
1912 no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore 
1913 maybe you 'll be lucky , and there 'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back 
1914 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , however , robert rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking 
1915 less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino 's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations 
1916 ... unbearably lame 
1917 certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either 
1918 where the film falters is in its tone 
1919 this film biggest problem ? 
1920 this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn 
1921 the gags are often a stitch 
1922 the complex , politically charged tapestry of contemporary chinese life this exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen is like nothing we westerners have seen before 
1923 the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito 's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless 
1924 the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of ` hypertime ' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids 
1925 it wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty 
1926 -lrb- shyamalan -rrb- continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision 
1927 as averse as i usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies , this one got to me 
1928 you 'll know a star when you see one 
1929 sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it 
1930 it 's another retelling of alexandre dumas ' classic 
1931 in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do 
1932 ' 
1933 this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family 
1934 horrible 
1935 you could love safe conduct -lrb- laissez passer -rrb- for being a subtitled french movie that is 170 minutes long 
1936 if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that 's so bad it starts to become good 
1937 it 's like an old warner bros. costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie errol flynn always wanted to make , though bette davis , cast as joan , would have killed him 
1938 grating and tedious 
1939 at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue 
1940 better effects , better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh 
1941 it 's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience 
1942 none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him 
1943 a keep - 'em - guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters 
1944 a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell 
1945 an elegant and sly deadpan comedy 
1946 neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price 
1947 the delicious trimmings ... arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute ... with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind 's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two 
1948 the movie is a dud 
1949 it 's not particularly subtle ... however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion 
1950 unfolds in a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow 
1951 does n't do more than expand a tv show to movie length 
1952 expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished 
1953 one of the best movies of the year 
1954 by applying definition to both sides of the man , the picture realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject 
1955 the movie turns out to be -lrb- assayas ' -rrb- homage to the gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness 
1956 once the downward spiral comes to pass , auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera ... 
1957 tsai ming-liang 's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being 
1958 ` butterfingered ' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach 
1959 cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes 
1960 berry 's saucy , full-bodied performance gives this aging series a much needed kick , making `` die another day '' one of the most entertaining bonds in years 
1961 despite the film 's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character 's gripping humanity 
1962 if you love reading and\/or poetry , then by all means check it out 
1963 driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm ... the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs 
1964 douglas mcgrath 's nicholas nickleby does dickens as it should be done cinematically 
1965 diane lane 's sophisticated performance ca n't rescue adrian lyne 's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing 
1966 simply put , `` far from heaven '' is a masterpiece 
1967 shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives 
1968 mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens ' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero 's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness 
1969 anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy 
1970 a worthwhile documentary , whether you 're into rap or not , even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll 
1971 halloween : resurrection is n't exactly quality cinema , but it is n't nearly as terrible as it cold have been 
1972 it seems grant does n't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all 
1973 works because we 're never sure if ohlinger 's on the level or merely a dying , delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks 
1974 the original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! 
1975 the venezuelans say things like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to americans 
1976 it 's a fun adventure movie for kids -lrb- of all ages -rrb- that like adventure 
1977 one sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot 
1978 limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly 
1979 no amount of nostalgia for carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it 
1980 consistently clever and suspenseful 
1981 this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be 
1982 a real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who 's ever waited in a doctor 's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office 
1983 ... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride 
1984 if you 're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you 're at the right film 
1985 one funny popcorn flick 
1986 bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them 
1987 i 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year 
1988 a gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable 
1989 smith finds amusing juxtapositions that justify his exercise 
1990 a charming , banter-filled comedy ... one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface 
1991 it 's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor 
1992 hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever 
1993 it 's mildly amusing , but i certainly ca n't recommend it 
1994 this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension 
1995 formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip 
1996 for a movie audience , the hours does n't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love 
1997 what madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once 
1998 rifkin 's references are ... impeccable throughout 
1999 insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it does n't disgrace it , either 
2000 the director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut 
2001 the fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it 
2002 an enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences ... the château is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten 
2003 try hell house , which documents the cautionary christian spook-a-rama of the same name

2009 the lightest , most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade 
2010 if i want a real movie , i 'll buy the criterion dvd 
2011 an earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool 
2012 a conventional but heartwarming tale 
2013 a sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect 
2014 there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills 
2015 the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage 
2016 there 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties 
2017 strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency 
2018 almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai 's villainous father to the endless action sequences 
2019 it wo n't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it 
2020 the formula is familiar but enjoyable 
2021 its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure 
2022 less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself 
2023 good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing 
2024 the trinity assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and george ratliff 's documentary , hell house , reflects their earnestness -- which makes for a terrifying film 
2025 just is n't as weird as it ought to be 
2026 if you love the music , and i do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary ... 
2027 watching queen of the damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in 
2028 stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom 
2029 the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage 
2030 while there are times when the film 's reach exceeds its grasp , the production works more often than it does n't 
2031 hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense 
2032 exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera ... more salacious telenovela than serious drama 
2033 i 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment 
2034 why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
2035 a thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` the thing ' and a geriatric ` scream 
2036 ' 
2037 contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom 
2038 laughably , irredeemably awful 
2039 one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before 
2040 together -lrb- time out and human resources -rrb- establish mr. cantet as france 's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace 
2041 ... a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy ... 
2042 everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line 
2043 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids 
2044 reno himself can take credit for most of the movie 's success 
2045 boldly engineering a collision between tawdry b-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , rose 's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer 
2046 outside of burger 's desire to make some kind of film , it 's really unclear why this project was undertaken 
2047 as for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all 
2048 if you saw it on tv , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie 
2049 while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context 
2050 journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull 
2051 brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film 
2052 like mike is n't going to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience -lrb- young bow wow fans -rrb- - with nothing but net 
2053 exposing the ways we fool ourselves is one hour photo 's real strength 
2054 the gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon 
2055 while the path may be familiar , first-time director denzel washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting 
2056 standing in the shadows of motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow 
2057 the filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ... 
2058 a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story 
2059 j. lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl 
2060 this documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what -lrb- evans -rrb- had , lost , and got back 
2061 their work is fantastic 
2062 much of the movie 's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo 
2063 looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito 's way 
2064 a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility 
2065 like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover 
2066 jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it 
2067 do we really need the tiger beat version ? 
2068 if it 's unnerving suspense you 're after -- you 'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for 
2069 gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways 
2070 a beautiful paean to a time long past 
2071 a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world 
2072 an extremely funny , ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china 
2073 sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before 
2074 bad in such a bizarre way that it 's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste 
2075 an ambitious and moving but bleak film 
2076 but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness 
2077 and diesel is n't the actor to save it 
2078 only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate 
2079 a feeble tootsie knockoff 
2080 see it for his performance if nothing else 
2081 terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life 
2082 the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense 
2083 a thriller without a lot of thrills 
2084 yet the act is still charming here 
2085 strictly middle of the road 
2086 far more enjoyable than its predecessor 
2087 i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd 
2088 a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide 
2089 phillip noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , christopher doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of greene 's prose , and it 's there on the screen in their version of the quiet american 
2090 though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous 
2091 barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time 
2092 this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie 
2093 ' 
2094 even at its worst , it 's not half-bad 
2095 ... even if you 've never heard of chaplin , you 'll still be glued to the screen 
2096 a long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral 
2097 i would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that should n't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable 
2098 the concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers 
2099 most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears 
2100 vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two english women 
2101 queen of the damned is too long with too little going on 
2102 whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors 
2103 the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing 
2104 it ai n't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year 's lame musketeer , this dumas adaptation entertains 
2105 campanella 's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael 's evolution 
2106 schütte 's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close 
2107 would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial new yorker if 26-year-old reese witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character , melanie carmichael , with a massive infusion of old-fashioned hollywood magic 
2108 a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness 
2109 their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes 
2110 cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation -lrb- career - kids = misery -rrb- in tiresome romantic-comedy duds 
2111 naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation 
2112 idiotic and ugly 
2113 ` film aficionados can not help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director 's cut 
2114 ' 
2115 if you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore , you 'll see del toro has brought unexpected gravity to blade ii 
2116 hard , endearing , caring , warm 
2117 the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character 
2118 - greaseballs mob action-comedy 
2119 visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay 
2120 writer and director otar iosseliani 's pleasant tale about a factory worker who escapes for a holiday in venice reveals how we all need a playful respite from the grind to refresh our souls 
2121 a refreshingly realistic , affectation-free coming-of-age tale 
2122 `` simone '' is a fun and funky look into an artificial creation in a world that thrives on artificiality 
2123 is truth stranger than fiction ? 
2124 supposedly , pokemon ca n't be killed , but pokemon 4ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over 
2125 the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing 
2126 it 's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film 
2127 you have to see it 
2128 pray has really done his subject justice 
2129 some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent 
2130 will you go ape over this movie ? 
2131 ... the implication is kissinger may have decided that -- when it comes to truncheoning -- it 's better to give than to receive 
2132 woody , what happened ? 
2133 but it 's also disappointing to a certain degree 
2134 coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock 
2135 bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers 
2136 at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated -lrb- depending upon where you live -rrb- , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two 
2137 a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad 
2138 a semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it 
2139 the skills of a calculus major at m.i.t. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ? 
2140 though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation 
2141 efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug 
2142 two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy 
2143 could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals 
2144 the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly 
2145 offers big , fat , dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in 
2146 hardly a film that comes along every day 
2147 definitely worth 95 minutes of your time 
2148 certainly the big finish was n't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for ... but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps 
2149 rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine 
2150 there 's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream 
2151 it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi 
2152 `` it 's all about the image 
2153 '' 
2154 the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated 
2155 this may be dover kosashvili 's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic 
2156 i 'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up 
2157 this beautifully animated epic is never dull 
2158 human nature , in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart 
2159 davis ... gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences 
2160 even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities 
2161 an enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving 
2162 neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment 
2163 a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last 
2164 the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions 
2165 this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story 
2166 take nothing seriously and enjoy the ride 
2167 any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors 
2168 it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story 
2169 still rapturous after all these years , cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love 
2170 be patient with the lovely hush ! 
2171 the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way 
2172 i 'd be lying if i said my ribcage did n't ache by the end of kung pow 
2173 it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made 
2174 an entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller 
2175 and the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence 
2176 whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear 
2177 all comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad 
2178 the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i ca n't remember a single name responsible for it 
2179 all too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` angels with dirty faces ' appeared in 1938 
2180 seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago 
2181 this is a truly , truly bad movie 
2182 the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful 
2183 both flawed and delayed , martin scorcese 's gangs of new york still emerges as his most vital work since goodfellas 
2184 what ` blade runner ' would 've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel 
2185 there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do n't care about being stupid 
2186 an ebullient tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing 
2187 a lovely film for the holiday season 
2188 ... ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that wo n't win many fans over the age of 12 
2189 after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here , it 's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen 
2190 tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother 
2191 a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair 's film is an absolute delight for all audiences 
2192 when you think you 've figured out bielinsky 's great game , that 's when you 're in the most trouble : he 's the con , and you 're just the mark 
2193 the most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any `` jackass '' fan could want 
2194 k-19 : the widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining 
2195 every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable 
2196 by that measure , it is a failure 
2197 rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf 's encounter with the world 
2198 seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one 
2199 ... a pretentious mess ... 
2200 full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! 
2201 `` 13 conversations '' holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point 
2202 so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned 
2203 laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale 
2204 in the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned 
2205 remove spider-man the movie from its red herring surroundings and it 's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies 
2206 spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning 
2207 , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller 
2208 -lrb- raimi 's -rrb- matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it 's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you 'll ever see 
2209 what makes the movie special is its utter sincerity 
2210 the thing just never gets off the ground 
2211 after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget 
2212 the film oozes craft 
2213 once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny 
2214 funny , sexy , devastating and incurably romantic 
2215 eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath 
2216 and how 
2217 an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting 
2218 not one moment in the enterprise did n't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow 
2219 norton holds the film together 
2220 this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship 
2221 the densest distillation of roberts ' movies ever made 
2222 with this masterful , flawless film , -lrb- wang -rrb- emerges in the front ranks of china 's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers 
2223 a live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze 
2224 throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
2225 ong chooses to present ah na 's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character 's blank-faced optimism 
2226 the large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes 
2227 a finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere 
2228 egoyan 's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose 
2229 an original little film about one young woman 's education 
2230 by the end , you just do n't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich -lrb- that would be reno -rrb- gets his comeuppance 
2231 it 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids 
2232 too bad maggio could n't come up with a better script 
2233 sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching 
2234 a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned 
2235 charming , if overly complicated ... 
2236 it 's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor 
2237 will no doubt delight plympton 's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting 
2238 all mood and no movie 
2239 the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments ... but it 's such a warm and charming package that you 'll feel too happy to argue much 
2240 will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year 
2241 what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea 
2242 a half-assed film 
2243 it 's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible 
2244 the most ingenious film comedy since being john malkovich 
2245 being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough 
2246 the cast is phenomenal , especially the women 
2247 inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening 
2248 director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two 
2249 much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors 
2250 a chiller resolutely without chills 
2251 while -lrb- roman coppola -rrb- scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story 
2252 the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie 
2253 and it is 
2254 even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking 
2255 mildly amusing 
2256 imperfect ? 
2257 missteps take what was otherwise a fascinating , riveting story and send it down the path of the mundane 
2258 this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy 
2259 a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you 're going to alter the bard 's ending , you 'd better have a good alternative 
2260 there 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits 
2261 no , it 's not as single-minded as john carpenter 's original , but it 's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels 
2262 the boys ' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story 's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements 
2263 beating the austin powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness 
2264 while this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it 's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience 
2265 viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm 's performance , the film would be a total washout 
2266 there 's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme 
2267 - spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together 
2268 there 's already been too many of these films ... 
2269 peralta 's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight 
2270 we want the funk - and this movie 's got it 
2271 `` the kid stays in the picture '' is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat 
2272 creeps you out in high style , even if nakata did it better 
2273 -lrb- a -rrb- thoughtful , visually graceful work 
2274 shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling 
2275 ` snow dogs ' has both 
2276 like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie does n't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome 
2277 almost 
2278 a waterlogged version of ` fatal attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads 
2279 the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work 
2280 the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar 
2281 kudos to the most enchanting film of the year 
2282 the engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that 's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion 
2283 by its modest , straight-ahead standards , undisputed scores a direct hit 
2284 chances are you wo n't , either 
2285 i 'm guessing the director is a magician 
2286 a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france 's most inventive directors 
2287 it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere 
2288 that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel 
2289 none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest

2291 ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness 
2292 i saw juwanna mann so you do n't have to 
2293 kids do n't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there 's lots of cute animals and clumsy people 
2294 it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling 
2295 wonder , hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars 
2296 while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary 
2297 here 's my advice , kev 
2298 haneke 's script -lrb- from elfriede jelinek 's novel -rrb- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending 
2299 there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew 
2300 the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality 
2301 tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham 
2302 filmmaker tian zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power 
2303 ... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made 
2304 it 's about time 
2305 the importance of being earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from bartlett 's familiar quotations 
2306 five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before 
2307 director alfonso cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of french new wave films 
2308 ... manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun

2314 the sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame 
2315 the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing 
2316 ... digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations 
2317 much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep 
2318 unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate 
2319 it 's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages 
2320 an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal 
2321 yes they can swim , the title is merely anne-sophie birot 's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through 
2322 -lrb- scherfig -rrb- has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters ' lives after the clever credits roll 
2323 it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie 's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie 's most admirable quality 
2324 a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies 
2325 -lrb- johnnie to and wai ka fai are -rrb- sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers 
2326 conceptually brilliant ... plays like a living-room war of the worlds , gaining most of its unsettling force from the suggested and the unknown 
2327 this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head 
2328 -lrb- danny huston gives -rrb- an astounding performance that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent 's smirk 
2329 in addition to hoffman 's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday 
2330 thin period piece 
2331 this is n't exactly profound cinema , but it 's good-natured and sometimes quite funny 
2332 hailed as a clever exercise in neo-hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately chabrolian 
2333 it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject 
2334 a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole 
2335 because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low - budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly -lrb- but not sophomoric -rrb- romp through horror and hellish conditions 
2336 the picture does n't know it 's a comedy 
2337 touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society ... might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants 
2338 yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack ... and his chemistry with shimizu is very believable 
2339 works , it 's thanks to huston 's revelatory performance 
2340 in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle 
2341 ararat feels like a book report 
2342 the beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -lrb- godard 's -rrb- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice 
2343 tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience 
2344 it 's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 
2345 a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood 's comic-book adaptations 
2346 my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack 
2347 audacious-impossible yet compelling ... 
2348 a quasi-documentary by french filmmaker karim dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of cuban music 
2349 family fare 
2350 ... a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that 's likely to irk viewers 
2351 the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates 
2352 one of recent memory 's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise 
2353 god is great , the movie 's not 
2354 ... a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor 
2355 even if you 're an agnostic carnivore , you can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor 
2356 one of the best of a growing strain of daring films ... that argue that any sexual relationship that does n't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect 
2357 set in a 1986 harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in new york 
2358 if you do n't ... well , skip to another review 
2359 in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni 's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it 
2360 evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones 
2361 they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness 
2362 with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon 's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone 
2363 in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded 
2364 perhaps it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing , ' but it is 
2365 as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved 
2366 almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called ` the gift of tears 
2367 ' 
2368 a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys 
2369 ... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid 
2370 and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception 
2371 it 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it 
2372 an old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher 's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue 
2373 another useless recycling of a brutal mid - '70s american sports movie 
2374 the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics 
2375 hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining 
2376 as literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children 's entertainment 
2377 this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering 
2378 goofy , nutty , consistently funny 
2379 two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all 
2380 if `` lilo & stitch '' is n't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since `` dumbo '' certainly ranks as the most original in years 
2381 while it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight 
2382 it 's a talking head documentary , but a great one 
2383 an extremely unpleasant film 
2384 director juan jose campanella could have turned this into an argentine retread of `` iris '' or `` american beauty , '' but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films 
2385 not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans 
2386 after seeing the film , i can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it 
2387 an `` o bruin , where art thou ? '' 
2388 it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie 
2389 merely -lrb- and literally -rrb- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense 
2390 terrible 
2391 throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material 
2392 chai 's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack 
2393 if you grew up on scooby -- you 'll love this movie 
2394 enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary 
2395 if you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy 
2396 the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder 
2397 it will break your heart many times over 
2398 millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry 
2399 any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss 
2400 it 's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen 
2401 some episodes work , some do n't 
2402 like its new england characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness 
2403 all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject 
2404 a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun 
2405 for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale 
2406 a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda 
2407 about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more , houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him 
2408 disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other john woo flick for that matter 
2409 it may not be `` last tango in paris '' but ... 
2410 it 's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence 
2411 becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters 
2412 murderous maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy ... 
2413 it 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time 
2414 the movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth 
2415 ... delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story 
2416 it is n't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure ! 
2417 the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy 
2418 a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling 
2419 it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did 
2420 in his latest effort , storytelling , solondz has finally made a movie that is n't just offensive -- it also happens to be good 
2421 enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre 
2422 a smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy 
2423 stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about 
2424 a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness 
2425 reyes ' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it 's undone by a sloppy script 
2426 it wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy hawaiian shirt 
2427 it 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting 
2428 ... the film 's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama 
2429 ' 
2430 harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden 
2431 symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal 
2432 they were right 
2433 you come away from his film overwhelmed , hopeful and , perhaps paradoxically , illuminated 
2434 equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 
2435 a film of delicate interpersonal dances 
2436 -lrb- westbrook -rrb- makes a wonderful subject for the camera 
2437 cusack 's just brilliant in this 
2438 what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is 
2439 never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches ... gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving 
2440 every child 's story is what matters 
2441 there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy 
2442 few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt 's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying 
2443 ferrara 's best film in years 
2444 we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat 
2445 spare yet audacious ... 
2446 ` all in all , reign of fire will be a good -lrb- successful -rrb- rental 
2447 ' 
2448 sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't 
2449 watching war photographer , you come to believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals 
2450 you 'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous -lrb- than leon -rrb- 
2451 what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky 
2452 ... only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction 
2453 ash wednesday is not edward burns ' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film 
2454 the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma 
2455 ms. phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening 
2456 when not wallowing in its characters ' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems 
2457 polished , well-structured film 
2458 basically , it 's pretty but dumb 
2459 the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung 
2460 an eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake 
2461 but there 's plenty to offend everyone ... 
2462 after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course 
2463 suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling 
2464 an exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama 
2465 stuart 's poor-me persona needs a whole bunch of snowball 's cynicism to cut through the sugar coating 
2466 one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense 
2467 stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* 
2468 alain choquart 's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating 
2469 an intelligently made -lrb- and beautifully edited -rrb- picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch 
2470 charlie hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a dickensian hero 
2471 what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test 
2472 the film has -lrb- its -rrb- moments , but they are few and far between 
2473 if religious films are n't your bailiwick , stay away 
2474 this enthralling documentary ... is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends 
2475 schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying 
2476 a wild , endearing , masterful documentary 
2477 on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it 
2478 a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment 
2479 the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood 
2480 if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it 
2481 there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see 
2482 a minor-league soccer remake of the longest yard 
2483 ` it 's painful to watch witherspoon 's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama 
2484 ' 
2485 nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick 
2486 it 's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan 
2487 at its worst , it 's rambo - meets-john ford 
2488 it 's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest 
2489 to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy 
2490 you wo n't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies 
2491 if you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , sweet home alabama is diverting in the manner of jeff foxworthy 's stand-up act 
2492 too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient 
2493 it does n't work as either 
2494 this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit 
2495 innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good 
2496 in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor 's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach 
2497 the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads 
2498 two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending 
2499 and your reward will be a thoughtful , emotional movie experience 
2500 obvious

2502 muddled , trashy and incompetent 
2503 `` birthday girl '' is an actor 's movie first and foremost 
2504 the little girls understand , and mccracken knows that 's all that matters 
2505 the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs 
2506 i liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive 
2507 that , in itself , is extraordinary 
2508 ... one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else 
2509 yes 
2510 sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology 
2511 k-19 : the widowmaker is a great yarn 
2512 and educational ! 
2513 in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls 
2514 an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that 's what makes it worth a recommendation 
2515 confessions is n't always coherent , but it 's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong 
2516 the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo 
2517 sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative 
2518 crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half 
2519 a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation 
2520 strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short 
2521 the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier 's oft-brilliant safe conduct -lrb- `` laissez-passer '' -rrb- wears its heart on its sleeve 
2522 i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short 
2523 ... despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches

2530 director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel

2532 ... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman 
2533 a small movie with a big heart

2535 most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement

2538 -lrb- taylor -rrb- takes us on a ride that 's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb 
2539 most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ; `` frailty '' leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home 
2540 the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited 
2541 this remake of lina wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero

2543 holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals

2545 lawrence plumbs personal tragedy and also the human comedy 
2546 maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while 
2547 tends to pile too many `` serious issues '' on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written 
2548 a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late 
2549 an inventive , absorbing movie that 's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist 
2550 -lrb- russell -rrb- makes good b movies -lrb- the mask , the blob -rrb- , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards 
2551 what little grace -lrb- rifkin 's -rrb- tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics 
2552 the last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful 
2553 however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence 
2554 the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas 
2555 supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment 
2556 no laughs

2561 mr. clooney , mr. kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster 
2562 it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction 
2563 both deserve better 
2564 between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season 
2565 upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that does n't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them 
2566 slap me , i saw this movie

2568 there 's no question that epps scores once or twice , but it 's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head 
2569 a coming-of-age tale from new zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board 
2570 the porky 's revenge : ultimate edition ? 
2571 ` it 's better to go in knowing full well what 's going to happen , but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists 
2572 a portrait of hell so shattering it 's impossible to shake 
2573 hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired 
2574 bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side 
2575 like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy 
2576 but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work 
2577 take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture , and he 'll be your slave for a year 
2578 miyazaki 's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period , no timeout 
2579 stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge 
2580 vereté has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs 
2581 ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film 
2582 gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés 
2583 director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity 
2584 a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing 
2585 if you want to see a train wreck that you ca n't look away from , then look no further , because here it is 
2586 gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic 
2587 then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed 
2588 a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard ... and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels 
2589 the re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well 
2590 if a horror movie 's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well ... a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride 
2591 oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between 
2592 often silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films 
2593 perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter 
2594 spielberg 's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later 
2595 -lrb- haynes ' -rrb- homage to such films as `` all that heaven allows '' and `` imitation of life '' transcends them 
2596 ... unlike -lrb- scorsese 's mean streets -rrb- , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot 
2597 you may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject 
2598 slow and ponderous , but rohmer 's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption 
2599 sheridan 's take on the author 's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life 
2600 godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence 
2601 under-rehearsed and lifeless 
2602 the film offers an intriguing what-if premise 
2603 this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired 
2604 you need n't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes ' work 
2605 rarely have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart 
2606 a witty , low-key romantic comedy 
2607 what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates 
2608 an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter 
2609 a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach 
2610 it 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c.h.o. still feels like a promising work-in-progress 
2611 a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing 
2612 a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes , but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two 
2613 even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage 
2614 with ` bowling for columbine , ' michael moore gives us the perfect starting point for a national conversation about guns , violence , and fear 
2615 i liked it just enough 
2616 it 's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge 
2617 after an uncertain start , murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock 's memorable first interrogation of gosling 
2618 a decidedly mixed bag 
2619 although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell 
2620 ... a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet 
2621 on top of a foundering performance , -lrb- madonna 's -rrb- denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag 
2622 it comes off as so silly that you would n't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van 
2623 paxton 's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre 
2624 on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it were n't such a clever adaptation of the bard 's tragic play 
2625 mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances ... and excellent use of music by india 's popular gulzar and jagjit singh 
2626 about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience 's meat grinder one more time 
2627 but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through 
2628 it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart 
2629 a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop 
2630 far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but more than that , it 's a work of enthralling drama 
2631 blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling -lrb- murder by numbers -rrb- , the movie is powerful and provocative 
2632 this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it 's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it 
2633 although it does n't always hang together -- violence and whimsy do n't combine easily -- `` cherish '' certainly is n't dull 
2634 the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility 
2635 it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us 
2636 a low-rent retread of the alien pictures 
2637 it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them 
2638 there 's none of the happily-ever - after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that 's part of what makes dover kosashvili 's outstanding feature debut so potent 
2639 the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another 
2640 a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman 
2641 has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre 
2642 it 's a rare window on an artistic collaboration 
2643 an unremarkable , modern action\/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title 
2644 report card : does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement 
2645 too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley 's least accessible screed yet 
2646 a backstage must-see for true fans of comedy 
2647 it 's got the brawn , but not the brains 
2648 but i do 
2649 lacks dramatic punch and depth 
2650 it may be a no-brainer , but at least it 's a funny no-brainer 
2651 like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions 
2652 who is this movie for ? 
2653 a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family 
2654 ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves 
2655 the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material 
2656 a relative letdown 
2657 from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out 
2658 a realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade-cop tales 
2659 brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life 's harshness 
2660 inconsequential road-and-buddy pic 
2661 with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it 's - good camp 
2662 it 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure 
2663 the leanest and meanest of solondz 's misanthropic comedies 
2664 about schmidt belongs to nicholson 
2665 its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work 
2666 starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches 
2667 unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers 
2668 even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern 
2669 it 's a sight to behold 
2670 the setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of `` intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game 
2671 if you 're not totally weirded - out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force 
2672 better than the tepid star trek : insurrection ; falls short of first contact because the villain could n't pick the lint off borg queen alice krige 's cape ; and finishes half a parsec -lrb- a nose -rrb- ahead of generations 
2673 at times the guys taps into some powerful emotions , but this kind of material is more effective on stage 
2674 anyone else seen this before ? 
2675 the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one 
2676 daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation 
2677 boyd 's screenplay -lrb- co-written with guardian hack nick davies -rrb- has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon 
2678 not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense 
2679 this deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications 
2680 i know that i 'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again 
2681 bearable 
2682 a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore 
2683 mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values 
2684 horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible 
2685 after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned 
2686 predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell 
2687 laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl 's dilemma 
2688 essentially a collection of bits -- and they 're all naughty 
2689 you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools 
2690 ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of chinese ` cultural revolution 
2691 ' 
2692 happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude 
2693 viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess 
2694 the viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers 
2695 with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in 
2696 i just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie 
2697 the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn 
2698 one of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it 's far tamer than advertised 
2699 a well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature 
2700 still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered 
2701 wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there 
2702 how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you 're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts 
2703 filmmakers dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann area headed east , far east , in retelling a historically significant , and personal , episode detailing how one international city welcomed tens of thousands of german jewish refugees while the world 's democracie 
2704 who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? 
2705 can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms ' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included 
2706 it 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix 's 
2707 in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick -lrb- but none of the sheer lust -rrb- 
2708 cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film 
2709 sometimes shorter is better 
2710 as schmidt , nicholson walks with a slow , deliberate gait , chooses his words carefully and subdues his natural exuberance 
2711 if you 're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , enough is just the ticket you need 
2712 hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares 
2713 maybe there 's a metaphor here , but figuring it out would n't make trouble every day any better 
2714 a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks 
2715 every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy 
2716 but it is entertaining on an inferior level 
2717 plummer steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas ' wounded and wounding uncle ralph 
2718 a penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic 
2719 evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes 
2720 the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era 
2721 the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , ` what if ? ' 
2722 it 's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing 
2723 as it is , it 's too long and unfocused 
2724 this is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one 
2725 i 'm not a fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy , ' but real women have curves truly is life affirming 
2726 too much of storytelling moves away from solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries 
2727 charlotte sometimes is a gem 
2728 the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it 
2729 the symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees 
2730 the result is more depressing than liberating , but it 's never boring 
2731 australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place 
2732 as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous 
2733 further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap 
2734 benigni presents himself as the boy puppet pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and american breckin meyer 's ridiculously inappropriate valley boy voice 
2735 -lrb- a -rrb- satisfying niblet 
2736 this is a more fascinating look at the future than `` bladerunner '' and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen 
2737 coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story 
2738 it rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide 
2739 you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored 
2740 i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him 
2741 payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he 's the best brush in the business 
2742 -lrb- siegel -rrb- and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie 
2743 while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think 
2744 meant for star wars fans 
2745 the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch 
2746 unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook 
2747 the film 's strength is n't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears 
2748 i do n't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version 
2749 a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women 
2750 broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient 
2751 mostly , -lrb- goldbacher -rrb- just lets her complicated characters be unruly , confusing and , through it all , human 
2752 even with its $ 50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture 
2753 adam sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt 
2754 a genuine mind-bender 
2755 the master of disguise is funny -- not `` ha ha '' funny , `` dead circus performer '' funny 
2756 cynical and serious look at teenage boys doing what they do best - being teenagers 
2757 just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain 
2758 that frenetic spectacle -lrb- on the tv show -rrb- has usually been leavened by a charm that 's conspicuously missing from the girls ' big-screen blowout 
2759 nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , warm water may well be the year 's best and most unpredictable comedy 
2760 she 's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness 
2761 qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating 
2762 this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos 
2763 what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
2764 too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good 
2765 as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile 
2766 a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more 
2767 on its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny 
2768 a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem 
2769 it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made -lrb- eyre 's -rrb- first film something of a sleeper success 
2770 personally , i 'd rather watch them on the animal planet 
2771 as commander-in-chief of this film , bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world 
2772 an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere 
2773 the art demands live viewing 
2774 paul cox needed to show it 
2775 astonishing ... -lrb- frames -rrb- profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment 
2776 more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology ... 
2777 although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters 
2778 quelle surprise ! 
2779 a stirring road movie 
2780 bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted - from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen 
2781 even with all its botches , enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment 
2782 the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable 
2783 there 's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence 
2784 if you 're in the right b-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you 
2785 city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for 
2786 dismally dull sci-fi comedy 
2787 it 's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids 
2788 executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond 
2789 maybe he was reading the minds of the audience 
2790 may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman 
2791 grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback 's heidegger - and nietzsche-referencing dialogue 
2792 burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off 
2793 less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling -lrb- though no less horrifying for it -rrb- 
2794 if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show is n't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time 
2795 it 's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil ' bow wow 
2796 it labours as storytelling 
2797 a first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you 
2798 maybe thomas wolfe was right : you ca n't go home again 
2799 the plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story 
2800 the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations 
2801 it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here 
2802 festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you 
2803 yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero 
2804 a buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we 're all in this together 
2805 the locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches 
2806 an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism 
2807 those who are n't put off by the film 's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them 
2808 we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product 
2809 tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it 
2810 veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda 
2811 has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal 's overweight and out of shape 
2812 like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable 
2813 a fascinating literary mystery story with multiple strands about the controversy of who really wrote shakespeare 's plays 
2814 just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience 
2815 ... one of the more influential works of the ` korean new wave ' 
2816 the closest thing to the experience of space travel 
2817 in the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , like mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency 
2818 right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination 
2819 while easier to sit through than most of jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it 's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points 
2820 bon appétit ! 
2821 a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story 
2822 as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth 
2823 boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas 
2824 the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative 
2825 two hours of junk 
2826 this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer 
2827 i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 
2828 -lrb- d -rrb- espite its familiar subject matter , ice age is consistently amusing and engrossing ... 
2829 though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should 
2830 alternative medicine obviously has its merits ... but ayurveda does the field no favors 
2831 a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange 
2832 it 's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe ... but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor 
2833 infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane 
2834 overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film 
2835 a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties 
2836 talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark 
2837 but the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes 
2838 not so much farcical as sour 
2839 like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery 
2840 the material and the production itself are little more than routine 
2841 aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane 
2842 it 's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history 
2843 far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year 's kubrick-meets-spielberg exercise 
2844 when it 's this rich and luscious , who cares ? 
2845 and `` they 're coming ! '' 
2846 a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick 
2847 informative , intriguing , observant , often touching ... gives a human face to what 's often discussed in purely abstract terms 
2848 a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message 
2849 a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids ' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder 
2850 at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience 
2851 skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience 
2852 what a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride 
2853 unlike most surf movies , blue crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave 
2854 be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards 
2855 it has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past 
2856 i 'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it does n't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks 
2857 it strikes hardest ... when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain 
2858 most consumers of lo mein and general tso 's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons 
2859 even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash 
2860 the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard -lrb- which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog -rrb- is that it 's not as obnoxious as tom green 's freddie got fingered 
2861 the filmmakers lack the nerve ... to fully exploit the script 's potential for sick humor 
2862 ill-considered , unholy hokum 
2863 it 's just merely very bad 
2864 a flick about our infantilized culture that is n't entirely infantile 
2865 rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects 
2866 what begins as a film in the tradition of the graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant 
2867 b picture , and i mean that as a compliment 
2868 leading a double life in an american film only comes to no good , but not here 
2869 or else a doggie winks 
2870 especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie 
2871 trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible 
2872 the film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard 
2873 this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen 
2874 this rich , bittersweet israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man pasach ` ke burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines 
2875 boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect 
2876 this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson 's e ! 
2877 a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set 
2878 an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video 
2879 the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary 
2880 the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat 
2881 exactly what its title implies : lusty , boisterous and utterly charming 
2882 what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip 
2883 cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny 
2884 heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter næss ' delicate , clever direction ... and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius 
2885 let 's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what 's next ... ghost blimp ? 
2886 with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés 
2887 based on dave barry 's popular book of the same name , the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters ' moves and overlapping story 
2888 what 's missing is what we call the ` wow ' factor 
2889 normally , rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable 
2890 even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have 
2891 you watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises 
2892 the urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative 
2893 the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here 
2894 it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , `` look at this ! 
2895 the film truly does rescue -lrb- the funk brothers -rrb- from motown 's shadows 
2896 this is not chabrol 's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer 
2897 alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise 
2898 it 's 51 times better than this 
2899 directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves are n't all that interesting 
2900 a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy 
2901 it 's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up 
2902 of all the halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing 
2903 light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time 
2904 it 's refreshing to see a romance this smart 
2905 sodden and glum , even in those moments where it 's supposed to feel funny and light 
2906 with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -lrb- crane -rrb- becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report 
2907 nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley 's breasts -- is authentic 
2908 a manically generous christmas vaudeville 
2909 the powder blues and sun-splashed whites of tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs 
2910 with dickens ' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath 's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told 
2911 certainly 
2912 simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad 
2913 i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise 
2914 it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film 
2915 the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i 've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work 
2916 these three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people 
2917 smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem 
2918 insanely hilarious ! 
2919 ... strips bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults 
2920 it 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it 's just grating 
2921 its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience 
2922 the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman 
2923 it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film 's length becomes a part of its fun 
2924 even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest 
2925 it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots 
2926 a feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about 
2927 this version of h.g. wells ' time machine was directed by h.g. wells ' great-grandson 
2928 give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour 
2929 i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism 
2930 if the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well 
2931 disturbing 
2932 the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers 
2933 it 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss 
2934 the ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well i 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong 
2935 why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me 
2936 the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish 
2937 the movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had 
2938 it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound 
2939 the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace does n't organize it with any particular insight 
2940 as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four 
2941 a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis 
2942 ... contains very few laughs and even less surprises 
2943 a horrible , 99-minute stink bomb 
2944 you can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you 've completely lowered your entertainment standards 
2945 it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely 
2946 earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding 
2947 a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise 
2948 the doofus-on - the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it 
2949 it is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year 
2950 the film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet 
2951 cinematic pratfalls given a working over 
2952 underachieves only in not taking the shakespeare parallels quite far enough 
2953 apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film 
2954 handled correctly , wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice 
2955 this is the best star trek movie in a long time 
2956 a remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive eisenhower era about one suburban woman 's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life 
2957 instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way , secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way 
2958 a winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others 
2959 writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic 
2960 like kissing jessica stein , amy 's orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor 
2961 it 's time to let your hair down -- greek style 
2962 charlize chases kevin with a gun 
2963 an edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era 
2964 the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge 
2965 steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens -- especially the a \*\* holes 
2966 ... the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation 
2967 starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera 
2968 the touch is generally light enough and the performances , for the most part , credible 
2969 it is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter 
2970 eight legged freaks wo n't join the pantheon of great monster\/science fiction flicks that we have come to love ... 
2971 a slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise 
2972 howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they 're often undone by howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject 
2973 this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things 
2974 the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face 
2975 it 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind 
2976 a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material 
2977 belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video\/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating 
2978 a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale 
2979 imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s 
2980 without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking 
2981 this humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that ` they do n't make movies like they used to anymore 
2982 ' 
2983 what does n't this film have that an impressionable kid could n't stand to hear ? 
2984 stevens ' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls 
2985 ` in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision 
2986 ' 
2987 pull -lrb- s -rrb- off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel 
2988 overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste 
2989 a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes ... almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination 
2990 the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward 
2991 occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma 
2992 we 've seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world 's greatest teacher 
2993 easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-semitism ever seen on screen 
2994 despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this 
2995 about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal 
2996 the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill 
2997 impostor ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies 
2998 ... either you 're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you 're not 
2999 a great script brought down by lousy direction 
3000 a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise 
3001 its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition 
3002 new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is 
3003 rubbo runs through a remarkable amount of material in the film 's short 90 minutes 
3004 while this film has an ` a ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love 
3005 zoom ! 
3006 it 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest 
3007 the creative animation work may not look as fully ` rendered ' as pixar 's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree 
3008 every sequel you skip will be two hours gained 
3009 it 's hard to imagine anybody ever being `` in the mood '' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it 's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it 's started 
3010 it gives devastating testimony to both people 's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good 
3011 makes one thing abundantly clear 
3012 like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless 
3013 cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story 
3014 ' 
3015 too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility 
3016 into scrooge 
3017 the film is full of charm 
3018 it 's not the least of afghan tragedies that this noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history 
3019 the power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing did n't get our moral hackles up 
3020 the result might look like vulgar 
3021 there are no special effects , and no hollywood endings 
3022 while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs -lrb- including a knockout of a closing line -rrb- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity 
3023 we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies 
3024 a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage `` be careful what you wish for '' is given a full workout 
3025 not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective 
3026 this movie ... does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is 
3027 one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie 
3028 malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain 
3029 after a while , hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial 
3030 it 's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered 
3031 the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear 
3032 the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th heaven 
3033 '' 
3034 ... spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative 
3035 what 's next ? 
3036 in the end , there is n't much to it 
3037 an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message 
3038 an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy 
3039 the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis 
3040 norton is magnetic as graham 
3041 the year 's greatest adventure , and jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate 
3042 a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point 
3043 those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering 
3044 mr. goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way 
3045 abderrahmane sissako 's heremakono -lrb- waiting for happiness -rrb- is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the west african coast struggling against foreign influences 
3046 what might 've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors 
3047 a weird little movie that 's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l.a. 's show-biz and media subcultures 
3048 a wonderful , ghastly film 
3049 the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne 
3050 the film is flat 
3051 stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious 
3052 shiner can certainly go the distance , but is n't world championship material 
3053 but windtalkers does n't beat that one , either 
3054 -lrb- lee -rrb- treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects 
3055 the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher 
3056 whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end 
3057 a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans -lrb- but by no means all -rrb- will have fun with 
3058 co-writer\/director jonathan parker 's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short 
3059 his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive 
3060 smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise 
3061 o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing 
3062 a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours 
3063 ` it looks good , sonny , but you missed the point 
3064 ' 
3065 there 's nothing remotely topical or sexy here 
3066 fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience 
3067 even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene 
3068 scenario that will give most parents pause ... then , something terrible happens 
3069 blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood 's dirty harry period 
3070 the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat 
3071 the pool drowned me in boredom 
3072 if jews were catholics , this would be catechism 
3073 -lrb- sports -rrb- admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency 
3074 here is a vh1 behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that did n't sell many records but helped change a nation 
3075 it 's never dull and always looks good 
3076 competently directed but terminally cute drama 
3077 swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub 
3078 a sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old welsh boy more curious about god than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter 
3079 loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness 
3080 in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic 
3081 i will be 
3082 it 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing 
3083 represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen 
3084 an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle 
3085 the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms. ambrose 
3086 it 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful 
3087 a return to pure disney magic and is enjoyable family fare 
3088 distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register 
3089 the fact that it is n't very good is almost beside the point 
3090 it takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -lrb- and exotic dancing -rrb- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned 
3091 bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness 
3092 it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film 
3093 meant to reduce blake 's philosophy into a tragic coming-of-age saga punctuated by bursts of animator todd mcfarlane 's superhero dystopia 
3094 perhaps the grossest movie ever made 
3095 viveka seldahl and sven wollter will touch you to the core in a film you will never forget -- that you should never forget 
3096 it 's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process 
3097 ... instead go rent `` shakes the clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance 
3098 merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage 
3099 the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice 
3100 my wife 's plotting is nothing special ; it 's the delivery that matters here 
3101 an engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary 
3102 i wo n't argue with anyone who calls ` slackers ' dumb , insulting , or childish ... but i laughed so much that i did n't mind 
3103 nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams 
3104 the film 's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter 
3105 the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show 
3106 wes craven 's presence is felt ; not the craven of ' a nightmare on elm street ' or ` the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` deadly friend 
3107 ' 
3108 but tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde 's droll whimsy helps `` being earnest '' overcome its weaknesses and parker 's creative interference ... 
3109 as the princess , sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat 
3110 run for your lives ! 
3111 for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -lrb- orlando jones -rrb- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized 
3112 an impressive hybrid 
3113 the chateau ... is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters 
3114 highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it 
3115 -lrb- macdowell -rrb- ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is 
3116 pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick 
3117 the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie 's hideous yellow ` do 
3118 he does this so well you do n't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role 
3119 where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america 's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence 
3120 none of his actors stand out , but that 's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere 
3121 unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression 
3122 a surprisingly funny movie 
3123 if you thought tom hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star , wait until you 've seen him eight stories tall 
3124 drug abuse , infidelity and death are n't usually comedy fare , but turpin 's film allows us to chuckle through the angst 
3125 a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes 
3126 allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap 
3127 not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece 
3128 sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy ... attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called ` my husband is travis bickle ' 
3129 a harrowing account of a psychological breakdown 
3130 a mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director 's travel through 300 years of russian history 
3131 wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss barbershop out of hand 
3132 lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert 
3133 the movie is a trove of delights 
3134 the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about 
3135 but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell 
3136 in his u.s. debut , mr. schnitzler proves himself a deft pace master and stylist 
3137 yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents 
3138 it will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face 
3139 an uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , the grey zone does have a center , though a morbid one 
3140 sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
3141 -lrb- sam 's -rrb- self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining 
3142 dramas like this make it human 
3143 although estela bravo 's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro , it 's still a guilty pleasure to watch 
3144 but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed 
3145 it 's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in invincible and overlook its drawbacks 
3146 this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers 
3147 this bracingly truthful antidote to hollywood teenage movies that slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty 
3148 it 's up to you to decide whether to admire these people 's dedication to their cause or be repelled by their dogmatism , manipulativeness and narrow , fearful view of american life 
3149 lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else 
3150 viva le resistance ! 
3151 some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling 
3152 ` like a child with an important message to tell ... -lrb- skins ' -rrb- faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty 
3153 ' 
3154 plodding , peevish and gimmicky 
3155 given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is 
3156 the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself 
3157 nijinsky says , ' i know how to suffer ' and if you see this film you 'll know too 
3158 frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances ... keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease 
3159 it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster 
3160 witless and utterly pointless 
3161 fred schepisi 's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen 
3162 may lack the pungent bite of its title , but it 's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless 
3163 a rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children 's entertainment , superhero comics , and japanese animation 
3164 the film is a fierce dance of destruction 
3165 it 's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows 
3166 the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs 
3167 it 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress 
3168 it 's fitfully funny but never really takes off 
3169 psychologically revealing 
3170 if a big musical number like ` praise the lord , he 's the god of second chances ' does n't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids 
3171 has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups 
3172 but seriously , folks , it does n't work 
3173 i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great ... i 'm not , and then i realized that i just did n't care 
3174 and there 's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene 's story ends 
3175 though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone 
3176 bluto blutarsky , we miss you 
3177 this scarlet 's letter is a. 
3178 crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama 
3179 bond-inspired ? 
3180 do n't say you were n't warned 
3181 hopkins , squarely fills the screen 
3182 hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture 's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse 
3183 you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends 
3184 while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it 's an entertaining and informative documentary 
3185 what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music 
3186 it 's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive 
3187 the lady and the duke is eric rohmer 's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama 
3188 this may be burns 's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen 
3189 warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message 
3190 its director 's most substantial feature for some time 
3191 a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` in space , no one can hear you snore 
3192 ' 
3193 leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie ... without neglecting character development for even one minute 
3194 `` extreme ops '' exceeds expectations 
3195 it 's stylishly directed with verve ... 
3196 fans of critics ' darling band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart 
3197 its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director 's previous popcorn work 
3198 chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book 
3199 impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act 
3200 the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally 
3201 what -lrb- frei -rrb- gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows 
3202 -lrb- hell is -rrb- looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara is n't even halfway through 
3203 me no lika da accents so good , but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story 
3204 director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it 's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve 
3205 in other words , it 's just another sports drama\/character study 
3206 there 's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever 
3207 compassionately explores the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children 
3208 worthy of the gong 
3209 a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties 
3210 more dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat 
3211 in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian 
3212 the fourth `` pokemon '' is a diverting -- if predictable -- adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world 's delicate ecological balance 
3213 the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film 
3214 a jewish ww ii doc that is n't trying simply to out-shock , out-outrage or out-depress its potential audience ! 
3215 it 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant 
3216 the charming result is festival in cannes 
3217 while the film is not entirely successful , it still manages to string together enough charming moments to work 
3218 it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill 
3219 this breezy caper movie becomes a soulful , incisive meditation on the way we were , and the way we are 
3220 who are ` they ' ? 
3221 she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly 
3222 though frodo 's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle 
3223 the film 's maudlin focus on the young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking 
3224 plus , like i already mentioned ... it 's robert duvall ! 
3225 cinematic poetry showcases the city 's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything 
3226 a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene 's work as well as a remarkably faithful one 
3227 the ring never lets you off the hook 
3228 while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s. goyer is much sillier 
3229 lan yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece 
3230 fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care 
3231 uplifting , funny and wise 
3232 the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time 
3233 cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy 
3234 jarecki and gibney do find enough material to bring kissinger 's record into question and explain how the diplomat 's tweaked version of statecraft may have cost thousands and possibly millions of lives 
3235 i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights 
3236 though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed 
3237 a sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration 
3238 the beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor 
3239 a peculiar misfire that even tunney ca n't save 
3240 fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough 
3241 oozes condescension from every pore 
3242 in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song 
3243 witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic 
3244 a surprisingly ` solid ' achievement by director malcolm d. lee and writer john ridley 
3245 the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another 
3246 they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book 
3247 with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral 
3248 more timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food 
3249 brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade 
3250 a time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater , and films had the ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain 
3251 it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste 
3252 knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up 
3253 despite hoffman 's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before 
3254 a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching 
3255 offers absolutely nothing i had n't already seen 
3256 the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it 's at least watchable 
3257 serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time 
3258 a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being 
3259 trapped presents a frightening and compelling ` what if ? ' 
3260 all right , so it 's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny -lrb- sometimes hilarious -rrb- comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast 
3261 a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products 
3262 henry bean 's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect 
3263 not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan 's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way 
3264 ... a triumph of emotionally and narratively complex filmmaking 
3265 it may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but i enjoyed barbershop 
3266 glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum 
3267 the film occasionally tries the viewer 's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story 
3268 ... familiar and predictable , and 4\/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than -lrb- writer-director -rrb- franc 
3269 call it magic realism or surrealism , but miss wonton floats beyond reality with a certain degree of wit and dignity 
3270 this is as lax and limp a comedy as i 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material 
3271 the performances of the four main actresses bring their characters to life 
3272 ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing 
3273 neatly constructed thriller 
3274 tells -lrb- the story -rrb- with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot 's persnickety problems is simply a matter of -lrb- being -rrb- in a shrugging mood 
3275 the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task 
3276 rife with the rueful , wry humor springing out of yiddish culture and language 
3277 rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema 
3278 a cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall 
3279 a lovably old-school hollywood confection 
3280 it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time 
3281 it is n't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems 
3282 one of the year 's best films , featuring an oscar-worthy performance by julianne moore 
3283 why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ? 
3284 affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that ford effortlessly filled with authority 
3285 this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it 's a taunt - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered 
3286 it 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction 
3287 if you 're willing to have fun with it , you wo n't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful 
3288 the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters 
3289 but it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it 's won 
3290 a movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you do n't want to be 
3291 what 's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children 
3292 the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film 
3293 wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too 
3294 provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all 
3295 every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol 
3296 even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough 
3297 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur 
3298 nohe has made a decent ` intro ' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant 
3299 although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success 
3300 the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications 
3301 even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ... 
3302 a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in 
3303 watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown 
3304 hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation 
3305 despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype 
3306 this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them 
3307 making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love 's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror 
3308 it 's a masterpeice 
3309 incoherence reigns 
3310 gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western 
3311 the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention 
3312 disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances 
3313 who is the audience for cletis tout ? 
3314 works because reno does n't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience 
3315 it cooks conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle 
3316 wow , so who knew charles dickens could be so light-hearted ? 
3317 -lrb- a -rrb- wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting 
3318 ... tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i do n't know what she 's doing in here ... 
3319 this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost 
3320 a major waste ... generic 
3321 see it 
3322 it 's not just a feel-good movie , it 's a feel movie 
3323 the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum 's good intentions 
3324 the photographer 's show-don ` t-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject 
3325 ` the film is stark , straightforward and deadly ... an unnatural calm that 's occasionally shaken by ... blasts of rage , and later , violent jealousy 
3326 ' 
3327 tres greek writer and star nia vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script 
3328 with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable 
3329 this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout 
3330 a deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world 
3331 really is a pan-american movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart 
3332 ... plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family 
3333 this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month 's end , is tepid and tedious 
3334 but how it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery 
3335 far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love 
3336 the animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst 
3337 a movie that 's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty-pleasure , so-bad-it 's - funny level 
3338 this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f. kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative 
3339 -lrb- city -rrb- reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of ` analyze this ' -lrb- 1999 -rrb- and ` analyze that , ' promised -lrb- or threatened -rrb- for later this year 
3340 fast and funny , an action cartoon that 's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd 
3341 demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material 
3342 not a bad choice here , assuming that ... the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly 
3343 it 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones 's diary 
3344 watching these two actors play against each other so intensely , but with restraint , is a treat 
3345 this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year 
3346 critics need a good laugh , too , and this too-extreme-for-tv rendition of the notorious mtv show delivers the outrageous , sickening , sidesplitting goods in steaming , visceral heaps 
3347 since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things 
3348 real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders 
3349 a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1\/2 
3350 nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book 
3351 directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name 
3352 it 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull 
3353 there is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure 
3354 there 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects 
3355 as relationships shift , director robert j. siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc 
3356 nicks sustains the level of exaggerated , stylized humor throughout by taking your expectations and twisting them just a bit 
3357 here the love scenes all end in someone screaming 
3358 a lot smarter than your average bond 
3359 a soul-stirring documentary about the israeli\/palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds 
3360 enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary 
3361 too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay 
3362 kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope 
3363 stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes 
3364 the band performances featured in drumline are red hot ... -lrb- but -rrb- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold 
3365 that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed 
3366 for more than two decades mr. nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity 
3367 in fact , it does n't even seem like she tried 
3368 superb production values & christian bale 's charisma make up for a derivative plot 
3369 visually striking and viscerally repellent 
3370 though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia 's true emotions ... but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking 
3371 stealing harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor 
3372 rarely has a film 's title served such dire warning 
3373 dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material 
3374 it 's an interesting effort -lrb- particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts -rrb- , and barry 's cold-fish act makes the experience worthwhile 
3375 an unexpectedly sweet story of sisterhood 
3376 they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film 
3377 the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman 's lesser works 
3378 just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls 
3379 the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me 
3380 the script is smart , not cloying 
3381 its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche 
3382 auto focus is not your standard hollywood bio-pic 
3383 an uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations 
3384 ' 
3385 depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being 
3386 on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture 
3387 starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion 
3388 michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously 
3389 the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries 
3390 the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run 
3391 if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
3392 there 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right 
3393 kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an -lrb- emotionally at least -rrb- adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested 
3394 so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script 
3395 amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than barbershop 
3396 brought to life on the big screen 
3397 if it 's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch 
3398 knows how to make our imagination wonder 
3399 leaks treacle from every pore 
3400 do you say `` hi '' to your lover when you wake up in the morning ? 
3401 the saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world 
3402 the actors are fantastic 
3403 ... a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs -- sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh 
3404 ... an enjoyably frothy ` date movie ' ... 
3405 neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while 
3406 awesome work : ineffable , elusive , yet inexplicably powerful 
3407 leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time 
3408 intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery 
3409 please 
3410 authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow 
3411 faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , `` a walk to remember '' succeeds through sincerity 
3412 a wildly entertaining scan of evans ' career 
3413 does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets 
3414 a life-size reenactment of those jack chick cartoon tracts that always ended with some hippie getting tossed into the lake of fire 
3415 schaeffer is n't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does 
3416 is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation 
3417 it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity 
3418 -lrb- breheny 's -rrb- lensing of the new zealand and cook island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people 
3419 -lrb- an -rrb- absorbing documentary 
3420 if you open yourself up to mr. reggio 's theory of this imagery as the movie 's set ... it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change 
3421 oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material 
3422 showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment 
3423 an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film ... 
3424 it 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie 
3425 has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be 
3426 parris ' performance is credible and remarkably mature 
3427 the film 's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it 's propelled by the acting 
3428 ` stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall 's intense freight train of a film 
3429 ' 
3430 the casting of von sydow ... is itself intacto 's luckiest stroke 
3431 exhilarating , funny and fun 
3432 bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay 
3433 michael moore 's latest documentary about america 's thirst for violence is his best film yet ... 
3434 the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life 
3435 at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion 
3436 nearly every attempt at humor here is doa 
3437 the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief 
3438 it 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns 
3439 everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend 
3440 ourside the theatre roger might be intolerable company , but inside it he 's well worth spending some time with 
3441 enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid 
3442 not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions 
3443 eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof 
3444 takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms 
3445 it 's a long way from orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -lrb- 1984 -rrb- to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation 
3446 there are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but brown sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy 
3447 short-story quaint , touchingly mending a child 's pain for his dead mother via communication with an old woman straight out of eudora welty 
3448 smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off - broadway play 
3449 a photographic marvel of sorts , and it 's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community 
3450 ... while the humor aspects of ` jason x ' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks 
3451 but not without cheesy fun factor 
3452 if you ignore the cliches and concentrate on city by the sea 's interpersonal drama , it ai n't half-bad 
3453 tsai ming-liang 's witty , wistful new film , what time is it there ? 
3454 becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring 
3455 heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations 
3456 last orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life 's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced 
3457 the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it 
3458 the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained 
3459 on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough 
3460 an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism 
3461 each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth 
3462 assayas ' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne 's novel 
3463 nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives 
3464 the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life 
3465 it just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense 
3466 a straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they 've rarely been given 
3467 ... hokey art house pretension 
3468 harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality 
3469 unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script 
3470 and there 's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together 
3471 told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject 
3472 comes across as a fairly weak retooling 
3473 one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning 
3474 the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing 
3475 as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses 
3476 the film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson ... 
3477 what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence 
3478 it 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere 
3479 ninety minutes of viva castro ! 
3480 apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it 
3481 it never rises to its clever what-if concept 
3482 shallow , noisy and pretentious 
3483 demonstrates a vivid imagination and an impressive style that result in some terrific setpieces 
3484 not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers -- it 's a spirited film and a must-see 
3485 a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga 
3486 as allen 's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson 
3487 engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched 
3488 a clever script and skilled actors bring new energy to the familiar topic of office politics 
3489 it 's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits 
3490 none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh 
3491 an enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race 
3492 a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc 
3493 a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna 
3494 it may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied 
3495 - style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack 
3496 a polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con 
3497 do n't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you do n't have kids borrow some 
3498 could as easily have been called ` under siege 3 : in alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life 
3499 cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle 
3500 make no mistake , ivans xtc 
3501 is it a comedy ? 
3502 a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action 
3503 as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr. murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold 
3504 it does n't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one 's imagination will lead when given the opportunity 
3505 its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess 
3506 this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often 
3507 the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them 
3508 both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ? 
3509 director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through 
3510 ... a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing 
3511 i walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like 
3512 the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you 
3513 a technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide 
3514 what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
3515 just like igby 
3516 long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame 
3517 familiar but utterly delightful 
3518 the chocolate factory without charlie

3521 wobbly senegalese updating of `` carmen '' which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai 
3522 steven spielberg brings us another masterpiece 
3523 ... a lesson in prehistoric hilarity 
3524 it made me feel unclean , and i 'm the guy who liked there 's something about mary and both american pie movies 
3525 complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold 
3526 a lot of the credit for the film 's winning tone must go to grant , who has n't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him 
3527 the rare imax movie that you 'll wish was longer than an hour 
3528 if you 're a comic fan , you ca n't miss it 
3529 a marvel of production design 
3530 the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too 
3531 from the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` besotted '' is misbegotten 
3532 a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story 
3533 from both a great and a terrible story , mr. nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience 
3534 the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i 've got to give it thumbs down 
3535 as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says ` i 'm telling you , this is f \*\*\* ed ' 
3536 consider it ` perfection

3538 affectionately reminds us that , in any language , the huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things 
3539 if the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , jacquot preserves tosca 's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera 
3540 the dramatic crisis does n't always succeed in its quest to be taken seriously , but huppert 's volatile performance makes for a riveting movie experience 
3541 like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on 
3542 it should be doing a lot of things , but does n't 
3543 anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in ` the ring

3545 moretti ... is the rare common-man artist who 's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness 
3546 ... irritating soul-searching garbage 
3547 the message of such reflections -- intentional or not -- is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one 
3548 the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is 
3549 a humorless journey into a philosophical void 
3550 none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens 
3551 you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise 
3552 the film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down 
3553 the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill 
3554 were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke 's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , ` do not go gentle into that good theatre

3556 the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ... 
3557 triple x is a double agent , and he 's one bad dude 
3558 wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own 
3559 lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded 
3560 a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird 
3561 fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor 
3562 jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness 
3563 daughter from danang sticks with its subjects a little longer and tells a deeper story 
3564 almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited 
3565 the movie 's captivating details are all in the performances , from foreman 's barking-mad taylor to thewlis 's smoothly sinister freddie and bettany\/mcdowell 's hard-eyed gangster 
3566 quite frankly , i ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out 
3567 a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt 
3568 a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness 
3569 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies 
3570 a bit too eager to please 
3571 sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard 
3572 it seems impossible that an epic four-hour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is 
3573 rarely has skin looked as beautiful , desirable , even delectable , as it does in trouble every day 
3574 a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable 
3575 noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism 
3576 funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness 
3577 this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater 
3578 shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera 
3579 the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing 
3580 the story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge 
3581 imagine a scenario where bergman approaches swedish fatalism using gary larson 's far side humor 
3582 leigh 's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher 's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other 
3583 murder by numbers ' is n't a great movie , but it 's a perfectly acceptable widget

3587 y tu mamá también is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt 
3588 rubbo 's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-shakespeare controversy 
3589 it is quite a vision 
3590 a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense 
3591 the color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie were n't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is 
3592 downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message 
3593 less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession 
3594 gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet 's mouth 
3595 the pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners 
3596 gere gives a good performance in a film that does n't merit it 
3597 you come away thinking not only that kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another 
3598 the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt 
3599 ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies 
3600 if you 're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you 're in luck 
3601 a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart 
3602 cool 
3603 the film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery 
3604 beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes 
3605 morvern callar confirms lynne ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema 
3606 just plain silly 
3607 guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep 
3608 there are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front 
3609 depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived 
3610 bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie ... is , also , frequently hilarious

3612 bouquet gives a performance that is masterly 
3613 it 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , mad cows 
3614 these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector 
3615 there 's a lot to recommend read my lips 
3616 i 'd rather watch a rerun of the powerpuff girls 
3617 this submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to das boot 
3618 bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made 
3619 the only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering 
3620 it 's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure 
3621 maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts 
3622 the movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us 
3623 britney spears ' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction 
3624 or intelligent 
3625 the movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error 
3626 ' 
3627 devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable 
3628 ... about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season 
3629 terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it 's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers 
3630 he fails 
3631 this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit 
3632 nicolas cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career 
3633 it 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate 
3634 jeong-hyang lee 's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying 
3635 the bodily function jokes are about what you 'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie 
3636 ... a story , an old and scary one , about the monsters we make , and the vengeance they take 
3637 two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning 
3638 for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype 
3639 it 's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but 
3640 the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras 
3641 one ca n't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney 's latest album 
3642 visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction 
3643 high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it ca n't help but engage an audience 
3644 it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly 
3645 if you can read the subtitles -lrb- the opera is sung in italian -rrb- and you like ` masterpiece theatre ' type costumes , you 'll enjoy this movie 
3646 `` the quiet american '' begins in saigon in 1952 
3647 a terrifically entertaining specimen of spielbergian sci-fi 
3648 simply a re-hash of the other seven films 
3649 hmmm ... might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
3650 -lrb- a -rrb- stuporously solemn film 
3651 a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences 
3652 death might be a release 
3653 the film 's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film 's production design 
3654 the movie 's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity 
3655 a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind 
3656 going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it 's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it 's worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through 
3657 the problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes 
3658 as ex-marine walter , who may or may not have shot kennedy , actor raymond j. barry is perfectly creepy and believable 
3659 the production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating 
3660 13 conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful , but sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister , karen sprecher , do n't seem ever to run out of ideas 
3661 it 's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from 
3662 the result puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally could n't care less 
3663 a gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the iranian new wave 
3664 the film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way 
3665 according to the script , grant and bullock 's characters are made for each other 
3666 a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters 
3667 the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came 
3668 a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making 
3669 a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture 
3670 lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject -- taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history 
3671 a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling 
3672 i 'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes 
3673 the feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept 
3674 the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality 
3675 a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis 
3676 an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound 
3677 ken russell would love this 
3678 has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool 
3679 they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental 
3680 claire is a terrific role for someone like judd , who really ought to be playing villains 
3681 the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield 
3682 kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera 
3683 its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life 
3684 sex is one of those films that aims to confuse 
3685 first-time director joão pedro rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on 
3686 salma goes native and she 's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon 
3687 his scenes are short and often unexpected 
3688 human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard 
3689 the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family 
3690 the inevitable double - and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich 's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line 
3691 a literary detective story is still a detective story and aficionados of the whodunit wo n't be disappointed 
3692 the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission 
3693 impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast 
3694 it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out 
3695 the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years 
3696 sly , sophisticated and surprising 
3697 -lrb- kline 's -rrb- utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who ca n't quite live up to it 
3698 more trifle than triumph 
3699 like its predecessor , it 's no classic , but it provides a reasonably attractive holiday contraption , one that families looking for a clean , kid-friendly outing should investigate 
3700 thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami 
3701 fubar is very funny , but not always in a laugh-out-loud way 
3702 ... generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish 
3703 it 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before 
3704 murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote 
3705 the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing 
3706 i hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness 
3707 she may not be real , but the laughs are 
3708 clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades 
3709 a depressingly retrograde , ` post-feminist ' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women 
3710 scherfig 's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky 
3711 you can sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions ; i 'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week 
3712 this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream 
3713 both garcia and jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny 
3714 many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i do n't think that a.c. will help this movie one bit 
3715 even more baffling is that it 's funny 
3716 you 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy 
3717 crudup 's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families 
3718 not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture , but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one 
3719 by surrounding us with hyper-artificiality , haynes makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way 
3720 ... somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clichés to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks 
3721 a highly spirited , imaginative kid 's movie that broaches neo-augustinian theology : is god stuck in heaven because he 's afraid of his best-known creation ? 
3722 deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits 
3723 alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes 
3724 when the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails 
3725 it 's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable 
3726 this often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal 
3727 the pianist is polanski 's best film 
3728 the camera twirls ! 
3729 oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition 
3730 you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did 
3731 klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed 
3732 from the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait 
3733 utter mush ... conceited pap 
3734 despite its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of `` lilo '' could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script 
3735 gooding is the energetic frontman , and it 's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences 
3736 ... the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy 
3737 just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective 
3738 think of it as gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch 
3739 grant carries the day with impeccable comic timing , raffish charm and piercing intellect 
3740 a frustrating ` tweener ' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls 
3741 predictably soulless techno-tripe 
3742 the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart 
3743 it 's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated 
3744 the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots 
3745 the film 's most improbable feat ? 
3746 the charm of revolution os is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers 
3747 one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way 
3748 there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch 
3749 there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer 
3750 possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio 
3751 the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects 
3752 a crisp psychological drama -lrb- and -rrb- a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old `` twilight zone '' episode 
3753 there is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country 
3754 time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable 
3755 a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation 
3756 mr. spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned 
3757 put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob 's body of work 
3758 while not quite a comedy , the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer , and is never less than engaging 
3759 what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark -lrb- dark green , to be exact -rrb- , sour , bloody and mean 
3760 mr. polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival 
3761 a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism 
3762 it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs 
3763 it 's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s 
3764 diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film 
3765 but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title 
3766 darkly funny and frequently insightful 
3767 formuliac , but fun 
3768 there 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes 
3769 damon brings the proper conviction to his role as -lrb- jason bourne -rrb- 
3770 the movie does n't generate a lot of energy 
3771 and yet , it still works 
3772 it squanders chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt ! 
3773 ... a light , yet engrossing piece 
3774 really quite funny 
3775 it 's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it 's implosion rather than explosion you fear 
3776 pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two 
3777 though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected 
3778 a singularly off-putting romantic comedy 
3779 diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance 
3780 the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen 
3781 the off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery 
3782 nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here 
3783 an eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , ` spy kids 2 ' is a visual treat for all audiences 
3784 a lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor 
3785 saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory 
3786 personal velocity ought to be exploring these women 's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces 
3787 an engaging criminal romp that will have viewers guessing just who 's being conned right up to the finale 
3788 an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line 
3789 kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious 
3790 for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? 
3791 it celebrates the group 's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his ` angels of light 
3792 ' 
3793 like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six 
3794 its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude 
3795 although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , `` orange county '' is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be 
3796 -lrb- the film -rrb- tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it 's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful 
3797 the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil 
3798 it 's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed 
3799 an uncomfortable experience , but one as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from american cinema 
3800 the huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent 
3801 charming and witty , it 's also somewhat clumsy 
3802 draggin ' about dragons 
3803 amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances 
3804 i ca n't 
3805 with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd 
3806 saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion 
3807 a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish 
3808 ... an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller 
3809 despite juliet stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs 
3810 this film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion 
3811 ... a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance 
3812 it all plays out ... like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller 's time out 
3813 what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time 
3814 wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime 
3815 those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time 
3816 the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie 
3817 she nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit 
3818 and for many of us , that 's good enough 
3819 like other great documentaries ... this goes after one truth -lrb- the ford administration 's complicity in tearing ` orphans ' from their mothers -rrb- and stumbles upon others even more compelling 
3820 meyjes ... has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics 
3821 poetic , heartbreaking 
3822 a memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill 
3823 as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer 
3824 the script by vincent r. nebrida ... tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot 
3825 a porn film without the sex scenes 
3826 just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation 
3827 the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam ` ron seal the deal 
3828 a film that will enthrall the whole family 
3829 it just does n't have anything really interesting to say 
3830 much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes 
3831 while you have to admit it 's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out `` when you 're a jet , you 're a jet all the way , '' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` tonight 
3832 '' 
3833 a quaint , romanticized rendering 
3834 filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes ' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home 
3835 as chilling and fascinating as philippe mora 's modern hitler-study , snide and prejudice 
3836 cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy 
3837 a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the bollywood films 
3838 a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita 
3839 seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie 
3840 a full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence 
3841 how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? 
3842 fudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we 're seeing something purer than the real thing 
3843 the cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael 
3844 sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip 
3845 it 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage 
3846 so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style 
3847 a faster paced family flick 
3848 `` analyze that '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original 
3849 fairy-tale formula , serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , comedy , direction and especially charm 
3850 the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare 
3851 the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths 
3852 i 'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché 
3853 in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation 
3854 let 's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate 
3855 not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog 
3856 tiresomely derivative and hammily acted 
3857 i walked away from this new version of e.t. just as i hoped i would -- with moist eyes 
3858 -lrb- it -rrb- has the feel of a summer popcorn movie 
3859 what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of variety 
3860 the film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence 
3861 the heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death 
3862 entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel 
3863 the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus 
3864 puts to rest any thought that the german film industry can not make a delightful comedy centering on food 
3865 with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity 
3866 no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable 
3867 a well-executed spy-thriller 
3868 lisa rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension 
3869 the trailer is a riot 
3870 this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell 
3871 alas , getting there is not even half the interest 
3872 a chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness 
3873 the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that was n't at least watchable 
3874 i 'll go out on a limb 
3875 deflated ending aside , there 's much to recommend the film 
3876 sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb 
3877 as improbable as this premise may seem , abbass 's understated , shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life 
3878 maybe leblanc thought , `` hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse 
3879 '' 
3880 gives an intriguing twist to the french coming-of-age genre 
3881 a brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others 
3882 confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis 
3883 he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race 
3884 escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions 
3885 full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life 
3886 a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith 's next movie 
3887 director hoffman , his writer and kline 's agent should serve detention 
3888 the quirky and recessive charms of co-stars martin donovan and mary-louise parker help overcome the problematic script 
3889 it 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex 
3890 it 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more 
3891 as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness 
3892 graced with the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in american teen comedies 
3893 -lrb- allen -rrb- manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise 
3894 the truth about charlie is that it 's a brazenly misguided project 
3895 with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee 
3896 martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more 
3897 this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment 
3898 exhilarating but blatantly biased 
3899 a mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama 
3900 rarely , a movie is more than a movie 
3901 a `` black austin powers ? '' 
3902 how this one escaped the lifetime network i 'll never know 
3903 to some eyes this will seem like a recycling of clichés , an assassin 's greatest hits 
3904 less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is 
3905 an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses 
3906 for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece 
3907 the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen 
3908 a gentle and engrossing character study 
3909 sluggish , tonally uneven 
3910 ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing 
3911 the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold 
3912 what could have easily become a cold , calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking 
3913 russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers 's title-bout features 
3914 some remarkable achival film about how shanghai -lrb- of all places -rrb- served jews who escaped the holocaust 
3915 `` interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into 
3916 an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore 
3917 as it stands it 's an opera movie for the buffs 
3918 intelligent and moving 
3919 a bodice-ripper for intellectuals 
3920 it 's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom 
3921 the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she 's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard 
3922 time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term 
3923 guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it 's not scary in the slightest 
3924 peppering this urban study with references to norwegian folktales , villeneuve creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical 
3925 elling builds gradually until you feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy 
3926 kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and lan yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie 
3927 maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards 
3928 ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film 
3929 a stylistic romp that 's always fun to watch 
3930 for 95 often hilarious minutes , -lrb- cho -rrb- riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outré sexual practice 
3931 you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood is n't going to jell 
3932 it says a lot about a filmmaker when he can be wacky without clobbering the audience over the head and still maintain a sense of urgency and suspense 
3933 a shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown 
3934 its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy 
3935 there 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film 
3936 an affectionately goofy satire that 's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary ... 
3937 examines its explosive subject matter as nonjudgmentally as wiseman 's previous studies of inner-city high schools , hospitals , courts and welfare centers 
3938 but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti 
3939 the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments 
3940 at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it 
3941 stress ` dumb 
3942 ' 
3943 katz 's documentary does n't have much panache , but with material this rich it does n't need it 
3944 deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel 
3945 huppert and girardot give performances of exceptional honesty 
3946 where 's the movie here ? 
3947 an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously 
3948 the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome 
3949 whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around 
3950 it does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that 
3951 this makes minority report necessary viewing for sci-fi fans , as the film has some of the best special effects ever 
3952 if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material 
3953 swimming is above all about a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds 
3954 mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination 
3955 ` the war of the roses , ' trailer-trash style 
3956 the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact 
3957 originality is sorely lacking 
3958 is red dragon worthy of a place alongside the other hannibal movies ? 
3959 it trusts the story it sets out to tell 
3960 boy oh boy , it 's a howler 
3961 an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship 
3962 the film has a kind of hard , cold effect 
3963 strip it of all its excess debris , and you 'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie 
3964 only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience 
3965 while there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans -lrb- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -rrb- , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor 
3966 did we really need a remake of `` charade ? '' 
3967 stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid 
3968 the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture 
3969 all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon 
3970 throughout , mr. audiard 's direction is fluid and quick 
3971 the observations of this social\/economic\/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony 
3972 while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan 's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends -lrb- it -rrb- stimulating depth 
3973 undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos 
3974 same guy with both hats 
3975 ... in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes 
3976 watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers 
3977 ian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon 
3978 time out is as serious as a pink slip 
3979 tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art 
3980 an exhilarating serving of movie fluff 
3981 -lrb- creates -rrb- the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama 
3982 circuit queens wo n't learn a thing , they 'll be too busy cursing the film 's strategically placed white sheets 
3983 director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself 
3984 a tremendous piece of work 
3985 as an actor 's showcase , hart 's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player 
3986 -lrb- crystal and de niro -rrb- manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing 
3987 a pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro 
3988 ... a fairly disposable yet still entertaining b picture 
3989 there 's something poignant about an artist of 90-plus years taking the effort to share his impressions of life and loss and time and art with us 
3990 our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and i know this because i 've seen ` jackass : the movie 
3991 ' 
3992 moonlight mile does n't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy 
3993 ozpetek joins the ranks of those gay filmmakers who have used the emigre experience to explore same-sex culture in ways that elude the more nationally settled 
3994 american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone 
3995 the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue 
3996 if you recognize zeus -lrb- the dog from snatch -rrb- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one 
3997 wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many 
3998 represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller\/horror genre 
3999 though nijinsky 's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature 
4000 parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place 
4001 this movie may not have the highest production values you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep 
4002 brings together some of the biggest names in japanese anime , with impressive results 
4003 woefully pretentious 
4004 mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money 
4005 -lrb- leigh -rrb- has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors -lrb- improvised over many months -rrb- and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable 
4006 director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading 
4007 godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks 
4008 there 's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau 
4009 gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth 
4010 no surprises 
4011 the film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen 
4012 a stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact 
4013 fortunately , you still have that option 
4014 conforms itself with creating a game of ` who 's who ' ... where the characters ' moves are often more predictable than their consequences 
4015 an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence 
4016 nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film ... it 's not even a tv special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break 
4017 blue crush is as predictable as the tides 
4018 we 're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments 
4019 this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter 
4020 the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow 
4021 ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's center 
4022 if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice 's novel the vampire chronicles 
4023 with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub 
4024 ... the one thing this wild film has that other imax films do n't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house 
4025 just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay 
4026 instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
4027 do n't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it 's anti-catholic 
4028 brown sugar signals director rick famuyiwa 's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema 
4029 their computer-animated faces are very expressive 
4030 not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches 
4031 the acting is n't much better 
4032 a powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s 
4033 another best of the year selection 
4034 the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either does n't notice when his story ends or just ca n't tear himself away from the characters -- but it 's smooth and professional 
4035 it 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain 
4036 its one-sidedness ... flirts with propaganda 
4037 the overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude 
4038 robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role 
4039 the underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese 's taxi driver and goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself 
4040 ` synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree 
4041 the film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing 
4042 oh , and booty call 
4043 too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash 
4044 a small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad 
4045 the château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera 
4046 ... quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks 
4047 arliss howard 's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , big bad love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws 
4048 ` the château is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot 
4049 ' 
4050 in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting 
4051 it 's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack 
4052 i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! 
4053 literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds 
4054 it 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' 
4055 a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs 
4056 tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star 
4057 since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! 
4058 the actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script 's bad ideas and awkwardness 
4059 romething 's really wrong with this ricture ! 
4060 an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film 
4061 crikey indeed 
4062 el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors 
4063 a processed comedy chop suey 
4064 rouge is less about a superficial midlife crisis than it is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80 
4065 spy-vs 
4066 part of the charm of satin rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness 
4067 sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness 
4068 more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller 
4069 its story about a young chinese woman , ah na , who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling 
4070 great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make gangster no. 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience 
4071 but that they are doing it is thought-provoking 
4072 the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is 
4073 the screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines 
4074 an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it 
4075 manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state 
4076 what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers 
4077 serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it 
4078 what 's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up 
4079 this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie 
4080 a winning and wildly fascinating work 
4081 blue crush is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be 
4082 for once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own 
4083 -lrb- fincher 's -rrb- camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller 
4084 but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold 
4085 there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally 
4086 some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being 
4087 and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence 's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest 
4088 it 's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought 
4089 it 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting 
4090 things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content 
4091 with freeman and judd , i 'll at least remember their characters 
4092 a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not 
4093 drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth 
4094 there 's absolutely no reason why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is 
4095 the cast comes through even when the movie does n't 
4096 mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life 
4097 it 's all entertaining enough , but do n't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper 
4098 contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin 
4099 transforms one of -lrb- shakespeare 's -rrb- deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy 
4100 successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie 
4101 a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies 
4102 an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication 
4103 even better than the first one ! 
4104 i ca n't recommend it 
4105 poor ben bratt could n't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions 
4106 more of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who 's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director 's previous films 
4107 allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today 
4108 by-the-numbers yarn 
4109 on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , the powerpuff girls is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience 
4110 those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves 
4111 an ambitious ` what if ? ' 
4112 when a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there 's something there 
4113 nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me 
4114 it 's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring 
4115 a first-class , thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film 
4116 the lady and the duke is a smart , romantic drama that dares to depict the french revolution from the aristocrats ' perspective 
4117 even if you 've seen `` stomp '' -lrb- the stage show -rrb- , you still have to see this ! 
4118 it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has 
4119 despite these annoyances , the capable clayburgh and tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age 
4120 this familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences , though it 's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times 
4121 despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break 
4122 while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that 's more interested in asking questions than in answering them 
4123 the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations 
4124 while not all that bad of a movie , it 's nowhere near as good as the original 
4125 as broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is , there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism 
4126 its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people 's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff 
4127 a less-than-thrilling thriller 
4128 would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement 
4129 the hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment 
4130 some of the most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since `` saving private ryan '' have been recreated by john woo in this little-known story of native americans and their role in the second great war 
4131 morton deserves an oscar nomination 
4132 you 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery 
4133 by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious 
4134 it 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey 
4135 -lrb- davis -rrb- wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters 
4136 it all looks and plays like a $ 40 million version of a game you 're more likely to enjoy on a computer 
4137 van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest 
4138 forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this wo n't seem like such a bore 
4139 viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet 
4140 it 's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that 's been given the drive of a narrative and that 's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work 
4141 there 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish 
4142 a very capable nailbiter 
4143 one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud 
4144 a witty , whimsical feature debut 
4145 `` -lrb- hopkins -rrb- does n't so much phone in his performance as fax it 
4146 a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine 
4147 no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film 
4148 wedding feels a bit anachronistic 
4149 it 's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that 's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie 's strangeness 
4150 schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park -lrb- as well as one , ms. mirren , who did -rrb- , has succeeded beyond all expectation 
4151 this movie got me grinning 
4152 even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it does n't make for completely empty entertainment 
4153 let 's face it -- there are n't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they 're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears 
4154 a haunting tale of murder and mayhem 
4155 weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting 
4156 me without you has a bracing truth that 's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood 
4157 consummate actor barry has done excellent work here 
4158 a decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit franklin needs to stay afloat in hollywood 
4159 ... the plot weaves us into a complex web 
4160 too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style 
4161 the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine 
4162 the scorpion king is more fun than conan the barbarian 
4163 ... the picture 's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine 
4164 what makes the movie work -- to an admittedly limited extent -- is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers 
4165 you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story 
4166 he has a great cast and a great idea 
4167 `` sweet home alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ... 
4168 even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end ... you almost do n't notice the 129-minute running time 
4169 diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused 
4170 sure , it 's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it 's never as solid as you want it to be 
4171 what we get ... is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons 
4172 tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 
4173 sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante 
4174 runs on the pure adrenalin of pacino 's performance 
4175 the tuxedo was n't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , ` hungry-man portions of bad ' 
4176 shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept -lrb- aliens come to earth -rrb- and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion 
4177 `` spider-man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer , and hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff 
4178 the film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant 
4179 ... a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i ca n't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here 
4180 like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about north korea 's recent past and south korea 's future adds a much needed moral weight 
4181 a charmer from belgium 
4182 it 's not only dull because we 've seen -lrb- eddie -rrb- murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed 
4183 even during the climactic hourlong cricket match , boredom never takes hold 
4184 a movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you 've actually spent time living in another community 
4185 pipe dream does have its charms 
4186 one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history 
4187 stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind 
4188 those who love cinema paradiso will find the new scenes interesting , but few will find the movie improved 
4189 if you 're part of her targeted audience , you 'll cheer 
4190 crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls 
4191 it 's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle 
4192 solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh 's best films , `` erin brockovich , '' `` out of sight '' and `` ocean 's eleven , '' never were 
4193 a modestly made but profoundly moving documentary 
4194 the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster 
4195 ... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces 
4196 fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget 
4197 if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell 
4198 as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character 
4199 frank capra played this story straight 
4200 control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible 
4201 nevertheless , it still seems endless 
4202 there 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title 
4203 mel gibson fights the good fight in vietnam in director randall wallace 's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency 
4204 for a film that 's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama is n't as funny as you 'd hoped 
4205 `` barbershop '' is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story 
4206 though lan yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude 
4207 this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins ' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book 
4208 fortunately , elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors ' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry 
4209 but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness 
4210 please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film 
4211 sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading 
4212 heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple 's moral ascension 
4213 despite its faults , gangs excels in spectacle and pacing 
4214 a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama 
4215 ' 
4216 lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life , stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness 
4217 provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views 
4218 flat , misguided comedy 
4219 it 's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion 
4220 berling and béart ... continue to impress , and isabelle huppert ... again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters 
4221 serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination 
4222 this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary 
4223 there are moments of hilarity to be had 
4224 it 's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb 
4225 i never thought i 'd say this , but i 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies ! 
4226 i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd 
4227 it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them 
4228 the film jolts the laughs from the audience -- as if by cattle prod 
4229 plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo 
4230 elegant , mannered and teasing 
4231 ... plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer -lrb- and -rrb- the director ca n't seem to get a coherent rhythm going 
4232 there are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we 're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why 
4233 by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre 
4234 not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too 
4235 kapur 's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself 
4236 but they fascinate in their recklessness 
4237 a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist 
4238 the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies 
4239 this is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned 
4240 worth catching for griffiths ' warm and winning central performance 
4241 ` cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola 's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about 
4242 who cares ? -rrb- 
4243 neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored 
4244 an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen 
4245 the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it 
4246 an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality 
4247 it 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting 
4248 a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze 
4249 it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex 
4250 a b-movie you can sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then forget 
4251 a fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction 
4252 enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious -- if you 've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse 
4253 there 's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments 
4254 williams absolutely nails sy 's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness 
4255 curiously , super troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length 
4256 as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma 
4257 watch barbershop again if you 're in need of a cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through 
4258 this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper 
4259 an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating 
4260 diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy 
4261 each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense 
4262 certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire 
4263 i have n't laughed that hard in years ! 
4264 sorvino is delightful in the central role 
4265 a gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost 
4266 possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another 
4267 what a great way to spend 4 units of your day 
4268 a passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action 
4269 both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right 
4270 and vin diesel is the man 
4271 just a kiss is a just a waste 
4272 meyjes focuses too much on max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured , dull artist and monster-in-the - making 
4273 hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud 
4274 murder by numbers just does n't add up 
4275 all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new 
4276 this is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek -lrb- as well as a serious debt to the road warrior -rrb- , but it feels like unrealized potential 
4277 -lrb- it -rrb- highlights not so much the crime lord 's messianic bent , but spacey 's 
4278 in death to smoochy , we do n't get williams ' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing 
4279 tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu 
4280 an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening 
4281 the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive 
4282 bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be 
4283 dramatically lackluster 
4284 made eddie murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day 
4285 this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground 
4286 yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it 
4287 their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle 
4288 all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams 
4289 tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality 
4290 a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices 
4291 tries too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span 
4292 the obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc 
4293 the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways 
4294 you emerge dazed , confused as to whether you 've seen pornography or documentary 
4295 lucy 's a dull girl , that 's all 
4296 sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments 
4297 directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length 
4298 it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships 
4299 the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired 
4300 is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche 
4301 the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece 
4302 spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative 
4303 this is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt 
4304 for almost the first two-thirds of martin scorsese 's 168-minute gangs of new york , i was entranced 
4305 ... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror 
4306 an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film 
4307 enticing and often funny documentary 
4308 but one thing 's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary 
4309 the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure 
4310 whereas oliver stone 's conspiracy thriller jfk was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy , interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity 
4311 the komediant is a tale worth catching 
4312 the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot 
4313 worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia 
4314 a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy 
4315 let 's hope not 
4316 it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes 
4317 an encouraging effort from mccrudden 
4318 i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise 
4319 such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us `` the skulls '' and last year 's `` rollerball 
4320 '' 
4321 initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama 
4322 this is not a jackie chan movie 
4323 chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans 
4324 you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer 
4325 lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago 
4326 a timid , soggy near miss 
4327 a solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration 
4328 a quiet family drama with a little bit of romance and a dose of darkness 
4329 smith examines the intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country 
4330 i admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time 
4331 thoroughly engrossing and ultimately tragic 
4332 i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin ' down 
4333 if only it were , well , funnier 
4334 it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd 
4335 from its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale , martin is a masterfully conducted work 
4336 charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions 
4337 kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party 
4338 its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary 
4339 an engrossing iranian film about two itinerant teachers and some lost and desolate people they encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed 
4340 for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience 
4341 somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out 
4342 first and foremost ... the reason to go see `` blue crush '' is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings 
4343 connoisseurs of chinese film will be pleased to discover that tian 's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus 
4344 gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , -lrb- harris -rrb- brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging sandeman 
4345 left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte 's web of desire and desperation 
4346 the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it 's far too sentimental 
4347 it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate 
4348 combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration 
4349 like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr. wong 's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting 
4350 loud , chaotic and largely unfunny 
4351 the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort 
4352 a movie to forget 
4353 the film 's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen 
4354 rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue 
4355 labute ca n't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he 's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel 's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film 
4356 starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter 
4357 a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up 's i 'm the one that i want 
4358 a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration 
4359 an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike 
4360 the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie 
4361 every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked 
4362 if that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will 
4363 this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience 
4364 it 's not an easy one to review 
4365 ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` chicago '' in 2002 
4366 a puzzling experience 
4367 the film has a terrific look and salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life 
4368 what makes barbershop so likable , with all its flaws , is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies 
4369 it pulls the rug out from under you , just when you 're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction 
4370 this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm 
4371 -lrb- reaches -rrb- wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair 
4372 the film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved ... this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture 
4373 gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up 
4374 for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either 
4375 unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire 
4376 when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip 
4377 ... a true delight 
4378 an awful snooze 
4379 does n't really add up to much 
4380 an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama 
4381 a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome 
4382 watching `` ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale 
4383 a thriller made from a completist 's checklist rather than with a cultist 's passion 
4384 cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge 
4385 may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since town and country 
4386 its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers 
4387 nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters 
4388 leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion 
4389 `` white oleander , '' the movie , is akin to a reader 's digest condensed version of the source material 
4390 high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky 
4391 has its moments , but it 's pretty far from a treasure 
4392 goes a long way on hedonistic gusto 
4393 schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that 's enough to sustain laughs ... 
4394 a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture 
4395 matches neorealism 's impact by showing the humanity of a war-torn land filled with people who just want to live their lives 
4396 the central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest 
4397 it 's the kind of movie that , aside from robert altman , spike lee , the coen brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough 
4398 the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series 
4399 the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way 
4400 the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material 
4401 no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild 
4402 acting can not be acted 
4403 comes off like a bad imitation of the bard 
4404 the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste 
4405 it 's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax 
4406 resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche 
4407 the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast is n't the least bit mesmerizing 
4408 a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series 
4409 a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot 
4410 the sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film 
4411 hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock 's imaginative flight to shyamalan 's self-important summer fluff 
4412 this is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull 
4413 you wo n't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again 
4414 the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic 
4415 eyre is on his way to becoming the american indian spike lee 
4416 in questioning the election process , payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box 
4417 not bad , but not all that good 
4418 there 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces 
4419 borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy 
4420 old people will love this movie , and i mean that in the nicest possible way : last orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship 
4421 so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen 
4422 the only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them 
4423 the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming 
4424 more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now 
4425 amazingly dopey 
4426 the christ allegory does n't work because there is no foundation for it 
4427 romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong 
4428 combines improbable melodrama -lrb- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -rrb- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched 
4429 there 's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo ... never quite settles on either side 
4430 you do n't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that 's the mark of a documentary that works 
4431 i 'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening , but it 's stupid 
4432 writer\/director david caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza 
4433 the journey to the secret 's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough 
4434 roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion 
4435 it 's soulful and unslick , and that 's apparently just what -lrb- aniston -rrb- has always needed to grow into a movie career 
4436 like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs 
4437 devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower 
4438 has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ... 
4439 tells a fascinating , compelling story 
4440 a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats 
4441 ah , what the hell 
4442 like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour 
4443 ... gripping and handsome execution , -lrb- but -rrb- there is n't much about k-19 that 's unique or memorable 
4444 one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation 
4445 devotees of star trek ii : the wrath of khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best next generation episodes is lacking 
4446 beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom 
4447 the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one 
4448 michel piccoli 's moving performance is this films reason for being 
4449 read my lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love 
4450 those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein 's life would do better elsewhere 
4451 yes , soar 
4452 as banal as the telling may be -- and at times , all my loved ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention 
4453 although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work 
4454 it 's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs 
4455 naipaul fans may be disappointed 
4456 attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama 
4457 poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter 
4458 in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's forget paris 
4459 ... by the time it 's done with us , mira nair 's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over 
4460 the film will appeal to discovery channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses 
4461 you do n't want to call the cops 
4462 if there 's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way 
4463 a huge box-office hit in korea , shiri is a must for genre fans 
4464 clint eastwood 's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb & j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises -- but still quite tasty and inviting all the same 
4465 the thing about guys like evans is this : you 're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins 
4466 i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent 
4467 it 's like an all-star salute to disney 's cheesy commercialism 
4468 `` the tuxedo '' should have been the vehicle for chan that `` the mask '' was for jim carrey 
4469 like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create 
4470 i do n't even care that there 's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff 
4471 though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere 
4472 the first fatal attraction was vile enough 
4473 a sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters 
4474 measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs , red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller 
4475 and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is 
4476 ... a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job ... 
4477 garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work 
4478 it 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly 
4479 friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans 
4480 it is also beautifully acted 
4481 this dubious product of a college-spawned -lrb- colgate u. -rrb- comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips 
4482 it 's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story 
4483 all three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly balk , who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents 
4484 ... a powerful sequel and one of the best films of the year 
4485 it 's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that 's actually sort of amazing 
4486 a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema 
4487 if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation 
4488 such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production 
4489 the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise ... then mike myers shows up and ruins everything 
4490 the new film of anton chekhov 's the cherry orchard puts the ` ick ' in ` classic 
4491 ' 
4492 poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action 
4493 if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably would n't be too crazy with his great-grandson 's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way 
4494 passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone 
4495 definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum 
4496 this story of a determined woman 's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments 
4497 well made but uninvolving , bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery 
4498 ... expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape 
4499 as steamy as last week 's pork dumplings 
4500 the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it 's as if it all happened only yesterday 
4501 the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance 
4502 another week , another gross-out college comedy -- ugh 
4503 a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film 
4504 but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns ... this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity 
4505 too silly to take seriously 
4506 low comedy does n't come much lower 
4507 it 's a very tasteful rock and roll movie 
4508 meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant 
4509 davis ' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort 
4510 a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play 
4511 all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise 
4512 ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok 
4513 sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they 'd need a shower 
4514 hard to resist 
4515 there 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 
4516 director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here 
4517 while the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other 
4518 like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it 's one tough rock 
4519 no cute factor here ... not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise 
4520 suffers from its timid parsing of the barn-side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers 
4521 it 's a frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be 
4522 an incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic 
4523 a knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor 
4524 ... begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully 
4525 the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries 
4526 for a debut film , skin of man , heart of beast feels unusually assured 
4527 quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver 
4528 most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved 
4529 a poignant comedy that offers food for thought 
4530 deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet\/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going 
4531 there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract 
4532 secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie 
4533 everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable 
4534 this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air 
4535 a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks 
4536 ah-nuld 's action hero days might be over 
4537 the movie has a script -lrb- by paul pender -rrb- made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions 
4538 the filmmakers ' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls ' environment 
4539 it also shows how deeply felt emotions can draw people together across the walls that might otherwise separate them 
4540 even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency 
4541 it 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness 
4542 they threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans 
4543 - west coast rap wars , this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate 
4544 as part of mr. dong 's continuing exploration of homosexuality in america , family fundamentals is an earnest study in despair 
4545 a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms 
4546 all in all , brown sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that 's both charming and well acted 
4547 represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging indian american cinema 
4548 so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy 
4549 a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life 
4550 tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to liyan 's backyard 
4551 a stylish thriller 
4552 constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act 
4553 this harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked 
4554 an estrogen opera so intensely feminine that it serves as the antidote -lrb- and cannier doppelganger -rrb- to diesel 's xxx flex-a-thon 
4555 birthday girl does n't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency 
4556 meanders between its powerful moments 
4557 with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted 
4558 a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise 
4559 that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults 
4560 the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` baran 
4561 ' 
4562 there 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease 
4563 unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country , but especially from france 
4564 the rock is destined to be the 21st century 's new `` conan '' and that he 's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal 
4565 adults , other than the parents ... will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild 
4566 here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé 
4567 plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story 
4568 snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him 
4569 before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg 's adaptation of mary gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience 
4570 there 's not much to fatale , outside of its stylish surprises ... but that 's ok 
4571 ... very funny , very enjoyable ... 
4572 it 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` the loud and the ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated 
4573 there ai n't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it 's hilarious 
4574 the hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone 
4575 ... with the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself 
4576 much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here 
4577 lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest 
4578 he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper 
4579 it 's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie 's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all 
4580 this method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here 
4581 a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films ... cross over to a more mainstream audience 
4582 it 's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive 
4583 a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie 
4584 sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to frida kahlo as if her life did , too 
4585 the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long 
4586 often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy 
4587 rob schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian 
4588 ... the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with musset unfolds as sand 's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form 
4589 aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters 
4590 it 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x ... look positively shakesperean by comparison 
4591 a hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life 
4592 an ugly , pointless , stupid movie 
4593 a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man 
4594 a smart little indie 
4595 a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on 
4596 ... what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be 
4597 goes on and on to the point of nausea 
4598 i have a new favorite musical -- and i 'm not even a fan of the genre 
4599 master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours 
4600 you 'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter ... ' 
4601 easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year 
4602 despite the surface attractions -- conrad l. hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything 
4603 broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs 
4604 looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights 
4605 that 's why sex and lucia is so alluring 
4606 after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be 
4607 nettelbeck ... has a pleasing way with a metaphor 
4608 a puzzle whose pieces do not fit 
4609 a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism 
4610 after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music 
4611 not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker 
4612 it 's fun , but it 's a real howler 
4613 even through its flaws , revolution # 9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film 
4614 just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing 
4615 the case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause 
4616 no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina 
4617 when twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we 'd live in if argento 's hollywood counterparts ... had this much imagination and nerve 
4618 on its own , big trouble could be considered a funny little film 
4619 -lrb- reynolds -rrb- takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch 
4620 ... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet 
4621 if you 're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director 's life , eisenstein delivers 
4622 it 's too bad nothing else is 
4623 this is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but ayres makes the right choices at every turn 
4624 probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent 
4625 it made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's reign of fire 
4626 ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley 's source novel -lrb- about schmidt -rrb- and an old payne screenplay 
4627 ... once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable 
4628 this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part 
4629 nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing 
4630 this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes 
4631 every joke is repeated at least four times 
4632 the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag 
4633 and adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film 's lamer instincts are in the saddle 
4634 the best film of the year 2002 
4635 blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden 
4636 you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld 's real life is boring 
4637 the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it 's actually watchable 
4638 a movie i loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance 
4639 an overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy 
4640 this is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope 
4641 solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike 
4642 a documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary 
4643 most haunting about `` fence '' is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen 
4644 starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés 
4645 the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe 
4646 -lrb- i -rrb- t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop is n't as funny as it should be 
4647 but the second half of the movie really goes downhill 
4648 a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a ` direct-to-video ' release 
4649 merci pour le movie 
4650 this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand 
4651 ... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable 
4652 the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game 
4653 an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle 
4654 although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film does n't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything 
4655 an engrossing story that combines psychological drama , sociological reflection , and high-octane thriller 
4656 a gripping drama 
4657 it picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film 
4658 barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality 
4659 the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies 
4660 its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock -lrb- since sept. 11 -rrb- 
4661 a pretty decent kid-pleasing , tolerable-to-adults lark of a movie 
4662 a disturbing examination of what appears to be the definition of a ` bad ' police shooting 
4663 as i settled into my world war ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances 
4664 the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing 
4665 presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency 
4666 classic cinema served up with heart and humor 
4667 there may have been a good film in `` trouble every day , '' but it is not what is on the screen 
4668 the result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis 
4669 that 's because relatively nothing happens 
4670 an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium 
4671 but they do n't fit well together and neither is well told 
4672 like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... circuit gets drawn into the party 
4673 with dirty deeds , david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen 
4674 oddly , the film is n't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that 's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny 
4675 i 've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and i recommend it for its originality alone 
4676 in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st 
4677 when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm 
4678 a virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze 
4679 ... there 's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise 
4680 it 's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot 
4681 a good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold 
4682 this is a children 's film in the truest sense 
4683 a very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles 
4684 if h.g. wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin 's reworked version , what would he say ? 
4685 the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating 
4686 a solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket 
4687 there are n't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs. the big guys 
4688 plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line 
4689 a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film 
4690 leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema 
4691 sitting in the third row of the imax cinema at sydney 's darling harbour , but i sometimes felt as though i was in the tiny two seater plane that carried the giant camera around australia , sweeping and gliding , banking and hovering over some of the most not 
4692 it 's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs 
4693 it 's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller 
4694 the film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences 
4695 she boxes these women 's souls right open for us 
4696 what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess 
4697 it 's just plain boring 
4698 all the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling 
4699 this is dicaprio 's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year 
4700 though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb 
4701 it 's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance 
4702 jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you 're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging 
4703 cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , the full monty , with something different 
4704 ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan 's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he 's a disloyal satyr 
4705 one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out 
4706 other than the slightly flawed -lrb- and fairly unbelievable -rrb- finale , everything else is top shelf 
4707 a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more 
4708 `` bad '' is the operative word for `` bad company , '' and i do n't mean that in a good way 
4709 seriously , rent the disney version 
4710 the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d 
4711 it 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 
4712 as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan 's gifts , which are such that we 'll keep watching the skies for his next project 
4713 the only pain you 'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub 
4714 in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage 
4715 the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time 
4716 about amy 's cuteness , amy 's career success -lrb- she 's a best-selling writer of self-help books who ca n't help herself -rrb- , and amy 's neuroses when it comes to men 
4717 if you go , pack your knitting needles 
4718 call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid 
4719 assured , vital and well wrought , the film is , arguably , the most accomplished work to date from hong kong 's versatile stanley kwan 
4720 notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , i 'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl - 
4721 the big ending surprise almost saves the movie 
4722 well , they 're ` they ' 
4723 `` secretary '' is owned by its costars , spader and gyllenhaal 
4724 an ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging 
4725 what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie 
4726 so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along 
4727 a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight 
4728 too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks 
4729 austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride 
4730 nair 's cast is so large it 's altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion 
4731 -lrb- t -rrb- oo many of these gross out scenes ... 
4732 an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind 
4733 when it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia 
4734 killing time , that 's all that 's going on here 
4735 it 's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal 
4736 if you like peace , you 'll like promises 
4737 there 's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again 
4738 the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed 
4739 a perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy 
4740 super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers\/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers 
4741 overall , it 's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs 
4742 the performances are uniformly good 
4743 it would n't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny 
4744 a subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad 
4745 if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material 
4746 murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud ... and parmentier 
4747 ... for all its social and political potential , state property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful 
4748 the search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters ' suffering 
4749 a hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic french nuance 
4750 unwieldy contraption 
4751 by and large this is mr. kilmer 's movie , and it 's his strongest performance since the doors 
4752 a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer 
4753 feral and uncomfortable 
4754 one of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature 
4755 -lrb- a -rrb- crushing disappointment 
4756 i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's 
4757 the beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep 
4758 seems like someone going through the motions 
4759 despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j.k. rowling 's marvelous series into a deadly bore 
4760 fans of plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers 
4761 ... a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind 
4762 the attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way 
4763 the production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these characters love each other 
4764 ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer 's memory 
4765 ` this movie sucks 
4766 ' 
4767 an ideal love story for those intolerant of the more common saccharine genre 
4768 ... a bland , pretentious mess 
4769 the smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense 
4770 the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale 
4771 alternately frustrating and rewarding 
4772 ... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags 
4773 a superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find 
4774 sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and judaism back at least 50 
4775 a listless and desultory affair 
4776 a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs. robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women 
4777 nothing about them is attractive 
4778 manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting 
4779 vera has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores 
4780 the performances are an absolute joy 
4781 this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done 
4782 like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame 
4783 it is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias , especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise 
4784 it 's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once 
4785 this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool 
4786 -lrb- swimfan -rrb- falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting 
4787 it ca n't escape its past , and it does n't want to 
4788 the umpteenth summer skinny dip in jerry bruckheimer 's putrid pond of retread action twaddle 
4789 so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie 
4790 loosely speaking , we 're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin 
4791 predictably melodramatic 
4792 silly , loud and goofy 
4793 russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage 
4794 highly engaging 
4795 by the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better 
4796 antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it 
4797 the whole talking-animal thing is grisly 
4798 the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory 
4799 more a gunfest than a rock concert 
4800 it is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one 
4801 if you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun 
4802 tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often 
4803 has its moments -- and almost as many subplots 
4804 a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches 
4805 except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion 
4806 what 's next ? 
4807 nelson 's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself 
4808 buy popcorn 
4809 twohy 's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels 
4810 an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that 's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty 
4811 sparkles in its deft portrait of tinseltown 's seasoned veterans of gossip , wealth , paranoia , and celebrityhood 
4812 aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash 
4813 fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers 
4814 a creaky staircase gothic 
4815 hatosy ... portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue 
4816 washington overcomes the script 's flaws and envelops the audience in his character 's anguish , anger and frustration 
4817 mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls 
4818 very stupid and annoying 
4819 don michael paul uses quick-cuts , -lrb- very -rrb- large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double -lrb- for seagal -rrb- 
4820 an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance 
4821 the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material 
4822 call this the full monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux 
4823 slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by 
4824 ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy 
4825 it 's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn 
4826 make like the title and dodge this one 
4827 often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers 
4828 the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington 's fine performance in the title role 
4829 but it 's surprisingly harmless 
4830 officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny 
4831 broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force 
4832 a film that suffers because of its many excesses 
4833 a quietly moving look back at what it was to be iranian-american in 1979 
4834 the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting 
4835 staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce 
4836 a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour 
4837 a competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country 
4838 functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing 
4839 spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around 
4840 reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining 
4841 the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience 
4842 turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters 
4843 one of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends 
4844 to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree 
4845 there 's no denying that burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him 
4846 a film that loses sight of its own story 
4847 where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval 
4848 these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation 
4849 a fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age 
4850 the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side 
4851 a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target 
4852 there 's plenty to impress about e.t. 
4853 the pianist -lrb- is -rrb- a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war 's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life 
4854 topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs 
4855 has its share of arresting images 
4856 never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three 
4857 the movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness 
4858 it 's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there 's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag 
4859 it is there to give them a good time 
4860 whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama is n't much of a mystery , unfortunately 
4861 has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke 
4862 a conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man 's right to raise his own children 
4863 those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking 
4864 the action is reasonably well-done ... yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together 
4865 sadly , ` garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` wayne 
4866 ' 
4867 some may choose to interpret the film 's end as hopeful or optimistic but i think payne is after something darker 
4868 the story of trouble every day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult 
4869 -lrb- t -rrb- he ideas of revolution # 9 are more compelling than the execution 
4870 most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence 
4871 consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire 
4872 imagine -lrb- if possible -rrb- a pasolini film without passion or politics , or an almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching o fantasma 
4873 it 's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you 've seen the remake first 
4874 just plain bad 
4875 although it tries to be much more , it 's really just another major league 
4876 when the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence 
4877 the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood 
4878 director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
4879 colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate 's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory 
4880 this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action 
4881 slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot 
4882 if i want music , i 'll buy the soundtrack 
4883 this movie has the usual impossible stunts ... but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie 
4884 ... salaciously simplistic 
4885 sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates 
4886 as a film director , labute continues to improve 
4887 a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so 
4888 the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course 
4889 lazily directed by charles stone iii ... from a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novelist thulani davis 
4890 the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so 
4891 this is a film living far too much in its own head 
4892 pascale bailly 's rom-com provides amélie 's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i.e. , a banal spiritual quest 
4893 flawed , but worth seeing for ambrose 's performance 
4894 p.t. anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible 
4895 imagine o. henry 's the gift of the magi relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of nyc 's drug scene 
4896 if mr. zhang 's subject matter is , to some degree at least , quintessentially american , his approach to storytelling might be called iranian 
4897 the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson 's magnolia and david lynch 's mulholland dr. 
4898 i do n't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he 's made at least one damn fine horror movie 
4899 large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride 
4900 `` frailty '' offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies 
4901 despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed 
4902 a pint-sized ` goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest 
4903 no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make 
4904 any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors 
4905 go , girls , right down the reality drain 
4906 staggeringly dreadful romance 
4907 a smart , compelling drama 
4908 thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents 
4909 ... there 's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages 
4910 you want to call domino 's 
4911 deliciously slow 
4912 might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper 
4913 the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay 
4914 the most remarkable -lrb- and frustrating -rrb- thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank 
4915 offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of beijing 
4916 ... certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes 
4917 an escapist confection that 's pure entertainment 
4918 an amused indictment of jaglom 's own profession 
4919 there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down 
4920 so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag 
4921 a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special 
4922 beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it 's a lyrical endeavour 
4923 pompous and garbled 
4924 there 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale 
4925 for all its problems ... the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring ... which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience 
4926 the salton sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety 
4927 a touching , sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes 
4928 it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag 
4929 ... myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty-joke book done up in post-tarantino pop-culture riffs ... 
4930 a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away 
4931 cuba gooding jr. valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy 
4932 a sharp , amusing study of the cult of celebrity 
4933 a culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe 
4934 constantly slips from the grasp of its maker 
4935 the leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits 
4936 an emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema 
4937 that the real antwone fisher was able to overcome his personal obstacles and become a good man is a wonderful thing ; that he has been able to share his story so compellingly with us is a minor miracle 
4938 what a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this is 
4939 simplistic , silly and tedious 
4940 we just do n't really care too much about this love story 
4941 writer\/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results 
4942 it 's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash. , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it 's what makes their project so interesting 
4943 now here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud 
4944 offers laughs and insight into one of the toughest ages a kid can go through 
4945 an extraordinarily silly thriller 
4946 the faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of v.s. naipaul 's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour 
4947 disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself 
4948 for a film about explosions and death and spies , `` ballistic : ecks vs. sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film 
4949 what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
4950 it 's up to -lrb- watts -rrb- to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe 
4951 what makes this film special is serry 's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context 
4952 well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies 
4953 ... a solid , well-formed satire 
4954 a pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film 
4955 though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set 
4956 the film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed 
4957 less than fresh 
4958 labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public 
4959 those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give `` scratch '' a second look 
4960 a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor 
4961 it 's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of -lrb- woo 's -rrb- best work 
4962 using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater 
4963 old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment 
4964 britney 's performance can not be faulted 
4965 they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way 
4966 `` what john does is heroic , but we do n't condone it , '' one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia 
4967 mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline 
4968 an ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation 
4969 below may not mark mr. twohy 's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished 
4970 i think it was plato who said , ' i think , therefore i know better than to rush to the theatre for this one 
4971 ' 
4972 the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot 
4973 is n't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? 
4974 but something seems to be missing 
4975 this stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror 
4976 chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing 
4977 ' 
4978 it 's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage 
4979 red dragon makes one appreciate silence of the lambs 
4980 yet another weepy southern bore-athon 
4981 white has n't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else 
4982 world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it 's certainly an honest attempt to get at something 
4983 it is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad 
4984 witty dialog between realistic characters showing honest emotions 
4985 it 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love 
4986 a very pretty after-school special 
4987 hawke 's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does n't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes 
4988 gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing 
4989 the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy 
4990 using an endearing cast , writer\/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred 
4991 some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments 
4992 `` sorority boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad 
4993 toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it 's hard not to be carried away 
4994 the movie is n't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave 
4995 silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who ca n't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another 
4996 it 's the filmmakers ' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time b movies good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion 
4997 and , there 's no way you wo n't be talking about the film once you exit the theater 
4998 the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing 
4999 his work with actors is particularly impressive 
5000 is `` ballistic '' worth the price of admission ? 
5001 a. 
5002 unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling 
5003 after all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying 
5004 worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames 
5005 one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart 
5006 when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble 
5007 a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day 
5008 wishy-washy 
5009 no one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive 
5010 it just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller 
5011 the next big thing 's not-so-big -lrb- and not-so-hot -rrb- directorial debut 
5012 reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that 
5013 moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured 
5014 for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must ! 
5015 too often , son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained `` big moment '' will occur and not `` if 
5016 '' 
5017 denis forges out of the theories of class - based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord 
5018 the mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t. 
5019 it is up to you to decide if you need to see it 
5020 the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy 's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away 
5021 a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much sense even on its own terms 
5022 it 's sweet ... but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end 
5023 a certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents 
5024 why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , i did n't care 
5025 shallow 
5026 a work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry 
5027 but toback 's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again 
5028 all three women deliver remarkable performances 
5029 koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager 's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation 
5030 off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all 
5031 there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon , providing unexpected fizzability 
5032 in an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve 
5033 `` freaky friday , '' it 's not 
5034 instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground 
5035 if there 's one big point to promises , it 's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other 
5036 an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades 
5037 bolstered by an astonishing voice cast -lrb- excepting love hewitt -rrb- , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i have n't encountered since at least pete 's dragon 
5038 while the now 72-year-old robert evans been slowed down by a stroke , he has at least one more story to tell : his own 
5039 this is one baaaaaaaaad movie 
5040 maggie smith as the ya-ya member with the o2-tank will absolutely crack you up with her crass , then gasp for gas , verbal deportment 
5041 granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek 
5042 brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life 
5043 borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion 
5044 appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites 
5045 self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable 
5046 the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head 
5047 this u-boat does n't have a captain 
5048 there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies 
5049 photographed with melancholy richness and eloquently performed yet also decidedly uncinematic 
5050 spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don ' t know an orc from a uruk-hai 
5051 a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst 
5052 you will likely prefer to keep on watching 
5053 a film that 's flawed and brilliant in equal measure 
5054 it 's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking 
5055 if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story -lrb- like , say , treasure planet -rrb- or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i 'll take the latter every time 
5056 the importance of being earnest movie seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play 
5057 '' 
5058 it 's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell 
5059 one fantastic -lrb- and educational -rrb- documentary 
5060 the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer 's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly 
5061 one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily 
5062 a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park 's 
5063 he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue 
5064 an incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been 
5065 cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio 
5066 instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust 
5067 i love the robust middle of this picture 
5068 for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one 
5069 it 's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience 
5070 children of the century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers 
5071 there is so much plodding sensitivity 
5072 intriguing and downright intoxicating 
5073 a sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception 
5074 i still like moonlight mile , better judgment be damned 
5075 a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels 
5076 so brisk is wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe 
5077 with an expressive face reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality like zhang ziyi 's , dong stakes out the emotional heart of happy 
5078 steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen 
5079 george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension 
5080 putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora 's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest 
5081 with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright 
5082 though tom shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance 
5083 `` auto focus '' works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era 
5084 with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is 
5085 one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once 
5086 except it 's much , much better 
5087 good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography 
5088 they exist for hushed lines like `` they 're back ! '' 
5089 it 's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects 
5090 is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime 
5091 jason patric and ray liotta make for one splendidly cast pair 
5092 there 's no clear picture of who killed bob crane 
5093 if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you 're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained 
5094 its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy 
5095 not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best 
5096 insightfully written , delicately performed 
5097 shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom 
5098 kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that 
5099 wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted 
5100 in my opinion , analyze that is not as funny or entertaining as analyze this , but it is a respectable sequel 
5101 the directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor 's doorstep 
5102 the movie 's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing 
5103 it 's no lie -- big fat liar is a real charmer 
5104 a gorgeously strange movie , heaven is deeply concerned with morality , but it refuses to spell things out for viewers 
5105 you 'll cry for your money back 
5106 the package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic 
5107 a subtle , humorous , illuminating study of politics , power and social mobility 
5108 i loved the look of this film 
5109 this little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation 
5110 another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting 
5111 it has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and mandy moore leaves a positive impression 
5112 a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise 
5113 the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute 
5114 for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet 
5115 clayburgh and tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves eric schaeffer 
5116 the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread 
5117 a slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time 
5118 life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why 
5119 what you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height 
5120 the campy results make mel brooks ' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated 
5121 an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots 
5122 two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity 
5123 when the violence actually shocked ? 
5124 aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships 
5125 an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance 
5126 while parker and co-writer catherine di napoli are faithful to melville 's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast ... have made the old boy 's characters more quick-witted than any english lit major would have thought possible 
5127 the aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement 
5128 it 's all surface psychodramatics 
5129 less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan 
5130 comedian , like its subjects , delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride 
5131 it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo 
5132 it 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good 
5133 it 's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters 
5134 it 's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth 
5135 scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario 
5136 replacing john carpenter 's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage 
5137 the film delivers what it promises : a look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans 
5138 it thankfully goes easy on the reel\/real world dichotomy that -lrb- jaglom -rrb- pursued with such enervating determination in venice\/venice 
5139 a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them 
5140 like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional 
5141 possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure 
5142 the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling 
5143 mark pellington 's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth 
5144 no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script 
5145 has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it 's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick 
5146 hollywood 's answer to an air ball 
5147 prepare to marvel again 
5148 family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition ... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance 
5149 stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed 
5150 troubling and powerful 
5151 the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness 
5152 cassavetes thinks he 's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon 
5153 ` dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue 
5154 the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there 's not enough to the story to fill two hours 
5155 a genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama 
5156 the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one 
5157 parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there is n't enough clever innuendo to fil 
5158 amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it 
5159 maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there 's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is 
5160 nohe 's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : he is n't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction 
5161 rock 's stand-up magic wanes 
5162 a delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie 
5163 a sexy , surprising romance ... idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair ... their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger 
5164 barely 
5165 plays like some corny television production from a bygone era 
5166 as a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious 
5167 it 's like a drive-by 
5168 most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer 's radio show and his simpson voice-overs 
5169 it 's sweet 
5170 one of the worst movies of the year 
5171 the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding 
5172 like brosnan 's performance , evelyn comes from the heart 
5173 though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable 
5174 -lrb- woo 's -rrb- most resonant film since the killer 
5175 it 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious 
5176 this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost 
5177 strange and beautiful film 
5178 a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece 
5179 the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch 
5180 the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's hollywood 
5181 the catch is that they 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders 
5182 one of those so-so films that could have been much better 
5183 proves mainly that south korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their hollywood counterparts 
5184 how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
5185 a very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about italian - , chinese - , irish - , latin - , indian - , russian - and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages 
5186 has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital 
5187 as original and insightful as last week 's episode of behind the music 
5188 marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary 
5189 ... this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along ... 
5190 ... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` queen '' and less of the `` damned 
5191 '' 
5192 reveals how important our special talents can be when put in service of of others 
5193 as a vehicle to savour binoche 's skill , the film is well worthwhile 
5194 what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera 's attention to detail 
5195 steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture 
5196 it has a way of seeping into your consciousness , with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at 
5197 the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film 's problems 
5198 the pleasure of read my lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string 
5199 insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion 
5200 this would-be ` james bond for the extreme generation ' pic is one big , dumb action movie 
5201 when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs. woo , it looks like woo 's a p.o.w. 
5202 initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience 
5203 evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention 
5204 characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle 
5205 a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it is n't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films 
5206 it turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning 
5207 is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house 
5208 an example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship 
5209 ` would n't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it 's like on the other side of the bra ? ' 
5210 the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books 
5211 cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace 
5212 been there done that 
5213 something has been lost in the translation ... another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise 
5214 tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun 
5215 despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable 
5216 cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective 
5217 for all its brooding quality , ash wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast 
5218 delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for 
5219 the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie 
5220 -- that the ` true story ' by which all the queen 's men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen 
5221 you could hate it for the same reason 
5222 a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously 
5223 waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway 
5224 reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition 
5225 `` frailty '' starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different -lrb- and better -rrb- than most films with this theme 
5226 thanks to the château 's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises 
5227 gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing 
5228 julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent 
5229 in the affable maid in manhattan , jennifer lopez 's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly a-list players 
5230 a movie that at its best does n't just make the most out of its characters ' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection 
5231 elegantly produced and expressively performed , the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy 
5232 dark and unrepentant , this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten 
5233 you really have to salute writer-director haneke -lrb- he adapted elfriede jelinek 's novel -rrb- for making a film that is n't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch 
5234 a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship 
5235 it is an indelible epic american story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives 
5236 solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is n't talking a talk that appeals to me 
5237 a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep ` epic 
5238 ' 
5239 stale , futile scenario 
5240 a film in a class with spike lee 's masterful do the right thing 
5241 not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance 
5242 in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs. sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase 
5243 if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it 
5244 full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in 
5245 a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something 
5246 a delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it 's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow 
5247 nothing but an episode of smackdown ! 
5248 for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there 's something creepy about this movie 
5249 it 's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost 
5250 the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers do n't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types 
5251 made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because -lrb- solondz 's -rrb- cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt 
5252 kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other 
5253 the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow 
5254 it 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish 
5255 a plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists 
5256 it 's drab 
5257 ... a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels 
5258 what 's so striking about jolie 's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair 
5259 director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff 
5260 in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works 
5261 i 've never bought from telemarketers , but i bought this movie 
5262 woven together handsomely , recalling sixties ' rockumentary milestones from lonely boy to do n't look back 
5263 melodrama with a message 
5264 horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists 
5265 a sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire 
5266 a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions 
5267 10 minutes into the film you 'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away 
5268 an enjoyable above average summer diversion 
5269 watching this film , what we feel is n't mainly suspense or excitement 
5270 a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman 's point-of-view 
5271 it 's not going to be everyone 's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on 
5272 violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining 
5273 like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories 
5274 as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired 
5275 sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this argentinean ` dramedy ' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors 
5276 `` 13 conversations about one thing '' is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling 
5277 a no-holds-barred cinematic treat 
5278 your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make 
5279 plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year 
5280 all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence 
5281 with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles 
5282 like a fish that 's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places 
5283 adaptation 's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary 
5284 canadian filmmaker gary burns ' inventive and mordantly humorous take on the soullessness of work in the city 
5285 ultimately , `` mib ii '' succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it ca n't be dismissed as mindless 
5286 like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen 's astringent wit 
5287 go for la salle 's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script 
5288 was i scared ? 
5289 fast , frantic and fun , but also soon forgotten 
5290 tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident 
5291 the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows 
5292 a family film that contains some hefty thematic material on time , death , eternity , and what is needed to live a rich and full life 
5293 a riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades 
5294 by no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one 
5295 rewarding 
5296 often hilarious 
5297 a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma 
5298 shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic 
5299 just watch bettany strut his stuff 
5300 it provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1.2 million palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of gaza 
5301 i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort 
5302 jaunty fun , with its celeb-strewn backdrop well used 
5303 the adventure does n't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 
5304 a very charming and funny movie 
5305 if you 're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again 
5306 you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that 
5307 nair 's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances 
5308 ... the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material 
5309 beware the quirky brit-com 
5310 a sense of real magic , perhaps 
5311 in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life 
5312 a tour de force of modern cinema 
5313 able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history 
5314 it still feels like a prison stretch 
5315 a lifetime movie about men 
5316 near the end takes on a whole other meaning 
5317 adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel 
5318 he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty 
5319 this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative 
5320 the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism 
5321 -lrb- a -rrb- smarter and much funnier version of the old police academy flicks 
5322 her fans walked out muttering words like `` horrible '' and `` terrible , '' but had so much fun dissing the film that they did n't mind the ticket cost 
5323 a supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama 
5324 snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good 
5325 an impeccable study in perversity 
5326 then nadia 's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all 
5327 what sets it apart is the vision that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway 's the lion king and the film titus , brings 
5328 twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task 
5329 offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere 
5330 but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging 
5331 a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices 
5332 decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like 
5333 an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers 
5334 i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen 
5335 time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation 
5336 a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft 
5337 twenty years after its first release , e.t. remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg 's misunderstood career 
5338 more of a career curio than a major work 
5339 suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness 
5340 talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture 
5341 filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life 
5342 the great pity is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home 
5343 beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments 
5344 more tiring than anything 
5345 laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters 
5346 uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ... 
5347 a perceptive , good-natured movie 
5348 the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy 
5349 maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor 
5350 humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way 
5351 if you 're looking for a story , do n't bother 
5352 reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness 
5353 if you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there 
5354 other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst 
5355 the movie is like scorsese 's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot 
5356 like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film 
5357 captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure , allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper 
5358 this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be 
5359 gay or straight , kissing jessica stein is one of the greatest date movies in years 
5360 when the heroes were actually under 40 ? 
5361 he drags it back , single-handed 
5362 translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be ya-ya 
5363 if horses could fly , this is surely what they 'd look like 
5364 the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits 
5365 there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has - been-told-a - thousand-times - before movie 
5366 a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause 
5367 reggio and glass put on an intoxicating show 
5368 a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd 
5369 be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat , tense with suspense 
5370 the mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick 
5371 ' 
5372 serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst 
5373 both heartbreaking and heartwarming ... just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it 's tremendously moving 
5374 the series ' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent , as do the girls ' amusing personalities 
5375 the santa clause 2 's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry 
5376 it 's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series 
5377 the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks 
5378 true to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` the country bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation 
5379 the piano teacher is not an easy film 
5380 degenerates into hogwash 
5381 absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man 's navel 
5382 those who are not acquainted with the author 's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep 
5383 sex with strangers is fascinating ... 
5384 unlike trey parker , sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself 
5385 byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle 
5386 smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong ... it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera 
5387 green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that 
5388 a minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera ... 
5389 not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending 
5390 stealing harvard ca n't even do that much 
5391 leguizamo and jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb 
5392 if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish 
5393 the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness 
5394 a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore 
5395 the characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script 
5396 neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm 
5397 likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? 
5398 what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom 
5399 this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain 
5400 another trumpet blast that there may be a new mexican cinema a-bornin ' 
5401 ' 
5402 it 's clear that mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent 
5403 what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point 
5404 expands the limits of what a film can be , taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street 
5405 does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny 
5406 it 's obvious -lrb- je-gyu is -rrb- trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom 
5407 despite the film 's shortcomings , the stories are quietly moving 
5408 from blushing to gushing -- imamura squirts the screen in ` warm water under a red bridge ' 
5409 delight your senses and crash this wedding ! 
5410 the best thing i can say about this film is that i ca n't wait to see what the director does next 
5411 ... wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams 
5412 the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo 
5413 a true-blue delight 
5414 about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces ... positively dreadful 
5415 it leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors 
5416 what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits 
5417 an enjoyable experience 
5418 and they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor 
5419 very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all 
5420 no , even that 's too committed 
5421 the entire movie is in need of a scented bath 
5422 i spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits 
5423 it shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between 
5424 director david jacobson gives dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims 
5425 the hours , a delicately crafted film , is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame 
5426 it 's all a rather shapeless good time ... 
5427 a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere 
5428 are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
5429 soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable 
5430 this movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad 
5431 no better or worse than ` truth or consequences , n.m. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater 
5432 well , this movie proves you wrong on both counts 
5433 much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments ... 
5434 those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals 
5435 its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads 
5436 theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues 
5437 this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i 'd expected it to be 
5438 ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway 
5439 but , no , we get another scene , and then another 
5440 we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest 
5441 as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely 
5442 like schindler 's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way 
5443 a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli 
5444 video games are more involving than this mess 
5445 if there ai n't none , you have a problem 
5446 an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? 
5447 it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff 
5448 the plan to make enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong 
5449 dog soldiers does n't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it 
5450 wow , a jump cut ! 
5451 third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby ! 
5452 weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title 
5453 i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done 
5454 would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ? 
5455 makes the case for a strong education and good teachers being more valuable in the way they help increase an average student 's self-esteem , and not strictly in the knowledge imparted 
5456 a giddy and provocative sexual romp that has something to say 
5457 what 's not to like about a movie with a ` children 's ' song that includes the line ` my stepdad 's not mean , he 's just adjusting ' ? 
5458 equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid 
5459 suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 
5460 eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation 
5461 in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway 
5462 schneider 's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story 's continuity and progression 
5463 for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence 
5464 what begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters 
5465 explosions , jokes , and sexual innuendoes abound 
5466 it was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at 
5467 it 's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son 's room 
5468 not as well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted 
5469 spielberg 's realization of a near-future america is masterful 
5470 amidst the action , the script carries arnold -lrb- and the viewers -rrb- into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story 
5471 '' 
5472 as gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting 
5473 maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements 
5474 jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama 
5475 -lrb- h -rrb- ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i 'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by 
5476 it 's sort of in-between , and it works 
5477 he 's the scariest guy you 'll see all summer 
5478 unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters 
5479 a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you ca n't wait to see end 
5480 a cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty 
5481 mediocre fable from burkina faso 
5482 a hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look 
5483 the worst film of the year 
5484 a funny , triumphant , and moving documentary 
5485 for the most part , the film does hold up pretty well 
5486 it 's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and i think that 's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline 
5487 there 's a spontaneity to the chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout 
5488 in fact , it 's quite fun in places 
5489 it 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground 
5490 manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick 
5491 not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired 
5492 it 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante 's similarly styled gremlins 
5493 hollywood ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless 
5494 the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does 
5495 it 's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter 
5496 as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko 's how to kill your neighbor 's dog is slight but unendurable 
5497 genuinely unnerving 
5498 enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast 
5499 without any redeeming value whatsoever 
5500 an intoxicating experience 
5501 rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle 
5502 they cheapen the overall effect 
5503 this engrossing , characteristically complex tom clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time 
5504 it 's exactly what you 'd expect 
5505 what results is the best performance from either in years 
5506 a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama 's family 
5507 s1m0ne 's satire is not subtle , but it is effective 
5508 has its charming quirks and its dull spots 
5509 an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus 
5510 a confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design 
5511 a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell 
5512 a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters 
5513 deliberately and skillfully uses ambiguity to suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance 
5514 and more than that , it 's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation 
5515 exploits -lrb- headbanger -rrb- stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter 
5516 resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project 
5517 the film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due 
5518 fluffy and disposible 
5519 in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film 
5520 odd and weird 
5521 the beauty of alexander payne 's ode to the everyman is in the details 
5522 wait for it to hit cable 
5523 no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way 
5524 he gets his secretary to fax it 
5525 '' 
5526 meyjes ' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil 
5527 can i admit xxx is as deep as a petri dish and as well-characterized as a telephone book but still say it was a guilty pleasure ? 
5528 a hugely rewarding experience that 's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant 's two best films -- four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones 's diary 
5529 jam-packed with literally bruising jokes 
5530 interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots 
5531 it 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through 
5532 it 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places 
5533 the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys 
5534 film ca n't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout 
5535 it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up 
5536 reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap 
5537 to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest 
5538 a distinguished and thoughtful film , marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances 
5539 grant is n't cary and bullock is n't katherine 
5540 a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome 
5541 not just unlikable 
5542 a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand 
5543 ' 
5544 priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal 
5545 disgusting 
5546 excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic 
5547 films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days 
5548 -lrb- it 's -rrb- a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest 
5549 as if drop dead gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition 
5550 but believe it or not , it 's one of the most beautiful , evocative works i 've seen 
5551 real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros 
5552 the film 's plot may be shallow , but you 've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots 
5553 the two leads , nearly perfect in their roles , bring a heart and reality that buoy the film , and at times , elevate it to a superior crime movie 
5554 a little objectivity could have gone a long way 
5555 mastering its formidable arithmetic of cameras and souls , group articulates a flood of emotion 
5556 ... a great , participatory spectator sport 
5557 ' 
5558 ... really horrible drek 
5559 wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men 
5560 the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not 
5561 a must for fans of british cinema , if only because so many titans of the industry are along for the ride 
5562 but it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre 
5563 what makes it worth watching is quaid 's performance 
5564 snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this 
5565 ... stale and uninspired 
5566 hey , happy ! 
5567 perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness 
5568 it reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death 
5569 it 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long 
5570 if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is -lrb- cattaneo -rrb- sophomore slump 
5571 rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along 
5572 this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative 
5573 for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion 
5574 no , i love it ... hell , i dunno 
5575 dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song 
5576 baran is shockingly devoid of your typical majid majidi shoe-loving , crippled children 
5577 khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum 
5578 as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign 
5579 that 's its first sign of trouble 
5580 the movie is ingenious fun 
5581 ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze 
5582 a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification 
5583 until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , wendigo , larry fessenden 's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films 
5584 you walk out of the good girl with mixed emotions -- disapproval of justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions 
5585 quitting delivers a sucker-punch , and its impact is all the greater beause director zhang 's last film , the cuddly shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house 
5586 hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the halloween series has lost its edge 
5587 a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog 
5588 it 's the perfect star vehicle for grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona 
5589 it grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration 
5590 makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place 
5591 tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination 
5592 the plot twists give i am trying to break your heart an attraction it desperately needed 
5593 breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting 
5594 like an episode of mtv 's undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance ... indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper 
5595 the film can depress you about life itself 
5596 the slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters 
5597 the film was n't preachy , but it was feminism by the book 
5598 like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone 
5599 then you get another phone call warning you that if the video is n't back at blockbuster before midnight , you 're going to face frightening late fees 
5600 until -lrb- the -rrb- superfluous ... epilogue that leaks suspension of disbelief like a sieve , die another day is as stimulating & heart-rate-raising as any james bond thriller 
5601 samuel beckett applied to the iranian voting process 
5602 its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there 's no time to think about them anyway 
5603 the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film 
5604 something for everyone 
5605 the story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed 
5606 graphic sex may be what 's attracting audiences to unfaithful , but gripping performances by lane and gere are what will keep them awake 
5607 feels shrill , simple and soapy 
5608 bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made 
5609 -lrb- screenwriter -rrb- pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation 
5610 it sucked 
5611 will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss 
5612 a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation 
5613 a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie 
5614 whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck 
5615 there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture 
5616 some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills 
5617 skins has a desolate air , but eyre , a native american raised by white parents , manages to infuse the rocky path to sibling reconciliation with flashes of warmth and gentle humor 
5618 an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. 
5619 a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages 
5620 the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished 
5621 this thing is virtually unwatchable 
5622 there is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all 
5623 this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks 
5624 s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance 
5625 handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy 
5626 schaefer 's ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle 
5627 huppert 's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling kathy baker 's creepy turn as the repressed mother on boston public just as much as 8 women 's augustine 
5628 yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma 
5629 may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists 
5630 terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood 's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man 
5631 costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier 
5632 the movie is brilliant , really 
5633 an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion 
5634 the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain 
5635 there is truth here 
5636 kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven 
5637 it 's easy to love robin tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices 
5638 it 's just not very smart 
5639 meandering and confusing 
5640 there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations 
5641 the film feels uncomfortably real , its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority 
5642 i 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i do n't see the point 
5643 without -lrb- de niro -rrb- , city by the sea would slip under the waves 
5644 and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser 
5645 great over-the-top moviemaking if you 're in a slap-happy mood 
5646 mr. soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious 
5647 if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann 's revolution no. 9 
5648 it 's something of the ultimate scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful new york gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas 
5649 too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one 
5650 instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence 
5651 just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills 
5652 williams creates a stunning , taxi driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity 
5653 demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh 
5654 but unless you 're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it is n't much fun 
5655 ah , the travails of metropolitan life ! 
5656 the pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of steven spielberg 's schindler 's list 
5657 promises is one film that 's truly deserving of its oscar nomination 
5658 this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film 
5659 impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition 
5660 it 's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer 's most pleasurable movies 
5661 a powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution 
5662 fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent 
5663 to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed 
5664 halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary 
5665 the otherwise good-naturedness of mr. deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely new york celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything sandler 's been attached to before 
5666 it arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications 
5667 all the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost 
5668 to get at the root psychology of this film would require many sessions on the couch of dr. freud 
5669 a remarkable film by bernard rose 
5670 pumpkin struts about with `` courage '' pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back 
5671 overly long and worshipful bio-doc 
5672 it 's the sweet cinderella story that `` pretty woman '' wanted to be 
5673 a delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by michael gondry 
5674 it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept 
5675 a tone of rueful compassion ... reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events 
5676 a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences 
5677 it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time 
5678 both grant and hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others 
5679 i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further 
5680 wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message 
5681 the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming 
5682 flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up 
5683 mr. wollter and ms. seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear 
5684 a moving story of determination and the human spirit 
5685 mostly martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it 's a pleasurable trifle 
5686 to the degree that ivans xtc 
5687 there is greatness here 
5688 lovely and amazing is holofcener 's deep , uncompromising curtsy to women she knows , and very likely is 
5689 i liked this film a lot ... 
5690 demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking 
5691 although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks 
5692 but they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail 
5693 a screenplay more ingeniously constructed than `` memento '' 
5694 those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters ' foibles a timeless and unique perspective 
5695 on that score , the film certainly does n't disappoint 
5696 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread 
5697 the movie 's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish 
5698 it asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up 
5699 you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , ` this is going to be something really good 
5700 ' 
5701 a negligible british comedy 
5702 great fun both for sports aficionados and for ordinary louts whose idea of exercise is climbing the steps of a stadium-seat megaplex 
5703 beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling ... recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly 
5704 , is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly 
5705 there has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently ... but peter mattei 's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive -lrb- if tragic -rrb- note 
5706 children and adults enamored of all things pokemon wo n't be disappointed 
5707 you 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie 
5708 the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl 
5709 how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of -lrb- françois and michèle 's -rrb- relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them 
5710 it bites hard 
5711 little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable 
5712 like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling -lrb- murder by numbers -rrb- delivers a magnetic performance 
5713 despite bearing the paramount imprint , it 's a bargain-basement european pickup 
5714 by the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing 
5715 a predictable , manipulative stinker 
5716 ... post-september 11 , `` the sum of all fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves 
5717 a solid , psychological action film from hong kong 
5718 a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese 
5719 it 's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it 
5720 a bad movie that happened to good actors 
5721 plays like john le carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders 
5722 ... a rather bland affair 
5723 spielberg has managed to marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks with philosophical inquiry 
5724 by the standards of knucklehead swill , the hot chick is pretty damned funny 
5725 a thought-provoking look at how western foreign policy - however well intentioned - can wreak havoc in other cultures 
5726 despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast 
5727 as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson 's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits 
5728 it 's funny 
5729 what an embarrassment 
5730 i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art 
5731 what makes esther kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony 
5732 that old adage about women being unknowable gets an exhilarating new interpretation in morvern callar 
5733 without resorting to camp or parody , haynes -lrb- like sirk , but differently -rrb- has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange 
5734 a thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy 
5735 this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic 
5736 jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky 's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive 
5737 it just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on -lrb- or be entertained by -rrb- 
5738 although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching 
5739 sweet home alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of -lrb- witherspoon 's -rrb- better films 
5740 the film is all over the place , really 
5741 has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release 
5742 ... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels 
5743 do n't even bother to rent this on video 
5744 if only merchant paid more attention the story 
5745 it 's a glorious spectacle like those d.w. griffith made in the early days of silent film 
5746 the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh 's rise up the social ladder 
5747 it is not what you see , it is what you think you see 
5748 -lrb- a -rrb- painfully flat gross-out comedy ... 
5749 richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings 
5750 shunji iwai 's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan 
5751 it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them 
5752 maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again 
5753 hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels 
5754 at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab 
5755 franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic 
5756 even though the film does n't manage to hit all of its marks , it 's still entertaining to watch the target practice 
5757 fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for 
5758 this is not an easy film 
5759 a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged 
5760 ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour 
5761 some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck 
5762 it challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should 
5763 while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears ... should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio 
5764 the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld -lrb- who is also one of the film 's producers -rrb- do everything he can to look like a good guy 
5765 in its chicken heart , crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises 
5766 a heady , biting , be-bop ride through nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he 'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego 
5767 squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare 
5768 it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness 
5769 skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults 
5770 as satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago ... has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency 
5771 elvira fans could hardly ask for more 
5772 its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare 
5773 a coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clichés and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood 
5774 at times , it actually hurts to watch 
5775 made me unintentionally famous -- as the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby 
5776 -lrb- taymor -rrb- utilizes the idea of making kahlo 's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work 
5777 at the end of the movie , my 6-year-old nephew said , `` i guess i come from a broken family , and my uncles are all aliens , too 
5778 '' 
5779 one of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace 
5780 forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five 
5781 i like it 
5782 philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess 
5783 while the humor is recognizably plympton , he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time 
5784 highly irritating at first , mr. koury 's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results 
5785 although some viewers will not be able to stomach so much tongue-in-cheek weirdness , those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime 
5786 a well-crafted letdown 
5787 duvall is strong as always 
5788 toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick 
5789 terrific performances , great to look at , and funny 
5790 very well-written and very well-acted 
5791 nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you 
5792 there 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery 
5793 -- was a fad that had long since vanished 
5794 girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy 
5795 adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design 
5796 muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious 
5797 morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating 
5798 carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master 
5799 ' 
5800 nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one 
5801 this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone 
5802 it remains to be seen whether statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre , but then again , who says he has to ? 
5803 while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise 
5804 and that makes all the difference 
5805 robert harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film 's thick shadows 
5806 ... a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920 's ... the film 's ending has a `` what was it all for ? '' 
5807 it 's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again 
5808 slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth 
5809 forgettable , if good-hearted , movie 
5810 a riveting story well told 
5811 for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence 
5812 worse than ` silence of the lambs ' better than ` hannibal ' 
5813 a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is 
5814 this version moves beyond the original 's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema 's inability to stand in for true , lived experience 
5815 this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it 
5816 at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer 
5817 mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service 
5818 at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot 
5819 the big-screen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison 
5820 the fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that broomfield 's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer 
5821 the script ? 
5822 nicole holofcener 's lovely and amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women 's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style 
5823 likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes 
5824 borrows a bit from the classics `` wait until dark '' and `` extremities '' ... but in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself 
5825 a pleasant piece of escapist entertainment 
5826 sweet and memorable film 
5827 this is a movie you can trust 
5828 whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black 
5829 impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation ... just about as chilling and unsettling as ` manhunter ' was 
5830 these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers 
5831 there are a couple of things that elevate `` glory '' above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall 
5832 it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band 
5833 daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails 
5834 many a parent and their teen -lrb- or preteen -rrb- kid could bond while watching a walk to remember 
5835 the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking ... because you get it 
5836 though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable 
5837 grown-up quibbles are beside the point here 
5838 evelyn 's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn 
5839 ... bibbidy-bobbidi-bland 
5840 one thing 's for sure -- if george romero had directed this movie , it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head 
5841 and he allows a gawky actor like spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range 
5842 epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star 
5843 it 's rare to find a film to which the adjective ` gentle ' applies , but the word perfectly describes pauline & paulette 
5844 ` blue crush ' swims away with the sleeper movie of the summer award 
5845 needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance 
5846 it lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho 
5847 but the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure 
5848 so fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated 
5849 the real question this movie poses is not ` who ? ' 
5850 despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances 
5851 a film of ideas and wry comic mayhem 
5852 in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more 
5853 effective in all its aspects , margarita happy hour represents an auspicious feature debut for chaiken 
5854 goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab 
5855 it 's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes 
5856 quietly engaging 
5857 what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman 's tragic odyssey 
5858 gambling and throwing a basketball game for money is n't a new plot -- in fact toback himself used it in black and white 
5859 not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? 
5860 a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum 
5861 what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points 
5862 the dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen 
5863 has none of the crackle of `` fatal attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 weeks '' , or even `` indecent proposal '' , and feels more like lyne 's stolid remake of `` lolita '' 
5864 a sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china 
5865 fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film 
5866 as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising 
5867 there 's much tongue in cheek in the film and there 's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all 
5868 ... `` bowling for columbine '' remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film ... 
5869 it 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense 
5870 phoned-in business as usual 
5871 the only thing to fear about `` fear dot com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film 
5872 blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew 
5873 to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore 
5874 there is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care 
5875 in -lrb- screenwriter -rrb- charlie kaufman 's world , truth and fiction are equally strange , and his for the taking 
5876 bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable 
5877 dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy 
5878 the film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it 's in danger of going wrong 
5879 with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it 's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness 
5880 it 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition 
5881 an unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage 
5882 a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply 
5883 a funny film 
5884 a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise 
5885 a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone 's crazy french grandfather 
5886 it 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling 
5887 an entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie 
5888 a generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith 
5889 ` you 'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied 
5890 eight legged freaks ? 
5891 malcolm mcdowell is cool 
5892 the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial 
5893 as a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , sex with strangers is a success 
5894 a reality-snubbing hodgepodge 
5895 -lrb- a -rrb- slummer 
5896 the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet 
5897 it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding 
5898 the impulses that produced this project ... are commendable , but the results are uneven 
5899 it 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled 
5900 an engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character 
5901 sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors 
5902 for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression 
5903 this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller 
5904 at the end , when the now computerized yoda finally reveals his martial artistry , the film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside 
5905 ferrara 's strongest and most touching movie of recent years 
5906 ... a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone 
5907 even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness 
5908 unfortunately , it 's also not very good 
5909 the most wondrous love story in years , it is a great film 
5910 too much power , not enough puff 
5911 despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy 
5912 finally , the french-produced `` read my lips '' is a movie that understands characters must come first 
5913 even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it 's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon 
5914 a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised 
5915 the rare movie that 's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it 's based 
5916 a brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it 
5917 here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha 
5918 -lrb- dong -rrb- makes a valiant effort to understand everyone 's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up 
5919 recoing 's fantastic performance does n't exactly reveal what makes vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat 
5920 not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by the piano teacher 
5921 once she lets her love depraved leads meet , -lrb- denis ' -rrb- story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle 
5922 nothing too deep or substantial 
5923 but what is missing from it all is a moral 
5924 splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity 
5925 obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque 
5926 it 's definitely a step in the right direction 
5927 vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much 
5928 the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul 's perspective 
5929 this one is a few bits funnier than malle 's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks 
5930 the writing is clever and the cast is appealing 
5931 although commentary on nachtwey is provided ... it 's the image that really tells the tale 
5932 a nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent 
5933 ... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept 
5934 some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat 
5935 but the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes 
5936 earnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese 
5937 jeffrey tambor 's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy 
5938 an overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort 
5939 a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film ... 
5940 ` christian bale 's quinn -lrb- is -rrb- a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent 
5941 ' 
5942 i 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about 
5943 somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates 
5944 it 's a scorcher 
5945 a real snooze 
5946 like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end 
5947 the kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books 
5948 partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless 
5949 for its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen 
5950 a chronicle not only of one man 's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign 's end , an extended publicity department 
5951 a movie that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' like whether compromise is the death of self ... this orgasm -lrb- wo n't be an -rrb- exceedingly memorable one for most people 
5952 a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it 
5953 fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense 
5954 this is not one of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live 
5955 but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted 
5956 at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future 
5957 lookin ' for sin , american-style ? 
5958 it drowns in sap 
5959 laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany 
5960 interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring 
5961 believability was n't one of the film 's virtues 
5962 filled with alexandre desplat 's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience 
5963 the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox 
5964 the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing 
5965 steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic 
5966 ... del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy 
5967 this filmed tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it 's filmed tosca that you want 
5968 features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film 
5969 a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship 
5970 starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar 
5971 comedy troupe broken lizard 's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot 
5972 though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal 
5973 director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the `` miami vice '' checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks 
5974 swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then 
5975 although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey 
5976 even fans of ismail merchant 's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one 
5977 the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there 's very little hustling on view 
5978 what 's worse is that pelosi knows it 
5979 a `` home alone '' film that is staged like `` rosemary 's baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films 
5980 although made on a shoestring and unevenly acted , conjures a lynch-like vision of the rotting underbelly of middle america 
5981 some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie 
5982 everything about girls ca n't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way 
5983 brian tufano 's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky 's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special 
5984 it is definitely worth seeing 
5985 a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers ' hearts 
5986 will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 
5987 a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it 
5988 allen 's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal 
5989 everybody loves a david and goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from david 's point of view 
5990 both lead performances are oscar-size 
5991 as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner 
5992 it 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid 
5993 all the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition 
5994 elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side 
5995 this new time machine is hardly perfect ... yet it proves surprisingly serviceable 
5996 the film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation 
5997 i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays 
5998 too daft by half ... but supremely good natured 
5999 though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor 's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio 
6000 the film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor 
6001 the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 
6002 ... silly humbuggery ... 
6003 nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that 's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life 
6004 predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king 
6005 worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees 
6006 it zips along with b-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special 
6007 ... too sappy for its own good 
6008 this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines 
6009 no , i do n't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money 
6010 if s&m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it 's to this film 's -lrb- and its makers ' -rrb- credit that we believe that that 's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves 
6011 little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick 
6012 one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time 
6013 the kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati 
6014 a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre 
6015 for a film that 's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama is n't as funny as you 'd hoped 
6016 there 's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american 
6017 richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold 
6018 a movie of riveting power and sadness 
6019 robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show 
6020 the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities 
6021 witless but watchable 
6022 just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over 
6023 written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there 's something about mary co-writer ed decter 
6024 it 's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt 
6025 one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman 's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002 's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off 
6026 seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil 
6027 not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid 
6028 a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire 
6029 it 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate 
6030 wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it is n't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited 
6031 k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia 
6032 a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script 
6033 god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness 
6034 it 's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good 
6035 the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt 's , no matter if it 's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale 
6036 if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick 
6037 watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing 
6038 mark wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry 
6039 a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration 
6040 moonlight mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things 
6041 it 's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca n't possibly be enough 
6042 the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once 
6043 like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again 
6044 the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class 
6045 nicely combines the enigmatic features of ` memento ' with the hallucinatory drug culture of ` requiem for a dream 
6046 ' 
6047 last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that 's true 
6048 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours 
6049 -lrb- a -rrb- stale retread of the '53 original 
6050 more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh 's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem 
6051 alarms for duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks 
6052 there 's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt 's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance 
6053 the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye 
6054 zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted 
6055 to better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and i wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough 
6056 is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience 
6057 at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill 
6058 a ragbag of cliches 
6059 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue 
6060 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it 's no glance 
6061 steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches 
6062 niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators ' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press 
6063 it 's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it 's also pretty funny 
6064 the milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch 
6065 the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment 
6066 whatever complaints i might have , i 'd take -lrb- its -rrb- earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor 's club any time 
6067 rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them 
6068 though not for everyone , the guys is a somber trip worth taking 
6069 another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez 
6070 but here 's a movie about it anyway 
6071 if -lrb- jaglom 's -rrb- latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing 
6072 i did n't smile 
6073 the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul ... he elevates the experience to a more mythic level 
6074 kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -lrb- or worth rooting against , for that matter -rrb- 
6075 it 's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you do n't try to look too deep into the story 
6076 see it now , before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles 
6077 befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject 
6078 nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises 
6079 it 's horribly depressing and not very well done 
6080 veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures 
6081 now as a former gong show addict , i 'll admit it , my only complaint is that we did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show 
6082 ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family 
6083 enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers 
6084 i prefer soderbergh 's concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky 's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies 
6085 this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy 
6086 a pale xerox of other , better crime movies 
6087 strange it is , but delightfully so 
6088 the story has little wit and no surprises 
6089 crummy 
6090 just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller 
6091 this is a very funny , heartwarming film 
6092 ` rare birds ' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience 
6093 good-naturedly cornball sequel 
6094 the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons 
6095 the french director has turned out nearly 21\/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing 
6096 it 's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after 
6097 feardotcom 's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work 
6098 a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes 
6099 a small movie with a big impact 
6100 the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset 
6101 crammed with incident , and bristles with passion and energy 
6102 an intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them 
6103 -lrb- gosling 's -rrb- combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character 
6104 and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen 
6105 though it inspires some -lrb- out-of-field -rrb- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract 
6106 in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled 
6107 reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby 
6108 marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula 
6109 there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
6110 a movie that 's held captive by mediocrity 
6111 screenwriter chris ver weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability 
6112 an admirable , sometimes exceptional film 
6113 this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography 
6114 a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish 
6115 has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness 
6116 not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , but the film works well enough to make it worth watching 
6117 a strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet 
6118 matthew lillard is born to play shaggy ! 
6119 a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment 
6120 there 's lots of cool stuff packed into espn 's ultimate x. 
6121 the mothman prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey 
6122 at its best , it 's black hawk down with more heart 
6123 `` home movie '' is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book 
6124 invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion 
6125 a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre 
6126 patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary 
6127 a frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you think it 's a tougher picture than it is 
6128 a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony 
6129 rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid ... 
6130 arnie blows things up 
6131 if you 're really renting this you 're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you 're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid 
6132 a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into 
6133 should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor 
6134 -lrb- barry -rrb- gives assassin a disquieting authority 
6135 its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more 
6136 a moving and important film 
6137 these people are really going to love the piano teacher 
6138 a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip 
6139 a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers 
6140 yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy 
6141 `` cremaster 3 '' should come with the warning `` for serious film buffs only ! '' 
6142 this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow 
6143 what 's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors 
6144 surprisingly insightful 
6145 to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer 's ` divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that 's not saying much 
6146 the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone 
6147 earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner 
6148 brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke 's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt 
6149 a glorious mess 
6150 unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart 
6151 arguably the best script that besson has written in years 
6152 it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it 
6153 pretend it 's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away 
6154 you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy 's holes , and the scripters do n't deserve any oscars 
6155 truly terrible 
6156 it 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter 
6157 you just know something terrible is going to happen 
6158 each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top 
6159 fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references 
6160 a special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento ... 
6161 do n't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle 
6162 one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time 
6163 a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't 
6164 too ordinary to restore -lrb- harmon -rrb- to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience 
6165 highly watchable stuff 
6166 exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere 
6167 there 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to 
6168 content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance 
6169 a charming but slight comedy 
6170 you know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ? 
6171 everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented 
6172 an unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture 
6173 a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears ' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor 
6174 it looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such 
6175 takes one character we do n't like and another we do n't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and is n't very funny 
6176 but mostly it 's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived 
6177 as an introduction to the man 's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it 's invaluable 
6178 young hanks and fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work 
6179 excellent performances from jacqueline bisset and martha plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama 
6180 the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back 
6181 its generic villains lack any intrigue -lrb- other than their funny accents -rrb- and the action scenes are poorly delivered 
6182 while bollywood\/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those -lrb- like me -rrb- who are n't 
6183 has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents 
6184 in a big corner office in hell , satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his r&d people , and has decided he will just screen the master of disguise 24\/7 
6185 captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world 
6186 in a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting 
6187 ... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick 
6188 deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i.q. than when i had entered 
6189 a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody 
6190 well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin 
6191 an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen 
6192 it is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style 
6193 just how these families interact may surprise you 
6194 a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films 
6195 a muted freak-out 
6196 lead actress gaï , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , is a towering siren 
6197 absolutely not 
6198 by turns gripping , amusing , tender and heart-wrenching , laissez-passer has all the earmarks of french cinema at its best 
6199 the cat 's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich ... 
6200 ... jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just is n't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts 
6201 generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it 's not without style 
6202 fans of so-bad-they 're - good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess 
6203 vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , metropolis is a feast for the eyes 
6204 brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie 
6205 ` stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall 's intense freight train of a film 
6206 ' 
6207 at its best , which occurs often , michael moore 's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the ` are we a sick society ? ' 
6208 in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like `` girl in bar # 3 
6209 '' 
6210 hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it does n't 
6211 barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull 
6212 an indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh 
6213 at 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth 
6214 the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness 
6215 dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit 
6216 it 's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied 
6217 sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group 
6218 brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every clichéd white-trash situation imaginable 
6219 the irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own 
6220 this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party 
6221 i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent 's complaint 
6222 a dreary movie 
6223 a thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you can not separate them 
6224 cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience 
6225 you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet 
6226 the premise itself is just sooooo tired 
6227 like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it 's never too late to learn 
6228 the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down 
6229 there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening 
6230 an engrossing and grim portrait of hookers : what they think of themselves and their clients 
6231 like mike is a harmlessly naïve slice of b-ball fantasy , fit for filling in during the real nba 's off-season 
6232 a lovely and beautifully photographed romance 
6233 in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is 
6234 ... while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey does n't really go anywhere 
6235 the film 's messages of tolerance and diversity are n't particularly original , but one ca n't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters 
6236 aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand 
6237 i had more fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies 
6238 a simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm 
6239 no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing 
6240 it 's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i 'd say the film works 
6241 aniston has at last decisively broken with her friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil 
6242 ... blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves 
6243 every joke is repeated at least four times 
6244 a smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist 
6245 if you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then triple x marks the spot 
6246 otherwise , maybe 
6247 stanley kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made , but one of the best love stories of any stripe 
6248 just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years 
6249 please see previous answer 
6250 in the director 's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes 
6251 `` not really as bad as you might think ! '' 
6252 samuel l. jackson is one of the best actors there is 
6253 it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity 
6254 a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of ` home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households 
6255 the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone 
6256 has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere 
6257 an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie 
6258 this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces 
6259 waiting for godard can be fruitful : ` in praise of love ' is the director 's epitaph for himself 
6260 it 's all about anakin ... and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect 
6261 solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining 
6262 so here it is : it 's about a family of sour immortals 
6263 ... pitiful , slapdash disaster 
6264 the crap continues 
6265 while the story 's undeniably hard to follow , iwai 's gorgeous visuals seduce 
6266 it 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch 
6267 this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy 
6268 a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics 
6269 a terrific b movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory 
6270 unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making 
6271 i liked about schmidt a lot , but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed 
6272 what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film 
6273 you may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes wo n't still be tapping 
6274 nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release 
6275 as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary 
6276 aside from rohmer 's bold choices regarding point of view , the lady and the duke represents the filmmaker 's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art 
6277 a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists 
6278 this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
6279 there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us 
6280 the graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real 
6281 the ingenious construction -lrb- adapted by david hare from michael cunningham 's novel -rrb- constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism 
6282 or both 
6283 the most horrific movie experience i 've had since `` ca n't stop the music 
6284 '' 
6285 but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming 
6286 whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste 
6287 weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk 
6288 it 's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing 
6289 a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'em powerment 
6290 ' 
6291 quite simply , a joy to watch and -- especially -- to listen to 
6292 not to mention absolutely refreshed 
6293 you can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored ... audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter 
6294 both the crime story and the love story are unusual 
6295 arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation 
6296 there 's no reason to miss interview with the assassin 
6297 sayles is making a statement about the inability of dreams and aspirations to carry forward into the next generation 
6298 i like this movie a lot 
6299 comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire 
6300 this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder 
6301 close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air 
6302 a dreary indulgence 
6303 teens only 
6304 while the transgressive trappings -lrb- especially the frank sex scenes -rrb- ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative 
6305 blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` pretty woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought 
6306 the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock 
6307 a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan 
6308 the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen -- and a hollywood-ized austen at that 
6309 -lrb- a -rrb- strong piece of work 
6310 daring and beautifully made 
6311 there has to be a few advantages to never growing old 
6312 a well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity 
6313 with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it 's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective 
6314 ... hits every cliche we 've come to expect , including the assumption that `` crazy '' people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny 
6315 slight but enjoyable documentary 
6316 adam sandler 's eight crazy nights grows on you -- like a rash 
6317 when compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , davis ' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic 
6318 nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try 
6319 not even solondz 's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it 
6320 and in a sense , that 's a liability 
6321 the romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be 
6322 hugh grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in about a boy 
6323 poignant and funny 
6324 this is pure , exciting moviemaking 
6325 never having seen the first two films in the series , i ca n't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days 
6326 the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity 
6327 a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality 
6328 the film 's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled 
6329 there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away 
6330 a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord 
6331 one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then 
6332 an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts 
6333 there 's an energy to y tu mamá también 
6334 the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau 
6335 the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years 
6336 ' 
6337 not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie 
6338 miyazaki is one of world cinema 's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers 
6339 the paradiso 's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film 's final -lrb- restored -rrb- third ... emotionally belittle a cinema classic 
6340 if you 're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with jason x. 
6341 all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that do n't really care for the candidate they 're forced to follow 
6342 in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds 
6343 some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff 
6344 ryan gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel 
6345 i do n't think so 
6346 at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd 
6347 a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles 
6348 poetry in motion captured on film 
6349 the fourth in a series that i 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped ! 
6350 parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic 
6351 the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish 
6352 but here 's a glimpse at his life 
6353 almost peerlessly unsettling 
6354 despite auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug 
6355 -lrb- ferrera -rrb- has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen 
6356 a solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude 
6357 flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old jack nicholson could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he 's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary 
6358 while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter 
6359 the hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty 
6360 daughter from danang reveals that efforts toward closure only open new wounds 
6361 if not a home run , then at least a solid base hit 
6362 it 's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it 's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance 
6363 what it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart 
6364 carrying off a spot-on scottish burr , duvall -lrb- also a producer -rrb- peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper 
6365 there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit 
6366 a well-acted , but one-note film 
6367 suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled 
6368 the picture 's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed 
6369 walter hill 's undisputed is like a 1940s warner bros. 
6370 parents beware ; this is downright movie penance 
6371 whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile 
6372 it did n't go straight to video 
6373 fred schepisi 's tale of four englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point 
6374 there 's no energy 
6375 the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy 
6376 starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner 
6377 kosminsky ... puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting 
6378 a well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars 
6379 seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as happiness was ... hence , storytelling is far more appealing 
6380 it 's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of sarah and harrison 
6381 alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience 
6382 true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at 
6383 at its best when the guarded , resentful betty and the manipulative yet needy margot are front and center 
6384 with exquisite craftsmanship ... olivier assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society 
6385 your response to its new sequel , analyze that , may hinge on what you thought of the first film 
6386 a hard look at one man 's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol 
6387 the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul 
6388 grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length 
6389 feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class 
6390 definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable 
6391 it 's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate 
6392 as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine 
6393 as we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- jason is a killer who does n't know the meaning of the word ` quit 
6394 ' 
6395 extremely bad 
6396 a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale 
6397 although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual 
6398 deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history 
6399 a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy 
6400 what 's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour 
6401 any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy 's sledgehammer sap 
6402 it 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay 
6403 cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most 
6404 it made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters 
6405 argento , at only 26 , brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she 's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock 
6406 as refreshing as a drink from a woodland stream 
6407 ... a sweetly affecting story about four sisters who are coping , in one way or another , with life 's endgame 
6408 beautifully directed and convincingly acted 
6409 it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual 
6410 ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous 
6411 the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself 
6412 the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids 
6413 depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles 
6414 despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off 
6415 purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging 
6416 any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things 
6417 an undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band 
6418 halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles 
6419 the magic -lrb- and original running time -rrb- of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki 's spirited away survives intact in bv 's re-voiced version 
6420 michael moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he 's got as potent a topic as ever here 
6421 frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he 's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him 
6422 predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle 
6423 sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction 
6424 such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show 
6425 a modest masterpiece 
6426 neil burger here succeeded in ... making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present 
6427 and thanks to kline 's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable 
6428 it 's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul 
6429 shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience 
6430 seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight 
6431 takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze 
6432 but it does n't leave you with much 
6433 the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them 
6434 broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary 
6435 as the mediterranean sparkles , ` swept away ' sinks 
6436 two-bit potboiler 
6437 a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature 
6438 mushes the college-friends genre -lrb- the big chill -rrb- together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas 
6439 an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension 
6440 a smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : it gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic 
6441 at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance 
6442 it 's just rather leaden and dull 
6443 problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on 
6444 the movie is a mess from start to finish 
6445 its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch 
6446 one of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever 
6447 but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass 
6448 a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at 
6449 the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago 
6450 the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers 
6451 scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company 
6452 i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither 
6453 a beautifully observed character piece 
6454 compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen , runteldat is something of a triumph 
6455 as plain and pedestrian as catsup -- 
6456 some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options 
6457 that jack nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend 
6458 with each of her three protagonists , miller eloquently captures the moment when a woman 's life , out of a deep-seated , emotional need , is about to turn onto a different path 
6459 if borstal boy is n't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece 
6460 a college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing ! 
6461 a loquacious and dreary piece of business 
6462 behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance 
6463 a rather tired exercise in nostalgia 
6464 ` linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project ... ' 
6465 there 's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity 
6466 certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic 
6467 one lousy movie 
6468 it 's such a mechanical endeavor -lrb- that -rrb- it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it 
6469 a blair witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast 
6470 until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity 
6471 abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed 
6472 needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism 
6473 watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd 's film offers little else of consequence 
6474 with the prospect of films like kangaroo jack about to burst across america 's winter movie screens it 's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative 
6475 where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable 
6476 a highly watchable , giggly little story with a sweet edge to it 
6477 skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise 
6478 -lrb- soderbergh -rrb- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness 
6479 writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured 
6480 the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea 
6481 falls short in explaining the music and its roots 
6482 each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time 
6483 a fascinating but choppy documentary 
6484 sweetly sexy , funny and touching 
6485 like all of egoyan 's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious 
6486 even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken 
6487 the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what 's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture 
6488 this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable 
6489 it 's a cool event for the whole family 
6490 time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life 
6491 yep , it 's `` waking up in reno 
6492 '' 
6493 a beautiful , entertaining two hours 
6494 though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful 
6495 too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community 
6496 another love story in 2002 's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre 
6497 it 's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon 
6498 the chateau belongs to rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms ... is a nonstop hoot 
6499 the story ... is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is 
6500 love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly was n't feeling any of it 
6501 this director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera 
6502 `` the dangerous lives of altar boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors 
6503 when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ? 
6504 i admit it , i hate to like it 
6505 movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation 
6506 an amusing and unexpectedly insightful examination of sexual jealousy , resentment and the fine line between passion and pretence 
6507 producer john penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them 
6508 '' 
6509 it 's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it 
6510 what redeems the film is the cast , particularly the ya-yas themselves 
6511 but what 's nice is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script 
6512 adam sandler 's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures ' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie 
6513 a mess 
6514 the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him 
6515 so purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it 's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride 
6516 talk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it 's hard to stop watching 
6517 a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives 
6518 it 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny 
6519 after seeing ` analyze that , ' i feel better already 
6520 mazel tov to a film about a family 's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage 
6521 the characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach 
6522 reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies 
6523 visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying 
6524 though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog 's works , invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film 
6525 the simplicity of the way home has few equals this side of aesop 
6526 monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds 
6527 it shows us a slice of life that 's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable 
6528 a fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to betty fisher and left out the other stories 
6529 interesting both as a historical study and as a tragic love story 
6530 feels untidily honest 
6531 what we have here is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down 
6532 there 's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening 
6533 there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling 
6534 though it 's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans ' saga of hollywood excess 
6535 one of the worst films of 2002 
6536 the film 's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling 
6537 lazy , miserable and smug 
6538 -lrb- t -rrb- he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent 
6539 often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part 
6540 i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story 
6541 an animation landmark as monumental as disney 's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs 
6542 this thing is just garbage 
6543 `` the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store '' 
6544 still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences 
6545 a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv 's big brother 
6546 `` juwanna mann ? '' 
6547 like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it 
6548 what 's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm 
6549 it 's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties 
6550 the extent to which it succeeds is impressive 
6551 proves a servicable world war ii drama that ca n't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored 
6552 ` tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation 
6553 ' 
6554 a fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with kissinger 
6555 never inspires more than an interested detachment 
6556 ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies 
6557 a sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , really is n't 
6558 this is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its freud and knows its sade 
6559 instead of trying to bust some blondes , -lrb- diggs -rrb- should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad 
6560 a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations 
6561 delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information 
6562 meyjes 's movie , like max rothman 's future , does not work 
6563 a weird , arresting little ride 
6564 but i had a lot of problems with this movie 
6565 a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness 
6566 it 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast 
6567 the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them 
6568 nakata 's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects 
6569 but it does n't need gangs of new york 
6570 the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate 
6571 there 's a part of us that can not help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something 
6572 but mr. polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr. spielberg 's 1993 classic 
6573 the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times 
6574 never does `` lilo & stitch '' reach the emotion or timelessness of disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` mulan '' or `` tarzan 
6575 '' 
6576 a wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival 
6577 the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker 
6578 a venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director 's understanding of the expressive power of the camera 
6579 that it 'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture 
6580 it 's still adam sandler , and it 's not little nicky 
6581 your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but 
6582 my own minority report is that it stinks 
6583 cage makes an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera 
6584 brosnan is more feral in this film than i 've seen him before and halle berry does her best to keep up with him 
6585 ben kingsley is truly funny , playing a kind of ghandi gone bad 
6586 frankly , it 's pretty stupid 
6587 ozpetek 's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie 
6588 too clever by about nine-tenths 
6589 you should pay nine bucks for this : because you can hear about suffering afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected 
6590 the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen 
6591 horns and halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth 
6592 a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale 
6593 an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see 
6594 watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures 
6595 there 's no good answer to that one 
6596 -lrb- while the last metro -rrb- was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history 
6597 cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in 
6598 if you think it 's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman 's clothes , then you 'll enjoy the hot chick 
6599 with the same sort of good-natured fun found in films like tremors , eight legged freaks is prime escapist fare 
6600 a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points 
6601 a non-mystery mystery 
6602 there 's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing 
6603 there 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie 
6604 together , miller , kuras and the actresses make personal velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey 
6605 i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was 
6606 the film sometimes flags ... but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace 
6607 fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds 
6608 often overwrought and at times positively irritating , the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself 
6609 instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos 
6610 feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form 
6611 it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film 
6612 gangster no. 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults 
6613 why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
6614 no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place 
6615 -lrb- rises -rrb- above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism 
6616 newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman 
6617 this is the first film i 've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved 
6618 captures that perverse element of the kafkaesque where identity , overnight , is robbed and replaced with a persecuted `` other 
6619 '' 
6620 never once predictable 
6621 the film does n't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia 
6622 offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory 
6623 the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l.a. to that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either 
6624 i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways 
6625 the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... -lrb- it -rrb- comes off like a hallmark commercial 
6626 -lrb- allen 's -rrb- been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now 
6627 cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility 
6628 the structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings 
6629 o.k. , not really 
6630 a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks 
6631 nice piece of work 
6632 -lrb- kirshner wins , but it 's close 
6633 -rrb- 
6634 a road trip that will get you thinking , ` are we there yet ? ' 
6635 the events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next 
6636 the ring is worth a look , if you do n't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment 
6637 who knew ... 
6638 episode ii -- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight 
6639 this is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem 
6640 though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish 
6641 noyce 's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us 
6642 the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers 
6643 what emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice 
6644 the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry 
6645 cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts 
6646 jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he 's easy to like and always leaves us laughing 
6647 -lrb- gayton 's script -rrb- telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience 
6648 i know i should n't have laughed , but hey , those farts got to my inner nine-year-old 
6649 ... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity 
6650 there is a general air of exuberance in all about the benjamins that 's hard to resist 
6651 plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on `` the simpsons '' has 
6652 a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence 
6653 a drama ? 
6654 dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation 
6655 this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed 
6656 the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves 
6657 streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , `` big trouble '' is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter 
6658 as it stands , there 's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more 
6659 delightfully rendered 
6660 shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that 's something i would rather live in denial about 
6661 many insightful moments 
6662 it is a movie about passion 
6663 made to be jaglomized is the cannes film festival , the annual riviera spree of flesh , buzz , blab and money 
6664 the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief 
6665 anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly 
6666 director claude chabrol has become the master of innuendo 
6667 as comedic spotlights go , notorious c.h.o. hits all the verbal marks it should 
6668 -lrb- tries -rrb- to parody a genre that 's already a joke in the united states 
6669 they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn 
6670 especially give credit to affleck 
6671 a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming 
6672 and it marks him as one of the most interesting writer\/directors working today 
6673 this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc 's , despite a few whopping shootouts 
6674 though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché 
6675 according to wendigo , ` nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves 
6676 even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture 
6677 it is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters 
6678 a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups 
6679 a vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition 
6680 but as you watch the movie , you 're too interested to care 
6681 a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke 
6682 the funny thing is , i did n't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit 
6683 thumbs down 
6684 while the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times , it 's awfully entertaining to watch 
6685 at a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture 
6686 adam sandler ! 
6687 upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute 
6688 as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done 
6689 an uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k. dick stories 
6690 -lrb- shyamalan -rrb- turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count 
6691 totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time 
6692 there 's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles 
6693 woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending 
6694 either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks 
6695 lightweight but appealing 
6696 there is nothing redeeming about this movie 
6697 what 's infuriating about full frontal is that it 's too close to real life to make sense 
6698 touché ! 
6699 the movie 's seams may show ... but pellington gives `` mothman '' an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling 
6700 macdowell ... gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she 's ever done 
6701 director paul cox 's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing nijinsky 's diaries is both stimulating and demanding 
6702 the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins 
6703 the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans ' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality 
6704 the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny 
6705 lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s 
6706 a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending 
6707 `` ... something appears to have been lost in the translation this time 
6708 featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock 
6709 hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry 
6710 everything about the quiet american is good , except its timing 
6711 it 's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas 
6712 the bourne identity should n't be half as entertaining as it is , but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood 
6713 once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional 
6714 a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community 
6715 the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him 
6716 an artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art 
6717 an unflinching look at the world 's dispossessed 
6718 unless you 're a fanatic , the best advice is : ` scooby ' do n't 
6719 nicole kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while 
6720 and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him 
6721 the culmination of everyone 's efforts is given life when a selection appears in its final form -lrb- in `` last dance '' -rrb- 
6722 there 's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance 
6723 the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks 
6724 go back to sleep 
6725 this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 
6726 the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious 
6727 it 's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` got aids yet ? '' 
6728 secret ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving 
6729 a visionary marvel , but it 's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this 
6730 nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy 
6731 one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made 
6732 this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time 
6733 happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and does n't pummel us with phony imagery or music 
6734 fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix 
6735 whatever one makes of its political edge , this is beautiful filmmaking from one of french cinema 's master craftsmen 
6736 jagger , stoppard and director michael apted ... deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride 
6737 banal and predictable 
6738 takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker 
6739 ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna 
6740 the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls 
6741 what eric schaeffer has accomplished with never again may not , strictly speaking , qualify as revolutionary 
6742 best of all is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man 
6743 it does n't flinch from its unsettling prognosis , namely , that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain 
6744 scooby-doo does n't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick 
6745 a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff 
6746 unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs 
6747 `` the best disney movie since the lion king '' 
6748 merry friggin ' christmas ! 
6749 best indie of the year , so far 
6750 feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series 
6751 it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier 
6752 simone is not a bad film 
6753 harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate 
6754 triumph of love is a very silly movie , but the silliness has a pedigree 
6755 a sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in renaissance spain , and the fact that it 's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling 
6756 as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , -lrb- franco -rrb- has all of dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability 
6757 open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile 's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations 
6758 the first bond movie in ages that is n't fake fun 
6759 the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull 
6760 for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer 's two hours amounts to little more than punishment 
6761 the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey 
6762 ramsay and morton fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling 
6763 has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together 
6764 the film is saved from are n't - kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that is n't faked and a stately sense of composition 
6765 death to smoochy is often very funny , but what 's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito 's misanthropic vision 
6766 this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous 
6767 you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal 
6768 the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants ... who might be distracted by the movie 's quick movements and sounds 
6769 there 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups 
6770 it collapses when mr. taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush 
6771 it 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy 
6772 ' 
6773 opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half 
6774 it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time 
6775 efficient , suitably anonymous chiller 
6776 ... stylistically , the movie is a disaster 
6777 it 's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity 
6778 ... a guiltless film for nice evening out 
6779 what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that 's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion 
6780 an opportunity missed 
6781 its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film 
6782 canada 's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people 
6783 fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it 
6784 dignified ceo 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree 
6785 helps to remind the first world that hiv\/aids is far from being yesterday 's news 
6786 some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema 
6787 a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man ... about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy 
6788 the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors 
6789 the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull 
6790 beneath the film 's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve 
6791 the film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in 
6792 perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` serving sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff 
6793 the film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting 
6794 the sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack 
6795 puts a refreshing and comical spin on the all-too-familiar saga of the contemporary single woman 
6796 ending 
6797 there are some laughs in this movie , but williams ' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak 
6798 boisterous , heartfelt comedy 
6799 it 's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself 
6800 the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience 
6801 i 'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent 
6802 very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both 
6803 if festival in cannes nails hard - boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing 
6804 coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world 's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching 
6805 but it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one 
6806 i wanted more 
6807 the entire cast is extraordinarily good 
6808 as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story , the more details slip out between his fingers 
6809 a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale 
6810 it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective 
6811 a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats 
6812 it 's immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it 's trying to do 
6813 director-writer bille august ... depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey martin 's deterioration and barbara 's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger 
6814 lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless 
6815 ... a pretentious mess ... 
6816 the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there 
6817 feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in nine queens 
6818 too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could 've been an impacting film 
6819 it sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that 
6820 terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable 
6821 a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities 
6822 captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics 
6823 if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it -- the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you 're one of the lucky few who sought it out 
6824 writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags 
6825 this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it 's the worst movie i 've seen this summer 
6826 in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of ... outrageous gags 
6827 singer\/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs -- a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story -- but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece 
6828 does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago 
6829 this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time 
6830 the movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell 
6831 if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash 
6832 boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun 
6833 the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake 
6834 it 's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill 
6835 weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he does n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car 
6836 once folks started hanging out at the barbershop , they never wanted to leave 
6837 choppy , overlong documentary about ` the lifestyle 
6838 ' 
6839 better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift 
6840 the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory 
6841 ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would 
6842 though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful 
6843 the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact 
6844 low rent from frame one 
6845 sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony 
6846 there 's very little sense to what 's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash 
6847 unfortunately , carvey 's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg 
6848 it may as well be called `` jar-jar binks : the movie 
6849 '' 
6850 over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor 
6851 what one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream 
6852 it hates its characters 
6853 ... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar 
6854 with `` ichi the killer '' , takashi miike , japan 's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than batman ... 
6855 anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity 
6856 comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man 
6857 we do n't even like their characters 
6858 just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole 
6859 the characters never change 
6860 even kids deserve better 
6861 while scorsese 's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that `` gangs '' is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that 's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about 
6862 once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window 
6863 this is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on jerry springer 
6864 into how long is this movie ? 
6865 the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims 
6866 think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world 's most generic rock star 
6867 you 'll probably love it 
6868 and for all the wrong reasons besides 
6869 reminiscent of alfred hitchcock 's thrillers , most of the scary parts in ` signs ' occur while waiting for things to happen 
6870 in his debut as a director , washington has a sure hand 
6871 if you love him , you 'll like it 
6872 what 's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director 's talent 
6873 i like that smith , he 's not making fun of these people , he 's not laughing at them 
6874 the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor 
6875 the movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality 
6876 so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened 
6877 victor rosa is leguizamo 's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance 
6878 the strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film 
6879 psychologically savvy 
6880 a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world 's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making 
6881 a chilling movie without oppressive gore 
6882 we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low 
6883 star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy 
6884 several of steven soderbergh 's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist 
6885 the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold 
6886 the most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal 
6887 a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one 's actions 
6888 the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving 
6889 directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut 
6890 true hollywood story 
6891 bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies 
6892 because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags 
6893 viewers of barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it 
6894 they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering 
6895 as it turns out , you can go home again 
6896 it 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones 
6897 his work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories 
6898 the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything 
6899 writer \/ director m. night shyamalan 's ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity is undeniable 
6900 fontaine 's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal 
6901 while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river 's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby 's main overall flaw 
6902 with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland 's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion 
6903 what bubbles up out of john c. walsh 's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch 
6904 abysmally pathetic 
6905 instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized 
6906 the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year 's -lrb- unintentionally -rrb- funniest moments , that it 's impossible to care 
6907 blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances 
6908 it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense 
6909 an exhilarating experience 
6910 a dazzling dream of a documentary 
6911 narc is a no-bull throwback to 1970s action films 
6912 jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart 
6913 mandel holland 's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning 
6914 in the disturbingly involving family dysfunctional drama how i killed my father , french director anne fontaine delivers an inspired portrait of male-ridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition 
6915 animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots 
6916 but rather , ` how can you charge money for this ? ' 
6917 `` austin powers in goldmember '' has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end 
6918 exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair 
6919 not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at 
6920 an erotic thriller that 's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either 
6921 while puerile men dominate the story , the women shine 
6922 family portrait of need , neurosis and nervy negativity is a rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking 
6923 a case in point : doug pray 's scratch 
6924 the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them 
6925 it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie 's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy 
6926 as any creature-feature fan knows , when you cross toxic chemicals with a bunch of exotic creatures , you get a lot of running around , screaming and death 
6927 demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack 
6928 i 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r. nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen 
6929 it 's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems 
6930 like the best 60 minutes exposé , the film -lrb- at 80 minutes -rrb- is actually quite entertaining 
6931 the lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired 
6932 medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt 
6933 is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
6934 art-house to the core , read my lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old french cinema 
6935 madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose 
6936 so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming 
6937 there 's a lot of good material here , but there 's also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful crudeness accompanying it 
6938 ... the story , like ravel 's bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with 
6939 it has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect 
6940 there 's something about a marching band that gets me where i live 
6941 the film favors the scientific over the spectacular -lrb- visually speaking -rrb- 
6942 it should have stayed there 
6943 it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material 
6944 alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick 
6945 well , it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises , but it 's definitely worth taking a look 
6946 bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love 
6947 ` enigma ' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of ` we were soldiers 
6948 ' 
6949 what a pity ... that the material is so second-rate 
6950 it 's that good 
6951 calculated swill 
6952 a mischievous visual style and oodles of charm make ` cherish ' a very good -lrb- but not great -rrb- movie 
6953 enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker 's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons 
6954 a truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation 
6955 directors brett morgen and nanette burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia 
6956 ... a confusing drudgery 
6957 it 's a testament to the film 's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries 
6958 -lrb- a -rrb- mess 
6959 believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic , and it is too cute by half 
6960 i 'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute 
6961 plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv 's dawson 's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story 
6962 black-and-white and unrealistic 
6963 -lrb- lin chung 's -rrb- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -lrb- at least to this western ear -rrb- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters 
6964 it 's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter 
6965 hardly an objective documentary , but it 's great cinematic polemic ... love moore or loathe him , you 've got to admire ... the intensity with which he 's willing to express his convictions 
6966 the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects 
6967 a lovely film ... elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic ... hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source 's complexity 
6968 a summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution 
6969 taken as a whole , the tuxedo does n't add up to a whole lot 
6970 good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork 
6971 intimate and panoramic 
6972 high crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them , and maybe that is nobility of a sort 
6973 suffers from all the excesses of the genre 
6974 hate it because it 's lousy 
6975 this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor 
6976 big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level 
6977 a doa dud from frame one 
6978 it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie 
6979 elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke 
6980 this is n't a terrible film by any means , but it 's also far from being a realized work 
6981 why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
6982 just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name 
6983 `` home movie '' is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time 
6984 it 's enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins 
6985 the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it 
6986 robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that clancy creates 
6987 ... a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional 
6988 intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being 
6989 like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating 
6990 where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment 
6991 throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh 
6992 a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special 
6993 debate it 
6994 i did n't laugh 
6995 holm does his sly , intricate magic , and iben hjelje is entirely appealing as pumpkin 
6996 one of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but ... also one of the most curiously depressing 
6997 grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors 
6998 bielinsky is a filmmaker of impressive talent 
6999 such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go 
7000 the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card 
7001 the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense 
7002 uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth 
7003 even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series 
7004 boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing 
7005 did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 armenia ? 
7006 the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it 
7007 this is the first full scale wwii flick from hong kong 's john woo 
7008 you do n't know whether to admire the film 's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace 
7009 the author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling 
7010 the tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story 's morals 
7011 less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving , which is powerful in itself 
7012 it 's quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer 
7013 often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it 's very much like life itself 
7014 in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel 's closely watched trains and danis tanovic 's no man 's land 
7015 sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman ca n't save it 
7016 this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september 
7017 talk to her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it 's still quite worth seeing 
7018 it 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness 
7019 shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting 
7020 observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom 
7021 in fact , even better 
7022 feels familiar and tired 
7023 the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value 
7024 but it 's worth the concentration 
7025 a complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son 's home after decades away 
7026 the film 's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls ' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that 's opened between them 
7027 humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath 's version of ` nicholas nickleby ' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful 
7028 the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film 
7029 what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america ... sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight 
7030 one thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company 's previous video work 
7031 is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief 
7032 brosnan 's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes 
7033 an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor 
7034 the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema 
7035 catch it ... if you can ! 
7036 to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor 
7037 it 's not too much of anything 
7038 one of the most highly-praised disappointments i 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time 
7039 everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had 
7040 the bard as black comedy -- willie would have loved it 
7041 clever but not especially compelling 
7042 memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual 
7043 this is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party 
7044 the performances are remarkable 
7045 as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain 
7046 not a strike against yang 's similarly themed yi yi , but i found what time ? 
7047 everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel 
7048 both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes 
7049 this is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood 
7050 -lrb- p -rrb- artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting 
7051 i have a confession to make : i did n't particularly like e.t. the first time i saw it as a young boy 
7052 a captivating new film 
7053 it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing 
7054 you 'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama 
7055 this is just lazy writing 
7056 a movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of cho 's fans 
7057 while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie 's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he 's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle 
7058 got a david lynch jones ? 
7059 this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers 
7060 coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else 
7061 is one of this year 's very best pictures 
7062 the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work 
7063 the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting 
7064 red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than silence 
7065 defies logic , the laws of physics and almost anyone 's willingness to believe in it 
7066 a compelling french psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart 
7067 ong 's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent chinese immigrant 's experiences in new york city 
7068 satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time 
7069 trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the `` gadzooks ! '' 
7070 wo n't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time 
7071 because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin 
7072 more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are ... an amusing little catch 
7073 i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound 
7074 a graceful , moving tribute to the courage of new york 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice 
7075 and it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it 
7076 contrived as this may sound , mr. rose 's updating works surprisingly well 
7077 mr. deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor 
7078 just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite 
7079 it 's always enthralling 
7080 one big blustery movie where nothing really happens 
7081 one of those rare films that seems as though it was written for no one , but somehow manages to convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen , just for them 
7082 diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful 
7083 one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking 
7084 is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it 's a love story as sanguine as its title 
7085 but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie 
7086 a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy 
7087 watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard 
7088 a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special 
7089 an inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds 
7090 can be viewed as pure composition and form -- film as music 
7091 this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie 
7092 the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail 
7093 a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack 
7094 smarter than its commercials make it seem 
7095 a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994 's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility 
7096 sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes 
7097 could have been crisper and punchier , but it 's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies 
7098 a french film with a more down-home flavor 
7099 when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger 's sex life , it already has one strike against it 
7100 an asian neo-realist treasure 
7101 generic thriller junk 
7102 an honest , sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view 
7103 while some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work 
7104 more than their unique residences , home movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it 
7105 apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does n't figure in the present hollywood program 
7106 thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances , the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods 
7107 a typically observant , carefully nuanced and intimate french coming-of-age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it 
7108 a compelling allegory about the last days of germany 's democratic weimar republic 
7109 or maybe `` how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? '' 
7110 it falls far short of poetry , but it 's not bad prose 
7111 the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo n't fly with most intelligent viewers 
7112 worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades 
7113 sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first -lrb- as best i remember -rrb- , but still a very good time at the cinema 
7114 by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest can not be revived 
7115 an 83 minute document of a project which started in a muddle , seesawed back and forth between controlling interests multiple times , then found its sweet spot 
7116 a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr. chicken 
7117 a beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions 
7118 scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept 
7119 despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book 
7120 i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon 
7121 chaiken ably balances real-time rhythms with propulsive incident 
7122 the movie is about as deep as that sentiment 
7123 the real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , jean reno , who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep 
7124 brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism 
7125 if you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it 's informative and breathtakingly spectacular 
7126 even the digressions are funny 
7127 and , thanks to the presence of ` the king , ' it also rocks 
7128 in other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year 
7129 visually fascinating ... an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty 
7130 as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you 've ever seen 
7131 we 've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there 's an enthusiastic charm in fire that makes the formula fresh again 
7132 gets better after foster leaves that little room 
7133 ... would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie 's edges 
7134 compulsively watchable , no matter how degraded things get 
7135 -lrb- evans is -rrb- a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie 
7136 the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution 
7137 show me the mugging 
7138 this is more a case of ` sacre bleu ! ' 
7139 this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -lrb- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -rrb- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` why ? ' 
7140 ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with 
7141 manages to be wholesome and subversive at the same time 
7142 feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake 
7143 a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady 's direction is prosaic 
7144 the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption 
7145 finally coming down off of miramax 's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie 
7146 a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily 
7147 a tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with 
7148 hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast 
7149 like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive 
7150 is n't as sharp as the original ... despite some visual virtues , ` blade ii ' just does n't cut it 
7151 enigma lacks it 
7152 now i can see why people thought i was too hard on `` the mothman prophecies '' 
7153 mr. caine and mr. fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances 
7154 too bad none of it is funny 
7155 overcomes its visual hideousness with a sharp script and strong performances 
7156 there 's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one 
7157 yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it 's so fascinating you wo n't be able to look away for a second 
7158 a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques 
7159 this film puts wang at the forefront of china 's sixth generation of film makers 
7160 a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one 's mother 
7161 like the full monty , this is sure to raise audience 's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll 
7162 i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that 
7163 -lrb- n -rrb- o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness 
7164 not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days 
7165 after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work 
7166 texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare 
7167 obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -lrb- including mine -rrb- on something very inconsequential 
7168 blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she 's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time 
7169 should have gone straight to video 
7170 maryam is more timely now than ever 
7171 koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own 
7172 it deserves to be seen everywhere 
7173 a timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices 
7174 the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment 
7175 you do n't need to know your ice-t 's from your cool-j 's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california 
7176 by turns very dark and very funny 
7177 completely awful iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque 
7178 suspend your disbelief here and now , or you 'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits 
7179 nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy 
7180 uneven but a lot of fun 
7181 the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying 
7182 the biggest problem i have -lrb- other than the very sluggish pace -rrb- is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing 
7183 ... it 's as comprehensible as any dummies guide , something even non-techies can enjoy 
7184 a zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious 
7185 -lrb- moore 's -rrb- better at fingering problems than finding solutions 
7186 ... fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist 's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film 
7187 is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? 
7188 there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels 
7189 -lrb- green is -rrb- the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i 'm just about ready to go to the u.n. and ask permission for a preemptive strike 
7190 a difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present 
7191 once again , director chris columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours 
7192 some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares 
7193 brave and sweetly rendered love story 
7194 for decades we 've marveled at disney 's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world 
7195 the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we 've long associated with washington the actor 
7196 curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary 
7197 while tattoo borrows heavily from both seven and the silence of the lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in 
7198 although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , tuck everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action 
7199 long before it 's over , you 'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser 
7200 the film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public 
7201 a thought-provoking and often-funny drama about isolation 
7202 bittersweet comedy\/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys 
7203 it 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors 
7204 the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial 
7205 this is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies 
7206 remarkable for its intelligence and intensity 
7207 a complete waste of time 
7208 should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike 
7209 an intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives 
7210 you never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it 's a heck of a ride 
7211 resident evil is n't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail 
7212 that works 
7213 what 's most memorable about circuit is that it 's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb 
7214 the journey is worth your time , especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride 
7215 a classy , sprightly spin on film 
7216 frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women 
7217 in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry 
7218 watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy 
7219 nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining 
7220 it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors 
7221 so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film 
7222 one of the finest , most humane and important holocaust movies ever made 
7223 would n't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? 
7224 this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful 
7225 if villainous vampires are your cup of blood , blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest 
7226 but this is lohman 's film 
7227 if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh 
7228 a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable 
7229 the script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off 
7230 personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire 
7231 refreshing 
7232 a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men 
7233 by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them 
7234 the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter 
7235 ... a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs 
7236 director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking 
7237 while the film is competent , it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires 
7238 the locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand 
7239 releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them 
7240 alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie ... tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life 
7241 director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates 
7242 shankman ... and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story 
7243 cinematic poo 
7244 she 's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations 
7245 i ca n't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents ... 
7246 buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr. chips off the old block 
7247 in an art film ! 
7248 the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time 
7249 presents a side of contemporary chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists , and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation 
7250 after watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history 
7251 promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents ' anguish 
7252 so-so entertainment 
7253 it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth 
7254 robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favour of an altogether darker side 
7255 throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love 's brief moment 
7256 the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance 
7257 the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged 
7258 tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme does n't drag an audience down 
7259 a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants 
7260 playfully profound ... and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows 
7261 the story itself is actually quite vapid 
7262 this orange has some juice , but it 's far from fresh-squeezed 
7263 he does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash 
7264 no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story 
7265 the film has several strong performances 
7266 nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro 's right-hand goombah 
7267 the wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate 
7268 too predictably , in fact 
7269 the emperor 's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but ... 
7270 what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine 's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching 
7271 apart from its own considerable achievement , metropolis confirms tezuka 's status as both the primary visual influence on the animé tradition and its defining philosophical conscience 
7272 it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness 
7273 japanese director shohei imamura 's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime 
7274 only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it 's looking for 
7275 one of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms. spears 
7276 jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter 's glory days on three 's company 
7277 not too fancy , not too filling , not too fluffy , but definitely tasty and sweet 
7278 a true pleasure 
7279 lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck 
7280 if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign 
7281 a movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling 
7282 no big hairy deal 
7283 i loved this film 
7284 if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey 
7285 could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film ? 
7286 for the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera 
7287 it 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert 
7288 probably the best case for christianity since chesterton and lewis 
7289 gives us a lot to chew on , but not all of it has been properly digested 
7290 i suspect that you 'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it 
7291 this ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it 
7292 this is one of mr. chabrol 's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny 
7293 despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair ... 
7294 sparse but oddly compelling 
7295 despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings 
7296 in a strange way , egoyan has done too much 
7297 it 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today 
7298 the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical 
7299 -lrb- the film 's -rrb- taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers 
7300 as a remake , it 's a pale imitation 
7301 lan yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery 
7302 -lrb- washington 's -rrb- strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene 
7303 only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley 's flopping dolphin-gasm 
7304 i 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't 
7305 this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it 's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men 
7306 i was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon 
7307 entertaining enough , but nothing new 
7308 arty gay film 
7309 pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance 
7310 changing lanes tries for more 
7311 the only time 8 crazy nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers 
7312 the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances 
7313 sean penn , you owe nicolas cage an apology 
7314 the film exudes the urbane sweetness that woody allen seems to have bitterly forsaken 
7315 ludicrous , but director carl franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining 
7316 for his first attempt at film noir , spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future 
7317 a lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family 
7318 certainly the performances are worthwhile 
7319 fifty years after the fact , the world 's political situation seems little different , and -lrb- director phillip -rrb- noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill 
7320 i do n't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it 's a dish that 's best served cold 
7321 the acting in pauline and paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer 's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons 
7322 spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing 
7323 a weird and wonderful comedy 
7324 smart and taut 
7325 a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine 
7326 c'mon ! 
7327 this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years 
7328 will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts ... 
7329 in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide 
7330 a searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise 
7331 every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible 
7332 the film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end 
7333 an extraordinary dramatic experience 
7334 piccoli 's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent 
7335 no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population 
7336 it 's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm 's shelf 
7337 drowning 's too good for this sucker 
7338 rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? 
7339 the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros. giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie 's release 
7340 if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it 
7341 as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west 
7342 everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized 
7343 a bittersweet film , simple in form but rich with human events 
7344 a classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached 
7345 directed with purpose and finesse by england 's roger mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as notting hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft 
7346 it 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise 
7347 cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer 
7348 would benigni 's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ? 
7349 this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life 
7350 each punch seen through prison bars , the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs. man as brother-man vs. the man 
7351 there 's an admirable rigor to jimmy 's relentless anger , and to the script 's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there 's no place for this story to go but down 
7352 i 'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper 
7353 it 's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud 
7354 chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly 
7355 the story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one 
7356 they just do n't work in concert 
7357 a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire 
7358 it 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up 
7359 an unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode 
7360 both damning and damned compelling 
7361 it 's not original enough 
7362 apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen 
7363 the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada 
7364 a meditation on faith and madness , frailty is blood-curdling stuff 
7365 he 's one of the few ` cool ' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness 
7366 this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material 
7367 a serious movie with serious ideas 
7368 attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident 
7369 plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king 
7370 stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , labute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection 
7371 it 's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming 
7372 leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama 
7373 beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm 
7374 campbell scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson 
7375 it 's like a `` big chill '' reunion of the baader-meinhof gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists 
7376 then you 'd do well to check this one out because it 's straight up twin peaks action ... 
7377 aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there 's little to be learned from watching ` comedian ' 
7378 mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt 
7379 that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks 
7380 land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored 
7381 did the film inform and educate me ? 
7382 barney 's ideas about creation and identity do n't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material 
7383 cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film 's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein 's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark 's dogma movement 
7384 bottom-rung new jack city wannabe 
7385 despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as i thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie 
7386 but this time , the old mib label stands for milder is n't better 
7387 forget the misleading title , what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
7388 it 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long 
7389 what 's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be 
7390 yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit 
7391 every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here 
7392 the film 's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature\/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality 
7393 a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro 's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original 
7394 yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other 's existence 
7395 with notorious c.h.o. cho proves she has the stuff to stand tall with pryor , carlin and murphy 
7396 watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens ' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child 's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power 
7397 e.t. works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet 
7398 so unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is 
7399 yes , it 's as good as you remember 
7400 for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus 
7401 there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners ca n't overcome , but it 's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling 
7402 as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair 
7403 full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing 
7404 little more than a well-mounted history lesson 
7405 wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach 
7406 peter jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want 
7407 this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same 
7408 a joyous occasion 
7409 -lrb- `` take care of my cat '' -rrb- is an honestly nice little film that takes us on an examination of young adult life in urban south korea through the hearts and minds of the five principals 
7410 a bonanza of wacky sight gags , outlandish color schemes , and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract frank tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist 's career 
7411 novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama 
7412 one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece 
7413 trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein 's brain 
7414 a thoroughly engaging , surprisingly touching british comedy 
7415 you have no affinity for most of the characters 
7416 its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary 
7417 sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do 
7418 whether or not you buy mr. broomfield 's findings , the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale mr. broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover 
7419 a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick 
7420 charlotte sometimes is a brilliant movie 
7421 move over bond ; this girl deserves a sequel 
7422 an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg 's the prince of egypt from 1998 
7423 for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises 
7424 ' 
7425 congrats disney on a job well done , i enjoyed it just as much ! 
7426 a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations 
7427 is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ? 
7428 it 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety 
7429 the movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh 
7430 in between all the emotional seesawing , it 's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived 
7431 expect no major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle , but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women 
7432 an exit sign , that is 
7433 beautifully crafted and brutally honest , promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people 
7434 entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately ... dare i say , entertaining ! 
7435 just dreadful 
7436 bill morrison 's decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful 
7437 a superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing 
7438 the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap 
7439 yet another genre exercise , gangster no. 1 is as generic as its title 
7440 before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway 
7441 a well-acted movie that simply does n't gel 
7442 ... while dark water is n't a complete wash -lrb- no pun intended -rrb- , watched side-by-side with ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor 
7443 plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel 
7444 the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted 
7445 one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism 
7446 the script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off 
7447 the filmmakers might want to look it up 
7448 despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing 
7449 is a mess 
7450 adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some 
7451 ... quite endearing 
7452 a mess , but it 's a sincere mess 
7453 hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity 
7454 i found myself liking the film , though in this case one man 's treasure could prove to be another man 's garbage 
7455 a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches 
7456 a little better than sorcerer 's stone 
7457 nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil 
7458 almost as offensive as `` freddy got fingered 
7459 '' 
7460 imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern 
7461 cockettes has the glorious , gaudy benefit of much stock footage of those days , featuring all manner of drag queen , bearded lady and lactating hippie 
7462 there 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity 
7463 narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself 
7464 a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect 
7465 renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance 
7466 renner ? 
7467 brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation 
7468 the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality 
7469 the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once 
7470 wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time 
7471 steven soderbergh does n't remake andrei tarkovsky 's solaris so much as distill it 
7472 although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love 
7473 a compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one 
7474 if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $ 8 and get ready for the big shear 
7475 tale will be all too familiar for anyone who 's seen george roy hill 's 1973 film , `` the sting 
7476 '' 
7477 secretary is not a movie about fetishism 
7478 warm and exotic 
7479 the movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster 
7480 rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results 
7481 like a grinning jack o ' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded 
7482 the story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there 's a certain style and wit to the dialogue 
7483 a dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you 're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater provides 
7484 it 's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama 
7485 here 's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix 
7486 one of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society 
7487 done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment 
7488 troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal 
7489 unfortunately , kapur modernizes a.e.w. mason 's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks `` the four feathers '' bare 
7490 uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof 
7491 the phone rings and a voice tells you you 've got seven days left to live 
7492 deserving of its critical backlash and more 
7493 entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were 
7494 when the twist endings were actually surprising ? 
7495 do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ? 
7496 more mature than fatal attraction , more complete than indecent proposal and more relevant than 9 1\/2 weeks , unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema 
7497 the wonder of mostly martha is the performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing 
7498 a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee 
7499 like a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing 
7500 it 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? 
7501 this movie is to be cherished 
7502 in all fairness , i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks 
7503 the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children 
7504 entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel 
7505 ryan gosling ... is at 22 a powerful young actor 
7506 -lrb- garbus -rrb- discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation 
7507 i am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson 
7508 while this movie , by necessity , lacks fellowship 's heart , two towers outdoes its spectacle 
7509 for those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s , the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed 
7510 an absorbing and unsettling psychological drama 
7511 skillful as he is , mr. shyamalan is undone by his pretensions 
7512 like the best of godard 's movies ... it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable 
7513 with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters ' striving solipsism 
7514 spare but quietly effective retelling 
7515 the story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy 
7516 this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors 
7517 it 's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to 
7518 a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie 
7519 chomp chomp ! 
7520 harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research 
7521 all the queen 's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers 
7522 fessenden 's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy 
7523 the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you 'll find in this dreary mess 
7524 a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy 
7525 a must see for all sides of the political spectrum 
7526 the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome 
7527 skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd 
7528 viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture 
7529 ... unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted 
7530 forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining 
7531 an action\/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat 
7532 beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures 
7533 the best part about `` gangs '' was daniel day-lewis 
7534 ... hypnotically dull 
7535 we ca n't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie 
7536 but then again , i hate myself most mornings 
7537 a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother\/daughter relationship 
7538 although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out 
7539 if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere 
7540 it can be safely recommended as a video\/dvd babysitter 
7541 the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end 
7542 part of the film 's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz 
7543 a fun family movie that 's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh , cry and realize , ` it 's never too late to believe in your dreams 
7544 ' 
7545 unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile 
7546 there is something that is so meditative and lyrical about babak payami 's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot ... a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics 
7547 it winds up moving in many directions as it searches -lrb- vainly , i think -rrb- for something fresh to say 
7548 it 's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese 
7549 fulfills the minimum requirement of disney animation 
7550 with or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller 
7551 rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative 
7552 but it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that does n't make you feel like a sucker 
7553 the acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff 
7554 romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here 
7555 -lrb- a -rrb- rather thinly-conceived movie 
7556 good , solid storytelling 
7557 it 's a treat watching shaw , a british stage icon , melting under the heat of phocion 's attentions 
7558 the film does n't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half 
7559 a smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie 
7560 um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
7561 -lrb- has -rrb- an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it 's all true 
7562 a deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed 
7563 bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal 
7564 a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving 
7565 to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago ... 
7566 this is not a retread of `` dead poets ' society 
7567 '' 
7568 an intriguing near-miss 
7569 the film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed 
7570 the kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself 
7571 craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters 
7572 rosenthal -lrb- halloween ii -rrb- seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense 
7573 but it 's defiantly and delightfully against the grain 
7574 famuyiwa 's feature deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the cliché-riddled genre can offer 
7575 ` matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy 
7576 -lrb- toback 's -rrb- fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard ... blends uneasily with the titillating material 
7577 at a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had , godfrey reggio 's career shines like a lonely beacon 
7578 the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -lrb- teen comedy -rrb- genre a bad name 
7579 elegant and eloquent -lrb- meditation -rrb- on death and that most elusive of passions , love 
7580 you bet there is and it 's what makes this rather convoluted journey worth taking 
7581 weird 
7582 -lrb- clooney 's -rrb- debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh 
7583 pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess 
7584 it was a dark and stormy night ... 
7585 the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack 
7586 nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me -lrb- horrors ! -rrb- 
7587 romanek 's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals 
7588 no worse a film than breaking out , and breaking out was utterly charming 
7589 an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility 
7590 scooby doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation 
7591 a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring 
7592 ... an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit 
7593 will anyone who is n't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it has n't gone straight to video ? 
7594 your children will be occupied for 72 minutes 
7595 exciting and well-paced 
7596 in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie 
7597 wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste 
7598 lasker 's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as byron and luther ... realize they ca n't get no satisfaction without the latter 
7599 `` feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker 
7600 essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality 
7601 like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider 
7602 the amazing film work is so convincing that by movies ' end you 'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others 
7603 it must be in the genes 
7604 only for young children , if them 
7605 femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience 
7606 combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that 's not merely about kicking undead \*\*\* , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption 
7607 just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny 
7608 while hoffman 's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere 
7609 the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds 
7610 filled with honest performances and exceptional detail , baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity 
7611 rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style -- casting excellent latin actors of all ages -- a trend long overdue 
7612 takashi miike keeps pushing the envelope : ichi the killer 
7613 more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat 
7614 fairly run-of-the-mill 
7615 so could young romantics out on a date 
7616 despite its flaws ... belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn 
7617 the secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again 
7618 the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy 
7619 though it 's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal , the film shatters you in waves 
7620 satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it 's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman 's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity 
7621 due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter 
7622 it 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence 
7623 shamelessly resorting to pee-related sight gags that might even cause tom green a grimace ; still , myer 's energy and the silliness of it all eventually prevail 
7624 a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture 
7625 noyce has worked wonders with the material 
7626 a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama 
7627 no thanks 
7628 despite the predictable parent vs. child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at `` the real americans '' make this a charmer 
7629 delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year 
7630 best described as i know what you did last winter 
7631 action - mechanical 
7632 another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures 
7633 this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes 
7634 it 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit 
7635 while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation 
7636 although olivier assayas ' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation ... its three-hour running time plays closer to two 
7637 the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen 's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive 
7638 dense and enigmatic ... elusive ... stagy and stilted 
7639 the moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended 
7640 a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions 
7641 overall , it 's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love 
7642 some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs. sever , were made for the palm screen 
7643 `` on guard ! '' 
7644 a minor work yet there 's no denying the potency of miller 's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure 
7645 a confident , richly acted , emotionally devastating piece of work and 2002 's first great film 
7646 labute 's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering 
7647 the whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product 
7648 an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength 
7649 ... a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations 
7650 routine and rather silly 
7651 denver should not get the first and last look at one of the most triumphant performances of vanessa redgrave 's career 
7652 as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet 's airless cinematic shell games 
7653 the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments 
7654 the story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution 
7655 a different kind of love story - one that is dark , disturbing , painful to watch , yet compelling 
7656 the action clichés just pile up 
7657 not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest 
7658 a delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life tosses at them 
7659 if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it 
7660 you may be captivated , as i was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why paul thomas anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which adam sandler will probably ever appear 
7661 `` brown sugar '' admirably aspires to be more than another `` best man '' clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film 
7662 highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it 's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role 
7663 far away 
7664 the kind of trifle that date nights were invented for 
7665 all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as ` belgium 's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline 
7666 gently humorous and touching 
7667 puportedly `` based on true events , '' a convolution of language that suggests it 's impossible to claim that it is `` based on a true story '' with a straight face 
7668 vulgar is too optimistic a title 
7669 `` the adventures of pluto nash '' is a big time stinker 
7670 visually captivating 
7671 as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity 
7672 she 's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but does n't reveal an inner life 
7673 writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call ` too clever by half 
7674 ' 
7675 for the future , one hopes mr. plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter 
7676 the story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic 
7677 very predictable but still entertaining 
7678 if you 're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts 
7679 has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a `` 2 '' at the end of its title 
7680 mr. deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy 
7681 it all seemed wasted like deniro 's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk 
7682 its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart 
7683 armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud 
7684 gloriously straight from the vagina 
7685 ... works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once 
7686 a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted 
7687 a small gem from belgium 
7688 courtney chases stuart with a cell phone 
7689 the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life 
7690 worth a look as a curiosity 
7691 it is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival 
7692 if you 've got a house full of tots -- do n't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then 
7693 eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good 
7694 short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight ... tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations 
7695 poignant and delicately complex 
7696 and we do n't avert our eyes for a moment 
7697 simply and eloquently articulates the tangled feelings of particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy 
7698 plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up 
7699 ... could easily be called the best korean film of 2002 
7700 the title , alone , should scare any sane person away 
7701 for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them 
7702 it does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes 
7703 the plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours 
7704 this english-language version ... does full honor to miyazaki 's teeming and often unsettling landscape , and to the conflicted complexity of his characters 
7705 whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable 
7706 the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what 's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all ca n't stand 
7707 the ending feels at odds with the rest of the film 
7708 in the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest 
7709 the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks 
7710 it 's a quirky , off-beat project 
7711 if you can get past the taboo subject matter , it will be well worth your time 
7712 coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes 
7713 starts slowly , but adrien brody -- in the title role -- helps make the film 's conclusion powerful and satisfying 
7714 feeble comedy 
7715 no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie 's lack of ideas 
7716 simply does n't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time 
7717 ... the good and different idea -lrb- of middle-aged romance -rrb- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` never again 
7718 '' 
7719 parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story 's core 
7720 would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility 
7721 sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago 
7722 the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles 
7723 the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
7724 wise and deadpan humorous 
7725 twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him 
7726 boring and meandering 
7727 while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari 's film falls short in building the drama of lilia 's journey 
7728 make chan 's action sequences boring 
7729 simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn 
7730 proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness 
7731 but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless 
7732 an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching -lrb- or turntablism -rrb- in particular 
7733 screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite 
7734 but if you 've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there 's guilty fun to be had here 
7735 -lrb- ramsay -rrb- visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor 
7736 works as pretty contagious fun 
7737 in the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way 
7738 a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires 
7739 ... liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario 
7740 if there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one 
7741 ... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , scoob and shag do n't eat enough during the film 
7742 ' 
7743 the sheer dumbness of the plot -lrb- other than its one good idea -rrb- and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down 
7744 those who do n't entirely ` get ' godard 's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy 
7745 provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust 
7746 ... there is enough originality in ` life ' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens 
7747 raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings 
7748 if you saw benigni 's pinocchio at a public park , you 'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police 
7749 it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously 
7750 an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment 
7751 it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it 
7752 i do n't think this movie loves women at all 
7753 american musical comedy as we know it would n't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun 's - sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway 
7754 do n't judge this one too soon - it 's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going 
7755 ... -lrb- the film -rrb- works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay 
7756 features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory 
7757 too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot 
7758 it 's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades 
7759 the director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff 
7760 or for the year , for that matter 
7761 an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker 's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent 
7762 ... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch 
7763 thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film 
7764 what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks -lrb- at least during their '70s heyday -rrb- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature 
7765 paul bettany playing malcolm mcdowell ? 
7766 that 's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying 
7767 it would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of oscar wilde 's classic satire 
7768 jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set 
7769 everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting 
7770 another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it 
7771 one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing 
7772 where their heads were is anyone 's guess 
7773 scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf 
7774 the music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and italy beckons us all 
7775 one of the best silly horror movies of recent memory , with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers 
7776 the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women 
7777 ` hey arnold ! ' 
7778 beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself 
7779 griffin & co. manage to be spectacularly outrageous 
7780 it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this 
7781 a well-put-together piece of urban satire 
7782 too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel 
7783 pan nalin 's exposition is beautiful and mysterious , and the interviews that follow , with the practitioners of this ancient indian practice , are as subtle and as enigmatic 
7784 given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube 
7785 with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie 
7786 an entertaining british hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance 
7787 but ... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically - distanced us from the characters 
7788 the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases 
7789 dense and thoughtful and brimming with ideas that are too complex to be rapidly absorbed 
7790 queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame 
7791 a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series 
7792 a cartoon ? 
7793 if a few good men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth 
7794 '' 
7795 a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics 
7796 the problem with `` xxx '' is that its own action is n't very effective 
7797 ` yes , that 's right : it 's forrest gump , angel of death 
7798 ' 
7799 with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story does n't have a single surprise up its sleeve 
7800 it 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another 
7801 ... while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare 's macbeth does n't sustain a high enough level of invention 
7802 a sterling film - a cross between boys do n't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made 
7803 no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through 
7804 australian actor\/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation 
7805 twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record 
7806 at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge 
7807 the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles 
7808 insufferably naive 
7809 these are textbook lives of quiet desperation 
7810 worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film 
7811 spend your benjamins on a matinee 
7812 it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope 
7813 the fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad 
7814 far too clever by half , howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another 
7815 serious and thoughtful 
7816 soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film 
7817 a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic 
7818 alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous 
7819 this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience 
7820 it 's unlikely we 'll see a better thriller this year 
7821 ... manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal 
7822 it 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances 
7823 a movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence 
7824 though harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities 
7825 schneidermeister ... makin ' a fool of himself ... losin ' his fan base ... 
7826 in this case zero 
7827 the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient 
7828 the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne 
7829 sexy and romantic 
7830 by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around 
7831 arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year 
7832 culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf 
7833 vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico 's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all 
7834 the concept is a hoot 
7835 it may not be particularly innovative , but the film 's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding 
7836 in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter 's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius 
7837 perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated 
7838 ... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already 
7839 the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head 
7840 even if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm 
7841 delivers more than its fair share of saucy hilarity 
7842 but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it 's about a very human one 
7843 but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old 
7844 if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo 
7845 `` punch-drunk love '' is a little like a chocolate milk moustache ... 
7846 more intimate than spectacular , e.t. is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades 
7847 i thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and the love ` real ' 
7848 amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way 
7849 wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture 
7850 the comedy makes social commentary more palatable 
7851 the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart 
7852 a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers 
7853 a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery 
7854 while howard 's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast 
7855 the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication 
7856 the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm 
7857 what 's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses -lrb- and one academy award winning actor -rrb- succumb to appearing in this junk that 's tv sitcom material at best 
7858 -lrb- jackson and bledel -rrb- seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd 
7859 except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made 
7860 whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes 
7861 piercingly affecting ... while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying 
7862 gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh 
7863 if only it had the story to match 
7864 `` frailty '' has been written so well , that even a simple `` goddammit ! '' 
7865 the pianist is the film roman polanski may have been born to make 
7866 the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we 're touched by the film 's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport 
7867 an excellent sequel 
7868 the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness 
7869 it 's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team 
7870 in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz 
7871 the story really has no place to go since simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict 
7872 both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics 
7873 all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness 
7874 a quiet , disquieting triumph 
7875 anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but ca n't afford the $ 20 million ticket to ride a russian rocket should catch this imax offering 
7876 -lrb- carvey 's -rrb- characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark 
7877 if divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances 
7878 rashomon-for-dipsticks tale 
7879 sleek and arty 
7880 a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation 
7881 the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors 
7882 there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman 's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film 
7883 it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about 
7884 it 's splash without the jokes 
7885 even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting 
7886 while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot 
7887 you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain 
7888 a coming-of-age movie that hollywood would n't have the guts to make 
7889 ` possession , ' based on the book by a.s. byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit 
7890 did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
7891 cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude 
7892 some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time 
7893 the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched 
7894 others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that ` the urge to destroy is also a creative urge ' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison 's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating 
7895 an awfully good , achingly human picture 
7896 but no. 
7897 the main problem being that it 's only a peek 
7898 slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious 
7899 it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people 
7900 i have n't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered 
7901 a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there 
7902 ... a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice 's second installment of her vampire chronicles 
7903 `` what really happened ? '' 
7904 it 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring 
7905 provides the kind of ` laugh therapy ' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending 
7906 a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp 
7907 little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic 
7908 director nancy savoca 's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could 
7909 despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film 
7910 the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia 
7911 the hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity 
7912 it 's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty 
7913 big time 
7914 ... the first 2\/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices -lrb- cool visual backmasking -rrb- , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor ... 
7915 rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash 
7916 return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , but it 's not half-bad 
7917 the movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing 
7918 much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date 
7919 a pleasing , often-funny comedy 
7920 a tour de force drama about the astonishingly pivotal role of imagination in the soulful development of two rowdy teenagers 
7921 good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there 's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat 
7922 after all , it 'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies 
7923 it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt 
7924 her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks 
7925 has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy ca n't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original 
7926 that is because - damn it ! 
7927 bad company 
7928 so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt 
7929 if you 've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart 
7930 unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic 
7931 swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell 
7932 dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery 
7933 almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like `` the addams family '' to everyone looking in ... `` my big fat greek wedding '' comes from the heart ... 
7934 an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay 
7935 despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining 
7936 otherwise , this could be a passable date film 
7937 -lrb- at least -rrb- moore is a real charmer 
7938 leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances 
7939 this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point 
7940 as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he 's neglected over the years 
7941 the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious 
7942 bang ! 
7943 by not averting his eyes , solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable 
7944 ... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry 
7945 the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart 
7946 does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez 
7947 tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world 's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances 
7948 a movie that 's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts 
7949 a movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart 
7950 elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level 
7951 it 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie 
7952 sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both 
7953 donovan ... squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences 
7954 this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people 
7955 the film is darkly atmospheric , with herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath hearst 's forced avuncular chortles 
7956 in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice 
7957 as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle 
7958 the most compelling performance of the year adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism 
7959 just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people 
7960 though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch 
7961 a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted 
7962 a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity 
7963 despite slick production values and director roger michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours 
7964 well , jason 's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels -lrb- hey , do n't shoot the messenger -rrb- 
7965 like a veteran head cutter , barbershop is tuned in to its community 
7966 brisk hack job 
7967 the grey zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of holocaust movies ... but the film suffers from its own difficulties 
7968 national lampoon 's van wilder may aim to be the next animal house , but it more closely resembles this year 's version of tomcats 
7969 well , it 's not as pathetic as the animal 
7970 thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer 
7971 performances all around are tops , with the two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances 
7972 qutting may be a flawed film , but it is nothing if not sincere 
7973 it does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject 
7974 though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous 
7975 if sinise 's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over 
7976 miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary 
7977 at the film 's centre is a precisely layered performance by an actor in his mid-seventies , michel piccoli 
7978 this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton 's ever-watchful gaze -- and it 's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one 
7979 as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut dahmer -lrb- jeremy renner -rrb- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge 
7980 as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school 
7981 if you 're not , you 'll still have a good time 
7982 '' 
7983 moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy 
7984 has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of b-movie excitement 
7985 although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense 
7986 -lrb- cuarón has -rrb- created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy 
7987 and second , what 's with all the shooting ? 
7988 billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse 
7989 shrewd but pointless 
7990 the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart 
7991 proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they ca n't go wrong 
7992 ... wise and elegiac ... 
7993 though filmed partly in canada , paid in full has clever ways of capturing inner-city life during the reagan years 
7994 well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man 's triumph of will into everyman 's romance comedy 
7995 ... creates a visceral sense of its characters ' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above ... what could have been a melodramatic , lifetime channel-style anthology 
7996 not counting a few gross-out comedies i 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes 
7997 all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper 's approach to the material is too upbeat 
7998 the overall fabric is hypnotic , and mr. mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy 
7999 friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite 
8000 there 's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it 's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted 
8001 opera on film is never satisfactory 
8002 nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer\/director responsible for this illuminating comedy does n't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully 
8003 a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps 
8004 but , like silence , it 's a movie that gets under your skin 
8005 gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable 
8006 loud , silly , stupid and pointless 
8007 while it 's nothing we have n't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it 's more than a worthwhile effort 
8008 mctiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious 
8009 if you 're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you 'll need a stronger stomach than us 
8010 an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more 
8011 a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen 
8012 the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short 
8013 only masochistic moviegoers need apply 
8014 is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
8015 like shrek , spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world 
8016 statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british 
8017 a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama 
8018 whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? 
8019 for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian 
8020 kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper 
8021 one of the greatest films i 've ever seen 
8022 feels strangely hollow at its emotional core 
8023 watching spirited away is like watching an eastern imagination explode 
8024 it gets old quickly 
8025 feels less like a change in -lrb- herzog 's -rrb- personal policy than a half-hearted fluke 
8026 it 's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it 's well worth a rental 
8027 like a poor man 's you can count on me 
8028 exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza 
8029 good performances keep it from being a total rehash 
8030 tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here 
8031 he thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject 
8032 an uplifting , largely bogus story 
8033 a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who 's the scariest of sadists 
8034 it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television 
8035 some body will take you places you have n't been , and also places you have 
8036 while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it 's far from being this generation 's animal house 
8037 hollywood ending just is n't very funny 
8038 a jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every cliché of japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage 
8039 but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them 
8040 ` drumline ' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated 
8041 upper teens may get cynical 
8042 it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied 
8043 a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds 
8044 you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie 's failings 
8045 the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne 's ' 20,000 leagues under the sea ' and the george pal version of h.g. wells ' ` the time machine 
8046 ' 
8047 i ca n't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there 's only one problem ... it 's supposed to be a drama 
8048 welles groupie\/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst 
8049 the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood 
8050 it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness 
8051 birthday girl lucks out with chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie 's darker turns 
8052 stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory 
8053 one gets the impression the creators of do n't ask do n't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes 
8054 it is a likable story , told with competence 
8055 a gushy episode of `` m \* a \* s \* h '' only this time from an asian perspective 
8056 bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it 
8057 i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just does n't have the restraint to fully realize them 
8058 the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film 's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable 
8059 some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the ball and chain 
8060 a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite 
8061 you 'll forget about it by monday , though , and if they 're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids 
8062 a good thriller 
8063 you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time 
8064 it 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one 
8065 rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic 
8066 works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making 
8067 there 's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it 
8068 while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy 
8069 the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it 
8070 the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility 
8071 it 's all pretty tame 
8072 it 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars 
8073 ... an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle 
8074 with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low 
8075 mr. koshashvili is a director to watch 
8076 about as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come 
8077 but on the whole , you 're gonna like this movie 
8078 we can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art 
8079 the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys ' direction is clever and insightful 
8080 there 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance 
8081 the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann 
8082 the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready 
8083 but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
8084 sad nonsense , this 
8085 every note rings false 
8086 the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear 
8087 succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture 
8088 plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision 
8089 an immensely entertaining look at some of the unsung heroes of 20th century pop music 
8090 the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos had n't blown them all up 
8091 howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you 'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective 
8092 eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants 
8093 it 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion 
8094 even if you do n't know the band or the album 's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st century 
8095 inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss 
8096 like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you 're over 100 
8097 it 's better than the phantom menace 
8098 an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work 
8099 broomfield is energized by volletta wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles 
8100 a fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries 
8101 davis has energy , but she does n't bother to make her heroine 's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly 
8102 the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned 
8103 this kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors 
8104 formulaic to the 51st power , more like 
8105 when your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
8106 a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 
8107 eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring 
8108 the results are far more alienating than involving 
8109 these characters become wearisome 
8110 it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice 
8111 a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance 
8112 i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again 
8113 comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible 
8114 the movie is as padded as allen 's jelly belly 
8115 the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin 
8116 this is a nervy , risky film , and villeneuve has inspired croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of bibi 
8117 an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character 
8118 more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining 
8119 although ... visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated 
8120 though in some ways similar to catherine breillat 's fat girl , rain is the far superior film 
8121 you leave feeling like you 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing 
8122 one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation 
8123 instead , it 'll only put you to sleep 
8124 the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers 
8125 a sensitive and astute first feature by anne-sophie birot 
8126 the comedy is nonexistent 
8127 a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant 
8128 ... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental 
8129 an instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick 
8130 romantic , riveting and handsomely animated 
8131 try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman 's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment 
8132 every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most - the fanboy 
8133 with not a lot of help from the screenplay -lrb- proficient , but singularly cursory -rrb- , -lrb- testud -rrb- acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis 
8134 spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations 
8135 the acting , for the most part , is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they 're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans 
8136 -lrb- less a movie than -rrb- an appalling , odoriferous thing ... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own \*\*\* in embarrassment 
8137 funny and touching 
8138 an awkward hybrid of genres that just does n't work 
8139 affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together 
8140 less worrying about covering all the drama in frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie 
8141 a fifty car pileup of cliches 
8142 will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it 
8143 one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced 
8144 a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism 
8145 this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected 
8146 the result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking 
8147 as a science fiction movie , `` minority report '' astounds 
8148 does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films 
8149 chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america 
8150 it does give you a peek 
8151 the auteur 's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug 
8152 a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade 
8153 shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral 
8154 the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment 
8155 below is well below expectations 
8156 a generic international version of a typical american horror film 
8157 includes too much obvious padding 
8158 at just over an hour , home movie will leave you wanting more , not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face 
8159 the movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness 
8160 a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film 's ability to make its subject interesting to those who are n't part of its supposed target audience 
8161 dong shows how intolerance has the power to deform families , then tear them apart 
8162 in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage 's war-weary marine 
8163 peppered with witty dialogue and inventive moments 
8164 -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw 
8165 whether or not you 're enlightened by any of derrida 's lectures on `` the other '' and `` the self , '' derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow 
8166 the people in jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we 're never sure how things will work out 
8167 parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults 
8168 a good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz 
8169 -lrb- gulpilil -rrb- is a commanding screen presence , and his character 's abundant humanism makes him the film 's moral compass 
8170 as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that 's not much to hang a soap opera on 
8171 the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him ... there is never really a true `` us '' versus `` them '' 
8172 an interesting look behind the scenes of chicago-based rock group wilco ... 
8173 interesting , but not compelling 
8174 the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure 
8175 the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie 
8176 munch 's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters 
8177 it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references 
8178 the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea 
8179 a film of epic scale with an intimate feeling , a saga of the ups and downs of friendships 
8180 the movie would seem less of a trifle if ms. sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine 
8181 mention `` solaris '' five years from now and i 'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share 
8182 that ` alabama ' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon -lrb- who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate -rrb- ... 
8183 the reason to see `` sade '' lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis -lrb- auteil -rrb- and emilie -lrb- le besco -rrb- 
8184 pacino is the best he 's been in years and keener is marvelous 
8185 a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well 
8186 as happily glib and vicious as its characters 
8187 ... has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites 
8188 much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad 
8189 overall , interesting as a documentary -- but not very imaxy 
8190 it 's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best ` old neighborhood ' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists 
8191 what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears ' first movie 
8192 busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy 
8193 imagine the cleanflicks version of ` love story , ' with ali macgraw 's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes 
8194 the movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance 
8195 extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten 
8196 bound to appeal to women looking for a howlingly trashy time 
8197 a perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film 
8198 ms. hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda 's ultimate fate 
8199 such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution 
8200 return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market 
8201 writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted 
8202 holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp 
8203 drama of temptation , salvation and good intentions is a thoughtful examination of faith , love and power 
8204 oddly compelling 
8205 feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place 
8206 a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours -lrb- and , for that matter , shrek -rrb- 
8207 alas , another breathless movie about same ! 
8208 strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre 
8209 shanghai ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life 
8210 a movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well 
8211 though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film does n't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown 's life 
8212 the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own 
8213 cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh 
8214 this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives 
8215 ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills 
8216 while maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman 's warmest 
8217 but it would be better to wait for the video 
8218 dreary tale of middle-class angst 
8219 though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation 
8220 the byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , carmen -lrb- vega -rrb- and juni -lrb- sabara -rrb- cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take 
8221 it 's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful 
8222 seen in that light , moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many 
8223 to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit 
8224 the movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story 
8225 none of birthday girl 's calculated events take us by surprise ... 
8226 there are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them 
8227 i can easily imagine benigni 's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial 
8228 this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad 's wallet 
8229 k 19 stays afloat as decent drama\/action flick 
8230 what more can be expected from a college comedy that 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school ? 
8231 it 's quite diverting nonsense 
8232 aggravating and tedious 
8233 i 'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back 
8234 a bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling can open the door to liberation 
8235 formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market 
8236 more precious than perspicacious 
8237 kurys never shows why , of all the period 's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention 
8238 rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material 
8239 a moving picture that does not move 
8240 this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn 
8241 just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm 
8242 -lrb- fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall -rrb- show us the world they love and make us love it , too 
8243 were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about cal than does the movie or the character any good , freundlich 's world traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising american movies of the year 
8244 a fanciful drama about napoleon 's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility 
8245 the superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead -lrb- water -rrb- weight of the other 
8246 ... enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games 
8247 spy kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : it actually improves upon the original hit movie 
8248 speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life 
8249 benigni 's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow 
8250 audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling 
8251 an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud 
8252 its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story 
8253 a compassionate , moving portrait of an american -lrb- and an america -rrb- always reaching for something just outside his grasp 
8254 -lrb- stephen -rrb- earnhart 's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have 
8255 adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of orlean 's themes without being a true adaptation of her book 
8256 if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride 
8257 an older cad instructs a younger lad in zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy 
8258 director-chef gabriele muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin ' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale 
8259 with amazing finesse , the film shadows heidi 's trip back to vietnam and the city where her mother , mai thi kim , still lives 
8260 an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten 
8261 does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring 
8262 it 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long 
8263 a respectable but uninspired thriller that 's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact 
8264 -lrb- jeff 's -rrb- gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams 's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent 
8265 one of the pleasures in walter 's documentary ... is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject 's mysterious personality without ever explaining him 
8266 it 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn 
8267 a violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for angelique , the -lrb- opening -rrb- dance guarantees karmen 's enthronement among the cinema 's memorable women 
8268 the film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol 
8269 the heat of the moment prevails 
8270 a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea 
8271 return to never land is much more p.c. than the original version -lrb- no more racist portraits of indians , for instance -rrb- , but the excitement is missing 
8272 the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much 
8273 the only thing `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time 
8274 the banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group ... and never fails to entertain 
8275 while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances 
8276 indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild 
8277 contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster 
8278 amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism ... that is routinely dynamited by blethyn 
8279 broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed 
8280 offers a persuasive look at a defeated but defiant nation in flux 
8281 jolting into charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent -lrb- accurate ? 
8282 muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they do n't have , and how this gets us in trouble 
8283 this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer 
8284 my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy 
8285 a riveting documentary 
8286 while i ca n't say it 's on par with the first one , stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie 
8287 so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it 
8288 sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people 
8289 it 's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments 
8290 great character interaction 
8291 louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense 
8292 even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man 
8293 a meatier deeper beginning and\/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the `` a '' range , as is , it 's a very very strong `` b + 
8294 '' 
8295 twist open the ouzo ! 
8296 the biggest problem with this movie is that it 's not nearly long enough 
8297 funny in a sick , twisted sort of way 
8298 trapped wo n't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness 
8299 nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy 
8300 but though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more 
8301 it 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death 
8302 there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending 
8303 the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises 
8304 the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects 
8305 birthday girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked 
8306 potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults 
8307 does n't add up to much 
8308 while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire 
8309 the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension 
8310 ... is there a deeper , more direct connection between these women , one that spans time and reveals meaning ? 
8311 despite its flaws , crazy as hell marks an encouraging new direction for la salle 
8312 this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own 
8313 one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i 've ever seen 
8314 it 's tough to watch , but it 's a fantastic movie 
8315 the movie is well crafted , and well executed 
8316 it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow 
8317 90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping 
8318 moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought 
8319 perhaps not since nelson eddy crooned his indian love call to jeanette macdonald has there been a movie so unabashedly canadian , not afraid to risk american scorn or disinterest 
8320 a big fat pain 
8321 this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least 
8322 as giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago 
8323 -lrb- javier bardem is -rrb- one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama 
8324 while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation 
8325 it 's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame 
8326 hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture 
8327 parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam 's subconscious , pressed through kafka 's meat grinder and into buñuel 's casings 
8328 it uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film 
8329 for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson 's creek , they 'll probably run out screaming 
8330 with elements cribbed from lang 's metropolis , welles ' kane , and eisenstein 's potemkin , the true wonder of rintarô 's metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own 
8331 even with harris 's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear 's soul-stripping breakdown 
8332 it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe 's misunderstanding of marivaux 's rhythms , and mira sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress 
8333 affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids 
8334 slap her - she 's not funny ! 
8335 everything 's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull 
8336 see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes 
8337 nor is it a romantic comedy 
8338 if you 're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake 
8339 a psychic journey deep into the very fabric of iranian ... life 
8340 performances are potent , and the women 's stories are ably intercut and involving 
8341 an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks 
8342 love liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit 
8343 this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal 
8344 gaghan ... has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story 
8345 deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence 
8346 it 's still terrible ! 
8347 it 's in the action scenes that things fall apart 
8348 if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing 
8349 you wo n't exactly know what 's happening but you 'll be blissfully exhausted 
8350 will certainly appeal to asian cult cinema fans and asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about 
8351 they 're just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood 
8352 while dutifully pulling on heartstrings , directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix 
8353 the good is very , very good ... the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful 
8354 davis is funny , charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as amy 
8355 hey arnold ! 
8356 in period costume and with a bigger budget 
8357 heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart 
8358 scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar 
8359 barry convinces us he 's a dangerous , secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful 
8360 an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas 
8361 this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook 
8362 stands as one of the year 's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be 
8363 this story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour 
8364 it 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish 
8365 though haynes ' style apes films from the period ... its message is not rooted in that decade 
8366 in imax in short , it 's just as wonderful on the big screen 
8367 made-up lampoons the moviemaking process itself , while shining a not particularly flattering spotlight on america 's skin-deep notions of pulchritude 
8368 sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler 
8369 i 'd watch these two together again in a new york minute 
8370 it 's a film that 's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics 
8371 a behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that 's made a difference to nyc inner-city youth 
8372 continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means 
8373 this is so de palma 
8374 it 's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing 
8375 he 's a better actor than a standup comedian 
8376 a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over 
8377 so beautifully acted and directed , it 's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses 
8378 he 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does 
8379 insomnia is one of the year 's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances 
8380 it 's so badly made on every level that i 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it 
8381 while not quite `` shrek '' or `` monsters , inc. '' , it 's not too bad 
8382 a slight but sweet film 
8383 my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it 
8384 proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs. sever 
8385 one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there 's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations 
8386 an appalling ` ace ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton 
8387 a smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy 
8388 it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers 
8389 a powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man 's dying fall 
8390 the innocence of holiday cheer ai n't what it used to be 
8391 the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere 
8392 the son of the bride 's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues 
8393 traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill 
8394 you 'd think by now america would have had enough of plucky british eccentrics with hearts of gold 
8395 an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection 
8396 an uplifting , near-masterpiece 
8397 the film 's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence 
8398 unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises 
8399 go 
8400 in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature 
8401 boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome 
8402 pete 's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish 
8403 exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable 
8404 the humor and humanity of monsoon wedding are in perfect balance 
8405 the gorgeously elaborate continuation of `` the lord of the rings '' trilogy is so huge that a column of words can not adequately describe co-writer\/director peter jackson 's expanded vision of j.r.r. tolkien 's middle-earth 
8406 to paraphrase a line from another dickens ' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato 
8407 he 's worked too hard on this movie 
8408 lacks depth 
8409 i 'll put it this way : if you 're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you 
8410 it 's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here 
8411 in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in 
8412 this slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm as the aged napoleon 
8413 rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic 
8414 straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it 
8415 though the story ... is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament 
8416 for all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable 
8417 she 's not yet an actress , not quite a singer ... 
8418 it 's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing 
8419 the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i 'm likely to see all year 
8420 yo , it 's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo 
8421 anybody who enjoys quirky , fun , popcorn movies with a touch of silliness and a little bloodshed 
8422 as the dominant christine , sylvie testud is icily brilliant 
8423 the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad 
8424 -lrb- a -rrb- devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama 
8425 dogtown & z-boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of james dean 
8426 die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with 
8427 it works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory 
8428 -lrb- hayek -rrb- throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo 
8429 the film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9 \/ 11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind 
8430 there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements do n't gel 
8431 the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself 
8432 the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes -lrb- of which they 'll get plenty -rrb- fills me with revulsion 
8433 captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head 
8434 jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar 
8435 contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad 
8436 one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison 
8437 the film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut 
8438 like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls 
8439 to be more engaging on an emotional level , funnier , and on the whole less detached 
8440 savvy director robert j. siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense 
8441 puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself 
8442 ... best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report 
8443 the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet 
8444 has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes 
8445 while broomfield 's film does n't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system 
8446 some movies blend together as they become distant memories 
8447 what ` dumb and dumber ' would have been without the vulgarity and with an intelligent , life-affirming script 
8448 completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage 
8449 ... a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll 
8450 a treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you 're a struggling nobody 
8451 what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between 
8452 it 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland 
8453 we do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this 
8454 feels like a cold old man going through the motions 
8455 both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter 
8456 bravado kathy ! 
8457 occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story 
8458 a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss 
8459 it 's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn 
8460 execrable 
8461 -lrb- seagal 's -rrb- strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's razzie 
8462 thoroughly awful 
8463 the production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable 
8464 starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill 
8465 entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together 
8466 despite besson 's high-profile name being wasabi 's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film 's thoroughly winning tone 
8467 often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? 
8468 a sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work 
8469 perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? 
8470 not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general 
8471 a high-minded snoozer 
8472 the wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic 
8473 bring on the sequel 
8474 judging by those standards , ` scratch ' is a pretty decent little documentary 
8475 a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work 
8476 pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion 
8477 although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing 
8478 an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century 
8479 check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you do n't want to think too much about what 's going on 
8480 a seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by georgian-israeli director dover kosashvili 
8481 as saccharine as it is disposable 
8482 the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai 's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her 
8483 matters play out realistically if not always fairly 
8484 as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan 
8485 it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul 's - eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case 
8486 the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film 
8487 is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing 
8488 contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing 
8489 cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression 
8490 ver wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless 
8491 instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view 
8492 a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer 
8493 a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her 
8494 a much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director anthony friedman 's similarly updated 1970 british production 
8495 hugh grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are 
8496 mendes still does n't quite know how to fill a frame 
8497 but darned if it does n't also keep us riveted to our seats 
8498 such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema 
8499 the message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another 
8500 if you do n't laugh , flee 
8501 there 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present 
8502 to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it 
8503 all of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness 
8504 intriguing and stylish 
8505 a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics are n't likely to enter the theater 
8506 mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor 
8507 it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring 
8508 the film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies 
8509 when it 's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama , `` real women have curves '' is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she 'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams 
8510 that death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world 's religions 
8511 but you 'd never guess that from the performances 
8512 cold , nervy and memorable 
8513 feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum 
8514 first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course 
8515 you can practically hear george orwell turning over 
8516 helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome 
8517 passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly ... 
8518 eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that 's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters 
8519 what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery 
8520 there is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights 
8521 supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy 
8522 spiderman rocks 
8523 the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults 
8524 astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap 
8525 you might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see `` simone , '' and consider a dvd rental instead 
8526 unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style 
8527 kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story 
8528 still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett 's story is appealing 
8529 waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it 
8530 he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities 
8531 hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film 
8532 it 's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters 
8533 this charming , thought-provoking new york fest of life and love has its rewards 
8534 cube 's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche 
8535 a full-frontal attack on audience patience 
8536 ... less a story than an inexplicable nightmare , right down to the population 's shrugging acceptance to each new horror 
8537 tony gayton 's script does n't give us anything we have n't seen before , but director d.j. caruso 's grimy visual veneer and kilmer 's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably 
8538 this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted 
8539 the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface 
8540 it 's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit 
8541 an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans 
8542 a very well-meaning movie , and it will stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the world trade center tragedy 
8543 we get an image of big papa spanning history , rather than suspending it 
8544 it 's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period 
8545 adaptation is simply brilliant 
8546 a thought-provoking picture 
8547 but arriving at a particularly dark moment in history , it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us 
8548 director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film 's music than to the story line ; what 's best about drumline is its energy 
8549 presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable 
8550 williams plays sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in insomnia 
8551 ... its stupidities wind up sticking in one 's mind a lot more than the cool bits 
8552 turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a ` very sneaky ' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing\/reappearing acts 
8553 from beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film 
8554 director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times 
8555 average , at best , i 'm afraid 
8556 this is a superior horror flick 
8557 the cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story 
8558 all in all , it 's a pretty good execution of a story that 's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own 
8559 yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a ca n't - miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong 
8560 it 's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins\/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas 
8561 i felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes 
8562 although i did n't hate this one , it 's not very good either 
8563 cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work 
8564 a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film 
8565 while the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course ... director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades 
8566 anemic , pretentious 
8567 i know we 're not supposed to take it seriously , but i ca n't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary 
8568 with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it 
8569 wiseman reveals the victims of domestic abuse in all of their pity and terror 
8570 light-years ahead of paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor , at least artistically 
8571 one of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theatre 
8572 to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer 
8573 trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all 
8574 all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely 
8575 a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse 
8576 very well made , but does n't generate a lot of tension 
8577 a moving , if uneven , success 
8578 it 's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads 
8579 -lrb- a -rrb- real pleasure in its laid-back way 
8580 what is the filmmakers ' point ? 
8581 trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease 
8582 feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together 
8583 reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish 
8584 has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children 's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting 
8585 ... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be 
8586 ... in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy , it does n't disappoint 
8587 the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about 
8588 after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky 
8589 a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers 
8590 a breathtaking adventure for all ages , spirit tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images 
8591 this is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light -lrb- yet unsentimental -rrb- touch 
8592 a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort 
8593 unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications 
8594 a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of 
8595 the film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects 
8596 though a capable thriller , somewhere along the way k-19 jettisoned some crucial drama 
8597 it 's ... worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts 
8598 in auteil 's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he 's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer 
8599 when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , ` hey , kool-aid ! ' 
8600 how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
8601 the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful 
8602 this is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style 
8603 a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe 
8604 handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism 
8605 ` if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy , it can easily worm its way into your heart 
8606 ' 
8607 who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds 
8608 at its best -lrb- and it does have some very funny sequences -rrb- looking for leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be 
8609 it 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah 
8610 at its best ... festival in cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in cannes 
8611 lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney 's cutoffs 
8612 simple , poignant and leavened with humor , it 's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship 
8613 at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty 
8614 a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession -- one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom 
8615 this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio 
8616 i simply ca n't recommend it enough 
8617 it 's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that 
8618 anyone who 's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved 
8619 returning director rob minkoff ... and screenwriter bruce joel rubin ... have done a fine job of updating white 's dry wit to a new age 
8620 with zoe clarke-williams 's lackluster thriller `` new best friend '' , who needs enemies ? 
8621 an involving , inspirational drama that sometimes falls prey to its sob-story trappings 
8622 just send it to cranky 
8623 it 's secondary to american psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours 
8624 bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda 
8625 one of the funnier movies in town 
8626 a terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown 
8627 the movie is amateurish , but it 's a minor treat 
8628 still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin 
8629 it is n't scary 
8630 a preposterous , prurient whodunit 
8631 they are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre 
8632 `` the turntable is now outselling the electric guitar ... '' 
8633 chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy 
8634 absolutely -lrb- and unintentionally -rrb- terrifying 
8635 an average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains 
8636 instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture 
8637 the plot of the comeback curlers is n't very interesting actually , but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what 's unique and quirky about canadians 
8638 tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic 
8639 it 's harmless , diverting fluff 
8640 the movie is without intent 
8641 the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast 
8642 here is a divine monument to a single man 's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music 
8643 if you 're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix , i have just one word for you - -- decasia 
8644 both overstuffed and undernourished ... the film ca n't be called a solid success , although there 's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time 
8645 if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative 
8646 all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast 
8647 painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed 
8648 take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length 
8649 the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people 
8650 a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level 
8651 it 's not too racy and it 's not too offensive 
8652 a deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams 
8653 in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically 
8654 one long string of cliches 
8655 if you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever 
8656 k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension 
8657 it 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up 
8658 there is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them 
8659 it may seem long at 110 minutes if you 're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert 
8660 while the stoically delivered hokum of hart 's war is never fun , it 's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation 
8661 although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women 
8662 it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong 
8663 it 's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth 
8664 exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise 
8665 however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust 
8666 broomfield turns his distinctive ` blundering ' style into something that could really help clear up the case 
8667 a mess when it comes to the characters and writing ... but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory 
8668 although german cooking does not come readily to mind when considering the world 's best cuisine , mostly martha could make deutchland a popular destination for hungry tourists 
8669 a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture 
8670 ` they ' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying i 'm still stunned 
8671 a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments 
8672 a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba 
8673 smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities 
8674 all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that 
8675 a swashbuckling tale of love , betrayal , revenge and above all , faith 
8676 not a film to rival to live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted 
8677 there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked 
8678 a rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love 
8679 on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion 
8680 macdowell , whose wifty southern charm has anchored lighter affairs ... brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role 
8681 the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center 
8682 despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed 
8683 at once half-baked and overheated 
8684 this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars 
8685 ... a good , if not entirely fresh , look at war 
8686 jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot 
8687 people cinema at its finest 
8688 ` de niro ... is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around 
8689 ' 
8690 if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday 
8691 candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work 
8692 its maker , steven spielberg , has n't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray 
8693 more romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original 
8694 it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment 
8695 it 's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force 
8696 coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit 
8697 with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge 
8698 lovely and poignant 
8699 at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there 's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential 
8700 and just when you think it ca n't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane 
8701 ... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause 
8702 paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma 's scarface 
8703 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag 
8704 ' 
8705 american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize 
8706 visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality 
8707 exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids 
8708 directed in a paint-by-numbers manner 
8709 the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter 's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second 
8710 detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor 
8711 i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i 've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe 
8712 despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults 
8713 huppert 's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face 
8714 so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines 
8715 i just loved every minute of this film 
8716 the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey 's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment 
8717 to say this was done better in wilder 's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east 
8718 the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes 
8719 they should have called it gutterball 
8720 -lrb- majidi -rrb- makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day 
8721 it 's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant 
8722 that 's a cheat 
8723 the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well 
8724 i do n't think i laughed out loud once 
8725 may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen 
8726 taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes 
8727 i am sorry that i was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy 
8728 the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts 
8729 it 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface 
8730 ... think of it as american pie on valium 
8731 the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power 
8732 this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash 
8733 here 's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep 
8734 all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based 
8735 for anyone unfamiliar with pentacostal practices in general and theatrical phenomenon of hell houses in particular , it 's an eye-opener 
8736 if steven soderbergh 's ` solaris ' is a failure it is a glorious failure 
8737 new best friend 's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous 
8738 there 's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl 
8739 not for the prurient or squeamish , it 's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics 
8740 while locals will get a kick out of spotting cleveland sites , the rest of the world will enjoy a fast-paced comedy with quirks that might make the award-winning coen brothers envious 
8741 while -lrb- hill -rrb- has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film 
8742 this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing 
8743 the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom 
8744 -lrb- a -rrb- shapeless blob of desperate entertainment 
8745 dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation 
8746 makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff 
8747 apart from dazzling cinematography , we 've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other 
8748 over age 15 ? 
8749 an exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , minority report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order 
8750 this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities 
8751 this disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget 
8752 from the opening scenes , it 's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie 
8753 it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal 
8754 the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take 
8755 it all adds up to good fun 
8756 `` the time machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself 
8757 unfortunately , it appears that -lrb- jackie -rrb- chan 's us influence is starting to show in his hong kong films 
8758 something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously 
8759 ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine 
8760 the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth 
8761 a coarse and stupid gross-out 
8762 cool ? 
8763 the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries 
8764 a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity 
8765 the weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough 
8766 it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen 
8767 the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor 
8768 when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie 
8769 to my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation 
8770 as ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting 
8771 despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience 
8772 uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance 
8773 socrates motions for hemlock 
8774 the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty 
8775 an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy 
8776 like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... how can something so gross be so boring ? 
8777 feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work 
8778 a celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals ' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences 
8779 awesome creatures , breathtaking scenery , and epic battle scenes add up to another ` spectacular spectacle 
8780 ' 
8781 -lrb- a -rrb- n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s 
8782 neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula 
8783 by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , ... actually pretty good 
8784 seldahl 's barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness 
8785 filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels 
8786 what 's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you 
8787 it 's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it 's brilliant 
8788 it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others 
8789 open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny 
8790 better to just call it abc kiarostami 
8791 just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever 
8792 the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise 
8793 exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling 
8794 this movie is maddening 
8795 not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through 
8796 not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time 
8797 another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues 
8798 that dogged good will of the parents and ` vain ' jia 's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums 
8799 more concerned with sade 's ideas than with his actions 
8800 allows us to hope that nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker 
8801 one of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year 
8802 an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story 
8803 what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action 
8804 but it could have been worse 
8805 a wildly inconsistent emotional experience 
8806 it 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker 
8807 we root for -lrb- clara and paul -rrb- , even like them , though perhaps it 's an emotion closer to pity 
8808 if you dig on david mamet 's mind tricks ... rent this movie and enjoy ! 
8809 you wo n't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him 
8810 delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas 
8811 for starters , the story is just too slim 
8812 the vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one 
8813 half submarine flick , half ghost story , all in one criminally neglected film 
8814 the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays 
8815 my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it 's virtually its own hollywood remake 
8816 an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce 
8817 \/ but daphne , you 're too buff \/ fred thinks he 's tough \/ and velma - wow , you 've lost weight ! 
8818 the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated 
8819 feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot 
8820 the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones 
8821 a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear 
8822 an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes 
8823 a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ... 
8824 not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit 
8825 a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution 
8826 fancy a real downer ? 
8827 a painfully funny ode to bad behavior 
8828 featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , `` sade '' covers the same period as kaufmann 's `` quills '' with more unsettlingly realistic results 
8829 given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done 
8830 has all the depth of a wading pool 
8831 the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work 
8832 it 's just filler 
8833 a deep and meaningful film 
8834 sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you 
8835 holden caulfield did it better 
8836 the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide 
8837 samira makhmalbaf 's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal 
8838 ... brian de palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad 
8839 nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle 
8840 well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull 
8841 while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy 
8842 there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer 
8843 suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative 
8844 -lrb- t -rrb- here 's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them 
8845 if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world 
8846 you wo n't miss its messages , but you 'll be entertained as well 
8847 for movie lovers as well as opera lovers , tosca is a real treat 
8848 the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end 
8849 the film 's performances are thrilling 
8850 a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz 
8851 in all , this is a watchable movie that 's not quite the memorable experience it might have been 
8852 affleck and jackson are good sparring partners 
8853 it inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental ` picture shows 
8854 ' 
8855 ... with `` the bourne identity '' we return to the more traditional action genre 
8856 what the director ca n't do is make either of val kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about 
8857 holm ... embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma 
8858 -lrb- næs -rrb- directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage 
8859 my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor 
8860 if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he does n't hold them in contempt 
8861 this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well 
8862 whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting 
8863 with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff 
8864 at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s 
8865 moretti 's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss 
8866 a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -lrb- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -rrb- 
8867 the end result is a film that 's neither 
8868 scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about 
8869 an artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre 
8870 makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience 
8871 pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery 
8872 travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment 
8873 like the chelsea 's denizens ... burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste 
8874 altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece 
8875 ... an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly should n't hurt talented young gaghan 's resume 
8876 the story and structure are well-honed 
8877 it will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth 
8878 has a lot of the virtues of eastwood at his best 
8879 do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk 
8880 do not see this film 
8881 a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie 
8882 this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer 's star trek vi : the undiscovered country 
8883 a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers 
8884 due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality 
8885 a by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise 
8886 enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age 
8887 thanks to scott 's charismatic roger and eisenberg 's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men 
8888 richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez 
8889 immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop djs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch 
8890 a pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable 
8891 this movie is a snow emergency 
8892 an important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values 
8893 griffiths proves she 's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession 
8894 christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire 
8895 an entertaining , colorful , action-filled crime story with an intimate heart 
8896 and that 's a big part of why we go to the movies 
8897 while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target 
8898 it 's a scathing portrayal 
8899 the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as ... -lrb- quills -rrb- did by showing them 
8900 the film 's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip 
8901 it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie 
8902 historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit 
8903 a rarity among recent iranian films : it 's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist 's plight 
8904 while there 's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying ` get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer 
8905 if your taste runs to ` difficult ' films you absolutely ca n't miss it 
8906 the film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go 
8907 the cold turkey would 've been a far better title 
8908 it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28k modem 
8909 two hours fly by -- opera 's a pleasure when you do n't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated 
8910 hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story 
8911 mcconaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script 
8912 a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama 
8913 looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen 
8914 inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat 
8915 its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? 
8916 the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams 
8917 the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together 
8918 the film may appear naked in its narrative form ... but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the catholic doctrine 
8919 there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them 
8920 overall very good for what it 's trying to do 
8921 it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away 
8922 sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance 
8923 it showcases carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff 
8924 escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie 
8925 the most compelling wiseman epic of recent years 
8926 sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out 
8927 entertains by providing good , lively company 
8928 just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame 
8929 it 's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip 
8930 it 's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake 
8931 there is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients 
8932 it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived 
8933 even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping 
8934 impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly 
8935 preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment 
8936 there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through 
8937 it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that 
8938 manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer 
8939 a smart , witty follow-up 
8940 it 's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie 
8941 for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam 
8942 anchored by friel and williams 's exceptional performances , the film 's power lies in its complexity 
8943 without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelström is just another winter sleepers 
8944 the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip 
8945 it just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read stevenson 's book , which is a treasure in and of itself 
8946 turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting 
8947 it 's also , clearly , great fun 
8948 oscar wilde 's masterpiece , the importance of being earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century 
8949 it 's like watching a nightmare made flesh 
8950 forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending 
8951 it 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that 
8952 the mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted 
8953 belongs to daniel day-lewis as much as it belongs to martin scorsese ; it 's a memorable performance in a big , brassy , disturbing , unusual and highly successful film 
8954 if the first men in black was money , the second is small change 
8955 writer\/director mark romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in america 
8956 for the most part stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue 
8957 there 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route 
8958 viewers of `` the ring '' are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes 
8959 it 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism 
8960 it 's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way 
8961 looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in jane hamilton 's exemplary costumes , rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon

8963 thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters

8965 if you 're in the mood for a bollywood film , here 's one for you 
8966 dilbert without the right-on satiric humor 
8967 an exquisitely crafted and acted tale 
8968 skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt 
8969 has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence 
8970 the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we ca n't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo 
8971 not since tom cruise in risky business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear 
8972 or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife 
8973 scooby dooby doo \/ and shaggy too \/ you both look and sound great 
8974 may be far from the best of the series , but it 's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation 
8975 one of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it 
8976 does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence 
8977 the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time 
8978 movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction 
8979 even in this less-than-magic kingdom , reese rules 
8980 not only unfunny , but downright repellent 
8981 for the most part , it 's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions 
8982 seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work 
8983 you 'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear 
8984 comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class 
8985 this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get 
8986 ramsay , as in ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid 
8987 if there 's one thing this world needs less of , it 's movies about college that are written and directed by people who could n't pass an entrance exam 
8988 director of photography benoit delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors , and the costumes and sets are grand 
8989 is not easy 
8990 instead , he shows them the respect they are due 
8991 ... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments 
8992 the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation 
8993 a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored 
8994 warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality 
8995 it is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of leon 's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction 
8996 a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel 
8997 it 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic 
8998 few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands 
8999 the lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it 
9000 this is it 
9001 yes , dull 
9002 that 's pure pr hype 
9003 it is great summer fun to watch arnold and his buddy gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters 
9004 a subtle and well-crafted -lrb- for the most part -rrb- chiller 
9005 that is a compliment to kuras and miller 
9006 if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it 's john turturro , who 's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish 
9007 if it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent 
9008 one of the more intelligent children 's movies to hit theaters this year 
9009 for the most part , director anne-sophie birot 's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama 
9010 it 's a beautiful madness 
9011 stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros. -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green 's half-hearted movie career 
9012 i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand 
9013 harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment 
9014 the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing 
9015 a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn 
9016 the words , ` frankly , my dear , i do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate 
9017 by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie 
9018 his healthy sense of satire is light and fun ... 
9019 a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama 
9020 ` a ' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy 
9021 it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it does n't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise 
9022 part low rent godfather 
9023 or emptying rat traps 
9024 the special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original , while the oscar-winning sound and james horner 's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system 
9025 under 15 ? 
9026 on the heels of the ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness 
9027 harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness 
9028 it 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center 
9029 schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character 
9030 offers much to enjoy ... and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends 
9031 in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space 
9032 adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized 
9033 so unassuming and pure of heart , you ca n't help but warmly extend your arms and yell ` safe ! ' 
9034 walter hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity 
9035 full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny 
9036 professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller 
9037 this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience 
9038 it 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue 
9039 one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution 
9040 nothing 's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun 
9041 it 's not without its pleasures , but i 'll stick with the tune 
9042 drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why 
9043 a muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that 
9044 while undisputed is n't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes mr. hill higher than he 's been in a while 
9045 a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original 
9046 it does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored 
9047 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so 
9048 jacquot 's rendering of puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera 
9049 the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships 
9050 a warm , funny , engaging film 
9051 uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity 
9052 i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers 
9053 -lrb- serry -rrb- wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition 
9054 with tightly organized efficiency , numerous flashbacks and a constant edge of tension , miller 's film is one of 2002 's involvingly adult surprises 
9055 the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who 's ever had family trauma 
9056 there seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there 
9057 aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better 
9058 by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , -lrb- jones -rrb- calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity 
9059 a breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters 
9060 because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling 
9061 there 's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you 'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it 
9062 exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes 
9063 a superbly acted and funny\/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate 
9064 the movie 's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast 
9065 it 's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt 
9066 in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in 
9067 green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project 
9068 the socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides ... -lrb- and -rrb- personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy 
9069 a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney 
9070 writer\/director joe carnahan 's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic 
9071 too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... the isle defies an easy categorization 
9072 based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters 
9073 the format gets used best ... to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups 
9074 even in its most tedious scenes , russian ark is mesmerizing 
9075 this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes 
9076 you wonder why enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie 
9077 funny but perilously slight 
9078 chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama 
9079 in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest 
9080 makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun 
9081 this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you 're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other 
9082 while it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it 's alarmingly current 
9083 fresnadillo 's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that wo n't go away 
9084 ` easily my choice for one of the year 's best films 
9085 ' 
9086 pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins 
9087 candid camera on methamphetamines 
9088 it 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction 
9089 but it 's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle 
9090 in spite of good housekeeping 's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film 
9091 more maudlin than sharp 
9092 no aspirations to social import inform the movie version 
9093 outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent 
9094 rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment 
9095 van wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers 
9096 so , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today 's new delhi 
9097 a subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; the pianist does not 
9098 ... routine , harmless diversion and little else 
9099 not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers 
9100 blanchett 's performance confirms her power once again 
9101 this is nothing but familiar territory 
9102 this is a winning ensemble comedy that shows canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world 
9103 it ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy 
9104 while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they 're presented with a wry dark humor 
9105 the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did 
9106 a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection 
9107 the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance 
9108 this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work 
9109 it can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull 
9110 sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation 
9111 a film about a young man finding god that is accessible and touching to the marrow 
9112 nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting 
9113 although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there 's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun 
9114 it 's hard to imagine alan arkin being better than he is in this performance 
9115 it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study 
9116 a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores 
9117 a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back 
9118 nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay 
9119 not since japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa 's ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur 
9120 though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions 
9121 the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him 
9122 although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs 
9123 hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile -lrb- emphasized here -rrb- accent the humor of wilson 's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness 
9124 reggio 's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking 
9125 about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it 's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological 
9126 too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped 
9127 `` roger michell -lrb- '' notting hill `` -rrb- directs a morality thriller 
9128 '' 
9129 unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies 
9130 the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure 
9131 in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan 
9132 cq 's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors 
9133 jones ... does offer a brutal form of charisma 
9134 it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds 
9135 not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions 
9136 it 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes 
9137 this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults 
9138 the lion king was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on imax it seems better , not just bigger 
9139 kinnear does n't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth 
9140 is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
9141 wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty 
9142 this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs 
9143 you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this 
9144 a quiet , pure , elliptical film 
9145 harrison 's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all 
9146 it 's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman 
9147 no screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of clones ' last 45 minutes 
9148 despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine 
9149 it 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role 
9150 building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise 
9151 overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube 
9152 it 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong 
9153 this is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming 
9154 the band 's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring , especially for aging hippies -lrb- this one included -rrb- 
9155 this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs 
9156 thanks to haynes ' absolute control of the film 's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , far from heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act 
9157 more whiny downer than corruscating commentary 
9158 beneath clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from rabbit-proof fence 
9159 a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle 
9160 the film is powerful , accessible and funny 
9161 a good piece of work more often than not 
9162 there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade 
9163 in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey 
9164 care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters 
9165 the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque 
9166 the chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between gauls and yanks 
9167 i can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers 
9168 ... the film suffers from a lack of humor -lrb- something needed to balance out the violence -rrb- ... 
9169 a working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered 
9170 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he 'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor 
9171 with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here 
9172 but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
9173 majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places 
9174 if you 've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like , here it is 
9175 the vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination 
9176 martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid 
9177 all that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight 
9178 it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness 
9179 it confirms fincher 's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight 
9180 this is as respectful a film as byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it 's necessary 
9181 dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments 
9182 if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle 
9183 good film , but very glum 
9184 nine queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head 
9185 when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while 
9186 the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain 
9187 a solid examination of the male midlife crisis 
9188 -lrb- d -rrb- oes n't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful 
9189 it 's a coming-of-age story we 've all seen bits of in other films -- but it 's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity 
9190 an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles 
9191 -lrb- grant 's -rrb- bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle 
9192 they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending 
9193 a poignant and compelling story about relationships , food of love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart 
9194 a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug 
9195 a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other 
9196 this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film 
9197 a marvel like none you 've seen 
9198 the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects 
9199 leigh 's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom 
9200 manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time 
9201 the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens 
9202 determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult 
9203 the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes 
9204 whether you like rap music or loathe it , you ca n't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie 
9205 all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us 
9206 feature debuter d.j. caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton 's narcotics noir to life 
9207 serving sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs 
9208 ah yes , and then there 's the music ... 
9209 my reaction in a word : disappointment 
9210 the film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style 
9211 star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before 
9212 very psychoanalytical -- provocatively so -- and also refreshingly literary 
9213 the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not 
9214 with rabbit-proof fence , noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie 
9215 a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal 
9216 even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor 
9217 this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast 
9218 the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale 
9219 add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney 's a good director 
9220 as unseemly as its title suggests 
9221 the movie is n't just hilarious : it 's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it is n't even all that dumb 
9222 among the year 's most intriguing explorations of alientation 
9223 the sort of film that makes me miss hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there 's hope for popular cinema yet 
9224 the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants 
9225 the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing 
9226 and if you 're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes , you 've got ice water in your veins 
9227 a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures 
9228 the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances 
9229 -lrb- lawrence bounces -rrb- all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place 
9230 what distinguishes time of favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts 
9231 crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action 
9232 with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap 
9233 in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song 
9234 ... designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns 
9235 as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear 
9236 worth watching for dong jie 's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change 
9237 if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then esther 's story is a compelling quest for truth 
9238 unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners 
9239 stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad 
9240 `` mostly martha '' is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see 
9241 no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie 
9242 a workshop mentality prevails 
9243 this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : al pacino loathing robin williams 
9244 writer-director 's mehta 's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres 
9245 ... takes the beauty of baseball and melds it with a story that could touch anyone regardless of their familiarity with the sport 
9246 one of the smartest takes on singles culture i 've seen in a long time 
9247 it 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks 
9248 this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against 
9249 to call the other side of heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be 
9250 the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental 
9251 it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience 
9252 a great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar 
9253 lapaglia 's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver 's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class 
9254 my thoughts were focused on the characters 
9255 it 's slow -- very , very slow 
9256 though it 's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class 
9257 should have been someone else - 
9258 it 's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker 's movie adaptation 
9259 it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes 
9260 indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie 
9261 even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy 
9262 it 's fascinating to see how bettany and mcdowell play off each other 
9263 teen movies have really hit the skids 
9264 i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example 
9265 stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond 's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , ` tis 
9266 even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller 's hand often feels unsure 
9267 every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn 
9268 it gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right 
9269 i 'm sure if you 're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... me , i did n't care for it 
9270 a poignant , artfully crafted meditation on mortality 
9271 one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals ... a psychological masterpiece 
9272 no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand 
9273 even if you do n't think -lrb- kissinger 's -rrb- any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he 'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch 
9274 ... a story we have n't seen on the big screen before , and it 's a story that we as americans , and human beings , should know 
9275 irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater 
9276 instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it 's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life 
9277 the film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency 
9278 scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas 
9279 hey arnold ! 
9280 though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining 
9281 woody allen 's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz 
9282 it 's the perfect kind of film to see when you do n't want to use your brain 
9283 there 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging 
9284 as a first-time director , paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul 
9285 a gripping movie , played with performances that are all understated and touching 
9286 too slow , too long and too little happens 
9287 plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread 
9288 at all 
9289 there can be no other explanation 
9290 by the time we learn that andrew 's turnabout is fair play is every bit as awful as borchardt 's coven , we can enjoy it anyway 
9291 attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience 
9292 it 's a demented kitsch mess -lrb- although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative -rrb- , but it 's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year 
9293 bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves 
9294 it is amusing , and that 's all it needs to be 
9295 what time is it there ? 
9296 the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory 
9297 a taut psychological thriller that does n't waste a moment of its two-hour running time 
9298 ... is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri 
9299 michael gerbosi 's script is economically packed with telling scenes 
9300 light years \/ several warp speeds \/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful insurrection 
9301 what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian 
9302 at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it 's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form 's history 
9303 at the very least , if you do n't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave 
9304 a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic ... 
9305 partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show 
9306 bennett 's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any ` reality ' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first 
9307 jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory 
9308 ... mafia , rap stars and hood rats butt their ugly heads in a regurgitation of cinematic violence that gives brutal birth to an unlikely , but likable , hero 
9309 ' 
9310 i got a headache watching this meaningless downer 
9311 montias ... pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters 
9312 slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
9313 his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level 
9314 big fat waste of time 
9315 it 's not that kung pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk 's impish augmentation 
9316 it 's so good that you can practically see the hollywood ` suits ' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too - inevitable american remake 
9317 a delightful coming-of-age story 
9318 binoche makes it interesting trying to find out 
9319 the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant 
9320 a beguiling , slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in iran 
9321 kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble 
9322 ... a fun little timewaster , helped especially by the cool presence of jean reno 
9323 prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this english trifle 
9324 the old-world - meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie 's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco bollywood that , by the end of monsoon wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater 
9325 as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming 
9326 director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback 
9327 the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained 
9328 claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that 's okay 
9329 puts a human face on a land most westerners are unfamiliar with 
9330 unflinchingly bleak and desperate 
9331 the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence 
9332 like mike is n't interested in recycling old cliches 
9333 it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker 's motherland 
9334 works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them 
9335 the film 's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties 
9336 no one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best 
9337 verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies 
9338 creepy , authentic and dark 
9339 uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions 
9340 as vulgar as it is banal 
9341 i 'm just too bored to care 
9342 i had to look away - this was god awful 
9343 it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color 
9344 84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare 
9345 a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going 
9346 what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we 've shared a great adventure 
9347 of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad 
9348 for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal 
9349 scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence 
9350 though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama 
9351 it 's a charming and often affecting journey 
9352 nervous breakdowns are not entertaining 
9353 this is a story of two misfits who do n't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent 
9354 atom egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues 
9355 as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor 
9356 it 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible 
9357 no way i can believe this load of junk 
9358 we know the plot 's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish 
9359 lan yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree 
9360 will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues 
9361 another one of those estrogen overdose movies like `` divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood , '' except that the writing , acting and character development are a lot better 
9362 byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama 
9363 it 's unnerving to see recoing 's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment 
9364 the humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original 
9365 instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone 
9366 a moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate 
9367 offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm 
9368 it haunts you , you ca n't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it 
9369 sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest 
9370 as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms. redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality 
9371 almost gags on its own gore 
9372 the film is quiet , threatening and unforgettable 
9373 ... the movie is just a plain old monster 
9374 likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer 
9375 sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos 
9376 displaying about equal amounts of naiveté , passion and talent , beneath clouds establishes sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential 
9377 it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot 
9378 a strangely compelling and brilliantly acted psychological drama 
9379 i 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film 
9380 every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable 
9381 the movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach 
9382 a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right 
9383 minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report 
9384 the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting 
9385 like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well 
9386 confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it 
9387 -lrb- e -rrb- ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism 
9388 denis o'neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others 
9389 forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power 
9390 this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms 
9391 first-time writer-director serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film 
9392 while it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records -lrb- sugar hill gang , etc. -rrb- , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences 
9393 -lrb- leigh -rrb- lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race 
9394 the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past 
9395 combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest system of a down video 
9396 there 's no emotional pulse to solaris 
9397 a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of -lrb- besson 's -rrb- earlier work 
9398 the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it 
9399 does paint some memorable images ... , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters 
9400 rare birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable 
9401 the film 's essentially over by the meet-cute 
9402 but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell 
9403 generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes 
9404 dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled 
9405 sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn 
9406 essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of aliens 
9407 the quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy 
9408 the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge 
9409 very bad 
9410 having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , khouri then gets terrific performances from them all 
9411 a woman 's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken 
9412 mr. tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? 
9413 the intent is almost exactly the same -lrb- as the full monty -rrb- 
9414 for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout 
9415 a by-the-numbers patient\/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground 
9416 a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j.m. barrie 's peter pan 
9417 why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? 
9418 the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough 
9419 burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast 
9420 oh come on 
9421 generally provides its target audience of youngsters enough stimulating eye and ear candy to make its moral medicine go down 
9422 even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting 
9423 its well of thorn and vinegar -lrb- and simple humanity -rrb- has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks 
9424 the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy 
9425 at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects 
9426 and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new 
9427 is this love or is it masochism ? 
9428 ... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller 
9429 a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment 
9430 mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way 
9431 slick piece of cross-promotion 
9432 sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero 
9433 deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises 
9434 a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 
9435 for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he 's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars 
9436 birthday girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments 
9437 a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty 
9438 while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer 's appetite , the film 's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving 
9439 ... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock 
9440 we learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef 
9441 excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters 
9442 if you 're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here 
9443 davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is 
9444 it 's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again 
9445 dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness -lrb- which always relates to characters and story -rrb- and johnny dankworth 's best soundtrack in years 
9446 highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up 
9447 once -lrb- kim -rrb- begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard 
9448 -lrb- t -rrb- his beguiling belgian fable , very much its own droll and delicate little film , has some touching things to say about what is important in life and why 
9449 simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy 
9450 too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance 
9451 it 's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that does n't feel it has to prove anything 
9452 bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era 's creme de la celluloid 
9453 it 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job 
9454 it 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense 
9455 fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment 
9456 hey arnold ! 
9457 just one bad idea after another 
9458 it 's a lovely film with lovely performances by buy and accorsi 
9459 the script kicks in , and mr. hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow 
9460 this is her blue lagoon 
9461 does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past 
9462 a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line 
9463 like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter 
9464 remember the kind of movie we were hoping `` ecks vs. sever '' or `` xxx '' was going to be ? 
9465 it 's a buggy drag 
9466 yakusho and shimizu ... create engaging characterizations in imamura 's lively and enjoyable cultural mix 
9467 it 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel 
9468 i ca n't say that i liked homeboy ; it 'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way 
9469 there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine 
9470 a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness 
9471 very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant achilles ' heel in `` stuart little 2 `` : there 's just no story , folks 
9472 like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all 
9473 manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite 
9474 it 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think 
9475 the very definition of the ` small ' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher 
9476 one from the heart 
9477 and when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem 
9478 this is so bad 
9479 so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises 
9480 ahhhh ... revenge is sweet ! 
9481 against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine 
9482 the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad 
9483 it 's one heck of a character study -- not of hearst or davies but of the unique relationship between them 
9484 as a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a triumph , however , it is not 
9485 the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned 
9486 whether writer-director anne fontaine 's film is a ghost story , an account of a nervous breakdown , a trip down memory lane , all three or none of the above , it is as seductive as it is haunting 
9487 the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves 
9488 the draw -lrb- for `` big bad love '' -rrb- is a solid performance by arliss howard 
9489 one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year 
9490 basically a static series of semi-improvised -lrb- and semi-coherent -rrb- raps between the stars 
9491 for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking 
9492 a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction 
9493 some of it is clever , but it is never melodic \/ 
9494 there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill 
9495 it 's fun lite 
9496 a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion 
9497 although there are several truly jolting scares , there 's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at 
9498 not nearly long enough 
9499 the overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts 
9500 trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive 
9501 so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie 
9502 chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson 's dahmer 
9503 visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it 
9504 columns from ladies home journal ... 
9505 a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda 
9506 once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back 
9507 on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura 's best work since the xfl 
9508 but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned can not be said to suck 
9509 at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch 
9510 the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate\/surf culture , the l.a. beach scene and the imaginative -lrb- and sometimes illegal -rrb- ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults 
9511 should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor 
9512 much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind -- namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation 
9513 for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery 
9514 corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in 
9515 nothing is black and white 
9516 this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath 
9517 trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son 
9518 villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi 's generic angst -lrb- there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows -rrb- 
9519 what is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting 
9520 who needs love like this ? 
9521 as the two leads , lathan and diggs are charming and have chemistry both as friends and lovers 
9522 like leon , it 's frustrating and still oddly likable 
9523 if you can stomach the rough content , it 's worth checking out for the performances alone 
9524 there 's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache 
9525 and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea 
9526 there 's ... tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate 
9527 although jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for the return of the king , we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of the two towers 
9528 director andrew niccol ... demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame 
9529 try as i may , i ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` thank you ! ' 
9530 shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere 
9531 utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni 's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film 
9532 further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of dubya 's axis of evil 
9533 but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 
9534 miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness 
9535 the piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to anspaugh 's three lead actresses 
9536 what better message than ` love thyself ' could young women of any size receive ? 
9537 if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you 
9538 may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow 
9539 it 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -lrb- and who knew they even had any ? -rrb- 
9540 the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that 's all too rare in hollywood 's hastier productions 
9541 prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment 
9542 there 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours 
9543 although huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun 
9544 a gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life 
9545 nothing is sacred in this gut-buster 
9546 a tender , heartfelt family drama 
9547 ... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects 
9548 it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen 
9549 but the power of these -lrb- subjects -rrb- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative 
9550 suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it 's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood 
9551 a delirious celebration of the female orgasm 
9552 reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way 
9553 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace 
9554 the acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production 's austere locales 
9555 this is n't even madonna 's swept away 
9556 i ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it 
9557 a coda in every sense , the pinochet case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the british court 's extradition chess game and the regime 's talking-head survivors 
9558 brilliantly explores the conflict between following one 's heart and following the demands of tradition 
9559 like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away 
9560 involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters 
9561 the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous -lrb- but with bears , and a g rating -rrb- , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure 
9562 i 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here 
9563 -lrb- director -rrb- o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short 
9564 the problem with this film is that it lacks focus 
9565 on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality 
9566 long time dead ? 
9567 ... a magnificent drama well worth tracking down 
9568 the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people 
9569 the next generation of mob movie 
9570 perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie 
9571 for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution 
9572 it believes it 's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it 's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile 
9573 it 's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part 
9574 old-form moviemaking at its best 
9575 a sometimes tedious film 
9576 whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u.s. satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife\/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy 
9577 a gorgeous , witty , seductive movie 
9578 moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not 
9579 a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes 
9580 late marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u.s. viewers off their feet 
9581 a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it 's approached with imagination and flair 
9582 but it still jingles in the pocket 
9583 it 's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this `` two weddings and a funeral '' fun 
9584 it all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time 
9585 the french are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the americans , who have a passion for musketeers , only to spoof them 
9586 nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns 
9587 it wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor 
9588 which is n't to say that it 's the equal of some of its predecessors 
9589 an unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse 
9590 comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief 
9591 you do n't have to know about music to appreciate the film 's easygoing blend of comedy and romance 
9592 if you 're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a.i. , you 'll probably like rollerball 
9593 the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life 
9594 it 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` can this marriage be saved ? '' 
9595 it will grip even viewers who are n't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way 
9596 challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative 
9597 expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery 
9598 there 's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichéd , doddering , misogynistic boy 's club 
9599 the whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film 
9600 the film 's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone 
9601 tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar 
9602 while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these 
9603 barely gets off the ground 
9604 beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama 
9605 a solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring 
9606 let 's hope -- shall we ? 
9607 i still ca n't relate to stuart : he 's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough 
9608 stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time 
9609 the ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures 
9610 good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back ! 
9611 a movie with a real anarchic flair 
9612 it 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions 
9613 characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs 
9614 maneuvers skillfully through the plot 's hot brine -- until it 's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors 
9615 a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard 's finest work 
9616 a thinly veiled look at different aspects of chinese life clashing with each other 
9617 far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features nickelodeon has made from its other animated tv series 
9618 pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r. abrams , in their feature debut 
9619 it 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one 
9620 zhang ... has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast 
9621 without ever becoming didactic , director carlos carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality 
9622 it 's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth 
9623 pumpkin wants to have it both ways 
9624 gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive 
9625 -lrb- chaiken 's -rrb- talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters 
9626 a psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor bill paxton 's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural americana 
9627 it 's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children 
9628 dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away 
9629 the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle 
9630 less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins 
9631 a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left 
9632 -lrb- w -rrb- hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall 's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands 
9633 intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject 
9634 the son 's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos 
9635 a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers 
9636 it 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination 
9637 ... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it 
9638 this time mr. burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again 
9639 manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane 
9640 a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past 
9641 yes , ballistic is silly 
9642 the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan 's madness 
9643 a sequel that 's much too big for its britches 
9644 this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento -lrb- a producer here -rrb- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic 
9645 nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy 
9646 it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons 
9647 it treats women like idiots 
9648 there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness 
9649 the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died 
9650 an interesting story with a pertinent -lrb- cinematically unique -rrb- message , told fairly well and scored to perfection , i found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive `` missing thing 
9651 '' 
9652 weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger 
9653 what 's next : `` my mother the car ? '' 
9654 not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics 
9655 a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year 
9656 an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss 
9657 the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second 
9658 hilariously inept and ridiculous 
9659 vera 's three actors -- mollà , gil and bardem -- excel in insightful , empathetic performances 
9660 for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one 
9661 good car chases , great fight scenes , and a distinctive blend of european , american and asian influences 
9662 the performances take the movie to a higher level 
9663 some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny 
9664 chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum 
9665 if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this imposter 
9666 would n't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc. , be more valuable ? 
9667 though catch me if you can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie 
9668 despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected -lrb- even , at times , preposterous -rrb- turns , love is just too , too precious in the end 
9669 deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness 
9670 collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans 
9671 part three stooges 
9672 still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed 
9673 his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it 
9674 portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama 
9675 the minor figures surrounding -lrb- bobby -rrb- ... form a gritty urban mosaic 
9676 no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise 
9677 complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort 
9678 it 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it 's about as exciting as a sunburn 
9679 while it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold 
9680 the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life 
9681 returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy 
9682 there 's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino 's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television 
9683 zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight 
9684 not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j.k. rowling 's books 
9685 the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence 
9686 the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it 's an enjoyable one 
9687 chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer 
9688 too much of the humor falls flat 
9689 falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun 
9690 if the count of monte cristo does n't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago 
9691 jaglom ... put -lrb- s -rrb- the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters 
9692 if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con 
9693 every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency 
9694 velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene 
9695 hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people 
9696 one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others 
9697 it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death 
9698 the so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing -lrb- featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer -rrb- brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks 
9699 it 's everything you do n't go to the movies for 
9700 mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity 
9701 the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows 
9702 pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical 
9703 a compelling spanish film about the withering effects of jealousy in the life of a young monarch whose sexual passion for her husband becomes an obsession 
9704 holy mad maniac in a mask , splat-man ! 
9705 there 's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like steven spielberg to follow a.i. with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority 
9706 whereas last year 's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it 
9707 bad 
9708 an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution 
9709 it 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show 
9710 the subtle strength of `` elling '' is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation 
9711 not exactly the bees knees 
9712 audrey tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate french comedy , she 's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in amélie 
9713 just not campy enough 
9714 an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director john mckay can swallow 
9715 equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today 's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 
9716 a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking 
9717 a spellbinding african film about the modern condition of rootlessness , a state experienced by millions around the globe 
9718 a cartoon that 's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that 's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore 
9719 you will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report 
9720 an operatic , sprawling picture that 's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length 
9721 i 've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal 
9722 morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern 's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan 
9723 and i 've decided to leave a light on every night from now on 
9724 the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious 
9725 it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought 
9726 rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign 
9727 we have n't seen such hilarity since say it is n't so ! 
9728 true tale of courage -- and complicity -- at auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable 
9729 how do you spell cliché ? 
9730 manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious 
9731 the script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman -lrb- the actor -rrb- can make it work 
9732 a giggle a minute 
9733 made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss 
9734 the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater 
9735 maud and roland 's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy 
9736 but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material 
9737 just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time 
9738 vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them 
9739 a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking 
9740 the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner 
9741 corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless 
9742 huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair 
9743 in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy 
9744 if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong 
9745 nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle 
9746 a sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes 
9747 it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i ca n't wait for the sequel 
9748 liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image 
9749 passable entertainment , but it 's the kind of motion picture that wo n't make much of a splash when it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards 
9750 the movie is for fans who ca n't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it 
9751 a sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss 
9752 it 's made with deftly unsettling genre flair 
9753 it 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary 
9754 a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers ... 
9755 ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it 
9756 the tale of tok -lrb- andy lau -rrb- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o -lrb- takashi sorimachi -rrb- , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold 
9757 something like scrubbing the toilet 
9758 `` the ring '' is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws 
9759 smart , provocative and blisteringly funny 
9760 this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics 
9761 charles ' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld 's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams ' attempts to get his shot at the big time 
9762 an effectively creepy , fear-inducing -lrb- not fear-reducing -rrb- film from japanese director hideo nakata , who takes the superstitious curse on chain letters and actually applies it 
9763 no movement , no yuks , not much of anything 
9764 a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore 's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée 
9765 ` how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? ' 
9766 so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something 
9767 gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up 
9768 we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas 
9769 this is one of polanski 's best films 
9770 take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema 
9771 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes `` never again '' worthwhile , but -lrb- writer\/director -rrb- schaeffer should follow his titular advice 
9772 the movie exists for its soccer action and its fine acting 
9773 arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces 
9774 a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided 
9775 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -lrb- literally -rrb- 
9776 jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot 
9777 even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame 
9778 oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough 
9779 though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes 
9780 when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign 
9781 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot ... 
9782 the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air 
9783 if your senses have n't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you 're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket 
9784 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes 
9785 as conceived by mr. schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell 
9786 those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida 
9787 most new movies have a bright sheen 
9788 but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing 
9789 steve irwin 's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume 
9790 d.j. qualls as indiana jones ? 
9791 it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america 's most oppressive regimes 
9792 nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition 
9793 the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave 
9794 culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character 
9795 sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well 
9796 the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit 
9797 not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it 's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it 
9798 the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover 
9799 it 's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock , garry shandling and colin quinn 
9800 finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less 
9801 the low-budget full frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother 
9802 exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven ... -lrb- the film -rrb- addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce 
9803 an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the ` truth ' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to 
9804 as a singular character study , it 's perfect 
9805 haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration 
9806 an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment 
9807 all the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , all or nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit 
9808 a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe ... the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history 
9809 is it a total success ? 
9810 i do n't have an i am sam clue 
9811 zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it 's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones 
9812 the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they 'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor 
9813 the new guy is one of them 
9814 the thrill is -lrb- long -rrb- gone 
9815 much monkeyfun for all 
9816 a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle 
9817 this is really just another genre picture 
9818 much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride 
9819 for the first time in several years , mr. allen has surpassed himself with the magic he 's spun with the hollywood empress of ms. leoni 's ellie 
9820 one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce 
9821 as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them 
9822 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity 
9823 with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv 's defunct cleopatra 2525 
9824 this is simply the most fun you 'll ever have with a documentary ! 
9825 it represents better-than-average movie-making that does n't demand a dumb , distracted audience 
9826 ... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity 
9827 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just does n't make the cut 
9828 the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays 
9829 how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ? 
9830 for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way 
9831 as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness 
9832 sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle 
9833 ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family 's custom-made christmas card 
9834 a dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble 
9835 the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy 
9836 instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre 
9837 the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll 
9838 it is ridiculous , of course ... but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness 
9839 everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids 
9840 big deal ! 
9841 tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure 
9842 a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull 
9843 the cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters 
9844 a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series 
9845 a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at 
9846 dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick 
9847 a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy 
9848 not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' i once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad 
9849 a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek 
9850 it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism 
9851 the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that 's rare in film today , but be warned : it 's a slow slog to get there 
9852 -lrb- schweiger is -rrb- talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists 
9853 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer 
9854 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 
9855 for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero 
9856 this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap 
9857 now it 's just tired 
9858 not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen 
9859 it 's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- i 'm prepared to call it a draw 
9860 about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through 
9861 the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark 
9862 as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten 
9863 writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear 
9864 truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before 
9865 george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please 
9866 sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary 
9867 all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility 
9868 it 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time 
9869 the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience 
9870 too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience 
9871 goyer 's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast 
9872 reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world 's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes 
9873 abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists 
9874 if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right 
9875 scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism 
9876 director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama 
9877 without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor 's home videos 
9878 a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favour the audience 
9879 de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork 
9880 an intelligent fiction about learning through cultural clash 
9881 greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill 
9882 you wo n't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who 's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all 
9883 there 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about 
9884 at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance 
9885 sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling 
9886 enough similarities to gymkata and howie long 's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs 
9887 despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show ... represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there 's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it 
9888 here 's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you 
9889 a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship 
9890 if i spy were funny -lrb- enough -rrb- or exciting -lrb- enough -rrb- then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public 
9891 a great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell does n't even have a great ending 
9892 demands too much of most viewers 
9893 rare is the ` urban comedy ' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie 
9894 its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer 
9895 a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish 
9896 arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie 
9897 the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable 
9898 a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless 
9899 while not as aggressively impressive as its american counterpart , `` in the bedroom , '' moretti 's film makes its own , quieter observations 
9900 asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy 
9901 aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend 
9902 imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno 
9903 a refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale 
9904 the marquis de sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be 
9905 somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional 
9906 ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy 's intrepid hero ? 
9907 the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer 
9908 the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us 
9909 u.s. audiences may find -lrb- attal and gainsbourg 's -rrb- unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what hollywood typically concocts 
9910 escapism in its purest form 
9911 the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed 
9912 works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren 
9913 sucking all the ` classic ' out of robert louis stevenson 's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst ... 
9914 audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film 's tart , sugar-free wit 
9915 despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy 
9916 nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them 
9917 it 's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director 's previous full frontal 
9918 even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad 
9919 the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense 
9920 the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear 
9921 the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of 
9922 it 's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental 
9923 it 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too 
9924 it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding 
9925 a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency 
9926 barely goes beyond comic book status 
9927 even if you ca n't pronounce `` gyro '' correctly , you 'll appreciate much of vardalos ' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries 
9928 borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu 
9929 fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored 
9930 it wo n't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking 
9931 once again , director jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action\/effects on the spectacular scale 
9932 as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys ' novel `` the death of napoleon '' and directed by alan taylor , napoleon 's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn 
9933 not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies 
9934 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original 
9935 a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy 
9936 a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans 
9937 sits uneasily as a horror picture ... but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family 
9938 lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel 
9939 an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video 
9940 it 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed 
9941 the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough 
9942 ridiculous 
9943 no. 
9944 if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker 's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life 's urgent questions 
9945 if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta 
9946 a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been 
9947 a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not 
9948 and in this regard , on guard delivers 
9949 something the true film buff will enjoy 
9950 the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached 
9951 a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing 
9952 the actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them 
9953 the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants ' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed 
9954 it 's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it 's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep 
9955 the result is something quite fresh and delightful 
9956 if you love motown music , you 'll love this documentary 
9957 it 's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be 
9958 you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they 're each interesting 
9959 -lrb- wendigo is -rrb- why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind 
9960 lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically 
9961 a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty 
9962 for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry 
9963 spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama 
9964 frida 's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it 's among the most breathtakingly designed films i 've ever seen 
9965 i hate this movie 
9966 not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it 's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies 
9967 the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity 
9968 like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel 
9969 city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes 
9970 it 's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary ... 
9971 this insightful , oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance 
9972 this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay 
9973 too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes 
9974 so young , so smart , such talent , such a wise \*\*\* 
9975 only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry 
9976 resourceful and ingenious entertainment 
9977 ` enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable 
9978 rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic 
9979 this romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime england , and ably captures the speech patterns , moral codes and ideals of the 1940s 
9980 reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film 
9981 a masterpiece four years in the making 
9982 polished korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as hollywood action epics 
9983 `` an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters 
9984 '' 
9985 in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns 
9986 do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman does n't work ? 
9987 this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he 's the most obvious one 
9988 the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry 
9989 the movie is n't always easy to look at 
9990 a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness 
9991 the movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension 
9992 digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world 
9993 it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy 
9994 impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises 
9995 the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive 
9996 her delivery and timing are flawless 
9997 if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title 
9998 almost every scene in this film is a gem that could stand alone , a perfectly realized observation of mood , behavior and intent 
9999 when it 's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper 
10000 like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause 
10001 boring we did n't 
10002 a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages 
10003 undercover brother does n't go far enough 
10004 moot point 
10005 let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home 
10006 as green-guts monster movies go , it 's a beaut 
10007 elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone 
10008 the movie is full of fine performances , led by josef bierbichler as brecht and monica bleibtreu as helene weigel , his wife 
10009 münch 's genuine insight makes the film 's occasional overindulgence forgivable 
10010 the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment 
10011 all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure 
10012 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut 
10013 the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script 
10014 beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at 
10015 this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through 
10016 for the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride 
10017 ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life 's stasis 
10018 no question 
10019 neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn 
10020 a compendium of solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes 
10021 all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit 
10022 biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame 
10023 anyone who can count to five -lrb- the film 's target market ? -rrb- 
10024 warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard 
10025 an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick 
10026 emerges as something rare , an issue movie that 's so honest and keenly observed that it does n't feel like one 
10027 cuts right through the b.s. giving a big middle-fingered `` shut up '' to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another 
10028 sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film 
10029 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic 
10030 thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking 
10031 it is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling -lrb- and an uneasy alliance , at that -rrb- 
10032 unfortunately , as a writer , mr. montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor 
10033 a long-winded , predictable scenario 
10034 invincible is a wonderful movie 
10035 earns its laughs from stock redneck ` types ' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing 
10036 a smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy 
10037 a moody horror\/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director 's well-known narrative gamesmanship 
10038 a dreadful live-action movie 
10039 s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results 
10040 for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies 
10041 though the controversial korean filmmaker 's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding 
10042 well worth the time 
10043 they felt like the same movie to me 
10044 witty , touching and well paced 
10045 i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr. holland 's class for the music , or to robin williams 's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve 
10046 this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998 's whatever 
10047 absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way 
10048 good movie 
10049 lilia 's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth 
10050 i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie -- for its historical significance alone 
10051 it 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school 
10052 but what spectacular sizzle it is ! 
10053 enduring love but exhausting cinema 
10054 stephen earnhart 's homespun documentary mule skinner blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens 
10055 it 's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its `` men in a sardine can '' warped logic 
10056 a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well 
10057 taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise 
10058 ... understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation 
10059 when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music 
10060 so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check 
10061 one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade 
10062 the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness 
10063 an amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail 
10064 time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets 
10065 a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth 
10066 ... the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats 
10067 these are lives worth watching , paths worth following 
10068 static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! 
10069 this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself 
10070 we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again 
10071 the wwii drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear 
10072 a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world 
10073 ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` what 's the point ? ' 
10074 the best movie of its kind since ` brazil 
10075 ' 
10076 as a director , mr. ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects 
10077 the disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on 
10078 davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces 
10079 it might be tempting to regard mr. andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr. earnhart 's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists 
10080 sadly , hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks 
10081 this one does 
10082 so what is the point ? 
10083 the issue of faith is not explored very deeply 
10084 everything that 's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television 
10085 my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie 
10086 director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building 
10087 i kept thinking over and over again , ' i should be enjoying this 
10088 ' 
10089 it 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie 
10090 do n't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches ... 
10091 i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war ... it 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink 
10092 the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension 
10093 an eccentric little comic\/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality 
10094 behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one ca n't help but think he 'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art 
10095 my goodness , queen latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts 
10096 often moving and explores the discomfort inherent in the contacts between the american ` hosts ' and their ` guests 
10097 ' 
10098 anthony hopkins ? 
10099 egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you 'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious 
10100 will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them 
10101 a chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags 
10102 the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction 
10103 this is one for the ages 
10104 the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense 
10105 bennett 's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that 's tough to shake 
10106 every so often a movie comes along that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it 
10107 a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material 
10108 the talents of the actors helps `` moonlight mile '' rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing 
10109 as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame 
10110 ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers 
10111 all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable 
10112 i wonder why 
10113 day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs 
10114 the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes 
10115 quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
10116 karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat 
10117 it is nature against progress 
10118 by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious 
10119 the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll 
10120 this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences 
10121 most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness 
10122 makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran 's borderlands 
10123 despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei 's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy 
10124 well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull 
10125 this is n't a narrative film -- i do n't know if it 's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i 'm sure some will try -- but it 's as close as anyone has dared to come 
10126 christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr. feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic 
10127 heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension 
10128 a clever blend of fact and fiction 
10129 all ms. jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters 
10130 there 's plenty of style in guillermo del toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes 
10131 the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi 
10132 a sudsy cautionary tale 
10133 the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers 
10134 it 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish 
10135 based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness 
10136 pray 's film works well and will appeal even to those who are n't too familiar with turntablism 
10137 those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find what time is it there ? 
10138 it 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff 
10139 it 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story 
10140 to the film 's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment 
10141 why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson ... and puke up something like rose red ? 
10142 an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood 
10143 though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work 
10144 well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons 
10145 outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time 
10146 sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth 
10147 there 's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking 
10148 a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term 
10149 this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema 's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable 
10150 newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg 
10151 vividly conveys both the pitfalls and the pleasures of over-the-top love 
10152 formula 51 is so trite that even yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor 
10153 when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily 
10154 flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey 
10155 too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette 
10156 overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek 's novel by some way 
10157 an incredibly low-rent danish film , it brings a group of people together in a sweet and charming way , if a little convenient 
10158 the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing 
10159 occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almodóvar style 
10160 high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character 
10161 pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura 
10162 a mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world 
10163 a movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults , as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats 
10164 -lrb- an -rrb- hilarious romantic comedy 
10165 both deeply weird and charmingly dear 
10166 the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch 
10167 the movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music 
10168 what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender 
10169 a hip ride into hyper-time , clockstoppers is a lively and enjoyable adventure for all ages at any time 
10170 it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise 
10171 occasionally melodramatic , it 's also extremely effective 
10172 a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more 
10173 it 's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness 
10174 an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street 
10175 rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down 
10176 the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year 
10177 it 's hard not to feel you 've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story 
10178 it 's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood 
10179 where last time jokes flowed out of cho 's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines 
10180 -lrb- but it 's -rrb- worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser 
10181 the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins 
10182 there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital 
10183 though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters 
10184 philip k. dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach 
10185 its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper 
10186 fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots 
10187 theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n't learn at the center of a kids ' story ? 
10188 the movie 's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow 
10189 it might as well have been problem child iv 
10190 feels like one of those contrived , only-in - hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk 
10191 good ol' urban legend stuff 
10192 the film 's greatest asset is how much it 's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture 
10193 home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do 
10194 ... a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original 
10195 if it 's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that 
10196 one of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind 
10197 sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece 
10198 painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year 's most accomplished and riveting film performances 
10199 do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor 
10200 he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works 
10201 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer 
10202 like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it 
10203 kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth -lrb- mojo -rrb- that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world 
10204 it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
10205 ... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world 
10206 while surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing 
10207 an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years 
10208 begins as a promising meditation on one of america 's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt 
10209 a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it 
10210 -lrb- howard -rrb- so good as leon barlow ... that he hardly seems to be acting 
10211 the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology 
10212 but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing 
10213 the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by 
10214 though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention 
10215 the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you ca n't wait to see what they do next 
10216 reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad 
10217 you 've already seen heartbreak if you 've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard 
10218 -lrb- fessenden -rrb- is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills 
10219 if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of `` the isle '' you 'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else 
10220 the plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality 
10221 jacquot 's tosca is a treat 
10222 you 're better off staying home and watching the x-files 
10223 the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes 
10224 the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense 
10225 divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it 's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances 
10226 the movie sticks much closer to hornby 's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did 
10227 the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one 
10228 the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts 
10229 but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds 
10230 the ending is a cop-out 
10231 the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket -lrb- second prize , of course , two free tickets -rrb- to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie 
10232 no , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences 
10233 but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person 
10234 bullock 's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film 
10235 say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue 
10236 all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click 
10237 you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes 
10238 proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie 
10239 workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies 
10240 this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone 's career 
10241 like the film 's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early - '80s suburbia , it 's significant without being overstated 
10242 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license 
10243 elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it 's therapeutic to laugh along with them 
10244 ... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film 
10245 a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk 'n' slash 
10246 take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo 's cool jackets 
10247 a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters 
10248 hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love 
10249 insomnia is involving 
10250 the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion 
10251 just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story 
10252 not a bad journey at all 
10253 has a shambling charm ... a cheerfully inconsequential diversion 
10254 passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless 
10255 the film 's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen 
10256 collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end 
10257 even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for disney 
10258 bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that does n't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it 
10259 although the editing might have been tighter , hush ! 
10260 it 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable 
10261 the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel 
10262 you could say that it 's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people would n't , but one thing you could n't say is that alias betty is predictable 
10263 hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic 
10264 it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come 
10265 a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man 
10266 a comprehensive and provocative film -- one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience 
10267 despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style 
10268 the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh does n't always improve the over-the-top mix 
10269 this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire 
10270 ` charly ' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy ... 
10271 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola 's inadequate performance 
10272 the performances are so leaden , michael rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud 
10273 a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film 
10274 the movie bounces all over the map 
10275 if there 's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr. demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a. addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic 
10276 there 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong 
10277 a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality 
10278 it 's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it 's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit 
10279 it 's as close as we 'll ever come to looking through a photographer 's viewfinder as he works 
10280 the film is all a little lit crit 101 , but it 's extremely well played and often very funny 
10281 it 's a trifle 
10282 de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli 
10283 funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , `` a city where people still read 
10284 '' 
10285 too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through 
10286 the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low 
10287 fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn 
10288 a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan 
10289 disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids ' books to the screen ... tuck everlasting is a little of both 
10290 though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following 
10291 this idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture 
10292 little more than a frothy vanity project 
10293 a depressing confirmation of everything those of us who do n't object to the description `` unelected '' have suspected all along : george w. bush is an incurious , uncharismatic , overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide 
10294 an enchanting film that presents an audacious tour of the past and takes within its warm embrace the bounties of cultural artifacts inside st. petersburg 's hermitage museum 
10295 the new guy does have a heart 
10296 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice 's complex akasha into a cartoon monster 
10297 nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity ... 
10298 few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness 
10299 i did n't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood 
10300 the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them 
10301 if you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere 
10302 the movie makes absolutely no sense 
10303 it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya 
10304 edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery 
10305 mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty 
10306 this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family 
10307 almost everything else is wan 
10308 as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , ` lovely ! 
10309 it never fails to engage us 
10310 it is now 
10311 only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee 's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents 
10312 or tom green as han solo ? 
10313 it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three 's company-style laugh track 
10314 shadyac shoots his film like an m. night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail 's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension 
10315 waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality 
10316 i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible 
10317 the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter 
10318 no more 
10319 -lrb- newton -rrb- wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality 
10320 i did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot 
10321 purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u.s. foreign policy has played in the rise of castro 
10322 a mild , reluctant , thumbs down 
10323 a tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man 's tortured soul 
10324 an original gem about an obsession with time 
10325 she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs 
10326 none of this violates the letter of behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor 
10327 tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool 
10328 a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance 
10329 this is art paying homage to art 
10330 happily for mr. chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match 
10331 makes s&m seem very romantic , and maggie gyllenhaal is a delight 
10332 like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike 
10333 how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us 
10334 despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is amy 's self-absorbed personality -- amy 's o 's honesty will win you over 
10335 it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion 
10336 in the second half of the film , frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis 
10337 the year 's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way 
10338 andersson creates a world that 's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad 
10339 an intelligent , moving and invigorating film 
10340 daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget 
10341 ... as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the star wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement 
10342 never -lrb- sinks -rrb- into exploitation 
10343 leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness 
10344 the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct 
10345 a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience 
10346 it 's hard not to be seduced by -lrb- witherspoon 's -rrb- charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max 
10347 glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism 
10348 with the film 's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved 
10349 you 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot 
10350 foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling 
10351 it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile 
10352 fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense 
10353 ... has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they 're ghosts imagining themselves as alive 
10354 tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth 
10355 this is carion 's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach 
10356 an elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller 
10357 stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd 
10358 the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece 
10359 hey , who else needs a shower ? 
10360 but even a hero can stumble sometimes 
10361 the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy 
10362 moore 's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995 's safe 
10363 not even the hanson brothers can save it 
10364 a picture that extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky , spirited fashion 
10365 too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it 's not a total loss 
10366 his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving 
10367 now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism 
10368 for the most part , the ingredients are there 
10369 hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world 
10370 an imaginative comedy\/thriller 
10371 technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial 
10372 the only thing in pauline and paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers 
10373 offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude 
10374 there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit 
10375 for anyone who grew up on disney 's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor 
10376 ... an inviting piece of film 
10377 ... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason 
10378 flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern 's thick , working-class scottish accent 
10379 maudlin and melodramatic we expected 
10380 shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption 
10381 not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey 
10382 the visuals alone make metropolis worth seeing 
10383 uncertain in tone ... a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things 
10384 a waste of good performances 
10385 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating 
10386 a bit of an unwieldy mess 
10387 the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety 
10388 julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan 
10389 a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe 
10390 noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama 
10391 liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase 
10392 a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction ! 
10393 propelled not by characters but by caricatures 
10394 never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man 
10395 here 's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah 
10396 every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point 
10397 one of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory 
10398 the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime 
10399 i like the new footage and still love the old stuff 
10400 i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women 
10401 without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie 
10402 gollum 's ` performance ' is incredible ! 
10403 superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line 
10404 there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them 
10405 an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story 
10406 if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins 
10407 a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy 
10408 a sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about 
10409 flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with 
10410 director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one 
10411 it would have benefitted the dialogue 
10412 lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and does n't know how to have fun 
10413 this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray 
10414 it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes 
10415 kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action 
10416 you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing 
10417 the tenderness of the piece is still intact 
10418 these people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance 
10419 a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller 
10420 the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day 
10421 while undercover brother is definitely one for the masses , it 's also full of sharp , smart satire 
10422 two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more 's the pity 
10423 visits spy-movie territory like a novel you ca n't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last 
10424 just how extreme are these ops ? 
10425 too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing 
10426 it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media ... to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks 
10427 just one problem : fish out of water usually die 
10428 some actors steal scenes 
10429 this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics 
10430 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial 
10431 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter 
10432 a tough go , but leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu 
10433 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin 
10434 a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable 
10435 while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at 
10436 denis and co-writer michele petin 's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing 
10437 expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies 
10438 lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new 
10439 the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies 
10440 he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about 
10441 an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you 're getting its metaphysical point 
10442 majidi 's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times 
10443 it 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original 
10444 westfeldt and juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that 's both saucy and endearing 
10445 quite funny for the type of movie it is ... 
10446 run , do n't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen 
10447 matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy 
10448 a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie 
10449 a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine ` twist ' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense 
10450 i 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s 
10451 dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter 
10452 when it 's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable 
10453 a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes 
10454 a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race 
10455 usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it 
10456 mr. wedge and mr. saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well 
10457 longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days 
10458 a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered 
10459 the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor 
10460 do n't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life 
10461 a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia 's film history 
10462 too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century 
10463 plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial 
10464 all that -lrb- powerpuff girls -rrb- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin 
10465 jirí hubac 's script is a gem 
10466 as -lrb- the characters -rrb- get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound 
10467 even when foreign directors ... borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting 
10468 in a word -- yes 
10469 feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention 
10470 no worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go 
10471 this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment 
10472 admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch 
10473 `` the emperor 's new clothes '' begins with a simple plan ... well , at least that 's the plan 
10474 often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter 's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie 
10475 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original 
10476 cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent 's days 
10477 friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it 's called where 's chris tucker when you need him ? 
10478 extremely confusing 
10479 -lrb- hawn 's character -rrb- is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten 
10480 well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special 
10481 but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi 
10482 son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness 
10483 it 's laughing at us 
10484 haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you 're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed 
10485 like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness 
10486 this film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation 
10487 helmer devito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' tv and revenge 
10488 the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny 
10489 4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it 's the ultimate redneck road-trip 
10490 still , i 'm not quite sure what the point is ... 
10491 has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ? 
10492 after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin 
10493 unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit 
10494 by the end of no such thing the audience , like beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster 
10495 a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -lrb- woody allen -rrb- has made in the last twenty years 
10496 the production values are up there 
10497 rates an ` e ' for effort -- and a ` b ' for boring 
10498 it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less 
10499 the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain 
10500 being author wells ' great-grandson , you 'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material 
10501 a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers 
10502 it 's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured 
10503 like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest 
10504 whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion 
10505 there are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv 
10506 smith 's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes 
10507 a shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional 
10508 its direction , its script , and weaver 's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that 's what you 're in the mood for 
10509 it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he 's been making for the last several years 
10510 `` collateral damage '' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment -- until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief 
10511 still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral 
10512 a blessed gift to film geeks and historians 
10513 what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level 
10514 it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit 
10515 yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature 
10516 there 's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film ... or the emotional integrity of the performances 
10517 whether you 're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you 'll still feel something 
10518 a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino 
10519 an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true 
10520 moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance 
10521 this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all 
10522 boisterous and daft documentary 
10523 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric 
10524 what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical 
10525 is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? 
10526 the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students 
10527 the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset 
10528 roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut 
10529 maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this 
10530 ... there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen 
10531 i loved it ! 
10532 brilliant ! ' 
10533 some studio pizazz might have helped 
10534 it will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary 
10535 all the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi 
10536 a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level 
10537 a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations 
10538 the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge 
10539 director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` the longest yard '' playbook like a checklist 
10540 i have n't seen one in so long , no wonder i did n't recognize it at first 
10541 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up 
10542 cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing 
10543 you can practically smell the patchouli oil 
10544 cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone 
10545 what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment 
10546 this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow 
10547 it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture 
10548 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor 
10549 maguire is a surprisingly effective peter\/spider-man 
10550 windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live 
10551 for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded 
10552 so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart 
10553 a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido 
10554 cho 's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience 
10555 about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream 
10556 ... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work 
10557 ... in this incarnation its fizz is infectious 
10558 the gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook 
10559 it 's just incredibly dull 
10560 genuinely touching because it 's realistic about all kinds of love 
10561 nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year 
10562 it 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more 
10563 a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python 's meaning of life 
10564 a graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined 
10565 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 
10566 a little too pat for its own good 
10567 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay 
10568 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential 
10569 if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror 
10570 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards 
10571 for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale 
10572 had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago 
10573 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed\/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation 
10574 there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false 
10575 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script 
10576 just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail 
10577 mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness 
10578 ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it 's all over his chelsea walls 
10579 the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles 
10580 an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection 
10581 extremely dumb 
10582 in the end , ted bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context 
10583 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising 
10584 just what makes us happy , anyway ? 
10585 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke 
10586 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after -lrb- or during -rrb- consumption of its second half 
10587 enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later 
10588 leave these flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine 
10589 when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility 
10590 may be spoofing an easy target -- those old ' 50 's giant creature features -- but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today 
10591 morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start 
10592 all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto 
10593 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession 
10594 it 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition 
10595 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you 've imagined the ring 
10596 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions 
10597 it 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana 's future 
10598 think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind 
10599 hilarious , acidic brit comedy 
10600 an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams 
10601 myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another 
10602 but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting 
10603 a marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption 
10604 whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment 
10605 how did it ever get made ? 
10606 it is also , at times , curiously moving 
10607 it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs 
10608 a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services 
10609 the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game 
10610 the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la 
10611 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it does n't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story 
10612 worth the effort to watch 
10613 morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either 
10614 everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan 's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true 
10615 grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte 
10616 just a bloody mess 
10617 suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video 
10618 the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today 's cinema du sarcasm 
10619 i do n't think i 've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto 's iron man 
10620 the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question 
10621 anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women 's self-actualization knows few continental divides 
10622 kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed 
10623 as an actor , the rock is aptly named 
10624 thoughtful , provocative and entertaining 
10625 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why 
10626 at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts 
10627 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding 
10628 places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller 
10629 the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom 
10630 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere 
10631 there 's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm 
10632 good for a few unintentional laughs , `` extreme ops '' was obviously made for the `` xxx '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction 
10633 tim story 's not there yet - but ` barbershop ' shows he 's on his way 
10634 a sports movie with action that 's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it 
10635 those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they do n't really want to know 
10636 the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure 
10637 what happened with pluto nash ? 
10638 using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead 
10639 notorious c.h.o. has oodles of vulgar highlights 
10640 before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon 
10641 it 's just a silly black genre spoof 
10642 as written by michael berg and michael j. wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all 
10643 in fessenden 's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale 
10644 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings 
10645 offers that rare combination of entertainment and education 
10646 romanek keeps the film constantly taut ... reflecting the character 's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score 
10647 despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there 's no scene that screams `` bathroom break ! '' 
10648 greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders 
10649 the heightened symmetry of this new\/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time 
10650 moore 's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that 's still very much playing itself out 
10651 there 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity 
10652 hip-hop has a history , and it 's a metaphor for this love story 
10653 as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining 
10654 engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship 
10655 eventually , it wins you over 
10656 you 'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it 
10657 effective but too-tepid biopic 
10658 if we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get 
10659 the acting alone is worth the price of admission 
10660 i admired this work a lot 
10661 might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr. eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage 
10662 it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world 
10663 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal 
10664 highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager 
10665 bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability 
10666 the 3d images only enhance the film 's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen 
10667 this version 's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful 
10668 it 's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be 
10669 if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps 
10670 but some unexpected zigs and zags help 
10671 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer 
10672 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another 
10673 an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale 
10674 de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest 
10675 the master of disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy 
10676 as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes were n't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create 
10677 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven 
10678 a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive 's attention to detail 
10679 interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals ` red dragon ' right from under their noses 
10680 what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent 
10681 if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan 
10682 a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master 's steady stroke 
10683 offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works 
10684 there is n't a weak or careless performance amongst them 
10685 the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide 
10686 brimful 
10687 it virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while 
10688 the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin 
10689 fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox 's work 
10690 viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson 's novel will likely prefer disney 's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic 
10691 novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach 
10692 what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness 
10693 i enjoyed the ride -lrb- bumps and all -rrb- , creamy depth , and ultimate theme 
10694 what you get with empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead 
10695 a very average science fiction film 
10696 it 's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak 
10697 the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off 
10698 verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills 
10699 no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either 
10700 the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin 
10701 though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static 
10702 we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride 
10703 complex , affecting and uniquely almodóvar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong 
10704 maybe it 's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades ... but honestly , analyze that really is n't all that bad 
10705 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory 
10706 a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america 's culture of fear 
10707 while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun 
10708 theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical 
10709 the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr. desplechin is content to state it 
10710 the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it 
10711 great story , bad idea for a movie 
10712 cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i 'm not one of them 
10713 while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it 's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy 
10714 while benigni -lrb- who stars and co-wrote -rrb- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that 
10715 smith 's point is simple and obvious -- people 's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers 
10716 divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy 
10717 extremely boring 
10718 an impossible romance , but we root for the patronized iranian lad 
10719 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it 'll be on video by then 
10720 eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler 's many talents 
10721 too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise 
10722 if there 's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it 's in projects like the -lrb- unfortunately r-rated -rrb- paid 
10723 you 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus 
10724 an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids 
10725 it 's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more 
10726 there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject 
10727 more honest about alzheimer 's disease , i think , than iris 
10728 hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading 
10729 what 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class 
10730 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented 
10731 some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast 
10732 it would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 
10733 you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you 'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story 
10734 a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it 
10735 effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience 
10736 life is a crock -- or something like it 
10737 a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind 
10738 from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent 's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir 
10739 is n't quite the equal of woo 's best earlier work , but it 's easily his finest american film ... comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films 
10740 secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny 
10741 the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat 
10742 automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf 
10743 it 's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer 
10744 one minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and\/or sailor moon have been spliced in 
10745 director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini 's famous love-jealousy - murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation 
10746 this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story 
10747 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater 
10748 never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery 
10749 choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy 
10750 makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man 's greatness 
10751 an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living 
10752 the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time 
10753 unfortunately , they 're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo 's life imaginable 
10754 this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long 
10755 it 's like a poem 
10756 ... lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar 
10757 a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half 
10758 earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast 
10759 it 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun 
10760 a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to 
10761 here , thankfully , they are 
10762 a sour , nasty offering 
10763 everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones 
10764 this time kaufman 's imagination has failed him 
10765 ... breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters 
10766 ' 
10767 suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal 
10768 the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects 
10769 has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act 
10770 this is junk food cinema at its greasiest 
10771 clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie 
10772 -lrb- director -rrb- byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one 
10773 if you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now 
10774 a miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out 
10775 shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme 
10776 frailty is n't as gory or explicit 
10777 choose your reaction : a. -rrb- that sure is funny ! 
10778 it 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile 
10779 it 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u.s. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in french -lrb- well , mostly -rrb- with english subtitles and is magically ` significant ' because of that 
10780 droll caper-comedy remake of `` big deal on madonna street '' that 's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate `` bellini '' begins to look like a `` real kaputschnik 
10781 '' 
10782 call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film 
10783 search it out 
10784 it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count 
10785 japan 's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date 
10786 easier to respect than enthuse over , andersson 's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing 
10787 and if the hours wins ` best picture ' i just might 
10788 another rent installment for the ian fleming estate 
10789 instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart 's war , like the st. louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started 
10790 murderous maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth 
10791 some of seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot 
10792 one of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever 
10793 for caine lovers only 
10794 it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb 
10795 elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one 
10796 a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience 
10797 opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between 
10798 ... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs 
10799 thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings 
10800 farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis 's world-weary colonel 
10801 that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered 
10802 it 's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet 
10803 those who would follow haneke on his creepy explorations ... are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from huppert and magimel 
10804 it 's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner 
10805 but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship 
10806 a fascinating and fun film 
10807 the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick 
10808 a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life 
10809 the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary 
10810 wait for video -- and then do n't rent it 
10811 an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best 
10812 remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? 
10813 -lrb- i -rrb- f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you 've already seen this kind of thing 
10814 excellent acting and direction 
10815 a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american 's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle 
10816 a very funny movie 
10817 both awful and appealing 
10818 wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together 
10819 ranks among willams ' best screen work 
10820 you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling 
10821 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it 's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it 's told by the people who were there 
10822 these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining 
10823 it 's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart 
10824 had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin 
10825 scotland , pa. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole 
10826 there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering 
10827 the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious 
10828 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well 
10829 the seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going 
10830 an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone 
10831 what kids will discover is a new collectible 
10832 could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? 
10833 even die-hard fans of japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge 
10834 it 's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds 
10835 this is an hour and a half of daydreaming 
10836 ford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier 
10837 that rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind 
10838 could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? 
10839 while mcfarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films ... it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys ' story 
10840 when -lrb- de palma 's -rrb- bad , he 's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done 
10841 behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies -lrb- plus one sheep dog -rrb- , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart 
10842 a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners 
10843 hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette 's dialogue 
10844 a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect 
10845 dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee 
10846 look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music 
10847 presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it 
10848 the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other 
10849 but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick -lrb- remember cabin boy ? -rrb- 
10850 besides , real movie producers are n't this nice 
10851 mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness 
10852 this is how you use special effects 
10853 haneke keeps us at arm 's length 
10854 like its two predecessors , 1983 's koyaanisqatsi and 1988 's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever 
10855 what 's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world 
10856 he 's super spy ! 
10857 though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr. schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear 
10858 i do n't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh 's full frontal , though that did n't stop me from enjoying much of it 
10859 has the feel of an unedited personal journal 
10860 the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next 
10861 skip work to see it at the first opportunity 
10862 ecks this one off your must-see list 
10863 gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film 
10864 drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality 
10865 human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control 
10866 the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs 
10867 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive 
10868 the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic 
10869 so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality 
10870 smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way 
10871 the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon 
10872 merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone 
10873 but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here 
10874 not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny 
10875 murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous 
10876 even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good 
10877 the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone 
10878 there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production 
10879 but in 2002 , such revelations wilt 
10880 it 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks 
10881 gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? 
10882 engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying 
10883 birot 's directorial debut -lrb- she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré -rrb- is n't so much bad as it is bland 
10884 as bundy , michael reilly burke -lrb- octopus 2 : river of fear -rrb- has just the right amount of charisma and menace 
10885 it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original 
10886 scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be 
10887 b. -rrb- that sure is pathetic ! 
10888 this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life 
10889 all 's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags 
10890 the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun 
10891 it wo n't bust your gut -- and it 's not intended to -- it 's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke 
10892 it 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor 
10893 several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare 
10894 -lrb- u -rrb- nrelentingly stupid 
10895 or a profit 
10896 the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc. 
10897 compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder 
10898 faultlessly professional but finally slight 
10899 renner 's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing 
10900 big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities 
10901 afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen 's men is finally just one long drag 
10902 bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he ca n't help throwing in a few of his own touches 
10903 a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots 
10904 it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun 
10905 a recipe for cinematic disaster ... part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad 
10906 hands down the year 's most thought-provoking film 
10907 the furious coherence that -lrb- deniro -rrb- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing 
10908 there was time on that second round to see the subtleties of ramsay 's portrait of grief 
10909 perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about 
10910 you might not buy the ideas 
10911 looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due 
10912 as shaky as the plot is , kaufman 's script is still memorable for some great one-liners 
10913 not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it 's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare 
10914 this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you 'll be glad you went along for the ride 
10915 too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless 
10916 at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about 
10917 a compelling journey ... and `` his best friend remembers '' is up there with the finest of specials 
10918 a real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us do n't know 
10919 after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna 
10920 but buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie 
10921 a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against ... well , just stuff 
10922 the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout 
10923 this horror-comedy does n't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira 's hooters 
10924 yes , you are , ben kingsley 
10925 what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved 
10926 it 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre 
10927 the title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is 
10928 a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned 
10929 nothing about it fits 
10930 the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep 
10931 ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance 
10932 it 's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic 
10933 a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass 
10934 it 's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable 
10935 must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry 
10936 does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively 
10937 when the first few villians are introduced as `` spider '' and `` snake '' you know you 're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak 
10938 this is n't a `` friday '' worth waiting for 
10939 maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional 
10940 even the unwatchable soapdish is more original 
10941 a wildly funny prison caper 
10942 it 's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru 
10943 obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! 
10944 nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera 
10945 unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me 
10946 its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing 
10947 when a film is created solely because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result 
10948 often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed 
10949 when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart 
10950 there 's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable 
10951 it 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views 
10952 although very much like the first movie based on j.k. rowling 's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude 
10953 though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal woody at best 
10954 merchant effectively translates naipaul 's lively mix of characters from the page to screen 
10955 others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore 's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding 
10956 you 've seen them a million times 
10957 the comic performances are all spot on , especially lee ross 's turn as ken 
10958 nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about 
10959 message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? 
10960 disney 's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem 
10961 first good , then bothersome 
10962 to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable 
10963 adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse 
10964 manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas 
10965 even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs. sever is a dumb action movie 
10966 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it 's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch 
10967 ... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life 
10968 human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better 
10969 a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men 
10970 but this time there 's some mold on the gold 
10971 a model of what films like this should be like 
10972 a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title 
10973 light , cute and forgettable 
10974 -lrb- t -rrb- hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality does n't work in a modern context 
10975 a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones 
10976 immediately 
10977 melanie eventually slugs the yankee 
10978 a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil ' bow wow 
10979 aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol 's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it 
10980 a fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in japanese animation 
10981 if the ' 70 's were your idea of a good time at the movies , this will make you very happy 
10982 a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort 
10983 the hours is what movies are supposed to be ... 
10984 just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat 
10985 when it really counts ... bloody sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language 
10986 for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear 
10987 ... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time 
10988 a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution 
10989 nothing more than a mediocre trifle 
10990 full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience 
10991 this is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times 
10992 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production 
10993 equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama 
10994 johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to 
10995 not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care 
10996 audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school 
10997 a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy 
10998 a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness 
10999 as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled -lrb- literally and figuratively -rrb- by desire ... -lrb- sex and lucía -rrb- makes for an arousing good time 
11000 a work of intricate elegance , literary lyricism and profound common sense 
11001 solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts 
11002 remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster ... done up by howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand 
11003 for all its serious sense of purpose ... -lrb- it -rrb- finds a way to lay bare the tragedies of its setting with a good deal of warmth and humor 
11004 far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place ... innocent and well-meaning 
11005 despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions 
11006 the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task 
11007 the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted 
11008 it helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well 
11009 one of -lrb- herzog 's -rrb- least inspired works 
11010 the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller 
11011 the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case 
11012 as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure 
11013 it 's an awfully derivative story 
11014 now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie 
11015 fails to bring as much to the table 
11016 sturdy , entertaining period drama ... both caine and fraser have their moments 
11017 focuses on joan 's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her `` madness '' so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century torture device 
11018 there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema 's finest this year 
11019 dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement 
11020 narc may not get an ` a ' for originality , but it wears its b-movie heritage like a badge of honor 
11021 the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly 
11022 i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending 
11023 a tv episode inflated past its natural length 
11024 zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure 
11025 the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine 
11026 it 's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world 
11027 celebrated at sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that 's hard to beat 
11028 -lrb- davis -rrb- has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race 
11029 enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment 
11030 by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , auto focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing 
11031 the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses 
11032 watching trouble every day , at least if you do n't know what 's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms 
11033 a journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman 's brilliance almost makes worth taking 
11034 rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as monsoon wedding 
11035 the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them 
11036 what happens to john q ? 
11037 there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust 
11038 a thoughtful look at a painful incident that made headlines in 1995 
11039 an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort 
11040 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman -lrb- who never gets to play that flute -rrb- has all the charm of a meltdown 
11041 marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess 
11042 as teen movies go , `` orange county '' is a refreshing change 
11043 there 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant 
11044 attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage 
11045 with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path 
11046 a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales 
11047 flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year 's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat 
11048 lame , haphazard teen comedy 
11049 somewhat blurred , but kinnear 's performance is razor sharp 
11050 ... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense 
11051 no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story 
11052 the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama 
11053 just pound away 
11054 a slick , skillful little horror film 
11055 there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it 's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises 
11056 more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent 
11057 ... does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters ' choices , good and ill , that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought 
11058 on the surface , it 's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz 's and kieslowski 's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique 
11059 in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did 
11060 it helps that lil bow wow ... tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid 
11061 finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original 
11062 most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots 
11063 began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course 
11064 it 's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel ... 
11065 parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde 's still-contemporary play 
11066 much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -lrb- the movie 's -rrb- mindset 
11067 but based on cq , i 'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project 
11068 disturbing and brilliant documentary 
11069 chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror 
11070 windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop 
11071 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness 
11072 to say analyze that is de niro 's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career 
11073 an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world 
11074 the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors 
11075 the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt 
11076 this film is full of rabbits 
11077 alas , it 's neither 
11078 ... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core 
11079 men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce 
11080 not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve 's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters 
11081 it 's astonishing 
11082 a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch 
11083 a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution 
11084 a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser 
11085 between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap 
11086 the central story lacks punch 
11087 not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i 've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' 
11088 hmm 
11089 a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy 
11090 a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality 
11091 if you 're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite 
11092 all in all , there 's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone 
11093 it 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma 
11094 we need -lrb- moore 's -rrb- noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones 
11095 roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck -- few filmmakers will 
11096 gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife 
11097 national lampoon 's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion 
11098 the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected 
11099 i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation 
11100 over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that 's got oodles of style and substance 
11101 it has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it 's over 
11102 possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it 's directed by ... neil labute 
11103 -lrb- broomfield -rrb- uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue 
11104 it 's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides 
11105 has a plot full of twists upon knots ... and a nonstop parade of mock-tarantino scuzbag types that starts out clever but veers into overkill 
11106 there 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought 
11107 this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy 
11108 a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills 
11109 -lrb- it 's -rrb- a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy 
11110 there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting 
11111 rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next 
11112 if this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook 
11113 here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get 
11114 jagger the actor is someone you want to see again 
11115 the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter 
11116 murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together 
11117 but in imax 3-d , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography 
11118 there 's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career 
11119 the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath ... 
11120 ... a roller-coaster ride of a movie 
11121 just like hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination 
11122 tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point 
11123 god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse 
11124 the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act 
11125 the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue 
11126 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense de palma creates 
11127 the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound 
11128 hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors 
11129 in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works 
11130 when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray 's game of chinese whispers with mr bean 
11131 not always too whimsical for its own good -lrb- but enough to do harm -rrb- , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs 
11132 well before it 's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels 
11133 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy 
11134 i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off 
11135 lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose 
11136 oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven 
11137 with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door 
11138 marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie 
11139 the film 's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john 
11140 the movie 's eventual success should be credited to dennis quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor 
11141 the actors do n't inhabit their roles -- they 're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes 
11142 strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery 
11143 vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship 
11144 bow 's best moments are when he 's getting busy on the basketball court because that 's when he really scores 
11145 a movie that tries to fuse the two ` woods ' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess 
11146 but that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients 
11147 who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images do n't have to add up to mesmerize you 
11148 it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling 
11149 sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution 
11150 undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters 
11151 some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future 
11152 the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap 
11153 this time out , -lrb- sade -rrb- is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested 
11154 a pleasant romantic comedy 
11155 the director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -lrb- most notably wretched sound design -rrb- 
11156 must be seen to be believed 
11157 ... a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life 
11158 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever 
11159 birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it 
11160 it 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction 
11161 it 's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene 
11162 it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning 
11163 shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity 
11164 it 's painful 
11165 chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws 
11166 the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
11167 is office work really as alienating as ` bartleby ' so effectively makes it ? 
11168 a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within 
11169 as blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , el bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance 
11170 morton is , as usual , brilliant 
11171 the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn 
11172 ... a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway 
11173 what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale -- as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters 
11174 culkin , who 's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield 
11175 for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man 's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out 
11176 falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny 
11177 it wo n't be long before you 'll spy i spy at a video store near you 
11178 oh , it 's extreme , all right 
11179 an engaging overview of johnson 's eccentric career 
11180 proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report 
11181 that is essentially what 's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point 
11182 the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design 
11183 this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring 
11184 sorry , charlie 
11185 it 's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he 's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech 
11186 in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century ... takes kurys ' career to a whole new level 
11187 the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is 
11188 the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them 
11189 ... -lrb- a -rrb- strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense 
11190 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor 
11191 another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through 
11192 nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre 
11193 led by griffin 's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material 
11194 it 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high 
11195 i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief 
11196 with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept. 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire 's bright side 
11197 the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging 
11198 the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending 
11199 girls gone wild and gone civil again 
11200 but what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
11201 he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality 
11202 the movie 's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries 
11203 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten 
11204 is n't it great ? 
11205 enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd 
11206 this is as powerful a set of evidence as you 'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives 
11207 guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things 
11208 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor 
11209 ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year 's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum 
11210 some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations 
11211 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole 
11212 human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal 
11213 does n't amount to much of anything 
11214 huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she 'll crack 
11215 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema 
11216 lead provocatuers testud and parmentier give superlative performances 
11217 apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable tv 
11218 between the drama of cube ? 
11219 while the glass slipper does n't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale 
11220 meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it 's so bad it 's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie 
11221 rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation 
11222 when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble 
11223 this overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd 
11224 having never been a huge fan of dickens ' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath 's version 
11225 it 's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone 's head 
11226 the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction 
11227 if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg 
11228 i 've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one 
11229 the problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot 
11230 it 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script 
11231 the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business 
11232 so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun 
11233 this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring 
11234 a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats 
11235 i tried to read the time on my watch 
11236 writer\/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and kate 's jealous female friends become downright despicable 
11237 cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed 
11238 the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun 
11239 i like frank the pug , though 
11240 an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma 
11241 largely a for-fans artifact 
11242 an involving true story of a chinese actor who takes up drugs and winds up in an institution -- acted mostly by the actual people involved 
11243 nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you 'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it 
11244 would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year 
11245 ... a well-observed and disturbing little movie 
11246 an incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar -lrb- and peculiarly venomous -rrb- bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy 
11247 movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation 
11248 lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i could n't help being captivated by it 
11249 the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life 
11250 it 's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie 's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia 
11251 though the film 's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare 
11252 kinnear gives a tremendous performance 
11253 perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions 
11254 dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm 
11255 ... both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat 
11256 ' 
11257 windtalkers blows this way and that , but there 's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass , true to himself 
11258 an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson 
11259 ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but do n't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here 
11260 the new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted 
11261 sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre 
11262 it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future 
11263 the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare 
11264 although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser 's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious 
11265 claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications 
11266 to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist 
11267 the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess 
11268 daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who are n't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war 
11269 it 's also the year 's sweetest movie 
11270 this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story 's a little weak 
11271 a whole lot foul , freaky and funny 
11272 there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy ... but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an iranian specialty 
11273 for me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings 
11274 a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect 
11275 and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy 
11276 lawrence preaches strictly to the converted 
11277 given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much 
11278 `` antwone fisher '' is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington 
11279 succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series 
11280 you do n't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor 's club 
11281 the film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place 
11282 if you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog 
11283 the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus 
11284 the best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now 
11285 by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what 's possible and what we might do to make it so 
11286 after making several adaptations of other writers ' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject 
11287 all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure 
11288 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones 
11289 a sly game of cat and mouse that 's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances 
11290 ... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise 
11291 what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about 
11292 i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha 
11293 unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity 
11294 the film delivers not just the full assault of reno 's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days 
11295 one groan-inducing familiarity begets another 
11296 john mctiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga 
11297 an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives 
11298 a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking 
11299 but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck 's film from coming together 
11300 too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining 
11301 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized 
11302 everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing 
11303 the best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates 
11304 a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence 
11305 we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict 
11306 one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you 're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you did n't know was being taken 
11307 i believe the message is in the messenger : the agent is a woman 
11308 mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun 
11309 but i was n't 
11310 though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance 
11311 a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker 
11312 most impressive , though , is the film 's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters ' emotional wounds 
11313 it 's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell 
11314 a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move 
11315 it 's fairly self-aware in its dumbness 
11316 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves 
11317 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film 
11318 watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good 
11319 a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them 
11320 that 's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan 's existence 
11321 there 's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that 's what makes it irresistible 
11322 a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with ... it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm 
11323 this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese 's best in more than a decade 
11324 for a good chunk of its running time , trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller 
11325 full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he 's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000 
11326 even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of todd farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship 
11327 as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness 
11328 the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women 
11329 but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked 
11330 made by jackasses for jackasses 
11331 if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna 
11332 pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick 
11333 topkapi this is not 
11334 but he somehow pulls it off 
11335 the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture 
11336 bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that 
11337 an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s 
11338 it is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish 
11339 a worthwhile way to spend two hours 
11340 illuminating if overly talky documentary 
11341 never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds 
11342 two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama 
11343 -lrb- gai -rrb- comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form 
11344 a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags 
11345 it does n't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than `` confessions of a dangerous mind 
11346 '' 
11347 filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low 
11348 then lower them a bit more 
11349 i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind 
11350 a very bad sign 
11351 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr. deeds was to that of frank capra 
11352 sometimes , that 's enough 
11353 well , it does go on forever 
11354 there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double 
11355 this is n't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it 's the cliffsnotes with pages missing 
11356 it 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old 
11357 fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water 
11358 guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens 
11359 it 's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh 
11360 there 's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes 
11361 it 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it 
11362 `` its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right 
11363 '' 
11364 an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind 
11365 it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't 
11366 john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie 
11367 tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable 
11368 this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director 
11369 a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely can not last 
11370 the film 's center will not hold 
11371 it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle 
11372 literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes 
11373 it 's also stupider 
11374 none of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter 
11375 sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film 
11376 a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror 
11377 although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours 
11378 ` abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' ... you should definitely let dante 's gloomy words be your guide 
11379 he can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he 'll get the girl 
11380 so i just did 
11381 an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent 
11382 there 's not enough to sustain the comedy 
11383 fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters 
11384 the film is really not so much bad as bland 
11385 schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler 's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad 
11386 a vivid cinematic portrait 
11387 it 's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro 
11388 the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups 
11389 alex nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl 
11390 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object 
11391 ... tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope 
11392 it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment 
11393 frenetic but not really funny 
11394 sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open 
11395 it 's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really does n't fit the part 
11396 ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact amber is such a joke 
11397 this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it 's hard to know what to praise first 
11398 apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths 
11399 andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance 
11400 -lrb- anderson -rrb- uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense 
11401 this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border 
11402 this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience 
11403 dazzling and sugar-sweet , a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver 
11404 from the big giant titles of the opening credits to elmer bernstein 's perfectly melodic score , haynes gets just about everything right 
11405 watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives 
11406 as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing 
11407 working from elliott 's memoir , rohmer fashions the sort of delicate , articulate character - and - relationship study he 's favored for decades 
11408 watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both 
11409 intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area 
11410 -lrb- a -rrb- rare , beautiful film 
11411 ... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs 
11412 suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum 
11413 while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there 's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls ca n't swim 
11414 opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` glory : a soldier 's story 
11415 '' 
11416 ... an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal 's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs 
11417 it 's -lrb- ricci 's -rrb- best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world 's misery with blind good will 
11418 is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco 's last album ? 
11419 this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age 
11420 it tells more than it shows 
11421 evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children -- and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good 
11422 director clare kilner 's debut is never as daft as it should have been 
11423 as expected , sayles ' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances 
11424 ... the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes `` what time is it there ? '' 
11425 too bad the former murphy brown does n't pop reese back 
11426 it 's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth 
11427 taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore 
11428 george clooney proves he 's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he 's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind 
11429 ... mesmerizing , an eye-opening tour of modern beijing culture in a journey of rebellion , retreat into oblivion and return 
11430 the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing 
11431 a potent allegorical love story 
11432 provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz 
11433 it 's endearing to hear madame d. refer to her husband as ` jackie ' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer 
11434 so few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler 
11435 needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey 
11436 calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls 
11437 overly stylized with lots of flash black - & - white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , -lrb- it 's -rrb- at its worst when it 's actually inside the ring 
11438 it is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some 
11439 it 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss 
11440 the appearance of treebeard and gollum 's expanded role will either have you loving what you 're seeing , or rolling your eyes 
11441 now , if it only had a brain 
11442 a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives 
11443 like a south-of-the-border melrose place 
11444 it 's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements 
11445 this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie 
11446 fans of behan 's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy 
11447 everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse 
11448 a startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society 
11449 although it 's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do 
11450 watching haneke 's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment 
11451 once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care 
11452 but like bruce springsteen 's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins 
11453 stay clear of reminding yourself that it 's a `` true story '' and you 're likely to have one helluva time at the movies 
11454 so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program 
11455 lends itself to the narcotizing bland -lrb- sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie -rrb- machinations of the biennial disney boy movie 
11456 in the process , they demonstrate that there 's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema 
11457 though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium 
11458 what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy 
11459 it 's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice 
11460 like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them 
11461 a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love 
11462 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time 
11463 a soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie 
11464 though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial 
11465 only two words will tell you what you know when deciding to see it : anthony 
11466 there 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent 
11467 achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium 
11468 if you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , wasabi is a good place to start 
11469 but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour 
11470 ... always remains movingly genuine 
11471 maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` full frontal '' seems , well , contrived 
11472 the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels 
11473 a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home 
11474 schindler 's list it ai n't 
11475 a compelling portrait of moral emptiness 
11476 let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested 
11477 -lrb- a -rrb- superbly controlled , passionate adaptation of graham greene 's 1955 novel 
11478 a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film 
11479 no , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else 
11480 a comic gem with some serious sparkles 
11481 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats 
11482 the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes 
11483 a bravura exercise in emptiness 
11484 this concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where its intended under-12 audience is concerned 
11485 this one 's weaker than most 
11486 a lighthearted , feel-good film that embraces the time-honored truth that the most powerful thing in life is love 
11487 the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence 
11488 i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations 
11489 a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin 's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison 
11490 rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual 
11491 an offbeat , sometimes gross and surprisingly appealing animated film about the true meaning of the holidays 
11492 the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie 
11493 another great ` what you do n't see ' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances 
11494 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce 
11495 feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers 
11496 going to the website may be just as fun -lrb- and scary -rrb- as going to the film 
11497 is this progress ? 
11498 for a shoot - 'em - up , ballistic is oddly lifeless 
11499 one of the best of the year 
11500 there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected -lrb- and gentle -rrb- way 
11501 credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter 
11502 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination 
11503 bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences 
11504 a solidly seaworthy chiller 
11505 high on melodrama 
11506 when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever 
11507 if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead 
11508 still , i thought it could have been more 
11509 a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard 's pyromania 
11510 though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them 
11511 like mike does n't win any points for originality 
11512 ms. fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn 
11513 the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense 
11514 legendary irish writer brendan behan 's memoir , borstal boy , has been given a loving screen transferral 
11515 at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it 's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do 
11516 it 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold 
11517 it 's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the marks family 
11518 it uses an old-time formula , it 's not terribly original and it 's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding 
11519 if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones ' diary or high fidelity , then you wo n't want to miss about a boy 
11520 katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself 
11521 -lrb- it 's -rrb- difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view 
11522 a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant ` co-stars 
11523 ' 
11524 but as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess 
11525 what 's next ? 
11526 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music 
11527 showtime is closer to slowtime 
11528 thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ... takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda 
11529 the am-radio soundtrack and game cast -- tierney and the inimitable walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit 
11530 tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy 
11531 britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway 
11532 has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags 
11533 an enchanting spectacular for potter fans anxious to ride the hogwarts express toward a new year of magic and mischief 
11534 the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions 
11535 it 's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests 
11536 a real clunker 
11537 the film seems a dead weight 
11538 the voices are fine as well 
11539 it turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting 
11540 an awkward and indigestible movie 
11541 showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome 
11542 a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women 
11543 but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored 
11544 yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
11545 the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it does n't go too much further 
11546 as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart 
11547 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly -lrb- like one of hubert 's punches -rrb- , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn 
11548 despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another 
11549 the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes 
11550 even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat 
11551 go see it and enjoy 
11552 her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant 
11553 chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution 
11554 obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script 
11555 a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face 
11556 the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama 
11557 stevenson 's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination 
11558 on its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist byatt 
11559 pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs 
11560 this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man 
11561 a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions 
11562 while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production 
11563 you bet 
11564 any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment 
11565 what parents will suspect is that they 're watching a 76-minute commercial 
11566 do n't let your festive spirit go this far 
11567 eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work 
11568 a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail 
11569 -lrb- nelson 's -rrb- movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes 
11570 spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects 
11571 a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick 
11572 an epic of grandeur and scale that 's been decades gone from the popcorn pushing sound stages of hollywood 
11573 occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going 
11574 preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure 
11575 it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days 
11576 the saturation bombing of reggio 's images and glass ' evocative music ... ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning 
11577 as a witness to several greek-american weddings -- but , happily , a victim of none -- i can testify to the comparative accuracy of ms. vardalos ' memories and insights 
11578 a wonderful character-based comedy 
11579 sure , it 's more of the same , but as the film proves , that 's not always a bad thing 
11580 the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america 
11581 k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich 
11582 do n't waste your money 
11583 dreary , highly annoying ... ` some body ' will appeal to no one 
11584 just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos 
11585 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling -- but unquestionably alive 
11586 punish the vehicle to adore the star 
11587 reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it 's still pretty tasty 
11588 thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun 
11589 it 's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave 
11590 the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden 
11591 the movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens 
11592 an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece 
11593 a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco 's most vital , if least widely recognized , creative fountainheads 
11594 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer\/director\/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry 
11595 i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic 
11596 -lrb- sen 's -rrb- soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions 
11597 the stories here suffer from the chosen format 
11598 ... a cute and sometimes side-splittingly funny blend of legally blonde and drop dead gorgeous , starring piper perabo in what could be her breakthrough role 
11599 offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication 
11600 a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances 
11601 however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release 
11602 there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters 
11603 at the bottom rung of the series ' entries 
11604 whatever eyre 's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place 
11605 the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist 
11606 despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like -lrb- seinfeld 's -rrb- revered tv show , about pretty much nothing 
11607 mr. parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom 
11608 the transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb 
11609 ... too dull to enjoy 
11610 this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters 
11611 this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack 
11612 characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better 
11613 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives 
11614 ... -lrb- like -rrb- channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie 
11615 i hated every minute of it 
11616 this is a very fine movie -- go see it 
11617 this is n't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend 
11618 it 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning 
11619 a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion 
11620 a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 -lrb- k -rrb- statement 
11621 godawful boring slug of a movie 
11622 provide -lrb- s -rrb- nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue 
11623 but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance 
11624 once you get into its rhythm ... the movie becomes a heady experience 
11625 it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times 
11626 just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else 
11627 hayek is stunning as frida and ... a star-making project 
11628 about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie 
11629 a quietly reflective and melancholy new zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl 's life 
11630 an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction 
11631 benefits from a strong performance from zhao , but it 's dong jie 's face you remember at the end 
11632 too simple for its own good 
11633 it 's a worthwhile tutorial in quantum physics and slash-dash 
11634 we 've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time 
11635 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan 's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year 
11636 star wars is back in a major way 
11637 unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such ` have-yourself-a-happy-little-holocaust ' movies as life is beautiful and jakob the liar , the grey zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in auschwitz 
11638 director nalin pan does n't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other 
11639 the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky 
11640 most of the action setups are incoherent 
11641 compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady 
11642 despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america 's sweetheart 
11643 if you 're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years wo n't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open 
11644 in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel 
11645 the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound 
11646 winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults 
11647 an instant candidate for worst movie of the year 
11648 anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through 
11649 a highly intriguing thriller , coupled with some ingenious plot devices and some lavishly built settings 
11650 director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth 
11651 even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate 
11652 good actress 
11653 an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences 
11654 i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that 's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing 
11655 has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller 
11656 long after you leave justine , you 'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean 
11657 on the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... it 's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there 
11658 if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil 
11659 an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding 
11660 bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description 
11661 the parts are better than the whole -lrb- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york -rrb- 
11662 however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson 's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts 
11663 a classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done 
11664 it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg 's film is that it truly is romance 
11665 what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama 
11666 a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage 
11667 instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy 
11668 like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh 
11669 with danilo donati 's witty designs and dante spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role 
11670 nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives hollywood 
11671 i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough 
11672 i loved looking at this movie 
11673 binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles 
11674 doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie 's spycraft and uses damon 's ability to be focused and sincere 
11675 the film 's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard ... 
11676 i wish i could say `` thank god it 's friday '' , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over 
11677 lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist 
11678 occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new 
11679 `` men in black ii , '' has all the earmarks of a sequel 
11680 this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio 's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed 
11681 the cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming 
11682 yeah , these flicks are just that damn good 
11683 a worthy entry into a very difficult genre 
11684 there 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version 
11685 soul is what 's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself 
11686 this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob 's excellent adventure seem understated 
11687 his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos 
11688 feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network 
11689 majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast 
11690 the kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you 
11691 an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent 
11692 the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations 
11693 still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at ` face value ' to recommend to anyone looking for something different 
11694 woo 's fights have a distinct flair 
11695 the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team 
11696 ... has virtually no script at all ... 
11697 if it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after , there 's no better film than half past dead 
11698 we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting 
11699 flawed but worthy look at life in u.s. relocation camps 
11700 why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me 
11701 gloriously goofy -lrb- and gory -rrb- midnight movie stuff 
11702 the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound 
11703 the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances 
11704 at its best , the good girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery ... 
11705 nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations ... 
11706 throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another 
11707 although life or something like it is very much in the mold of feel-good movies , the cast and director stephen herek 's polished direction pour delightfully piquant wine from aged bottles 
11708 at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers 
11709 the story ... is moldy and obvious 
11710 scotland , pa. is a strangely drab romp 
11711 better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine 
11712 ... one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers i 've seen in quite a long time 
11713 denzel washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony 
11714 despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum 
11715 she must have a very strong back 
11716 ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much 
11717 we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood could n't possibly fictionalize and be believed 
11718 the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured -lrb- and torturing -rrb- artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on 
11719 an utterly compelling ` who wrote it ' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question 
11720 this is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the saturday matinee , and it still is 
11721 a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas 
11722 not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed 
11723 -lrb- drumline -rrb- is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it does n't do 
11724 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect 
11725 despite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it 
11726 noyce 's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective 
11727 the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere 
11728 despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles 
11729 succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies 
11730 i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory 
11731 watching beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it 
11732 it does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the russos ' next offering 
11733 bears is bad 
11734 any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes 
11735 a film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities 
11736 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth 
11737 i just did n't care as much for the story 
11738 very solid , very watchable first feature for director peter sheridan 
11739 while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling 
11740 the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes 
11741 pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film 
11742 if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he 'd have them mate 
11743 still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental 
11744 if the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care 
11745 consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept 
11746 leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago 
11747 sam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man 's ruin may be another 's fortune 
11748 a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through 
11749 a taut , intelligent psychological drama 
11750 barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful 
11751 it settles for being merely grim 
11752 a work of astonishing delicacy and force 
11753 dark and disturbing , but also surprisingly funny 
11754 a loving little film of considerable appeal 
11755 watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it 
11756 a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments 
11757 the problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball 
11758 can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going 
11759 parker holds true to wilde 's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness 
11760 these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future 
11761 if somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus ' son , they 'd come up with something like bart freundlich 's world traveler 
11762 new best friend should n't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video 
11763 as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it does n't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions 
11764 i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness 
11765 -lrb- director peter -rrb- jackson and his crew have so steeped themselves in the majesty of tolkien 's writing that every frame produces new joys , whether you 're a fan of the books or not 
11766 ... ambition is in short supply in the cinema , and egoyan tackles his themes and explores his characters ' crises with seriousness and compassion 
11767 it does n't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel 
11768 baran is n't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it 's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations 
11769 what is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form 
11770 -lrb- two -rrb- fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now 
11771 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes 
11772 their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i 'd hoped the movie would avoid 
11773 the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace 
11774 it 's still worth a look 
11775 jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips 
11776 it 's a count for our times 
11777 chao was chen kaige 's assistant for years in china 
11778 never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful 
11779 although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke 
11780 a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors 
11781 intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed 
11782 too close to phantom menace for comfort 
11783 without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions 
11784 somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g.i. jane 
11785 marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film 
11786 reinforces the talents of screenwriter charlie kaufman , creator of adaptation and being john malkovich 
11787 the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off 
11788 despite its title , amy 's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one 
11789 more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling 
11790 a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect 
11791 the story 's so preposterous that i did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved 
11792 its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
11793 and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
11794 watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay 's sappier elements ... and sustains off the hook 's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer 
11795 ice cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance ... 
11796 all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull 
11797 whether -lrb- binoche and magimel -rrb- are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria 
11798 tom green just gives them a bad odor 
11799 each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception 
11800 it 's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world 
11801 it has fun being grown up 
11802 this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on 
11803 you 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous 
11804 children may not understand everything that happens -- i 'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted 
11805 a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan 's heroes star bob crane 
11806 this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another 
11807 the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously 
11808 the long-range appeal of `` minority report '' should transcend any awards it bags 
11809 it 's haunting 
11810 the film starts out as competent but unremarkable ... and gradually grows into something of considerable power 
11811 ihops do n't pile on this much syrup 
11812 a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place 
11813 lucas , take notes 
11814 the unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right 
11815 you would n't call the good girl a date movie -lrb- an anti-date movie is more like it -rrb- , but when it 's good , it 's good and horrid 
11816 this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few 
11817 sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna does n't suck as an actress 
11818 the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome 
11819 much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie 
11820 disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material 
11821 flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams 
11822 unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it 
11823 i 'm afraid you wo n't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief 
11824 every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet 
11825 the movie gets muted and routine 
11826 -lrb- morgan -rrb- , judd and franklin ca n't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism
