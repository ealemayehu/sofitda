9640 1 no movement , no yuks , not much of anything 
9641 0 a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore 's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée 
9642 2 ` how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? ' 
9643 2 so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something 
9644 0 gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up 
9645 0 we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas 
9646 4 this is one of polanski 's best films 
9647 3 take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema 
9648 1 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes `` never again '' worthwhile , but -lrb- writer\/director -rrb- schaeffer should follow his titular advice 
9649 3 the movie exists for its soccer action and its fine acting 
9650 1 arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces 
9651 2 a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided 
9652 0 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -lrb- literally -rrb- 
9653 3 jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot 
9654 1 even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame 
9655 1 oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough 
9656 4 though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes 
9657 0 when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign 
9658 2 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot ... 
9659 4 the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air 
9660 3 if your senses have n't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you 're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket 
9661 0 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes 
9662 1 as conceived by mr. schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell 
9663 1 those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida 
9664 3 most new movies have a bright sheen 
9665 1 but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing 
9666 3 steve irwin 's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume 
9667 2 d.j. qualls as indiana jones ? 
9668 2 it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america 's most oppressive regimes 
9669 3 nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition 
9670 0 the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave 
9671 1 culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character 
9672 2 sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well 
9673 1 the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit 
9674 3 not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it 's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it 
9675 1 the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover 
9676 4 it 's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock , garry shandling and colin quinn 
9677 3 finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less 
9678 1 the low-budget full frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother 
9679 4 exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven ... -lrb- the film -rrb- addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce 
9680 3 an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the ` truth ' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to 
9681 4 as a singular character study , it 's perfect 
9682 3 haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration 
9683 3 an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment 
9684 4 all the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , all or nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit 
9685 3 a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe ... the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history 
9686 2 is it a total success ? 
9687 1 i do n't have an i am sam clue 
9688 3 zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it 's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones 
9689 3 the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they 'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor 
9690 2 the new guy is one of them 
9691 1 the thrill is -lrb- long -rrb- gone 
9692 4 much monkeyfun for all 
9693 0 a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle 
9694 2 this is really just another genre picture 
9695 4 much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride 
9696 3 for the first time in several years , mr. allen has surpassed himself with the magic he 's spun with the hollywood empress of ms. leoni 's ellie 
9697 3 one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce 
9698 1 as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them 
9699 3 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity 
9700 1 with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv 's defunct cleopatra 2525 
9701 4 this is simply the most fun you 'll ever have with a documentary ! 
9702 4 it represents better-than-average movie-making that does n't demand a dumb , distracted audience 
9703 0 ... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity 
9704 1 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just does n't make the cut 
9705 4 the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays 
9706 0 how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ? 
9707 3 for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way 
9708 1 as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness 
9709 1 sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle 
9710 2 ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family 's custom-made christmas card 
9711 4 a dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble 
9712 1 the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy 
9713 1 instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre 
9714 3 the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll 
9715 3 it is ridiculous , of course ... but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness 
9716 4 everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids 
9717 2 big deal ! 
9718 4 tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure 
9719 0 a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull 
9720 0 the cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters 
9721 2 a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series 
9722 3 a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at 
9723 2 dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick 
9724 3 a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy 
9725 1 not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' i once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad 
9726 1 a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek 
9727 3 it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism 
9728 2 the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that 's rare in film today , but be warned : it 's a slow slog to get there 
9729 3 -lrb- schweiger is -rrb- talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists 
9730 1 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer 
9731 4 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 
9732 1 for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero 
9733 3 this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap 
9734 1 now it 's just tired 
9735 1 not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen 
9736 0 it 's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- i 'm prepared to call it a draw 
9737 1 about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through 
9738 1 the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark 
9739 3 as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten 
9740 3 writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear 
9741 1 truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before 
9742 1 george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please 
9743 2 sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary 
9744 0 all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility 
9745 0 it 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time 
9746 3 the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience 
9747 2 too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience 
9748 4 goyer 's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast 
9749 3 reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world 's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes 
9750 0 abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists 
9751 3 if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right 
9752 3 scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism 
9753 1 director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama 
9754 0 without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor 's home videos 
9755 1 a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favour the audience 
9756 0 de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork 
9757 3 an intelligent fiction about learning through cultural clash 
9758 4 greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill 
9759 2 you wo n't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who 's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all 
9760 1 there 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about 
9761 4 at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance 
9762 3 sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling 
9763 1 enough similarities to gymkata and howie long 's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs 
9764 4 despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show ... represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there 's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it 
9765 3 here 's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you 
9766 3 a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship 
9767 1 if i spy were funny -lrb- enough -rrb- or exciting -lrb- enough -rrb- then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public 
9768 1 a great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell does n't even have a great ending 
9769 1 demands too much of most viewers 
9770 4 rare is the ` urban comedy ' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie 
9771 1 its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer 
9772 4 a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish 
9773 1 arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie 
9774 1 the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable 
9775 2 a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless 
9776 3 while not as aggressively impressive as its american counterpart , `` in the bedroom , '' moretti 's film makes its own , quieter observations 
9777 2 asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy 
9778 2 aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend 
9779 1 imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno 
9780 3 a refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale 
9781 2 the marquis de sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be 
9782 2 somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional 
9783 2 ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy 's intrepid hero ? 
9784 4 the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer 
9785 2 the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us 
9786 3 u.s. audiences may find -lrb- attal and gainsbourg 's -rrb- unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what hollywood typically concocts 
9787 3 escapism in its purest form 
9788 4 the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed 
9789 3 works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren 
9790 1 sucking all the ` classic ' out of robert louis stevenson 's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst ... 
9791 1 audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film 's tart , sugar-free wit 
9792 3 despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy 
9793 0 nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them 
9794 3 it 's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director 's previous full frontal 
9795 1 even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad 
9796 0 the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense 
9797 0 the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear 
9798 1 the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of 
9799 4 it 's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental 
9800 1 it 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too 
9801 3 it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding 
9802 2 a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency 
9803 1 barely goes beyond comic book status 
9804 3 even if you ca n't pronounce `` gyro '' correctly , you 'll appreciate much of vardalos ' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries 
9805 1 borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu 
9806 2 fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored 
9807 2 it wo n't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking 
9808 3 once again , director jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action\/effects on the spectacular scale 
9809 1 as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys ' novel `` the death of napoleon '' and directed by alan taylor , napoleon 's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn 
9810 3 not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies 
9811 1 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original 
9812 3 a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy 
9813 1 a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans 
9814 3 sits uneasily as a horror picture ... but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family 
9815 0 lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel 
9816 4 an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video 
9817 1 it 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed 
9818 1 the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough 
9819 0 ridiculous 
9820 1 no. 
9821 4 if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker 's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life 's urgent questions 
9822 2 if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta 
9823 1 a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been 
9824 0 a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not 
9825 3 and in this regard , on guard delivers 
9826 4 something the true film buff will enjoy 
9827 1 the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached 
9828 3 a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing 
9829 2 the actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them 
9830 0 the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants ' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed 
9831 3 it 's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it 's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep 
9832 4 the result is something quite fresh and delightful 
9833 4 if you love motown music , you 'll love this documentary 
9834 4 it 's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be 
9835 3 you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they 're each interesting 
9836 3 -lrb- wendigo is -rrb- why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind 
9837 3 lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically 
9838 3 a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty 
9839 1 for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry 
9840 0 spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama 
9841 4 frida 's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it 's among the most breathtakingly designed films i 've ever seen 
9842 1 i hate this movie 
9843 1 not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it 's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies 
9844 4 the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity 
9845 4 like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel 
9846 3 city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes 
9847 3 it 's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary ... 
9848 3 this insightful , oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance 
9849 1 this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay 
9850 0 too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes 
9851 4 so young , so smart , such talent , such a wise \*\*\* 
9852 2 only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry 
9853 4 resourceful and ingenious entertainment 
9854 0 ` enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable 
9855 4 rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic 
9856 3 this romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime england , and ably captures the speech patterns , moral codes and ideals of the 1940s 
9857 1 reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film 
9858 4 a masterpiece four years in the making 
9859 2 polished korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as hollywood action epics 
9860 0 `` an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters '' 
9861 3 in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns 
9862 0 do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman does n't work ? 
9863 0 this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he 's the most obvious one 
9864 4 the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry 
9865 2 the movie is n't always easy to look at 
9866 4 a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness 
9867 1 the movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension 
9868 3 digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world 
9869 2 it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy 
9870 4 impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises 
9871 0 the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive 
9872 4 her delivery and timing are flawless 
9873 0 if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title 
9874 4 almost every scene in this film is a gem that could stand alone , a perfectly realized observation of mood , behavior and intent 
9875 1 when it 's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper 
9876 0 like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause 
9877 1 boring we did n't 
9878 3 a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages 
9879 1 undercover brother does n't go far enough 
9880 1 moot point 
9881 0 let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home 
9882 3 as green-guts monster movies go , it 's a beaut 
9883 3 elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone 
9884 4 the movie is full of fine performances , led by josef bierbichler as brecht and monica bleibtreu as helene weigel , his wife 
9885 3 münch 's genuine insight makes the film 's occasional overindulgence forgivable 
9886 0 the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment 
9887 3 all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure 
9888 2 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut 
9889 1 the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script 
9890 1 beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at 
9891 0 this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through 
9892 3 for the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride 
9893 2 ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life 's stasis 
9894 2 no question 
9895 0 neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn 
9896 1 a compendium of solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes 
9897 0 all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit 
9898 4 biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame 
9899 1 anyone who can count to five -lrb- the film 's target market ? -rrb- 
9900 1 warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard 
9901 4 an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick 
9902 4 emerges as something rare , an issue movie that 's so honest and keenly observed that it does n't feel like one 
9903 2 cuts right through the b.s. giving a big middle-fingered `` shut up '' to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another 
9904 4 sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film 
9905 3 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic 
9906 1 thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking 
9907 0 it is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling -lrb- and an uneasy alliance , at that -rrb- 
9908 1 unfortunately , as a writer , mr. montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor 
9909 1 a long-winded , predictable scenario 
9910 4 invincible is a wonderful movie 
9911 3 earns its laughs from stock redneck ` types ' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing 
9912 4 a smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy 
9913 3 a moody horror\/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director 's well-known narrative gamesmanship 
9914 0 a dreadful live-action movie 
9915 4 s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results 
9916 3 for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies 
9917 3 though the controversial korean filmmaker 's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding 
9918 4 well worth the time 
9919 1 they felt like the same movie to me 
9920 3 witty , touching and well paced 
9921 1 i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr. holland 's class for the music , or to robin williams 's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve 
9922 3 this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998 's whatever 
9923 1 absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way 
9924 4 good movie 
9925 2 lilia 's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth 
9926 4 i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie -- for its historical significance alone 
9927 0 it 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school 
9928 4 but what spectacular sizzle it is ! 
9929 2 enduring love but exhausting cinema 
9930 3 stephen earnhart 's homespun documentary mule skinner blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens 
9931 3 it 's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its `` men in a sardine can '' warped logic 
9932 3 a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well 
9933 1 taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise 
9934 2 ... understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation 
9935 0 when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music 
9936 2 so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check 
9937 4 one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade 
9938 0 the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness 
9939 3 an amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail 
9940 3 time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets 
9941 4 a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth 
9942 1 ... the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats 
9943 4 these are lives worth watching , paths worth following 
9944 1 static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! 
9945 0 this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself 
9946 2 we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again 
9947 4 the wwii drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear 
9948 4 a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world 
9949 1 ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` what 's the point ? ' 
9950 4 the best movie of its kind since ` brazil ' 
9951 2 as a director , mr. ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects 
9952 2 the disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on 
9953 4 davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces 
9954 3 it might be tempting to regard mr. andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr. earnhart 's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists 
9955 1 sadly , hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks 
9956 2 this one does 
9957 0 so what is the point ? 
9958 1 the issue of faith is not explored very deeply 
9959 2 everything that 's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television 
9960 4 my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie 
9961 3 director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building 
9962 1 i kept thinking over and over again , ' i should be enjoying this ' 
9963 2 it 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie 
9964 0 do n't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches ... 
9965 1 i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war ... it 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink 
9966 4 the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension 
9967 3 an eccentric little comic\/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality 
9968 2 behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one ca n't help but think he 'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art 
9969 3 my goodness , queen latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts 
9970 2 often moving and explores the discomfort inherent in the contacts between the american ` hosts ' and their ` guests ' 
9971 2 anthony hopkins ? 
9972 1 egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you 'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious 
9973 4 will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them 
9974 1 a chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags 
9975 1 the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction 
9976 4 this is one for the ages 
9977 3 the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense 
9978 2 bennett 's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that 's tough to shake 
9979 2 every so often a movie comes along that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it 
9980 4 a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material 
9981 3 the talents of the actors helps `` moonlight mile '' rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing 
9982 0 as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame 
9983 2 ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers 
9984 0 all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable 
9985 2 i wonder why 
9986 3 day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs 
9987 1 the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes 
9988 1 quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
9989 2 karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat 
9990 2 it is nature against progress 
9991 1 by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious 
9992 0 the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll 
9993 4 this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences 
9994 3 most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness 
9995 3 makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran 's borderlands 
9996 1 despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei 's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy 
9997 4 well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull 
9998 3 this is n't a narrative film -- i do n't know if it 's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i 'm sure some will try -- but it 's as close as anyone has dared to come 
9999 3 christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr. feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic 
10000 2 heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension 
10001 3 a clever blend of fact and fiction 
10002 2 all ms. jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters 
10003 1 there 's plenty of style in guillermo del toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes 
10004 1 the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi 
10005 2 a sudsy cautionary tale 
10006 3 the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers 
10007 1 it 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish 
10008 1 based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness 
10009 3 pray 's film works well and will appeal even to those who are n't too familiar with turntablism 
10010 2 those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find what time is it there ? 
10011 0 it 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff 
10012 2 it 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story 
10013 3 to the film 's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment 
10014 1 why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson ... and puke up something like rose red ? 
10015 3 an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood 
10016 3 though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work 
10017 1 well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons 
10018 1 outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time 
10019 2 sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth 
10020 4 there 's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking 
10021 4 a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term 
10022 4 this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema 's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable 
10023 4 newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg 
10024 3 vividly conveys both the pitfalls and the pleasures of over-the-top love 
10025 0 formula 51 is so trite that even yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor 
10026 3 when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily 
10027 0 flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey 
10028 0 too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette 
10029 1 overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek 's novel by some way 
10030 3 an incredibly low-rent danish film , it brings a group of people together in a sweet and charming way , if a little convenient 
10031 1 the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing 
10032 4 occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almodóvar style 
10033 1 high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character 
10034 3 pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura 
10035 1 a mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world 
10036 4 a movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults , as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats 
10037 4 -lrb- an -rrb- hilarious romantic comedy 
10038 3 both deeply weird and charmingly dear 
10039 1 the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch 
10040 4 the movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music 
10041 3 what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender 
10042 4 a hip ride into hyper-time , clockstoppers is a lively and enjoyable adventure for all ages at any time 
10043 1 it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise 
10044 3 occasionally melodramatic , it 's also extremely effective 
10045 1 a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more 
10046 1 it 's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness 
10047 4 an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street 
10048 1 rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down 
10049 4 the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year 
10050 0 it 's hard not to feel you 've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story 
10051 4 it 's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood 
10052 1 where last time jokes flowed out of cho 's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines 
10053 4 -lrb- but it 's -rrb- worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser 
10054 2 the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins 
10055 3 there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital 
10056 2 though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters 
10057 0 philip k. dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach 
10058 1 its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper 
10059 1 fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots 
10060 1 theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n't learn at the center of a kids ' story ? 
10061 4 the movie 's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow 
10062 1 it might as well have been problem child iv 
10063 0 feels like one of those contrived , only-in - hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk 
10064 3 good ol' urban legend stuff 
10065 4 the film 's greatest asset is how much it 's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture 
10066 1 home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do 
10067 2 ... a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original 
10068 4 if it 's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that 
10069 4 one of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind 
10070 1 sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece 
10071 3 painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year 's most accomplished and riveting film performances 
10072 0 do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor 
10073 3 he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works 
10074 1 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer 
10075 1 like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it 
10076 2 kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth -lrb- mojo -rrb- that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world 
10077 0 it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
10078 1 ... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world 
10079 3 while surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing 
10080 4 an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years 
10081 1 begins as a promising meditation on one of america 's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt 
10082 3 a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it 
10083 4 -lrb- howard -rrb- so good as leon barlow ... that he hardly seems to be acting 
10084 3 the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology 
10085 0 but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing 
10086 3 the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by 
10087 1 though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention 
10088 4 the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you ca n't wait to see what they do next 
10089 1 reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad 
10090 2 you 've already seen heartbreak if you 've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard 
10091 3 -lrb- fessenden -rrb- is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills 
10092 3 if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of `` the isle '' you 'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else 
10093 2 the plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality 
10094 3 jacquot 's tosca is a treat 
10095 0 you 're better off staying home and watching the x-files 
10096 4 the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes 
10097 0 the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense 
10098 4 divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it 's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances 
10099 2 the movie sticks much closer to hornby 's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did 
10100 1 the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one 
10101 4 the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts 
10102 3 but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds 
10103 0 the ending is a cop-out 
10104 1 the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket -lrb- second prize , of course , two free tickets -rrb- to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie 
10105 1 no , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences 
10106 1 but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person 
10107 0 bullock 's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film 
10108 1 say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue 
10109 1 all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click 
10110 2 you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes 
10111 0 proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie 
10112 4 workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies 
10113 1 this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone 's career 
10114 3 like the film 's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early - '80s suburbia , it 's significant without being overstated 
10115 1 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license 
10116 3 elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it 's therapeutic to laugh along with them 
10117 1 ... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film 
10118 0 a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk 'n' slash 
10119 2 take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo 's cool jackets 
10120 4 a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters 
10121 4 hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love 
10122 2 insomnia is involving 
10123 1 the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion 
10124 0 just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story 
10125 3 not a bad journey at all 
10126 3 has a shambling charm ... a cheerfully inconsequential diversion 
10127 2 passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless 
10128 1 the film 's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen 
10129 1 collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end 
10130 1 even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for disney 
10131 4 bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that does n't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it 
10132 2 although the editing might have been tighter , hush ! 
10133 2 it 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable 
10134 0 the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel 
10135 2 you could say that it 's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people would n't , but one thing you could n't say is that alias betty is predictable 
10136 4 hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic 
10137 3 it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come 
10138 1 a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man 
10139 4 a comprehensive and provocative film -- one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience 
10140 1 despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style 
10141 1 the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh does n't always improve the over-the-top mix 
10142 3 this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire 
10143 2 ` charly ' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy ... 
10144 1 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola 's inadequate performance 
10145 1 the performances are so leaden , michael rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud 
10146 4 a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film 
10147 1 the movie bounces all over the map 
10148 2 if there 's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr. demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a. addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic 
10149 2 there 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong 
10150 1 a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality 
10151 4 it 's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it 's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit 
10152 4 it 's as close as we 'll ever come to looking through a photographer 's viewfinder as he works 
10153 4 the film is all a little lit crit 101 , but it 's extremely well played and often very funny 
10154 2 it 's a trifle 
10155 4 de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli 
10156 3 funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , `` a city where people still read '' 
10157 0 too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through 
10158 1 the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low 
10159 4 fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn 
10160 1 a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan 
10161 2 disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids ' books to the screen ... tuck everlasting is a little of both 
10162 1 though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following 
10163 0 this idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture 
10164 1 little more than a frothy vanity project 
10165 0 a depressing confirmation of everything those of us who do n't object to the description `` unelected '' have suspected all along : george w. bush is an incurious , uncharismatic , overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide 
10166 4 an enchanting film that presents an audacious tour of the past and takes within its warm embrace the bounties of cultural artifacts inside st. petersburg 's hermitage museum 
10167 3 the new guy does have a heart 
10168 1 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice 's complex akasha into a cartoon monster 
10169 3 nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity ... 
10170 4 few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness 
10171 1 i did n't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood 
10172 1 the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them 
10173 0 if you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere 
10174 0 the movie makes absolutely no sense 
10175 3 it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya 
10176 3 edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery 
10177 2 mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty 
10178 4 this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family 
10179 1 almost everything else is wan 
10180 4 as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , ` lovely ! 
10181 4 it never fails to engage us 
10182 2 it is now 
10183 4 only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee 's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents 
10184 2 or tom green as han solo ? 
10185 2 it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three 's company-style laugh track 
10186 0 shadyac shoots his film like an m. night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail 's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension 
10187 4 waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality 
10188 4 i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible 
10189 0 the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter 
10190 1 no more 
10191 1 -lrb- newton -rrb- wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality 
10192 1 i did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot 
10193 2 purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u.s. foreign policy has played in the rise of castro 
10194 2 a mild , reluctant , thumbs down 
10195 3 a tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man 's tortured soul 
10196 3 an original gem about an obsession with time 
10197 1 she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs 
10198 1 none of this violates the letter of behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor 
10199 2 tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool 
10200 3 a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance 
10201 3 this is art paying homage to art 
10202 3 happily for mr. chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match 
10203 4 makes s&m seem very romantic , and maggie gyllenhaal is a delight 
10204 1 like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike 
10205 2 how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us 
10206 2 despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is amy 's self-absorbed personality -- amy 's o 's honesty will win you over 
10207 4 it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion 
10208 1 in the second half of the film , frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis 
10209 4 the year 's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way 
10210 2 andersson creates a world that 's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad 
10211 4 an intelligent , moving and invigorating film 
10212 4 daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget 
10213 4 ... as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the star wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement 
10214 3 never -lrb- sinks -rrb- into exploitation 
10215 1 leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness 
10216 1 the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct 
10217 4 a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience 
10218 3 it 's hard not to be seduced by -lrb- witherspoon 's -rrb- charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max 
10219 1 glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism 
10220 4 with the film 's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved 
10221 0 you 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot 
10222 3 foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling 
10223 3 it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile 
10224 0 fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense 
10225 2 ... has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they 're ghosts imagining themselves as alive 
10226 3 tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth 
10227 4 this is carion 's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach 
10228 4 an elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller 
10229 1 stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd 
10230 2 the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece 
10231 1 hey , who else needs a shower ? 
10232 1 but even a hero can stumble sometimes 
10233 1 the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy 
10234 3 moore 's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995 's safe 
10235 0 not even the hanson brothers can save it 
10236 3 a picture that extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky , spirited fashion 
10237 3 too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it 's not a total loss 
10238 4 his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving 
10239 3 now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism 
10240 2 for the most part , the ingredients are there 
10241 2 hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world 
10242 3 an imaginative comedy\/thriller 
10243 1 technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial 
10244 1 the only thing in pauline and paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers 
10245 4 offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude 
10246 3 there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit 
10247 0 for anyone who grew up on disney 's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor 
10248 4 ... an inviting piece of film 
10249 1 ... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason 
10250 1 flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern 's thick , working-class scottish accent 
10251 1 maudlin and melodramatic we expected 
10252 1 shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption 
10253 2 not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey 
10254 3 the visuals alone make metropolis worth seeing 
10255 1 uncertain in tone ... a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things 
10256 0 a waste of good performances 
10257 1 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating 
10258 1 a bit of an unwieldy mess 
10259 1 the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety 
10260 0 julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan 
10261 3 a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe 
10262 2 noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama 
10263 1 liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase 
10264 4 a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction ! 
10265 1 propelled not by characters but by caricatures 
10266 1 never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man 
10267 1 here 's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah 
10268 0 every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point 
10269 3 one of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory 
10270 4 the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime 
10271 4 i like the new footage and still love the old stuff 
10272 1 i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women 
10273 1 without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie 
10274 4 gollum 's ` performance ' is incredible ! 
10275 3 superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line 
10276 1 there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them 
10277 3 an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story 
10278 1 if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins 
10279 3 a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy 
10280 1 a sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about 
10281 3 flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with 
10282 3 director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one 
10283 2 it would have benefitted the dialogue 
10284 1 lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and does n't know how to have fun 
10285 2 this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray 
10286 3 it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes 
10287 1 kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action 
10288 1 you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing 
10289 4 the tenderness of the piece is still intact 
10290 0 these people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance 
10291 1 a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller 
10292 1 the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day 
10293 3 while undercover brother is definitely one for the masses , it 's also full of sharp , smart satire 
10294 2 two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more 's the pity 
10295 4 visits spy-movie territory like a novel you ca n't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last 
10296 2 just how extreme are these ops ? 
10297 2 too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing 
10298 3 it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media ... to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks 
10299 2 just one problem : fish out of water usually die 
10300 2 some actors steal scenes 
10301 4 this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics 
10302 1 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial 
10303 1 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter 
10304 3 a tough go , but leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu 
10305 1 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin 
10306 4 a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable 
10307 3 while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at 
10308 4 denis and co-writer michele petin 's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing 
10309 1 expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies 
10310 4 lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new 
10311 3 the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies 
10312 0 he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about 
10313 3 an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you 're getting its metaphysical point 
10314 3 majidi 's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times 
10315 2 it 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original 
10316 3 westfeldt and juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that 's both saucy and endearing 
10317 3 quite funny for the type of movie it is ... 
10318 4 run , do n't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen 
10319 0 matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy 
10320 1 a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie 
10321 2 a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine ` twist ' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense 
10322 1 i 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s 
10323 1 dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter 
10324 4 when it 's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable 
10325 2 a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes 
10326 3 a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race 
10327 1 usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it 
10328 3 mr. wedge and mr. saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well 
10329 3 longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days 
10330 4 a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered 
10331 3 the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor 
10332 3 do n't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life 
10333 4 a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia 's film history 
10334 1 too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century 
10335 1 plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial 
10336 1 all that -lrb- powerpuff girls -rrb- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin 
10337 4 jirí hubac 's script is a gem 
10338 0 as -lrb- the characters -rrb- get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound 
10339 3 even when foreign directors ... borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting 
10340 2 in a word -- yes 
10341 1 feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention 
10342 2 no worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go 
10343 4 this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment 
10344 2 admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch 
10345 2 `` the emperor 's new clothes '' begins with a simple plan ... well , at least that 's the plan 
10346 4 often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter 's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie 
10347 1 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original 
10348 3 cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent 's days 
10349 1 friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it 's called where 's chris tucker when you need him ? 
10350 1 extremely confusing 
10351 2 -lrb- hawn 's character -rrb- is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten 
10352 1 well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special 
10353 3 but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi 
10354 1 son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness 
10355 1 it 's laughing at us 
10356 2 haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you 're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed 
10357 1 like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness 
10358 1 this film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation 
10359 1 helmer devito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' tv and revenge 
10360 1 the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny 
10361 3 4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it 's the ultimate redneck road-trip 
10362 1 still , i 'm not quite sure what the point is ... 
10363 1 has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ? 
10364 0 after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin 
10365 0 unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit 
10366 3 by the end of no such thing the audience , like beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster 
10367 0 a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -lrb- woody allen -rrb- has made in the last twenty years 
10368 3 the production values are up there 
10369 1 rates an ` e ' for effort -- and a ` b ' for boring 
10370 2 it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less 
10371 3 the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain 
10372 1 being author wells ' great-grandson , you 'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material 
10373 1 a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers 
10374 4 it 's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured 
10375 2 like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest 
10376 2 whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion 
10377 2 there are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv 
10378 3 smith 's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes 
10379 1 a shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional 
10380 3 its direction , its script , and weaver 's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that 's what you 're in the mood for 
10381 3 it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he 's been making for the last several years 
10382 1 `` collateral damage '' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment -- until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief 
10383 1 still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral 
10384 4 a blessed gift to film geeks and historians 
10385 3 what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level 
10386 4 it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit 
10387 2 yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature 
10388 4 there 's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film ... or the emotional integrity of the performances 
10389 3 whether you 're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you 'll still feel something 
10390 3 a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino 
10391 3 an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true 
10392 1 moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance 
10393 4 this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all 
10394 2 boisterous and daft documentary 
10395 2 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric 
10396 1 what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical 
10397 2 is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? 
10398 2 the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students 
10399 1 the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset 
10400 3 roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut 
10401 1 maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this 
10402 4 ... there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen 
10403 4 i loved it ! 
10404 4 brilliant ! ' 
10405 1 some studio pizazz might have helped 
10406 1 it will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary 
10407 0 all the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi 
10408 1 a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level 
10409 1 a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations 
10410 2 the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge 
10411 2 director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` the longest yard '' playbook like a checklist 
10412 2 i have n't seen one in so long , no wonder i did n't recognize it at first 
10413 1 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up 
10414 4 cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing 
10415 1 you can practically smell the patchouli oil 
10416 4 cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone 
10417 3 what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment 
10418 2 this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow 
10419 2 it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture 
10420 1 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor 
10421 3 maguire is a surprisingly effective peter\/spider-man 
10422 3 windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live 
10423 4 for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded 
10424 1 so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart 
10425 3 a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido 
10426 4 cho 's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience 
10427 3 about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream 
10428 1 ... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work 
10429 4 ... in this incarnation its fizz is infectious 
10430 2 the gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook 
10431 0 it 's just incredibly dull 
10432 4 genuinely touching because it 's realistic about all kinds of love 
10433 4 nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year 
10434 4 it 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more 
10435 4 a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python 's meaning of life 
10436 4 a graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined 
10437 0 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 
10438 1 a little too pat for its own good 
10439 1 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay 
10440 1 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential 
10441 3 if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror 
10442 0 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards 
10443 1 for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale 
10444 0 had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago 
10445 3 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed\/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation 
10446 0 there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false 
10447 0 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script 
10448 2 just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail 
10449 1 mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness 
10450 1 ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it 's all over his chelsea walls 
10451 1 the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles 
10452 3 an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection 
10453 0 extremely dumb 
10454 2 in the end , ted bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context 
10455 1 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising 
10456 2 just what makes us happy , anyway ? 
10457 1 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke 
10458 2 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after -lrb- or during -rrb- consumption of its second half 
10459 2 enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later 
10460 0 leave these flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine 
10461 1 when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility 
10462 3 may be spoofing an easy target -- those old ' 50 's giant creature features -- but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today 
10463 2 morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start 
10464 2 all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto 
10465 0 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession 
10466 2 it 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition 
10467 1 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you 've imagined the ring 
10468 1 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions 
10469 1 it 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana 's future 
10470 4 think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind 
10471 4 hilarious , acidic brit comedy 
10472 3 an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams 
10473 1 myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another 
10474 4 but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting 
10475 4 a marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption 
10476 4 whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment 
10477 0 how did it ever get made ? 
10478 3 it is also , at times , curiously moving 
10479 4 it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs 
10480 4 a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services 
10481 2 the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game 
10482 3 the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la 
10483 2 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it does n't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story 
10484 3 worth the effort to watch 
10485 2 morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either 
10486 4 everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan 's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true 
10487 3 grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte 
10488 1 just a bloody mess 
10489 0 suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video 
10490 4 the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today 's cinema du sarcasm 
10491 3 i do n't think i 've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto 's iron man 
10492 4 the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question 
10493 3 anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women 's self-actualization knows few continental divides 
10494 3 kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed 
10495 1 as an actor , the rock is aptly named 
10496 4 thoughtful , provocative and entertaining 
10497 1 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why 
10498 1 at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts 
10499 1 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding 
10500 1 places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller 
10501 2 the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom 
10502 0 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere 
10503 3 there 's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm 
10504 1 good for a few unintentional laughs , `` extreme ops '' was obviously made for the `` xxx '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction 
10505 3 tim story 's not there yet - but ` barbershop ' shows he 's on his way 
10506 4 a sports movie with action that 's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it 
10507 3 those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they do n't really want to know 
10508 3 the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure 
10509 1 what happened with pluto nash ? 
10510 2 using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead 
10511 1 notorious c.h.o. has oodles of vulgar highlights 
10512 1 before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon 
10513 1 it 's just a silly black genre spoof 
10514 0 as written by michael berg and michael j. wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all 
10515 3 in fessenden 's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale 
10516 0 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings 
10517 4 offers that rare combination of entertainment and education 
10518 4 romanek keeps the film constantly taut ... reflecting the character 's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score 
10519 3 despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there 's no scene that screams `` bathroom break ! '' 
10520 4 greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders 
10521 2 the heightened symmetry of this new\/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time 
10522 4 moore 's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that 's still very much playing itself out 
10523 1 there 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity 
10524 2 hip-hop has a history , and it 's a metaphor for this love story 
10525 4 as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining 
10526 4 engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship 
10527 3 eventually , it wins you over 
10528 4 you 'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it 
10529 2 effective but too-tepid biopic 
10530 1 if we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get 
10531 4 the acting alone is worth the price of admission 
10532 4 i admired this work a lot 
10533 1 might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr. eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage 
10534 1 it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world 
10535 2 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal 
10536 3 highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager 
10537 3 bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability 
10538 4 the 3d images only enhance the film 's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen 
10539 3 this version 's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful 
10540 0 it 's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be 
10541 0 if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps 
10542 3 but some unexpected zigs and zags help 
10543 3 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer 
10544 3 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another 
10545 4 an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale 
10546 3 de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest 
10547 0 the master of disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy 
10548 4 as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes were n't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create 
10549 2 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven 
10550 4 a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive 's attention to detail 
10551 3 interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals ` red dragon ' right from under their noses 
10552 1 what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent 
10553 1 if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan 
10554 4 a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master 's steady stroke 
10555 2 offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works 
10556 3 there is n't a weak or careless performance amongst them 
10557 3 the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide 
10558 2 brimful 
10559 1 it virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while 
10560 4 the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin 
10561 3 fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox 's work 
10562 2 viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson 's novel will likely prefer disney 's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic 
10563 4 novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach 
10564 3 what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness 
10565 4 i enjoyed the ride -lrb- bumps and all -rrb- , creamy depth , and ultimate theme 
10566 0 what you get with empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead 
10567 1 a very average science fiction film 
10568 1 it 's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak 
10569 0 the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off 
10570 1 verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills 
10571 0 no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either 
10572 1 the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin 
10573 1 though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static 
10574 1 we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride 
10575 4 complex , affecting and uniquely almodóvar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong 
10576 2 maybe it 's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades ... but honestly , analyze that really is n't all that bad 
10577 2 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory 
10578 4 a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america 's culture of fear 
10579 1 while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun 
10580 4 theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical 
10581 2 the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr. desplechin is content to state it 
10582 2 the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it 
10583 2 great story , bad idea for a movie 
10584 1 cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i 'm not one of them 
10585 3 while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it 's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy 
10586 1 while benigni -lrb- who stars and co-wrote -rrb- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that 
10587 4 smith 's point is simple and obvious -- people 's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers 
10588 1 divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy 
10589 0 extremely boring 
10590 3 an impossible romance , but we root for the patronized iranian lad 
10591 1 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it 'll be on video by then 
10592 4 eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler 's many talents 
10593 1 too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise 
10594 3 if there 's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it 's in projects like the -lrb- unfortunately r-rated -rrb- paid 
10595 0 you 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus 
10596 3 an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids 
10597 4 it 's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more 
10598 1 there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject 
10599 3 more honest about alzheimer 's disease , i think , than iris 
10600 2 hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading 
10601 0 what 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class 
10602 1 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented 
10603 3 some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast 
10604 0 it would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 
10605 3 you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you 'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story 
10606 1 a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it 
10607 4 effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience 
10608 1 life is a crock -- or something like it 
10609 4 a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind 
10610 3 from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent 's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir 
10611 3 is n't quite the equal of woo 's best earlier work , but it 's easily his finest american film ... comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films 
10612 2 secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny 
10613 0 the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat 
10614 0 automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf 
10615 2 it 's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer 
10616 1 one minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and\/or sailor moon have been spliced in 
10617 4 director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini 's famous love-jealousy - murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation 
10618 2 this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story 
10619 0 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater 
10620 1 never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery 
10621 0 choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy 
10622 3 makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man 's greatness 
10623 1 an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living 
10624 3 the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time 
10625 1 unfortunately , they 're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo 's life imaginable 
10626 0 this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long 
10627 3 it 's like a poem 
10628 2 ... lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar 
10629 1 a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half 
10630 1 earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast 
10631 1 it 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun 
10632 0 a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to 
10633 2 here , thankfully , they are 
10634 0 a sour , nasty offering 
10635 1 everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones 
10636 0 this time kaufman 's imagination has failed him 
10637 3 ... breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters ' 
10638 1 suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal 
10639 4 the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects 
10640 2 has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act 
10641 1 this is junk food cinema at its greasiest 
10642 3 clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie 
10643 1 -lrb- director -rrb- byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one 
10644 4 if you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now 
10645 3 a miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out 
10646 0 shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme 
10647 2 frailty is n't as gory or explicit 
10648 3 choose your reaction : a. -rrb- that sure is funny ! 
10649 2 it 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile 
10650 1 it 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u.s. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in french -lrb- well , mostly -rrb- with english subtitles and is magically ` significant ' because of that 
10651 3 droll caper-comedy remake of `` big deal on madonna street '' that 's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate `` bellini '' begins to look like a `` real kaputschnik '' 
10652 4 call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film 
10653 2 search it out 
10654 2 it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count 
10655 3 japan 's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date 
10656 2 easier to respect than enthuse over , andersson 's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing 
10657 3 and if the hours wins ` best picture ' i just might 
10658 1 another rent installment for the ian fleming estate 
10659 1 instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart 's war , like the st. louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started 
10660 4 murderous maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth 
10661 0 some of seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot 
10662 4 one of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever 
10663 1 for caine lovers only 
10664 2 it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb 
10665 2 elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one 
10666 0 a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience 
10667 0 opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between 
10668 1 ... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs 
10669 4 thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings 
10670 3 farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis 's world-weary colonel 
10671 3 that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered 
10672 2 it 's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet 
10673 4 those who would follow haneke on his creepy explorations ... are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from huppert and magimel 
10674 2 it 's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner 
10675 1 but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship 
10676 4 a fascinating and fun film 
10677 4 the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick 
10678 3 a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life 
10679 1 the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary 
10680 0 wait for video -- and then do n't rent it 
10681 2 an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best 
10682 1 remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? 
10683 1 -lrb- i -rrb- f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you 've already seen this kind of thing 
10684 4 excellent acting and direction 
10685 4 a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american 's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle 
10686 4 a very funny movie 
10687 2 both awful and appealing 
10688 2 wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together 
10689 4 ranks among willams ' best screen work 
10690 4 you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling 
10691 3 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it 's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it 's told by the people who were there 
10692 1 these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining 
10693 4 it 's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart 
10694 2 had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin 
10695 2 scotland , pa. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole 
10696 1 there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering 
10697 1 the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious 
10698 1 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well 
10699 2 the seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going 
10700 3 an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone 
10701 3 what kids will discover is a new collectible 
10702 1 could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? 
10703 0 even die-hard fans of japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge 
10704 4 it 's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds 
10705 2 this is an hour and a half of daydreaming 
10706 4 ford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier 
10707 4 that rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind 
10708 0 could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? 
10709 1 while mcfarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films ... it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys ' story 
10710 0 when -lrb- de palma 's -rrb- bad , he 's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done 
10711 3 behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies -lrb- plus one sheep dog -rrb- , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart 
10712 3 a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners 
10713 4 hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette 's dialogue 
10714 3 a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect 
10715 4 dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee 
10716 3 look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music 
10717 3 presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it 
10718 2 the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other 
10719 2 but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick -lrb- remember cabin boy ? -rrb- 
10720 2 besides , real movie producers are n't this nice 
10721 1 mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness 
10722 4 this is how you use special effects 
10723 2 haneke keeps us at arm 's length 
10724 1 like its two predecessors , 1983 's koyaanisqatsi and 1988 's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever 
10725 3 what 's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world 
10726 3 he 's super spy ! 
10727 1 though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr. schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear 
10728 3 i do n't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh 's full frontal , though that did n't stop me from enjoying much of it 
10729 1 has the feel of an unedited personal journal 
10730 1 the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next 
10731 3 skip work to see it at the first opportunity 
10732 0 ecks this one off your must-see list 
10733 4 gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film 
10734 2 drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality 
10735 2 human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control 
10736 1 the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs 
10737 1 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive 
10738 4 the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic 
10739 3 so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality 
10740 3 smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way 
10741 4 the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon 
10742 3 merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone 
10743 4 but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here 
10744 1 not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny 
10745 1 murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous 
10746 4 even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good 
10747 1 the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone 
10748 0 there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production 
10749 2 but in 2002 , such revelations wilt 
10750 1 it 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks 
10751 1 gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? 
10752 2 engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying 
10753 1 birot 's directorial debut -lrb- she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré -rrb- is n't so much bad as it is bland 
10754 3 as bundy , michael reilly burke -lrb- octopus 2 : river of fear -rrb- has just the right amount of charisma and menace 
10755 0 it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original 
10756 1 scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be 
10757 0 b. -rrb- that sure is pathetic ! 
10758 1 this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life 
10759 2 all 's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags 
10760 4 the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun 
10761 2 it wo n't bust your gut -- and it 's not intended to -- it 's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke 
10762 3 it 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor 
10763 2 several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare 
10764 0 -lrb- u -rrb- nrelentingly stupid 
10765 2 or a profit 
10766 0 the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc. 
10767 4 compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder 
10768 2 faultlessly professional but finally slight 
10769 4 renner 's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing 
10770 1 big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities 
10771 0 afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen 's men is finally just one long drag 
10772 2 bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he ca n't help throwing in a few of his own touches 
10773 1 a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots 
10774 0 it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun 
10775 0 a recipe for cinematic disaster ... part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad 
10776 4 hands down the year 's most thought-provoking film 
10777 1 the furious coherence that -lrb- deniro -rrb- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing 
10778 2 there was time on that second round to see the subtleties of ramsay 's portrait of grief 
10779 2 perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about 
10780 1 you might not buy the ideas 
10781 0 looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due 
10782 3 as shaky as the plot is , kaufman 's script is still memorable for some great one-liners 
10783 3 not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it 's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare 
10784 4 this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you 'll be glad you went along for the ride 
10785 1 too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless 
10786 1 at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about 
10787 3 a compelling journey ... and `` his best friend remembers '' is up there with the finest of specials 
10788 3 a real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us do n't know 
10789 1 after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna 
10790 1 but buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie 
10791 1 a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against ... well , just stuff 
10792 1 the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout 
10793 2 this horror-comedy does n't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira 's hooters 
10794 2 yes , you are , ben kingsley 
10795 3 what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved 
10796 0 it 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre 
10797 0 the title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is 
10798 1 a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned 
10799 1 nothing about it fits 
10800 0 the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep 
10801 0 ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance 
10802 4 it 's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic 
10803 4 a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass 
10804 3 it 's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable 
10805 4 must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry 
10806 4 does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively 
10807 1 when the first few villians are introduced as `` spider '' and `` snake '' you know you 're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak 
10808 0 this is n't a `` friday '' worth waiting for 
10809 1 maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional 
10810 0 even the unwatchable soapdish is more original 
10811 4 a wildly funny prison caper 
10812 3 it 's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru 
10813 1 obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! 
10814 1 nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera 
10815 0 unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me 
10816 1 its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing 
10817 0 when a film is created solely because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result 
10818 4 often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed 
10819 2 when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart 
10820 3 there 's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable 
10821 1 it 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views 
10822 3 although very much like the first movie based on j.k. rowling 's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude 
10823 2 though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal woody at best 
10824 3 merchant effectively translates naipaul 's lively mix of characters from the page to screen 
10825 0 others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore 's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding 
10826 1 you 've seen them a million times 
10827 4 the comic performances are all spot on , especially lee ross 's turn as ken 
10828 1 nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about 
10829 3 message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? 
10830 4 disney 's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem 
10831 1 first good , then bothersome 
10832 2 to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable 
10833 0 adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse 
10834 2 manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas 
10835 0 even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs. sever is a dumb action movie 
10836 4 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it 's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch 
10837 0 ... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life 
10838 2 human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better 
10839 2 a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men 
10840 1 but this time there 's some mold on the gold 
10841 4 a model of what films like this should be like 
10842 1 a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title 
10843 2 light , cute and forgettable 
10844 1 -lrb- t -rrb- hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality does n't work in a modern context 
10845 2 a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones 
10846 2 immediately 
10847 2 melanie eventually slugs the yankee 
10848 3 a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil ' bow wow 
10849 4 aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol 's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it 
10850 4 a fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in japanese animation 
10851 2 if the ' 70 's were your idea of a good time at the movies , this will make you very happy 
10852 4 a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort 
10853 4 the hours is what movies are supposed to be ... 
10854 0 just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat 
10855 3 when it really counts ... bloody sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language 
10856 2 for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear 
10857 0 ... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time 
10858 4 a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution 
10859 0 nothing more than a mediocre trifle 
10860 4 full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience 
10861 2 this is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times 
10862 1 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production 
10863 2 equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama 
10864 2 johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to 
10865 2 not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care 
10866 0 audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school 
10867 3 a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy 
10868 2 a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness 
10869 3 as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled -lrb- literally and figuratively -rrb- by desire ... -lrb- sex and lucía -rrb- makes for an arousing good time 
10870 3 a work of intricate elegance , literary lyricism and profound common sense 
10871 3 solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts 
10872 2 remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster ... done up by howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand 
10873 3 for all its serious sense of purpose ... -lrb- it -rrb- finds a way to lay bare the tragedies of its setting with a good deal of warmth and humor 
10874 3 far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place ... innocent and well-meaning 
10875 3 despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions 
10876 3 the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task 
10877 0 the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted 
10878 3 it helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well 
10879 2 one of -lrb- herzog 's -rrb- least inspired works 
10880 1 the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller 
10881 1 the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case 
10882 0 as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure 
10883 0 it 's an awfully derivative story 
10884 0 now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie 
10885 1 fails to bring as much to the table 
10886 3 sturdy , entertaining period drama ... both caine and fraser have their moments 
10887 0 focuses on joan 's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her `` madness '' so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century torture device 
10888 4 there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema 's finest this year 
10889 4 dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement 
10890 3 narc may not get an ` a ' for originality , but it wears its b-movie heritage like a badge of honor 
10891 4 the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly 
10892 3 i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending 
10893 1 a tv episode inflated past its natural length 
10894 3 zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure 
10895 1 the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine 
10896 3 it 's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world 
10897 4 celebrated at sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that 's hard to beat 
10898 3 -lrb- davis -rrb- has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race 
10899 0 enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment 
10900 2 by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , auto focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing 
10901 3 the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses 
10902 1 watching trouble every day , at least if you do n't know what 's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms 
10903 2 a journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman 's brilliance almost makes worth taking 
10904 4 rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as monsoon wedding 
10905 3 the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them 
10906 2 what happens to john q ? 
10907 1 there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust 
10908 3 a thoughtful look at a painful incident that made headlines in 1995 
10909 1 an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort 
10910 1 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman -lrb- who never gets to play that flute -rrb- has all the charm of a meltdown 
10911 0 marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess 
10912 3 as teen movies go , `` orange county '' is a refreshing change 
10913 2 there 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant 
10914 3 attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage 
10915 1 with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path 
10916 1 a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales 
10917 1 flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year 's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat 
10918 0 lame , haphazard teen comedy 
10919 4 somewhat blurred , but kinnear 's performance is razor sharp 
10920 1 ... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense 
10921 1 no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story 
10922 2 the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama 
10923 2 just pound away 
10924 3 a slick , skillful little horror film 
10925 3 there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it 's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises 
10926 3 more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent 
10927 2 ... does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters ' choices , good and ill , that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought 
10928 3 on the surface , it 's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz 's and kieslowski 's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique 
10929 1 in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did 
10930 3 it helps that lil bow wow ... tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid 
10931 4 finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original 
10932 0 most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots 
10933 0 began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course 
10934 4 it 's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel ... 
10935 2 parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde 's still-contemporary play 
10936 0 much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -lrb- the movie 's -rrb- mindset 
10937 3 but based on cq , i 'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project 
10938 4 disturbing and brilliant documentary 
10939 1 chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror 
10940 4 windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop 
10941 3 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness 
10942 2 to say analyze that is de niro 's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career 
10943 4 an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world 
10944 2 the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors 
10945 1 the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt 
10946 2 this film is full of rabbits 
10947 1 alas , it 's neither 
10948 1 ... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core 
10949 1 men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce 
10950 3 not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve 's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters 
10951 3 it 's astonishing 
10952 3 a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch 
10953 3 a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution 
10954 3 a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser 
10955 1 between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap 
10956 1 the central story lacks punch 
10957 1 not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i 've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' 
10958 2 hmm 
10959 0 a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy 
10960 4 a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality 
10961 4 if you 're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite 
10962 1 all in all , there 's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone 
10963 0 it 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma 
10964 3 we need -lrb- moore 's -rrb- noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones 
10965 3 roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck -- few filmmakers will 
10966 3 gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife 
10967 0 national lampoon 's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion 
10968 1 the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected 
10969 2 i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation 
10970 2 over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that 's got oodles of style and substance 
10971 2 it has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it 's over 
10972 2 possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it 's directed by ... neil labute 
10973 4 -lrb- broomfield -rrb- uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue 
10974 3 it 's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides 
10975 1 has a plot full of twists upon knots ... and a nonstop parade of mock-tarantino scuzbag types that starts out clever but veers into overkill 
10976 1 there 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought 
10977 2 this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy 
10978 3 a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills 
10979 1 -lrb- it 's -rrb- a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy 
10980 3 there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting 
10981 0 rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next 
10982 1 if this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook 
10983 3 here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get 
10984 3 jagger the actor is someone you want to see again 
10985 4 the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter 
10986 0 murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together 
10987 3 but in imax 3-d , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography 
10988 1 there 's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career 
10989 1 the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath ... 
10990 4 ... a roller-coaster ride of a movie 
10991 0 just like hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination 
10992 3 tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point 
10993 1 god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse 
10994 3 the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act 
10995 3 the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue 
10996 2 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense de palma creates 
10997 3 the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound 
10998 4 hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors 
10999 3 in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works 
11000 2 when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray 's game of chinese whispers with mr bean 
11001 2 not always too whimsical for its own good -lrb- but enough to do harm -rrb- , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs 
11002 2 well before it 's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels 
11003 0 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy 
11004 4 i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off 
11005 0 lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose 
11006 0 oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven 
11007 1 with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door 
11008 1 marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie 
11009 2 the film 's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john 
11010 3 the movie 's eventual success should be credited to dennis quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor 
11011 0 the actors do n't inhabit their roles -- they 're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes 
11012 1 strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery 
11013 0 vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship 
11014 4 bow 's best moments are when he 's getting busy on the basketball court because that 's when he really scores 
11015 1 a movie that tries to fuse the two ` woods ' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess 
11016 1 but that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients 
11017 3 who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images do n't have to add up to mesmerize you 
11018 1 it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling 
11019 1 sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution 
11020 0 undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters 
11021 0 some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future 
11022 0 the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap 
11023 1 this time out , -lrb- sade -rrb- is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested 
11024 3 a pleasant romantic comedy 
11025 1 the director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -lrb- most notably wretched sound design -rrb- 
11026 3 must be seen to be believed 
11027 3 ... a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life 
11028 3 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever 
11029 1 birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it 
11030 2 it 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction 
11031 3 it 's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene 
11032 1 it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning 
11033 1 shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity 
11034 0 it 's painful 
11035 2 chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws 
11036 2 the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
11037 2 is office work really as alienating as ` bartleby ' so effectively makes it ? 
11038 1 a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within 
11039 3 as blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , el bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance 
11040 4 morton is , as usual , brilliant 
11041 1 the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn 
11042 1 ... a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway 
11043 3 what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale -- as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters 
11044 3 culkin , who 's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield 
11045 4 for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man 's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out 
11046 1 falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny 
11047 1 it wo n't be long before you 'll spy i spy at a video store near you 
11048 2 oh , it 's extreme , all right 
11049 3 an engaging overview of johnson 's eccentric career 
11050 1 proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report 
11051 2 that is essentially what 's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point 
11052 3 the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design 
11053 1 this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring 
11054 1 sorry , charlie 
11055 3 it 's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he 's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech 
11056 4 in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century ... takes kurys ' career to a whole new level 
11057 1 the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is 
11058 1 the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them 
11059 1 ... -lrb- a -rrb- strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense 
11060 1 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor 
11061 1 another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through 
11062 1 nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre 
11063 3 led by griffin 's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material 
11064 1 it 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high 
11065 0 i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief 
11066 2 with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept. 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire 's bright side 
11067 0 the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging 
11068 2 the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending 
11069 2 girls gone wild and gone civil again 
11070 2 but what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
11071 3 he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality 
11072 3 the movie 's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries 
11073 0 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten 
11074 3 is n't it great ? 
11075 3 enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd 
11076 4 this is as powerful a set of evidence as you 'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives 
11077 1 guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things 
11078 4 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor 
11079 4 ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year 's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum 
11080 1 some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations 
11081 2 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole 
11082 1 human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal 
11083 1 does n't amount to much of anything 
11084 4 huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she 'll crack 
11085 4 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema 
11086 4 lead provocatuers testud and parmentier give superlative performances 
11087 0 apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable tv 
11088 2 between the drama of cube ? 
11089 2 while the glass slipper does n't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale 
11090 0 meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it 's so bad it 's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie 
11091 3 rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation 
11092 1 when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble 
11093 0 this overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd 
11094 4 having never been a huge fan of dickens ' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath 's version 
11095 2 it 's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone 's head 
11096 1 the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction 
11097 1 if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg 
11098 2 i 've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one 
11099 1 the problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot 
11100 1 it 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script 
11101 1 the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business 
11102 1 so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun 
11103 2 this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring 
11104 4 a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats 
11105 1 i tried to read the time on my watch 
11106 1 writer\/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and kate 's jealous female friends become downright despicable 
11107 2 cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed 
11108 1 the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun 
11109 3 i like frank the pug , though 
11110 1 an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma 
11111 2 largely a for-fans artifact 
11112 3 an involving true story of a chinese actor who takes up drugs and winds up in an institution -- acted mostly by the actual people involved 
11113 1 nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you 'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it 
11114 0 would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year 
11115 2 ... a well-observed and disturbing little movie 
11116 4 an incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar -lrb- and peculiarly venomous -rrb- bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy 
11117 2 movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation 
11118 3 lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i could n't help being captivated by it 
11119 3 the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life 
11120 4 it 's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie 's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia 
11121 3 though the film 's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare 
11122 4 kinnear gives a tremendous performance 
11123 3 perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions 
11124 1 dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm 
11125 3 ... both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat ' 
11126 3 windtalkers blows this way and that , but there 's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass , true to himself 
11127 4 an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson 
11128 1 ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but do n't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here 
11129 2 the new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted 
11130 1 sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre 
11131 4 it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future 
11132 0 the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare 
11133 3 although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser 's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious 
11134 3 claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications 
11135 0 to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist 
11136 3 the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess 
11137 3 daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who are n't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war 
11138 4 it 's also the year 's sweetest movie 
11139 3 this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story 's a little weak 
11140 3 a whole lot foul , freaky and funny 
11141 3 there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy ... but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an iranian specialty 
11142 0 for me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings 
11143 1 a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect 
11144 1 and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy 
11145 2 lawrence preaches strictly to the converted 
11146 1 given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much 
11147 3 `` antwone fisher '' is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington 
11148 3 succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series 
11149 2 you do n't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor 's club 
11150 2 the film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place 
11151 1 if you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog 
11152 1 the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus 
11153 1 the best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now 
11154 3 by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what 's possible and what we might do to make it so 
11155 3 after making several adaptations of other writers ' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject 
11156 1 all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure 
11157 1 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones 
11158 2 a sly game of cat and mouse that 's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances 
11159 0 ... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise 
11160 2 what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about 
11161 1 i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha 
11162 2 unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity 
11163 4 the film delivers not just the full assault of reno 's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days 
11164 1 one groan-inducing familiarity begets another 
11165 0 john mctiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga 
11166 4 an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives 
11167 3 a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking 
11168 1 but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck 's film from coming together 
11169 1 too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining 
11170 1 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized 
11171 4 everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing 
11172 3 the best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates 
11173 3 a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence 
11174 2 we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict 
11175 4 one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you 're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you did n't know was being taken 
11176 2 i believe the message is in the messenger : the agent is a woman 
11177 4 mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun 
11178 1 but i was n't 
11179 4 though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance 
11180 1 a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker 
11181 4 most impressive , though , is the film 's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters ' emotional wounds 
11182 1 it 's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell 
11183 2 a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move 
11184 1 it 's fairly self-aware in its dumbness 
11185 3 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves 
11186 0 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film 
11187 1 watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good 
11188 3 a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them 
11189 2 that 's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan 's existence 
11190 3 there 's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that 's what makes it irresistible 
11191 3 a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with ... it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm 
11192 4 this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese 's best in more than a decade 
11193 3 for a good chunk of its running time , trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller 
11194 4 full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he 's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000 
11195 1 even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of todd farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship 
11196 3 as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness 
11197 1 the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women 
11198 2 but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked 
11199 0 made by jackasses for jackasses 
11200 0 if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna 
11201 1 pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick 
11202 1 topkapi this is not 
11203 3 but he somehow pulls it off 
11204 2 the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture 
11205 0 bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that 
11206 2 an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s 
11207 4 it is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish 
11208 4 a worthwhile way to spend two hours 
11209 2 illuminating if overly talky documentary 
11210 1 never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds 
11211 4 two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama 
11212 3 -lrb- gai -rrb- comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form 
11213 3 a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags 
11214 2 it does n't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than `` confessions of a dangerous mind '' 
11215 0 filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low 
11216 1 then lower them a bit more 
11217 0 i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind 
11218 0 a very bad sign 
11219 2 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr. deeds was to that of frank capra 
11220 2 sometimes , that 's enough 
11221 1 well , it does go on forever 
11222 2 there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double 
11223 0 this is n't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it 's the cliffsnotes with pages missing 
11224 3 it 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old 
11225 0 fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water 
11226 0 guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens 
11227 3 it 's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh 
11228 2 there 's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes 
11229 1 it 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it 
11230 2 `` its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right '' 
11231 4 an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind 
11232 2 it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't 
11233 0 john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie 
11234 4 tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable 
11235 4 this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director 
11236 1 a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely can not last 
11237 1 the film 's center will not hold 
11238 3 it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle 
11239 2 literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes 
11240 1 it 's also stupider 
11241 1 none of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter 
11242 4 sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film 
11243 3 a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror 
11244 0 although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours 
11245 1 ` abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' ... you should definitely let dante 's gloomy words be your guide 
11246 2 he can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he 'll get the girl 
11247 2 so i just did 
11248 1 an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent 
11249 1 there 's not enough to sustain the comedy 
11250 1 fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters 
11251 1 the film is really not so much bad as bland 
11252 0 schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler 's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad 
11253 3 a vivid cinematic portrait 
11254 3 it 's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro 
11255 3 the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups 
11256 2 alex nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl 
11257 2 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object 
11258 2 ... tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope 
11259 4 it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment 
11260 1 frenetic but not really funny 
11261 3 sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open 
11262 1 it 's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really does n't fit the part 
11263 1 ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact amber is such a joke 
11264 3 this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it 's hard to know what to praise first 
11265 1 apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths 
11266 4 andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance 
11267 3 -lrb- anderson -rrb- uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense 
11268 3 this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border 
11269 0 this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience 
11270 4 dazzling and sugar-sweet , a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver 
11271 3 from the big giant titles of the opening credits to elmer bernstein 's perfectly melodic score , haynes gets just about everything right 
11272 0 watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives 
11273 4 as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing 
11274 3 working from elliott 's memoir , rohmer fashions the sort of delicate , articulate character - and - relationship study he 's favored for decades 
11275 3 watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both 
11276 1 intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area 
11277 4 -lrb- a -rrb- rare , beautiful film 
11278 1 ... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs 
11279 0 suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum 
11280 4 while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there 's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls ca n't swim 
11281 1 opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` glory : a soldier 's story '' 
11282 2 ... an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal 's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs 
11283 4 it 's -lrb- ricci 's -rrb- best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world 's misery with blind good will 
11284 2 is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco 's last album ? 
11285 0 this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age 
11286 2 it tells more than it shows 
11287 3 evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children -- and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good 
11288 2 director clare kilner 's debut is never as daft as it should have been 
11289 3 as expected , sayles ' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances 
11290 2 ... the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes `` what time is it there ? '' 
11291 1 too bad the former murphy brown does n't pop reese back 
11292 3 it 's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth 
11293 2 taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore 
11294 3 george clooney proves he 's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he 's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind 
11295 4 ... mesmerizing , an eye-opening tour of modern beijing culture in a journey of rebellion , retreat into oblivion and return 
11296 3 the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing 
11297 3 a potent allegorical love story 
11298 4 provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz 
11299 3 it 's endearing to hear madame d. refer to her husband as ` jackie ' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer 
11300 1 so few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler 
11301 0 needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey 
11302 0 calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls 
11303 2 overly stylized with lots of flash black - & - white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , -lrb- it 's -rrb- at its worst when it 's actually inside the ring 
11304 4 it is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some 
11305 4 it 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss 
11306 2 the appearance of treebeard and gollum 's expanded role will either have you loving what you 're seeing , or rolling your eyes 
11307 1 now , if it only had a brain 
11308 4 a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives 
11309 1 like a south-of-the-border melrose place 
11310 3 it 's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements 
11311 0 this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie 
11312 4 fans of behan 's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy 
11313 3 everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse 
11314 3 a startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society 
11315 3 although it 's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do 
11316 0 watching haneke 's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment 
11317 1 once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care 
11318 0 but like bruce springsteen 's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins 
11319 4 stay clear of reminding yourself that it 's a `` true story '' and you 're likely to have one helluva time at the movies 
11320 1 so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program 
11321 2 lends itself to the narcotizing bland -lrb- sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie -rrb- machinations of the biennial disney boy movie 
11322 3 in the process , they demonstrate that there 's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema 
11323 3 though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium 
11324 2 what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy 
11325 3 it 's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice 
11326 1 like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them 
11327 3 a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love 
11328 3 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time 
11329 1 a soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie 
11330 2 though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial 
11331 2 only two words will tell you what you know when deciding to see it : anthony 
11332 1 there 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent 
11333 3 achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium 
11334 3 if you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , wasabi is a good place to start 
11335 1 but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour 
11336 4 ... always remains movingly genuine 
11337 1 maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` full frontal '' seems , well , contrived 
11338 1 the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels 
11339 2 a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home 
11340 1 schindler 's list it ai n't 
11341 3 a compelling portrait of moral emptiness 
11342 1 let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested 
11343 4 -lrb- a -rrb- superbly controlled , passionate adaptation of graham greene 's 1955 novel 
11344 4 a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film 
11345 0 no , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else 
11346 4 a comic gem with some serious sparkles 
11347 0 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats 
11348 4 the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes 
11349 1 a bravura exercise in emptiness 
11350 3 this concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where its intended under-12 audience is concerned 
11351 0 this one 's weaker than most 
11352 4 a lighthearted , feel-good film that embraces the time-honored truth that the most powerful thing in life is love 
11353 1 the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence 
11354 0 i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations 
11355 1 a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin 's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison 
11356 4 rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual 
11357 4 an offbeat , sometimes gross and surprisingly appealing animated film about the true meaning of the holidays 
11358 2 the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie 
11359 4 another great ` what you do n't see ' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances 
11360 1 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce 
11361 1 feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers 
11362 1 going to the website may be just as fun -lrb- and scary -rrb- as going to the film 
11363 1 is this progress ? 
11364 1 for a shoot - 'em - up , ballistic is oddly lifeless 
11365 4 one of the best of the year 
11366 3 there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected -lrb- and gentle -rrb- way 
11367 0 credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter 
11368 1 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination 
11369 2 bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences 
11370 3 a solidly seaworthy chiller 
11371 2 high on melodrama 
11372 1 when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever 
11373 0 if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead 
11374 1 still , i thought it could have been more 
11375 3 a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard 's pyromania 
11376 3 though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them 
11377 1 like mike does n't win any points for originality 
11378 3 ms. fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn 
11379 4 the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense 
11380 3 legendary irish writer brendan behan 's memoir , borstal boy , has been given a loving screen transferral 
11381 4 at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it 's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do 
11382 1 it 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold 
11383 4 it 's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the marks family 
11384 3 it uses an old-time formula , it 's not terribly original and it 's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding 
11385 4 if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones ' diary or high fidelity , then you wo n't want to miss about a boy 
11386 3 katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself 
11387 1 -lrb- it 's -rrb- difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view 
11388 3 a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant ` co-stars ' 
11389 0 but as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess 
11390 3 what 's next ? 
11391 1 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music 
11392 1 showtime is closer to slowtime 
11393 2 thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ... takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda 
11394 2 the am-radio soundtrack and game cast -- tierney and the inimitable walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit 
11395 4 tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy 
11396 3 britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway 
11397 1 has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags 
11398 4 an enchanting spectacular for potter fans anxious to ride the hogwarts express toward a new year of magic and mischief 
11399 2 the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions 
11400 3 it 's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests 
11401 0 a real clunker 
11402 0 the film seems a dead weight 
11403 3 the voices are fine as well 
11404 4 it turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting 
11405 1 an awkward and indigestible movie 
11406 0 showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome 
11407 4 a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women 
11408 1 but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored 
11409 2 yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
11410 2 the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it does n't go too much further 
11411 1 as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart 
11412 3 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly -lrb- like one of hubert 's punches -rrb- , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn 
11413 2 despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another 
11414 1 the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes 
11415 2 even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat 
11416 4 go see it and enjoy 
11417 0 her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant

11531 3 a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage

11537 3 i loved looking at this movie 
11538 4 binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles 
11539 4 doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie 's spycraft and uses damon 's ability to be focused and sincere 
11540 3 the film 's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard ... 
11541 0 i wish i could say `` thank god it 's friday '' , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over 
11542 4 lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist 
11543 3 occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new 
11544 3 `` men in black ii , '' has all the earmarks of a sequel 
11545 3 this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio 's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed 
11546 2 the cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming 
11547 4 yeah , these flicks are just that damn good 
11548 4 a worthy entry into a very difficult genre 
11549 2 there 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version

11556 3 an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent 
11557 1 the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations 
11558 3 still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at ` face value ' to recommend to anyone looking for something different 
11559 3 woo 's fights have a distinct flair 
11560 1 the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team 
11561 0 ... has virtually no script at all ... 
11562 2 if it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after , there 's no better film than half past dead 
11563 1 we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting

11567 3 the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound 
11568 2 the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances 
11569 3 at its best , the good girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery ... 
11570 3 nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations ... 
11571 4 throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another 
11572 3 although life or something like it is very much in the mold of feel-good movies , the cast and director stephen herek 's polished direction pour delightfully piquant wine from aged bottles 
11573 3 at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers 
11574 0 the story ... is moldy and obvious 
11575 0 scotland , pa. is a strangely drab romp 
11576 0 better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine 
11577 4 ... one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers i 've seen in quite a long time 
11578 0 denzel washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony 
11579 1 despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum 
11580 3 she must have a very strong back 
11581 2 ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much 
11582 3 we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood could n't possibly fictionalize and be believed 
11583 1 the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured -lrb- and torturing -rrb- artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on 
11584 3 an utterly compelling ` who wrote it ' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question 
11585 3 this is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the saturday matinee , and it still is 
11586 2 a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas 
11587 1 not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed 
11588 3 -lrb- drumline -rrb- is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it does n't do 
11589 1 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect 
11590 3 despite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it 
11591 3 noyce 's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective 
11592 2 the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere 
11593 1 despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles 
11594 1 succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies 
11595 2 i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory 
11596 3 watching beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it 
11597 2 it does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the russos ' next offering 
11598 1 bears is bad 
11599 1 any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes 
11600 3 a film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities 
11601 4 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth 
11602 1 i just did n't care as much for the story 
11603 3 very solid , very watchable first feature for director peter sheridan 
11604 1 while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling 
11605 0 the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes 
11606 1 pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film 
11607 1 if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he 'd have them mate 
11608 1 still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental 
11609 2 if the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care 
11610 1 consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept 
11611 4 leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago 
11612 3 sam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man 's ruin may be another 's fortune

11615 4 barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful 
11616 1 it settles for being merely grim 
11617 4 a work of astonishing delicacy and force 
11618 3 dark and disturbing , but also surprisingly funny 
11619 4 a loving little film of considerable appeal 
11620 0 watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it 
11621 0 a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments 
11622 1 the problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball 
11623 1 can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going 
11624 4 parker holds true to wilde 's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness 
11625 0 these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future 
11626 1 if somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus ' son , they 'd come up with something like bart freundlich 's world traveler 
11627 0 new best friend should n't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video 
11628 1 as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it does n't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions 
11629 1 i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness 
11630 4 -lrb- director peter -rrb- jackson and his crew have so steeped themselves in the majesty of tolkien 's writing that every frame produces new joys , whether you 're a fan of the books or not 
11631 3 ... ambition is in short supply in the cinema , and egoyan tackles his themes and explores his characters ' crises with seriousness and compassion 
11632 0 it does n't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel 
11633 2 baran is n't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it 's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations 
11634 2 what is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form 
11635 1 -lrb- two -rrb- fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now 
11636 1 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes 
11637 1 their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i 'd hoped the movie would avoid 
11638 3 the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace 
11639 3 it 's still worth a look 
11640 1 jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips 
11641 2 it 's a count for our times 
11642 2 chao was chen kaige 's assistant for years in china 
11643 1 never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful 
11644 1 although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke 
11645 3 a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors 
11646 3 intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed 
11647 1 too close to phantom menace for comfort 
11648 3 without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions 
11649 1 somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g.i. jane 
11650 3 marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film 
11651 3 reinforces the talents of screenwriter charlie kaufman , creator of adaptation and being john malkovich 
11652 1 the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off 
11653 2 despite its title , amy 's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one 
11654 3 more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling 
11655 1 a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect 
11656 0 the story 's so preposterous that i did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved 
11657 0 its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
11658 1 and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
11659 3 watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay 's sappier elements ... and sustains off the hook 's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer 
11660 4 ice cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance ... 
11661 1 all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull 
11662 2 whether -lrb- binoche and magimel -rrb- are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria 
11663 1 tom green just gives them a bad odor 
11664 2 each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception 
11665 4 it 's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world 
11666 3 it has fun being grown up 
11667 1 this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on 
11668 2 you 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous 
11669 4 children may not understand everything that happens -- i 'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted 
11670 3 a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan 's heroes star bob crane 
11671 1 this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another
