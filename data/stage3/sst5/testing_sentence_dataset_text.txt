9763 no movement , no yuks , not much of anything 
9764 a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore 's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée 
9765 ` how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? ' 
9766 so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something

9769 this is one of polanski 's best films 
9770 take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema 
9771 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes `` never again '' worthwhile , but -lrb- writer\/director -rrb- schaeffer should follow his titular advice 
9772 the movie exists for its soccer action and its fine acting 
9773 arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces 
9774 a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided 
9775 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -lrb- literally -rrb- 
9776 jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot 
9777 even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame 
9778 oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough 
9779 though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes 
9780 when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign 
9781 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot ... 
9782 the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air 
9783 if your senses have n't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you 're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket 
9784 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes 
9785 as conceived by mr. schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell 
9786 those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida 
9787 most new movies have a bright sheen 
9788 but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing 
9789 steve irwin 's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume 
9790 d.j. qualls as indiana jones ? 
9791 it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america 's most oppressive regimes 
9792 nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition 
9793 the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave 
9794 culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character 
9795 sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well 
9796 the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit 
9797 not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it 's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it 
9798 the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover 
9799 it 's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock , garry shandling and colin quinn 
9800 finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less 
9801 the low-budget full frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother 
9802 exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven ... -lrb- the film -rrb- addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce 
9803 an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the ` truth ' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to 
9804 as a singular character study , it 's perfect 
9805 haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration 
9806 an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment 
9807 all the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , all or nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit 
9808 a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe ... the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history 
9809 is it a total success ? 
9810 i do n't have an i am sam clue 
9811 zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it 's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones 
9812 the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they 'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor 
9813 the new guy is one of them 
9814 the thrill is -lrb- long -rrb- gone 
9815 much monkeyfun for all 
9816 a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle 
9817 this is really just another genre picture 
9818 much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride 
9819 for the first time in several years , mr. allen has surpassed himself with the magic he 's spun with the hollywood empress of ms. leoni 's ellie 
9820 one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce 
9821 as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them 
9822 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity 
9823 with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv 's defunct cleopatra 2525 
9824 this is simply the most fun you 'll ever have with a documentary ! 
9825 it represents better-than-average movie-making that does n't demand a dumb , distracted audience 
9826 ... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity 
9827 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just does n't make the cut 
9828 the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays 
9829 how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ? 
9830 for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way 
9831 as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness 
9832 sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle 
9833 ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family 's custom-made christmas card 
9834 a dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble 
9835 the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy 
9836 instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre 
9837 the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll 
9838 it is ridiculous , of course ... but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness 
9839 everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids 
9840 big deal ! 
9841 tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure 
9842 a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull 
9843 the cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters 
9844 a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series 
9845 a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at 
9846 dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick 
9847 a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy 
9848 not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' i once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad 
9849 a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek 
9850 it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism 
9851 the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that 's rare in film today , but be warned : it 's a slow slog to get there 
9852 -lrb- schweiger is -rrb- talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists 
9853 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer 
9854 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 
9855 for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero 
9856 this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap 
9857 now it 's just tired 
9858 not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen 
9859 it 's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- i 'm prepared to call it a draw 
9860 about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through 
9861 the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark 
9862 as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten 
9863 writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear 
9864 truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before 
9865 george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please 
9866 sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary 
9867 all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility 
9868 it 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time 
9869 the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience 
9870 too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience 
9871 goyer 's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast 
9872 reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world 's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes 
9873 abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists 
9874 if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right 
9875 scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism 
9876 director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama 
9877 without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor 's home videos 
9878 a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favour the audience 
9879 de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork 
9880 an intelligent fiction about learning through cultural clash 
9881 greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill 
9882 you wo n't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who 's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all 
9883 there 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about 
9884 at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance 
9885 sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling 
9886 enough similarities to gymkata and howie long 's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs 
9887 despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show ... represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there 's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it 
9888 here 's a british flick gleefully unconcerned with plausibility , yet just as determined to entertain you 
9889 a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship 
9890 if i spy were funny -lrb- enough -rrb- or exciting -lrb- enough -rrb- then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public 
9891 a great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell does n't even have a great ending 
9892 demands too much of most viewers 
9893 rare is the ` urban comedy ' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie 
9894 its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer 
9895 a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish 
9896 arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie 
9897 the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable 
9898 a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless 
9899 while not as aggressively impressive as its american counterpart , `` in the bedroom , '' moretti 's film makes its own , quieter observations 
9900 asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy 
9901 aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend 
9902 imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno 
9903 a refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale 
9904 the marquis de sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be 
9905 somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional 
9906 ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy 's intrepid hero ? 
9907 the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer 
9908 the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us 
9909 u.s. audiences may find -lrb- attal and gainsbourg 's -rrb- unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what hollywood typically concocts 
9910 escapism in its purest form 
9911 the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed 
9912 works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren 
9913 sucking all the ` classic ' out of robert louis stevenson 's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst ... 
9914 audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film 's tart , sugar-free wit 
9915 despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy 
9916 nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them 
9917 it 's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director 's previous full frontal 
9918 even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad 
9919 the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense 
9920 the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear 
9921 the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of 
9922 it 's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental 
9923 it 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too 
9924 it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding 
9925 a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency 
9926 barely goes beyond comic book status 
9927 even if you ca n't pronounce `` gyro '' correctly , you 'll appreciate much of vardalos ' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries 
9928 borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu 
9929 fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored 
9930 it wo n't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking 
9931 once again , director jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action\/effects on the spectacular scale 
9932 as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys ' novel `` the death of napoleon '' and directed by alan taylor , napoleon 's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn 
9933 not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies 
9934 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original 
9935 a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy 
9936 a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans 
9937 sits uneasily as a horror picture ... but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family 
9938 lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel 
9939 an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video 
9940 it 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed 
9941 the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough 
9942 ridiculous 
9943 no. 
9944 if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker 's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life 's urgent questions 
9945 if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta 
9946 a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been 
9947 a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not 
9948 and in this regard , on guard delivers 
9949 something the true film buff will enjoy 
9950 the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached 
9951 a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing 
9952 the actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them 
9953 the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants ' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed 
9954 it 's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it 's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep 
9955 the result is something quite fresh and delightful 
9956 if you love motown music , you 'll love this documentary 
9957 it 's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be 
9958 you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they 're each interesting 
9959 -lrb- wendigo is -rrb- why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind 
9960 lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically 
9961 a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty 
9962 for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry 
9963 spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama 
9964 frida 's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it 's among the most breathtakingly designed films i 've ever seen 
9965 i hate this movie 
9966 not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it 's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies 
9967 the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity 
9968 like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel 
9969 city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes 
9970 it 's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary ... 
9971 this insightful , oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance 
9972 this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay 
9973 too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes 
9974 so young , so smart , such talent , such a wise \*\*\* 
9975 only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry 
9976 resourceful and ingenious entertainment 
9977 ` enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable 
9978 rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic 
9979 this romantic thriller is steeped in the atmosphere of wartime england , and ably captures the speech patterns , moral codes and ideals of the 1940s 
9980 reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film 
9981 a masterpiece four years in the making 
9982 polished korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as hollywood action epics 
9983 `` an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters 
9984 '' 
9985 in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns 
9986 do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman does n't work ? 
9987 this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he 's the most obvious one 
9988 the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry 
9989 the movie is n't always easy to look at 
9990 a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness 
9991 the movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension 
9992 digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world 
9993 it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy 
9994 impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises 
9995 the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive 
9996 her delivery and timing are flawless 
9997 if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title 
9998 almost every scene in this film is a gem that could stand alone , a perfectly realized observation of mood , behavior and intent 
9999 when it 's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper 
10000 like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause 
10001 boring we did n't 
10002 a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages 
10003 undercover brother does n't go far enough 
10004 moot point 
10005 let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home 
10006 as green-guts monster movies go , it 's a beaut 
10007 elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone 
10008 the movie is full of fine performances , led by josef bierbichler as brecht and monica bleibtreu as helene weigel , his wife 
10009 münch 's genuine insight makes the film 's occasional overindulgence forgivable 
10010 the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment 
10011 all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure 
10012 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut 
10013 the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script 
10014 beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at 
10015 this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through 
10016 for the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride 
10017 ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life 's stasis 
10018 no question 
10019 neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn 
10020 a compendium of solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes 
10021 all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit 
10022 biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame 
10023 anyone who can count to five -lrb- the film 's target market ? -rrb- 
10024 warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard 
10025 an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick 
10026 emerges as something rare , an issue movie that 's so honest and keenly observed that it does n't feel like one 
10027 cuts right through the b.s. giving a big middle-fingered `` shut up '' to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another 
10028 sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film 
10029 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic 
10030 thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking 
10031 it is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling -lrb- and an uneasy alliance , at that -rrb- 
10032 unfortunately , as a writer , mr. montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor 
10033 a long-winded , predictable scenario 
10034 invincible is a wonderful movie 
10035 earns its laughs from stock redneck ` types ' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing 
10036 a smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy 
10037 a moody horror\/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director 's well-known narrative gamesmanship 
10038 a dreadful live-action movie 
10039 s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results 
10040 for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies 
10041 though the controversial korean filmmaker 's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding 
10042 well worth the time 
10043 they felt like the same movie to me 
10044 witty , touching and well paced 
10045 i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr. holland 's class for the music , or to robin williams 's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve 
10046 this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998 's whatever 
10047 absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way 
10048 good movie 
10049 lilia 's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth 
10050 i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie -- for its historical significance alone 
10051 it 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school 
10052 but what spectacular sizzle it is ! 
10053 enduring love but exhausting cinema 
10054 stephen earnhart 's homespun documentary mule skinner blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens 
10055 it 's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its `` men in a sardine can '' warped logic 
10056 a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well 
10057 taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise 
10058 ... understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation 
10059 when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music 
10060 so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check 
10061 one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade 
10062 the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness 
10063 an amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail 
10064 time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets 
10065 a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth 
10066 ... the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats 
10067 these are lives worth watching , paths worth following 
10068 static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! 
10069 this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself 
10070 we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again 
10071 the wwii drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear 
10072 a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world 
10073 ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` what 's the point ? ' 
10074 the best movie of its kind since ` brazil 
10075 ' 
10076 as a director , mr. ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects 
10077 the disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on 
10078 davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces 
10079 it might be tempting to regard mr. andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr. earnhart 's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists 
10080 sadly , hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks 
10081 this one does 
10082 so what is the point ? 
10083 the issue of faith is not explored very deeply 
10084 everything that 's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television 
10085 my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie 
10086 director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building 
10087 i kept thinking over and over again , ' i should be enjoying this 
10088 ' 
10089 it 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie 
10090 do n't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches ... 
10091 i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war ... it 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink 
10092 the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension 
10093 an eccentric little comic\/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality 
10094 behan himself knew how to spin a tale and one ca n't help but think he 'd appreciate this attempt to turn his life into art 
10095 my goodness , queen latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts 
10096 often moving and explores the discomfort inherent in the contacts between the american ` hosts ' and their ` guests 
10097 ' 
10098 anthony hopkins ? 
10099 egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you 'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious 
10100 will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them 
10101 a chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags 
10102 the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction 
10103 this is one for the ages 
10104 the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense 
10105 bennett 's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that 's tough to shake 
10106 every so often a movie comes along that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it 
10107 a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material 
10108 the talents of the actors helps `` moonlight mile '' rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing 
10109 as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame 
10110 ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers 
10111 all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable 
10112 i wonder why 
10113 day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs 
10114 the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes 
10115 quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
10116 karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat 
10117 it is nature against progress 
10118 by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious 
10119 the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll 
10120 this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences 
10121 most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness 
10122 makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran 's borderlands 
10123 despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei 's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy 
10124 well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull 
10125 this is n't a narrative film -- i do n't know if it 's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i 'm sure some will try -- but it 's as close as anyone has dared to come 
10126 christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr. feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic 
10127 heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension 
10128 a clever blend of fact and fiction 
10129 all ms. jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters 
10130 there 's plenty of style in guillermo del toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes 
10131 the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi 
10132 a sudsy cautionary tale 
10133 the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers 
10134 it 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish 
10135 based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness 
10136 pray 's film works well and will appeal even to those who are n't too familiar with turntablism 
10137 those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find what time is it there ? 
10138 it 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff 
10139 it 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story 
10140 to the film 's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment 
10141 why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson ... and puke up something like rose red ? 
10142 an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood 
10143 though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work 
10144 well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons 
10145 outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time 
10146 sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth 
10147 there 's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking 
10148 a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term 
10149 this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema 's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable 
10150 newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg 
10151 vividly conveys both the pitfalls and the pleasures of over-the-top love 
10152 formula 51 is so trite that even yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor 
10153 when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily 
10154 flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey 
10155 too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette 
10156 overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek 's novel by some way 
10157 an incredibly low-rent danish film , it brings a group of people together in a sweet and charming way , if a little convenient 
10158 the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing 
10159 occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almodóvar style 
10160 high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character 
10161 pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura 
10162 a mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world 
10163 a movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults , as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats 
10164 -lrb- an -rrb- hilarious romantic comedy 
10165 both deeply weird and charmingly dear 
10166 the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch 
10167 the movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music 
10168 what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender 
10169 a hip ride into hyper-time , clockstoppers is a lively and enjoyable adventure for all ages at any time 
10170 it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise 
10171 occasionally melodramatic , it 's also extremely effective 
10172 a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more 
10173 it 's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness 
10174 an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street 
10175 rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down 
10176 the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year 
10177 it 's hard not to feel you 've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story 
10178 it 's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood 
10179 where last time jokes flowed out of cho 's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines 
10180 -lrb- but it 's -rrb- worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser 
10181 the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins 
10182 there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital 
10183 though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters 
10184 philip k. dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach 
10185 its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper 
10186 fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots 
10187 theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n't learn at the center of a kids ' story ? 
10188 the movie 's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow 
10189 it might as well have been problem child iv 
10190 feels like one of those contrived , only-in - hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk 
10191 good ol' urban legend stuff 
10192 the film 's greatest asset is how much it 's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture 
10193 home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do 
10194 ... a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original 
10195 if it 's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that 
10196 one of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind 
10197 sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece 
10198 painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year 's most accomplished and riveting film performances 
10199 do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor 
10200 he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works 
10201 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer 
10202 like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it 
10203 kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth -lrb- mojo -rrb- that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world 
10204 it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
10205 ... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world 
10206 while surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing 
10207 an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years 
10208 begins as a promising meditation on one of america 's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt 
10209 a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it 
10210 -lrb- howard -rrb- so good as leon barlow ... that he hardly seems to be acting 
10211 the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology 
10212 but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing 
10213 the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by 
10214 though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention 
10215 the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you ca n't wait to see what they do next 
10216 reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad 
10217 you 've already seen heartbreak if you 've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard 
10218 -lrb- fessenden -rrb- is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills 
10219 if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of `` the isle '' you 'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else 
10220 the plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality 
10221 jacquot 's tosca is a treat 
10222 you 're better off staying home and watching the x-files 
10223 the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes 
10224 the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense 
10225 divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it 's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances 
10226 the movie sticks much closer to hornby 's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did 
10227 the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one 
10228 the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts 
10229 but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds 
10230 the ending is a cop-out 
10231 the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket -lrb- second prize , of course , two free tickets -rrb- to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie 
10232 no , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences 
10233 but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person 
10234 bullock 's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film 
10235 say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue 
10236 all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click 
10237 you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes 
10238 proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie 
10239 workmanlike , maybe , but still a film with all the elements that made the other three great , scary times at the movies 
10240 this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone 's career 
10241 like the film 's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early - '80s suburbia , it 's significant without being overstated 
10242 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license 
10243 elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it 's therapeutic to laugh along with them 
10244 ... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film 
10245 a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk 'n' slash 
10246 take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo 's cool jackets 
10247 a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters 
10248 hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love 
10249 insomnia is involving 
10250 the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion 
10251 just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story 
10252 not a bad journey at all 
10253 has a shambling charm ... a cheerfully inconsequential diversion 
10254 passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless 
10255 the film 's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen 
10256 collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end 
10257 even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for disney 
10258 bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that does n't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it 
10259 although the editing might have been tighter , hush ! 
10260 it 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable 
10261 the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel 
10262 you could say that it 's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people would n't , but one thing you could n't say is that alias betty is predictable 
10263 hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic 
10264 it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come 
10265 a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man 
10266 a comprehensive and provocative film -- one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience 
10267 despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style 
10268 the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh does n't always improve the over-the-top mix 
10269 this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire 
10270 ` charly ' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy ... 
10271 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola 's inadequate performance 
10272 the performances are so leaden , michael rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud 
10273 a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film 
10274 the movie bounces all over the map 
10275 if there 's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr. demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a. addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic 
10276 there 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong 
10277 a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality 
10278 it 's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it 's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit 
10279 it 's as close as we 'll ever come to looking through a photographer 's viewfinder as he works 
10280 the film is all a little lit crit 101 , but it 's extremely well played and often very funny 
10281 it 's a trifle 
10282 de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli 
10283 funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , `` a city where people still read 
10284 '' 
10285 too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through 
10286 the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low 
10287 fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn 
10288 a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan 
10289 disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids ' books to the screen ... tuck everlasting is a little of both 
10290 though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following 
10291 this idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture 
10292 little more than a frothy vanity project 
10293 a depressing confirmation of everything those of us who do n't object to the description `` unelected '' have suspected all along : george w. bush is an incurious , uncharismatic , overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide 
10294 an enchanting film that presents an audacious tour of the past and takes within its warm embrace the bounties of cultural artifacts inside st. petersburg 's hermitage museum 
10295 the new guy does have a heart 
10296 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice 's complex akasha into a cartoon monster 
10297 nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity ... 
10298 few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness 
10299 i did n't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood 
10300 the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them 
10301 if you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere 
10302 the movie makes absolutely no sense 
10303 it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya 
10304 edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery 
10305 mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty 
10306 this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family 
10307 almost everything else is wan 
10308 as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , ` lovely ! 
10309 it never fails to engage us 
10310 it is now 
10311 only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee 's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents 
10312 or tom green as han solo ? 
10313 it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three 's company-style laugh track 
10314 shadyac shoots his film like an m. night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail 's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension 
10315 waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality 
10316 i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible 
10317 the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter 
10318 no more 
10319 -lrb- newton -rrb- wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality 
10320 i did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot 
10321 purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u.s. foreign policy has played in the rise of castro 
10322 a mild , reluctant , thumbs down 
10323 a tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man 's tortured soul 
10324 an original gem about an obsession with time 
10325 she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs 
10326 none of this violates the letter of behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor 
10327 tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool 
10328 a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance 
10329 this is art paying homage to art 
10330 happily for mr. chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match 
10331 makes s&m seem very romantic , and maggie gyllenhaal is a delight 
10332 like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike 
10333 how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us 
10334 despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is amy 's self-absorbed personality -- amy 's o 's honesty will win you over 
10335 it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion 
10336 in the second half of the film , frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis 
10337 the year 's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way 
10338 andersson creates a world that 's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad 
10339 an intelligent , moving and invigorating film 
10340 daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget 
10341 ... as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the star wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement 
10342 never -lrb- sinks -rrb- into exploitation 
10343 leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness 
10344 the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct 
10345 a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience 
10346 it 's hard not to be seduced by -lrb- witherspoon 's -rrb- charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max 
10347 glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism 
10348 with the film 's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved 
10349 you 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot 
10350 foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling 
10351 it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile 
10352 fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense 
10353 ... has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they 're ghosts imagining themselves as alive 
10354 tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth 
10355 this is carion 's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach 
10356 an elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller 
10357 stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd 
10358 the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece 
10359 hey , who else needs a shower ? 
10360 but even a hero can stumble sometimes 
10361 the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy 
10362 moore 's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995 's safe 
10363 not even the hanson brothers can save it 
10364 a picture that extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky , spirited fashion 
10365 too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it 's not a total loss 
10366 his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving 
10367 now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism 
10368 for the most part , the ingredients are there 
10369 hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world 
10370 an imaginative comedy\/thriller 
10371 technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial 
10372 the only thing in pauline and paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers 
10373 offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude 
10374 there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit 
10375 for anyone who grew up on disney 's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor 
10376 ... an inviting piece of film 
10377 ... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason 
10378 flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern 's thick , working-class scottish accent 
10379 maudlin and melodramatic we expected 
10380 shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption 
10381 not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey 
10382 the visuals alone make metropolis worth seeing 
10383 uncertain in tone ... a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things 
10384 a waste of good performances 
10385 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating 
10386 a bit of an unwieldy mess 
10387 the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety 
10388 julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan 
10389 a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe 
10390 noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama 
10391 liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase 
10392 a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction ! 
10393 propelled not by characters but by caricatures 
10394 never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man 
10395 here 's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah 
10396 every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point 
10397 one of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory 
10398 the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime 
10399 i like the new footage and still love the old stuff 
10400 i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women 
10401 without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie 
10402 gollum 's ` performance ' is incredible ! 
10403 superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line 
10404 there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them 
10405 an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story 
10406 if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins 
10407 a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy 
10408 a sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about 
10409 flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with 
10410 director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one 
10411 it would have benefitted the dialogue 
10412 lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and does n't know how to have fun 
10413 this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray 
10414 it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes 
10415 kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action 
10416 you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing 
10417 the tenderness of the piece is still intact 
10418 these people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance 
10419 a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller 
10420 the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day 
10421 while undercover brother is definitely one for the masses , it 's also full of sharp , smart satire 
10422 two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more 's the pity 
10423 visits spy-movie territory like a novel you ca n't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last 
10424 just how extreme are these ops ? 
10425 too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing 
10426 it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media ... to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks 
10427 just one problem : fish out of water usually die 
10428 some actors steal scenes 
10429 this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics 
10430 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial 
10431 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter 
10432 a tough go , but leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu 
10433 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin 
10434 a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable 
10435 while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at 
10436 denis and co-writer michele petin 's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing 
10437 expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies 
10438 lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new 
10439 the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies 
10440 he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about 
10441 an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you 're getting its metaphysical point 
10442 majidi 's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times 
10443 it 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original 
10444 westfeldt and juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that 's both saucy and endearing 
10445 quite funny for the type of movie it is ... 
10446 run , do n't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen 
10447 matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy 
10448 a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie 
10449 a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine ` twist ' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense 
10450 i 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s 
10451 dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter 
10452 when it 's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable 
10453 a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes 
10454 a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race 
10455 usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it 
10456 mr. wedge and mr. saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well 
10457 longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days 
10458 a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered 
10459 the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor 
10460 do n't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life 
10461 a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia 's film history 
10462 too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century 
10463 plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial 
10464 all that -lrb- powerpuff girls -rrb- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin 
10465 jirí hubac 's script is a gem 
10466 as -lrb- the characters -rrb- get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound 
10467 even when foreign directors ... borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting 
10468 in a word -- yes 
10469 feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention 
10470 no worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go 
10471 this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment 
10472 admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch 
10473 `` the emperor 's new clothes '' begins with a simple plan ... well , at least that 's the plan 
10474 often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter 's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie 
10475 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original 
10476 cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent 's days 
10477 friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it 's called where 's chris tucker when you need him ? 
10478 extremely confusing 
10479 -lrb- hawn 's character -rrb- is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten 
10480 well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special 
10481 but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi 
10482 son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness 
10483 it 's laughing at us 
10484 haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you 're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed 
10485 like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness 
10486 this film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation 
10487 helmer devito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' tv and revenge 
10488 the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny 
10489 4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it 's the ultimate redneck road-trip 
10490 still , i 'm not quite sure what the point is ... 
10491 has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ? 
10492 after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin 
10493 unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit 
10494 by the end of no such thing the audience , like beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster 
10495 a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -lrb- woody allen -rrb- has made in the last twenty years 
10496 the production values are up there 
10497 rates an ` e ' for effort -- and a ` b ' for boring 
10498 it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less 
10499 the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain 
10500 being author wells ' great-grandson , you 'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material 
10501 a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers 
10502 it 's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured 
10503 like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest 
10504 whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion 
10505 there are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv 
10506 smith 's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes 
10507 a shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional 
10508 its direction , its script , and weaver 's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that 's what you 're in the mood for 
10509 it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he 's been making for the last several years 
10510 `` collateral damage '' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment -- until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief 
10511 still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral 
10512 a blessed gift to film geeks and historians 
10513 what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level 
10514 it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit 
10515 yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature 
10516 there 's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film ... or the emotional integrity of the performances 
10517 whether you 're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you 'll still feel something 
10518 a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino 
10519 an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true 
10520 moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance 
10521 this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all 
10522 boisterous and daft documentary 
10523 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric 
10524 what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical 
10525 is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? 
10526 the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students 
10527 the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset 
10528 roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut 
10529 maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this 
10530 ... there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen 
10531 i loved it ! 
10532 brilliant ! ' 
10533 some studio pizazz might have helped 
10534 it will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary 
10535 all the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi 
10536 a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level 
10537 a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations 
10538 the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge 
10539 director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` the longest yard '' playbook like a checklist 
10540 i have n't seen one in so long , no wonder i did n't recognize it at first 
10541 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up 
10542 cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing 
10543 you can practically smell the patchouli oil 
10544 cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone 
10545 what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment 
10546 this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow 
10547 it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture 
10548 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor 
10549 maguire is a surprisingly effective peter\/spider-man 
10550 windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live 
10551 for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded 
10552 so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart 
10553 a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido 
10554 cho 's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience 
10555 about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream 
10556 ... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work 
10557 ... in this incarnation its fizz is infectious 
10558 the gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook 
10559 it 's just incredibly dull 
10560 genuinely touching because it 's realistic about all kinds of love 
10561 nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year 
10562 it 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more 
10563 a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python 's meaning of life 
10564 a graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined 
10565 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 
10566 a little too pat for its own good 
10567 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay 
10568 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential 
10569 if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror 
10570 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards 
10571 for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale 
10572 had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago 
10573 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed\/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation 
10574 there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false 
10575 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script 
10576 just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail 
10577 mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness 
10578 ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it 's all over his chelsea walls 
10579 the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles 
10580 an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection 
10581 extremely dumb 
10582 in the end , ted bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context 
10583 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising 
10584 just what makes us happy , anyway ? 
10585 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke 
10586 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after -lrb- or during -rrb- consumption of its second half 
10587 enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later 
10588 leave these flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine 
10589 when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility 
10590 may be spoofing an easy target -- those old ' 50 's giant creature features -- but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today 
10591 morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start 
10592 all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto 
10593 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession 
10594 it 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition 
10595 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you 've imagined the ring 
10596 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions 
10597 it 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana 's future 
10598 think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind 
10599 hilarious , acidic brit comedy 
10600 an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams 
10601 myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another 
10602 but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting 
10603 a marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption 
10604 whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment 
10605 how did it ever get made ? 
10606 it is also , at times , curiously moving 
10607 it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs 
10608 a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services 
10609 the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game 
10610 the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la 
10611 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it does n't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story 
10612 worth the effort to watch 
10613 morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either 
10614 everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan 's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true 
10615 grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte 
10616 just a bloody mess 
10617 suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video 
10618 the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today 's cinema du sarcasm 
10619 i do n't think i 've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto 's iron man 
10620 the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question 
10621 anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women 's self-actualization knows few continental divides 
10622 kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed 
10623 as an actor , the rock is aptly named 
10624 thoughtful , provocative and entertaining 
10625 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why 
10626 at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts 
10627 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding 
10628 places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller 
10629 the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom 
10630 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere 
10631 there 's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm 
10632 good for a few unintentional laughs , `` extreme ops '' was obviously made for the `` xxx '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction 
10633 tim story 's not there yet - but ` barbershop ' shows he 's on his way 
10634 a sports movie with action that 's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it 
10635 those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they do n't really want to know 
10636 the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure 
10637 what happened with pluto nash ? 
10638 using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead 
10639 notorious c.h.o. has oodles of vulgar highlights 
10640 before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon 
10641 it 's just a silly black genre spoof 
10642 as written by michael berg and michael j. wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all 
10643 in fessenden 's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale 
10644 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings 
10645 offers that rare combination of entertainment and education 
10646 romanek keeps the film constantly taut ... reflecting the character 's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score 
10647 despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there 's no scene that screams `` bathroom break ! '' 
10648 greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders 
10649 the heightened symmetry of this new\/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time 
10650 moore 's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that 's still very much playing itself out 
10651 there 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity 
10652 hip-hop has a history , and it 's a metaphor for this love story 
10653 as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining 
10654 engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship 
10655 eventually , it wins you over 
10656 you 'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it 
10657 effective but too-tepid biopic 
10658 if we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get 
10659 the acting alone is worth the price of admission 
10660 i admired this work a lot 
10661 might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr. eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage 
10662 it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world 
10663 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal 
10664 highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager 
10665 bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability 
10666 the 3d images only enhance the film 's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen 
10667 this version 's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful 
10668 it 's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be 
10669 if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps 
10670 but some unexpected zigs and zags help 
10671 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer 
10672 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another 
10673 an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale 
10674 de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest 
10675 the master of disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy 
10676 as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes were n't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create 
10677 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven 
10678 a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive 's attention to detail 
10679 interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals ` red dragon ' right from under their noses 
10680 what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent 
10681 if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan 
10682 a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master 's steady stroke 
10683 offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works 
10684 there is n't a weak or careless performance amongst them 
10685 the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide 
10686 brimful 
10687 it virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while 
10688 the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin 
10689 fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox 's work 
10690 viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson 's novel will likely prefer disney 's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic 
10691 novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach 
10692 what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness 
10693 i enjoyed the ride -lrb- bumps and all -rrb- , creamy depth , and ultimate theme 
10694 what you get with empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead 
10695 a very average science fiction film 
10696 it 's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak 
10697 the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off 
10698 verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills 
10699 no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either 
10700 the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin 
10701 though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static 
10702 we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride 
10703 complex , affecting and uniquely almodóvar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong 
10704 maybe it 's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades ... but honestly , analyze that really is n't all that bad 
10705 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory 
10706 a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america 's culture of fear 
10707 while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun 
10708 theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical 
10709 the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr. desplechin is content to state it 
10710 the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it 
10711 great story , bad idea for a movie 
10712 cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i 'm not one of them 
10713 while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it 's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy 
10714 while benigni -lrb- who stars and co-wrote -rrb- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that 
10715 smith 's point is simple and obvious -- people 's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers 
10716 divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy 
10717 extremely boring 
10718 an impossible romance , but we root for the patronized iranian lad 
10719 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it 'll be on video by then 
10720 eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler 's many talents 
10721 too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise 
10722 if there 's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it 's in projects like the -lrb- unfortunately r-rated -rrb- paid 
10723 you 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus 
10724 an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids 
10725 it 's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more 
10726 there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject 
10727 more honest about alzheimer 's disease , i think , than iris 
10728 hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading 
10729 what 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class 
10730 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented 
10731 some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast 
10732 it would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 
10733 you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you 'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story 
10734 a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it 
10735 effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience 
10736 life is a crock -- or something like it 
10737 a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind 
10738 from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent 's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir 
10739 is n't quite the equal of woo 's best earlier work , but it 's easily his finest american film ... comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films 
10740 secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny 
10741 the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat 
10742 automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf 
10743 it 's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer 
10744 one minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and\/or sailor moon have been spliced in 
10745 director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini 's famous love-jealousy - murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation 
10746 this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story 
10747 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater 
10748 never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery 
10749 choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy 
10750 makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man 's greatness 
10751 an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living 
10752 the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time 
10753 unfortunately , they 're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo 's life imaginable 
10754 this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long 
10755 it 's like a poem 
10756 ... lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar 
10757 a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half 
10758 earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast 
10759 it 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun 
10760 a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to 
10761 here , thankfully , they are 
10762 a sour , nasty offering 
10763 everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones 
10764 this time kaufman 's imagination has failed him 
10765 ... breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters 
10766 ' 
10767 suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal 
10768 the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects 
10769 has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act 
10770 this is junk food cinema at its greasiest 
10771 clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie 
10772 -lrb- director -rrb- byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one 
10773 if you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now 
10774 a miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out 
10775 shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme 
10776 frailty is n't as gory or explicit 
10777 choose your reaction : a. -rrb- that sure is funny ! 
10778 it 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile 
10779 it 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u.s. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in french -lrb- well , mostly -rrb- with english subtitles and is magically ` significant ' because of that 
10780 droll caper-comedy remake of `` big deal on madonna street '' that 's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate `` bellini '' begins to look like a `` real kaputschnik 
10781 '' 
10782 call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film 
10783 search it out 
10784 it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count 
10785 japan 's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date 
10786 easier to respect than enthuse over , andersson 's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing 
10787 and if the hours wins ` best picture ' i just might 
10788 another rent installment for the ian fleming estate 
10789 instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart 's war , like the st. louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started 
10790 murderous maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth 
10791 some of seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot 
10792 one of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever 
10793 for caine lovers only 
10794 it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb 
10795 elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one 
10796 a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience 
10797 opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between 
10798 ... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs 
10799 thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings 
10800 farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis 's world-weary colonel 
10801 that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered 
10802 it 's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet 
10803 those who would follow haneke on his creepy explorations ... are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from huppert and magimel 
10804 it 's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner 
10805 but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship 
10806 a fascinating and fun film 
10807 the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick 
10808 a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life 
10809 the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary 
10810 wait for video -- and then do n't rent it 
10811 an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best 
10812 remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? 
10813 -lrb- i -rrb- f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you 've already seen this kind of thing 
10814 excellent acting and direction 
10815 a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american 's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle 
10816 a very funny movie 
10817 both awful and appealing 
10818 wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together 
10819 ranks among willams ' best screen work 
10820 you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling 
10821 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it 's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it 's told by the people who were there 
10822 these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining 
10823 it 's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart 
10824 had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin 
10825 scotland , pa. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole 
10826 there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering 
10827 the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious 
10828 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well 
10829 the seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going 
10830 an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone 
10831 what kids will discover is a new collectible 
10832 could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? 
10833 even die-hard fans of japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge 
10834 it 's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds 
10835 this is an hour and a half of daydreaming 
10836 ford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier 
10837 that rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind 
10838 could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? 
10839 while mcfarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films ... it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys ' story 
10840 when -lrb- de palma 's -rrb- bad , he 's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done 
10841 behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies -lrb- plus one sheep dog -rrb- , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart 
10842 a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners 
10843 hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette 's dialogue 
10844 a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect 
10845 dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee 
10846 look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music 
10847 presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it 
10848 the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other 
10849 but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick -lrb- remember cabin boy ? -rrb- 
10850 besides , real movie producers are n't this nice 
10851 mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness 
10852 this is how you use special effects 
10853 haneke keeps us at arm 's length 
10854 like its two predecessors , 1983 's koyaanisqatsi and 1988 's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever 
10855 what 's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world 
10856 he 's super spy ! 
10857 though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr. schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear 
10858 i do n't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh 's full frontal , though that did n't stop me from enjoying much of it 
10859 has the feel of an unedited personal journal 
10860 the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next 
10861 skip work to see it at the first opportunity 
10862 ecks this one off your must-see list 
10863 gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film 
10864 drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality 
10865 human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control 
10866 the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs 
10867 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive 
10868 the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic 
10869 so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality 
10870 smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way 
10871 the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon 
10872 merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone 
10873 but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here 
10874 not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny 
10875 murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous 
10876 even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good 
10877 the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone 
10878 there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production 
10879 but in 2002 , such revelations wilt 
10880 it 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks 
10881 gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? 
10882 engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying 
10883 birot 's directorial debut -lrb- she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré -rrb- is n't so much bad as it is bland 
10884 as bundy , michael reilly burke -lrb- octopus 2 : river of fear -rrb- has just the right amount of charisma and menace 
10885 it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original 
10886 scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be 
10887 b. -rrb- that sure is pathetic ! 
10888 this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life 
10889 all 's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags 
10890 the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun 
10891 it wo n't bust your gut -- and it 's not intended to -- it 's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke 
10892 it 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor 
10893 several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare 
10894 -lrb- u -rrb- nrelentingly stupid 
10895 or a profit 
10896 the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc. 
10897 compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder 
10898 faultlessly professional but finally slight 
10899 renner 's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing 
10900 big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities 
10901 afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen 's men is finally just one long drag 
10902 bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he ca n't help throwing in a few of his own touches 
10903 a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots 
10904 it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun 
10905 a recipe for cinematic disaster ... part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad 
10906 hands down the year 's most thought-provoking film 
10907 the furious coherence that -lrb- deniro -rrb- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing 
10908 there was time on that second round to see the subtleties of ramsay 's portrait of grief 
10909 perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about 
10910 you might not buy the ideas 
10911 looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due 
10912 as shaky as the plot is , kaufman 's script is still memorable for some great one-liners 
10913 not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it 's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare 
10914 this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you 'll be glad you went along for the ride 
10915 too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless 
10916 at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about 
10917 a compelling journey ... and `` his best friend remembers '' is up there with the finest of specials 
10918 a real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us do n't know 
10919 after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna 
10920 but buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie 
10921 a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against ... well , just stuff 
10922 the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout 
10923 this horror-comedy does n't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira 's hooters 
10924 yes , you are , ben kingsley 
10925 what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved 
10926 it 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre 
10927 the title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is 
10928 a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned 
10929 nothing about it fits 
10930 the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep 
10931 ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance 
10932 it 's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic 
10933 a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass 
10934 it 's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable 
10935 must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry 
10936 does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively 
10937 when the first few villians are introduced as `` spider '' and `` snake '' you know you 're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak 
10938 this is n't a `` friday '' worth waiting for 
10939 maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional 
10940 even the unwatchable soapdish is more original 
10941 a wildly funny prison caper 
10942 it 's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru 
10943 obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! 
10944 nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera 
10945 unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me 
10946 its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing 
10947 when a film is created solely because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result 
10948 often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed 
10949 when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart 
10950 there 's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable 
10951 it 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views 
10952 although very much like the first movie based on j.k. rowling 's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude 
10953 though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal woody at best 
10954 merchant effectively translates naipaul 's lively mix of characters from the page to screen 
10955 others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore 's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding 
10956 you 've seen them a million times 
10957 the comic performances are all spot on , especially lee ross 's turn as ken 
10958 nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about 
10959 message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? 
10960 disney 's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem 
10961 first good , then bothersome 
10962 to portray modern women the way director davis has done is just unthinkable 
10963 adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse 
10964 manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas 
10965 even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs. sever is a dumb action movie 
10966 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it 's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch 
10967 ... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life 
10968 human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better 
10969 a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men 
10970 but this time there 's some mold on the gold 
10971 a model of what films like this should be like 
10972 a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title 
10973 light , cute and forgettable 
10974 -lrb- t -rrb- hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality does n't work in a modern context 
10975 a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones 
10976 immediately 
10977 melanie eventually slugs the yankee 
10978 a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil ' bow wow 
10979 aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol 's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it 
10980 a fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in japanese animation 
10981 if the ' 70 's were your idea of a good time at the movies , this will make you very happy 
10982 a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort 
10983 the hours is what movies are supposed to be ... 
10984 just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat 
10985 when it really counts ... bloody sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language 
10986 for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear 
10987 ... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time 
10988 a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution 
10989 nothing more than a mediocre trifle 
10990 full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience 
10991 this is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times 
10992 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production 
10993 equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama 
10994 johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to 
10995 not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care 
10996 audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school 
10997 a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy 
10998 a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness 
10999 as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled -lrb- literally and figuratively -rrb- by desire ... -lrb- sex and lucía -rrb- makes for an arousing good time 
11000 a work of intricate elegance , literary lyricism and profound common sense 
11001 solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts 
11002 remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster ... done up by howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand 
11003 for all its serious sense of purpose ... -lrb- it -rrb- finds a way to lay bare the tragedies of its setting with a good deal of warmth and humor 
11004 far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place ... innocent and well-meaning 
11005 despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions 
11006 the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task 
11007 the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted 
11008 it helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well 
11009 one of -lrb- herzog 's -rrb- least inspired works 
11010 the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller 
11011 the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case 
11012 as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure 
11013 it 's an awfully derivative story 
11014 now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie 
11015 fails to bring as much to the table 
11016 sturdy , entertaining period drama ... both caine and fraser have their moments 
11017 focuses on joan 's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her `` madness '' so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century torture device 
11018 there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema 's finest this year 
11019 dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement 
11020 narc may not get an ` a ' for originality , but it wears its b-movie heritage like a badge of honor 
11021 the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly 
11022 i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending 
11023 a tv episode inflated past its natural length 
11024 zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure 
11025 the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine 
11026 it 's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world 
11027 celebrated at sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that 's hard to beat 
11028 -lrb- davis -rrb- has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race 
11029 enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment 
11030 by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , auto focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing 
11031 the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses 
11032 watching trouble every day , at least if you do n't know what 's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms 
11033 a journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman 's brilliance almost makes worth taking 
11034 rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as monsoon wedding 
11035 the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them 
11036 what happens to john q ? 
11037 there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust 
11038 a thoughtful look at a painful incident that made headlines in 1995 
11039 an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort 
11040 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman -lrb- who never gets to play that flute -rrb- has all the charm of a meltdown 
11041 marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess 
11042 as teen movies go , `` orange county '' is a refreshing change 
11043 there 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant 
11044 attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage 
11045 with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path 
11046 a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales 
11047 flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year 's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat 
11048 lame , haphazard teen comedy 
11049 somewhat blurred , but kinnear 's performance is razor sharp 
11050 ... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense 
11051 no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story 
11052 the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama 
11053 just pound away 
11054 a slick , skillful little horror film 
11055 there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it 's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises 
11056 more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent 
11057 ... does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters ' choices , good and ill , that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought 
11058 on the surface , it 's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz 's and kieslowski 's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique 
11059 in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did 
11060 it helps that lil bow wow ... tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid 
11061 finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original 
11062 most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots 
11063 began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course 
11064 it 's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel ... 
11065 parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde 's still-contemporary play 
11066 much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -lrb- the movie 's -rrb- mindset 
11067 but based on cq , i 'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project 
11068 disturbing and brilliant documentary 
11069 chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror 
11070 windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop 
11071 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness 
11072 to say analyze that is de niro 's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career 
11073 an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world 
11074 the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors 
11075 the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt 
11076 this film is full of rabbits 
11077 alas , it 's neither 
11078 ... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core 
11079 men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce 
11080 not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve 's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters 
11081 it 's astonishing 
11082 a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch 
11083 a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution 
11084 a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser 
11085 between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap 
11086 the central story lacks punch 
11087 not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i 've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' 
11088 hmm 
11089 a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy 
11090 a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality 
11091 if you 're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite 
11092 all in all , there 's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone 
11093 it 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma 
11094 we need -lrb- moore 's -rrb- noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones 
11095 roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck -- few filmmakers will 
11096 gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife 
11097 national lampoon 's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion 
11098 the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected 
11099 i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation 
11100 over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that 's got oodles of style and substance 
11101 it has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it 's over 
11102 possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it 's directed by ... neil labute 
11103 -lrb- broomfield -rrb- uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue 
11104 it 's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides 
11105 has a plot full of twists upon knots ... and a nonstop parade of mock-tarantino scuzbag types that starts out clever but veers into overkill 
11106 there 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought 
11107 this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy 
11108 a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills 
11109 -lrb- it 's -rrb- a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy 
11110 there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting 
11111 rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next 
11112 if this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook 
11113 here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get 
11114 jagger the actor is someone you want to see again 
11115 the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter 
11116 murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together 
11117 but in imax 3-d , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography 
11118 there 's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career 
11119 the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath ... 
11120 ... a roller-coaster ride of a movie 
11121 just like hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination 
11122 tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point 
11123 god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse 
11124 the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act 
11125 the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue 
11126 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense de palma creates 
11127 the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound 
11128 hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors 
11129 in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works 
11130 when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray 's game of chinese whispers with mr bean 
11131 not always too whimsical for its own good -lrb- but enough to do harm -rrb- , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs 
11132 well before it 's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels 
11133 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy 
11134 i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off 
11135 lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose 
11136 oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven 
11137 with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door 
11138 marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie 
11139 the film 's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john 
11140 the movie 's eventual success should be credited to dennis quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor 
11141 the actors do n't inhabit their roles -- they 're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes 
11142 strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery 
11143 vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship 
11144 bow 's best moments are when he 's getting busy on the basketball court because that 's when he really scores 
11145 a movie that tries to fuse the two ` woods ' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess 
11146 but that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients 
11147 who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images do n't have to add up to mesmerize you 
11148 it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling 
11149 sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution 
11150 undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters 
11151 some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future 
11152 the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap 
11153 this time out , -lrb- sade -rrb- is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested 
11154 a pleasant romantic comedy 
11155 the director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -lrb- most notably wretched sound design -rrb- 
11156 must be seen to be believed 
11157 ... a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life 
11158 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever 
11159 birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it 
11160 it 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction 
11161 it 's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene 
11162 it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning 
11163 shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity 
11164 it 's painful 
11165 chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws 
11166 the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
11167 is office work really as alienating as ` bartleby ' so effectively makes it ? 
11168 a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within 
11169 as blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , el bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance 
11170 morton is , as usual , brilliant 
11171 the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn 
11172 ... a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway 
11173 what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale -- as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters 
11174 culkin , who 's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield 
11175 for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man 's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out 
11176 falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny 
11177 it wo n't be long before you 'll spy i spy at a video store near you 
11178 oh , it 's extreme , all right 
11179 an engaging overview of johnson 's eccentric career 
11180 proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report 
11181 that is essentially what 's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point 
11182 the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design 
11183 this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring 
11184 sorry , charlie 
11185 it 's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he 's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech 
11186 in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century ... takes kurys ' career to a whole new level 
11187 the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is 
11188 the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them 
11189 ... -lrb- a -rrb- strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense 
11190 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor 
11191 another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through 
11192 nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre 
11193 led by griffin 's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material 
11194 it 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high 
11195 i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief 
11196 with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept. 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire 's bright side 
11197 the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging 
11198 the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending 
11199 girls gone wild and gone civil again 
11200 but what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
11201 he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality 
11202 the movie 's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries 
11203 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten 
11204 is n't it great ? 
11205 enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd 
11206 this is as powerful a set of evidence as you 'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives 
11207 guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things 
11208 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor 
11209 ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year 's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum 
11210 some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations 
11211 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole 
11212 human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal 
11213 does n't amount to much of anything 
11214 huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she 'll crack 
11215 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema 
11216 lead provocatuers testud and parmentier give superlative performances 
11217 apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable tv 
11218 between the drama of cube ? 
11219 while the glass slipper does n't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale 
11220 meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it 's so bad it 's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie 
11221 rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation 
11222 when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble 
11223 this overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd 
11224 having never been a huge fan of dickens ' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath 's version 
11225 it 's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone 's head 
11226 the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction 
11227 if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg 
11228 i 've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one 
11229 the problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot 
11230 it 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script 
11231 the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business 
11232 so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun 
11233 this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring 
11234 a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats 
11235 i tried to read the time on my watch 
11236 writer\/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and kate 's jealous female friends become downright despicable 
11237 cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed 
11238 the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun 
11239 i like frank the pug , though 
11240 an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma 
11241 largely a for-fans artifact 
11242 an involving true story of a chinese actor who takes up drugs and winds up in an institution -- acted mostly by the actual people involved 
11243 nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you 'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it 
11244 would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year 
11245 ... a well-observed and disturbing little movie 
11246 an incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar -lrb- and peculiarly venomous -rrb- bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy 
11247 movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation 
11248 lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i could n't help being captivated by it 
11249 the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life 
11250 it 's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie 's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia 
11251 though the film 's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare 
11252 kinnear gives a tremendous performance 
11253 perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions 
11254 dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm 
11255 ... both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat 
11256 ' 
11257 windtalkers blows this way and that , but there 's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass , true to himself 
11258 an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson 
11259 ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but do n't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here 
11260 the new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted 
11261 sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre 
11262 it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future 
11263 the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare 
11264 although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser 's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious 
11265 claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications 
11266 to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist 
11267 the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess 
11268 daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who are n't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war 
11269 it 's also the year 's sweetest movie 
11270 this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story 's a little weak 
11271 a whole lot foul , freaky and funny 
11272 there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy ... but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an iranian specialty 
11273 for me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings 
11274 a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect 
11275 and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy 
11276 lawrence preaches strictly to the converted 
11277 given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much 
11278 `` antwone fisher '' is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington 
11279 succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series 
11280 you do n't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor 's club 
11281 the film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place 
11282 if you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog 
11283 the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus 
11284 the best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now 
11285 by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what 's possible and what we might do to make it so 
11286 after making several adaptations of other writers ' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject 
11287 all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure 
11288 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones 
11289 a sly game of cat and mouse that 's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances 
11290 ... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise 
11291 what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about 
11292 i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha 
11293 unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity 
11294 the film delivers not just the full assault of reno 's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days 
11295 one groan-inducing familiarity begets another 
11296 john mctiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga 
11297 an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives 
11298 a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking 
11299 but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck 's film from coming together 
11300 too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining 
11301 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized 
11302 everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing 
11303 the best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates 
11304 a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence 
11305 we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict 
11306 one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you 're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you did n't know was being taken 
11307 i believe the message is in the messenger : the agent is a woman 
11308 mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun 
11309 but i was n't 
11310 though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance 
11311 a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker 
11312 most impressive , though , is the film 's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters ' emotional wounds 
11313 it 's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell 
11314 a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move 
11315 it 's fairly self-aware in its dumbness 
11316 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves 
11317 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film 
11318 watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good 
11319 a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them 
11320 that 's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan 's existence 
11321 there 's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that 's what makes it irresistible 
11322 a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with ... it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm 
11323 this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese 's best in more than a decade 
11324 for a good chunk of its running time , trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller 
11325 full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he 's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000 
11326 even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of todd farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship 
11327 as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness 
11328 the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women 
11329 but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked 
11330 made by jackasses for jackasses 
11331 if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna 
11332 pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick 
11333 topkapi this is not 
11334 but he somehow pulls it off 
11335 the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture 
11336 bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that 
11337 an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s 
11338 it is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish 
11339 a worthwhile way to spend two hours 
11340 illuminating if overly talky documentary 
11341 never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds 
11342 two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama 
11343 -lrb- gai -rrb- comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form 
11344 a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags 
11345 it does n't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than `` confessions of a dangerous mind 
11346 '' 
11347 filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low 
11348 then lower them a bit more 
11349 i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind 
11350 a very bad sign 
11351 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr. deeds was to that of frank capra 
11352 sometimes , that 's enough 
11353 well , it does go on forever 
11354 there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double 
11355 this is n't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it 's the cliffsnotes with pages missing 
11356 it 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old 
11357 fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water 
11358 guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens 
11359 it 's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh 
11360 there 's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes 
11361 it 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it 
11362 `` its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right 
11363 '' 
11364 an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind 
11365 it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't 
11366 john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie 
11367 tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable 
11368 this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director 
11369 a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely can not last 
11370 the film 's center will not hold 
11371 it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle 
11372 literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes 
11373 it 's also stupider 
11374 none of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter 
11375 sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film 
11376 a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror 
11377 although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours 
11378 ` abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' ... you should definitely let dante 's gloomy words be your guide 
11379 he can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he 'll get the girl 
11380 so i just did 
11381 an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent 
11382 there 's not enough to sustain the comedy 
11383 fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters 
11384 the film is really not so much bad as bland 
11385 schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler 's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad 
11386 a vivid cinematic portrait 
11387 it 's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro 
11388 the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups 
11389 alex nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl 
11390 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object 
11391 ... tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope 
11392 it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment 
11393 frenetic but not really funny 
11394 sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open 
11395 it 's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really does n't fit the part 
11396 ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact amber is such a joke 
11397 this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it 's hard to know what to praise first 
11398 apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths 
11399 andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance 
11400 -lrb- anderson -rrb- uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense 
11401 this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border 
11402 this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience 
11403 dazzling and sugar-sweet , a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver 
11404 from the big giant titles of the opening credits to elmer bernstein 's perfectly melodic score , haynes gets just about everything right 
11405 watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives 
11406 as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing 
11407 working from elliott 's memoir , rohmer fashions the sort of delicate , articulate character - and - relationship study he 's favored for decades 
11408 watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both 
11409 intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area 
11410 -lrb- a -rrb- rare , beautiful film 
11411 ... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs 
11412 suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum 
11413 while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there 's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls ca n't swim 
11414 opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` glory : a soldier 's story 
11415 '' 
11416 ... an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal 's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs 
11417 it 's -lrb- ricci 's -rrb- best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world 's misery with blind good will 
11418 is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco 's last album ? 
11419 this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age 
11420 it tells more than it shows 
11421 evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children -- and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good 
11422 director clare kilner 's debut is never as daft as it should have been 
11423 as expected , sayles ' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances 
11424 ... the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes `` what time is it there ? '' 
11425 too bad the former murphy brown does n't pop reese back 
11426 it 's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth 
11427 taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore 
11428 george clooney proves he 's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he 's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind 
11429 ... mesmerizing , an eye-opening tour of modern beijing culture in a journey of rebellion , retreat into oblivion and return 
11430 the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing 
11431 a potent allegorical love story 
11432 provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz 
11433 it 's endearing to hear madame d. refer to her husband as ` jackie ' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer 
11434 so few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler 
11435 needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey 
11436 calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls 
11437 overly stylized with lots of flash black - & - white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , -lrb- it 's -rrb- at its worst when it 's actually inside the ring 
11438 it is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some 
11439 it 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss 
11440 the appearance of treebeard and gollum 's expanded role will either have you loving what you 're seeing , or rolling your eyes 
11441 now , if it only had a brain 
11442 a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives 
11443 like a south-of-the-border melrose place 
11444 it 's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements 
11445 this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie 
11446 fans of behan 's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy 
11447 everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse 
11448 a startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society 
11449 although it 's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do 
11450 watching haneke 's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment 
11451 once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care 
11452 but like bruce springsteen 's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins 
11453 stay clear of reminding yourself that it 's a `` true story '' and you 're likely to have one helluva time at the movies 
11454 so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program 
11455 lends itself to the narcotizing bland -lrb- sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie -rrb- machinations of the biennial disney boy movie 
11456 in the process , they demonstrate that there 's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema 
11457 though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium 
11458 what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy 
11459 it 's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice 
11460 like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them 
11461 a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love 
11462 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time 
11463 a soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie 
11464 though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial 
11465 only two words will tell you what you know when deciding to see it : anthony 
11466 there 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent 
11467 achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium 
11468 if you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , wasabi is a good place to start 
11469 but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour 
11470 ... always remains movingly genuine 
11471 maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` full frontal '' seems , well , contrived 
11472 the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels 
11473 a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home 
11474 schindler 's list it ai n't 
11475 a compelling portrait of moral emptiness 
11476 let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested 
11477 -lrb- a -rrb- superbly controlled , passionate adaptation of graham greene 's 1955 novel 
11478 a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film 
11479 no , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else 
11480 a comic gem with some serious sparkles 
11481 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats 
11482 the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes 
11483 a bravura exercise in emptiness 
11484 this concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where its intended under-12 audience is concerned 
11485 this one 's weaker than most 
11486 a lighthearted , feel-good film that embraces the time-honored truth that the most powerful thing in life is love 
11487 the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence 
11488 i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations 
11489 a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin 's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison 
11490 rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual 
11491 an offbeat , sometimes gross and surprisingly appealing animated film about the true meaning of the holidays 
11492 the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie 
11493 another great ` what you do n't see ' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances 
11494 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce 
11495 feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers 
11496 going to the website may be just as fun -lrb- and scary -rrb- as going to the film 
11497 is this progress ? 
11498 for a shoot - 'em - up , ballistic is oddly lifeless 
11499 one of the best of the year 
11500 there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected -lrb- and gentle -rrb- way 
11501 credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter 
11502 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination 
11503 bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences 
11504 a solidly seaworthy chiller 
11505 high on melodrama 
11506 when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever 
11507 if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead 
11508 still , i thought it could have been more 
11509 a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard 's pyromania 
11510 though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them 
11511 like mike does n't win any points for originality 
11512 ms. fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn 
11513 the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense 
11514 legendary irish writer brendan behan 's memoir , borstal boy , has been given a loving screen transferral 
11515 at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it 's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do 
11516 it 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold 
11517 it 's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the marks family 
11518 it uses an old-time formula , it 's not terribly original and it 's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding 
11519 if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones ' diary or high fidelity , then you wo n't want to miss about a boy 
11520 katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself 
11521 -lrb- it 's -rrb- difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view 
11522 a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant ` co-stars 
11523 ' 
11524 but as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess 
11525 what 's next ? 
11526 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music 
11527 showtime is closer to slowtime 
11528 thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ... takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda 
11529 the am-radio soundtrack and game cast -- tierney and the inimitable walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit 
11530 tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy 
11531 britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway 
11532 has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags 
11533 an enchanting spectacular for potter fans anxious to ride the hogwarts express toward a new year of magic and mischief 
11534 the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions 
11535 it 's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests 
11536 a real clunker 
11537 the film seems a dead weight 
11538 the voices are fine as well 
11539 it turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting 
11540 an awkward and indigestible movie 
11541 showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome 
11542 a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women 
11543 but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored 
11544 yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
11545 the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it does n't go too much further 
11546 as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart 
11547 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly -lrb- like one of hubert 's punches -rrb- , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn 
11548 despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another 
11549 the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes 
11550 even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat 
11551 go see it and enjoy 
11552 her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant 
11553 chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution 
11554 obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script 
11555 a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face 
11556 the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama 
11557 stevenson 's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination 
11558 on its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist byatt 
11559 pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs 
11560 this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man 
11561 a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions 
11562 while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production 
11563 you bet 
11564 any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment 
11565 what parents will suspect is that they 're watching a 76-minute commercial 
11566 do n't let your festive spirit go this far 
11567 eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work 
11568 a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail 
11569 -lrb- nelson 's -rrb- movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes 
11570 spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects 
11571 a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick 
11572 an epic of grandeur and scale that 's been decades gone from the popcorn pushing sound stages of hollywood 
11573 occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going 
11574 preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure 
11575 it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days 
11576 the saturation bombing of reggio 's images and glass ' evocative music ... ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning 
11577 as a witness to several greek-american weddings -- but , happily , a victim of none -- i can testify to the comparative accuracy of ms. vardalos ' memories and insights 
11578 a wonderful character-based comedy 
11579 sure , it 's more of the same , but as the film proves , that 's not always a bad thing 
11580 the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america 
11581 k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich 
11582 do n't waste your money 
11583 dreary , highly annoying ... ` some body ' will appeal to no one 
11584 just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos 
11585 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling -- but unquestionably alive 
11586 punish the vehicle to adore the star 
11587 reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it 's still pretty tasty 
11588 thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun 
11589 it 's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave 
11590 the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden 
11591 the movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens 
11592 an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece 
11593 a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco 's most vital , if least widely recognized , creative fountainheads 
11594 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer\/director\/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry 
11595 i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic 
11596 -lrb- sen 's -rrb- soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions 
11597 the stories here suffer from the chosen format 
11598 ... a cute and sometimes side-splittingly funny blend of legally blonde and drop dead gorgeous , starring piper perabo in what could be her breakthrough role 
11599 offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication 
11600 a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances 
11601 however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release 
11602 there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters 
11603 at the bottom rung of the series ' entries 
11604 whatever eyre 's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place 
11605 the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist 
11606 despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like -lrb- seinfeld 's -rrb- revered tv show , about pretty much nothing 
11607 mr. parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom 
11608 the transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb 
11609 ... too dull to enjoy 
11610 this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters 
11611 this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack 
11612 characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better 
11613 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives 
11614 ... -lrb- like -rrb- channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie 
11615 i hated every minute of it 
11616 this is a very fine movie -- go see it 
11617 this is n't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend 
11618 it 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning 
11619 a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion 
11620 a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 -lrb- k -rrb- statement 
11621 godawful boring slug of a movie 
11622 provide -lrb- s -rrb- nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue 
11623 but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance 
11624 once you get into its rhythm ... the movie becomes a heady experience 
11625 it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times 
11626 just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else 
11627 hayek is stunning as frida and ... a star-making project 
11628 about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie 
11629 a quietly reflective and melancholy new zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl 's life 
11630 an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction 
11631 benefits from a strong performance from zhao , but it 's dong jie 's face you remember at the end 
11632 too simple for its own good 
11633 it 's a worthwhile tutorial in quantum physics and slash-dash 
11634 we 've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time 
11635 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan 's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year 
11636 star wars is back in a major way 
11637 unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such ` have-yourself-a-happy-little-holocaust ' movies as life is beautiful and jakob the liar , the grey zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in auschwitz 
11638 director nalin pan does n't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other 
11639 the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky 
11640 most of the action setups are incoherent 
11641 compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady 
11642 despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america 's sweetheart 
11643 if you 're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years wo n't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open 
11644 in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel 
11645 the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound 
11646 winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults 
11647 an instant candidate for worst movie of the year 
11648 anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through 
11649 a highly intriguing thriller , coupled with some ingenious plot devices and some lavishly built settings 
11650 director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth 
11651 even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate 
11652 good actress 
11653 an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences 
11654 i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that 's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing 
11655 has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller 
11656 long after you leave justine , you 'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean 
11657 on the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... it 's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there 
11658 if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil 
11659 an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding 
11660 bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description 
11661 the parts are better than the whole -lrb- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york -rrb- 
11662 however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson 's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts 
11663 a classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done 
11664 it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg 's film is that it truly is romance 
11665 what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama 
11666 a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage 
11667 instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy 
11668 like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh 
11669 with danilo donati 's witty designs and dante spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role 
11670 nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives hollywood 
11671 i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough 
11672 i loved looking at this movie 
11673 binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles 
11674 doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie 's spycraft and uses damon 's ability to be focused and sincere 
11675 the film 's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard ... 
11676 i wish i could say `` thank god it 's friday '' , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over 
11677 lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist 
11678 occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new 
11679 `` men in black ii , '' has all the earmarks of a sequel 
11680 this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio 's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed 
11681 the cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming 
11682 yeah , these flicks are just that damn good 
11683 a worthy entry into a very difficult genre 
11684 there 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version 
11685 soul is what 's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself 
11686 this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob 's excellent adventure seem understated 
11687 his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos 
11688 feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network 
11689 majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast 
11690 the kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you 
11691 an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent 
11692 the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations 
11693 still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at ` face value ' to recommend to anyone looking for something different 
11694 woo 's fights have a distinct flair 
11695 the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team 
11696 ... has virtually no script at all ... 
11697 if it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after , there 's no better film than half past dead 
11698 we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting 
11699 flawed but worthy look at life in u.s. relocation camps 
11700 why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me 
11701 gloriously goofy -lrb- and gory -rrb- midnight movie stuff 
11702 the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound 
11703 the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances 
11704 at its best , the good girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery ... 
11705 nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations ... 
11706 throwing caution to the wind with an invitation to the hedonist in us all , nair has constructed this motion picture in such a way that even the most cynical curmudgeon with find himself or herself smiling at one time or another 
11707 although life or something like it is very much in the mold of feel-good movies , the cast and director stephen herek 's polished direction pour delightfully piquant wine from aged bottles 
11708 at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers 
11709 the story ... is moldy and obvious 
11710 scotland , pa. is a strangely drab romp 
11711 better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine 
11712 ... one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers i 've seen in quite a long time 
11713 denzel washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony 
11714 despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum 
11715 she must have a very strong back 
11716 ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much 
11717 we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood could n't possibly fictionalize and be believed 
11718 the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured -lrb- and torturing -rrb- artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on 
11719 an utterly compelling ` who wrote it ' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question 
11720 this is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the saturday matinee , and it still is 
11721 a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas 
11722 not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed 
11723 -lrb- drumline -rrb- is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it does n't do 
11724 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect 
11725 despite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it 
11726 noyce 's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective 
11727 the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere 
11728 despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles 
11729 succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies 
11730 i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory 
11731 watching beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it 
11732 it does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the russos ' next offering 
11733 bears is bad 
11734 any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes 
11735 a film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities 
11736 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth 
11737 i just did n't care as much for the story 
11738 very solid , very watchable first feature for director peter sheridan 
11739 while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling 
11740 the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes 
11741 pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film 
11742 if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he 'd have them mate 
11743 still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental 
11744 if the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care 
11745 consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept 
11746 leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago 
11747 sam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man 's ruin may be another 's fortune 
11748 a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through 
11749 a taut , intelligent psychological drama 
11750 barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful 
11751 it settles for being merely grim 
11752 a work of astonishing delicacy and force 
11753 dark and disturbing , but also surprisingly funny 
11754 a loving little film of considerable appeal 
11755 watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it 
11756 a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments 
11757 the problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball 
11758 can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going 
11759 parker holds true to wilde 's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness 
11760 these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future 
11761 if somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus ' son , they 'd come up with something like bart freundlich 's world traveler 
11762 new best friend should n't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video 
11763 as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it does n't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions 
11764 i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness 
11765 -lrb- director peter -rrb- jackson and his crew have so steeped themselves in the majesty of tolkien 's writing that every frame produces new joys , whether you 're a fan of the books or not 
11766 ... ambition is in short supply in the cinema , and egoyan tackles his themes and explores his characters ' crises with seriousness and compassion 
11767 it does n't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel 
11768 baran is n't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it 's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations 
11769 what is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form 
11770 -lrb- two -rrb- fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now 
11771 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes 
11772 their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i 'd hoped the movie would avoid 
11773 the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace 
11774 it 's still worth a look 
11775 jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips 
11776 it 's a count for our times 
11777 chao was chen kaige 's assistant for years in china 
11778 never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful 
11779 although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke 
11780 a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors 
11781 intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed 
11782 too close to phantom menace for comfort 
11783 without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions 
11784 somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g.i. jane 
11785 marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film 
11786 reinforces the talents of screenwriter charlie kaufman , creator of adaptation and being john malkovich 
11787 the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off 
11788 despite its title , amy 's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one 
11789 more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling 
11790 a woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect 
11791 the story 's so preposterous that i did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved 
11792 its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
11793 and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
11794 watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay 's sappier elements ... and sustains off the hook 's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer 
11795 ice cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance ... 
11796 all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull 
11797 whether -lrb- binoche and magimel -rrb- are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria 
11798 tom green just gives them a bad odor 
11799 each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception 
11800 it 's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world 
11801 it has fun being grown up 
11802 this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on 
11803 you 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous 
11804 children may not understand everything that happens -- i 'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted 
11805 a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan 's heroes star bob crane 
11806 this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another 
11807 the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously 
11808 the long-range appeal of `` minority report '' should transcend any awards it bags 
11809 it 's haunting 
11810 the film starts out as competent but unremarkable ... and gradually grows into something of considerable power 
11811 ihops do n't pile on this much syrup 
11812 a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place 
11813 lucas , take notes 
11814 the unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right 
11815 you would n't call the good girl a date movie -lrb- an anti-date movie is more like it -rrb- , but when it 's good , it 's good and horrid 
11816 this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few 
11817 sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna does n't suck as an actress 
11818 the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome 
11819 much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie 
11820 disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material 
11821 flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams 
11822 unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it 
11823 i 'm afraid you wo n't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief 
11824 every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet 
11825 the movie gets muted and routine 
11826 -lrb- morgan -rrb- , judd and franklin ca n't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism 
11827 madonna still ca n't act a lick 
11828 `` the mothman prophecies '' is a difficult film to shake from your conscience when night falls 
11829 if you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at britney spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch 
11830 some actors have so much charisma that you 'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book 
11831 energetic and boldly provocative 
11832 not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well 
11833 the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive 
11834 in the end , white oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel 
11835 sympathetically captures the often futile lifestyle of young people in modern japan 
11836 i 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes 
11837 occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao 
11838 there 's a disturbing ` great white hope ' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion 
11839 awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over 
11840 the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd 
11841 a lousy movie that 's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable 
11842 flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind 
11843 no wonder they 're talking about `` talk to her 
11844 '' 
11845 with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele 's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast 
11846 if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford 's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it 's time to rethink independent films 
11847 a great comedy filmmaker knows great comedy need n't always make us laugh 
11848 while this film is not in the least surprising , it is still ultimately very satisfying 
11849 recalls quiet freak-outs like l'avventura and repulsion 
11850 remarkably accessible and affecting 
11851 writhing under dialogue like ` you 're from two different worlds ' and ` tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability 
11852 bourne , jason bourne 
11853 this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends 
11854 plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights 
11855 will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings 
11856 what would jesus do if he was a film director ? 
11857 credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment 
11858 director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a french poodle 
11859 it 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins 
11860 but it 's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast 
11861 francophiles will snicker knowingly and you 'll want to slap them 
11862 the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes 
11863 -lrb- plays -rrb- in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy 
11864 one hour photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it 's just too bad it does n't have more flashes of insight 
11865 a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still ca n't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable 
11866 this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format 
11867 an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job ... 
11868 will only satisfy those who ca n't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly 
11869 if this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you ca n't wait to see what happens next 
11870 ` dragonfly ' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck 
11871 -lrb- villeneuve -rrb- seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death 
11872 hits one out of the park for the ` they do n't make 'em like that anymore ' department 
11873 rather , you 'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief 
11874 feel bad for king , who 's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who 's shot himself in the foot 
11875 it 's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film 's shortcomings start to shine through 
11876 involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd 
11877 for benigni it was n't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio 
11878 starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end 
11879 together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death 
11880 de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal 
11881 the film 's real appeal wo n't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers 
11882 guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled 
11883 unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson 's perspective as a storyteller 
11884 at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story 
11885 this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh 
11886 so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly 
11887 there has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes 
11888 a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview 
11889 a great idea becomes a not-great movie 
11890 an inspiring and heart-affecting film about the desperate attempts of vietnamese refugees living in u.s. relocation camps to keep their hopes alive in 1975 
11891 passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes 
11892 its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops 
11893 demme 's loose approach kills the suspense 
11894 a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising 
11895 there is no insight into the anguish of heidi 's life -- only a depiction of pain , today 's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate 
11896 even if you feel like you 've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi 's easy-going likableness 
11897 harsh , effective documentary on life in the israeli-occupied palestinian territories 
11898 steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it 's so clever you want to hate it 
11899 this is what imax was made for : strap on a pair of 3-d goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space 
11900 though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score 
11901 but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film 
11902 the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do 
11903 ... if you 're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games 
11904 a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy 
11905 there are just enough twists in the tale to make it far more satisfying than almost any horror film in recent memory 
11906 ... hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves 
11907 ... a haunting vision , with images that seem more like disturbing hallucinations 
11908 this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch 
11909 hopkins 
11910 consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g 
11911 a breezy , diverting , conventional , well-acted tale of two men locked in an ongoing game of cat-and-cat 
11912 the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them 
11913 imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs 
11914 an ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it 
11915 smith profiles five extraordinary american homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it 's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities 
11916 it 's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self 
11917 with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious 
11918 ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap 
11919 an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions 
11920 uneasy mishmash of styles and genres 
11921 the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no. 1 , but falls apart long before the end 
11922 earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker 's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material 
11923 tailored to entertain ! 
11924 in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work 
11925 the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality 
11926 the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable 
11927 but you 'll definitely want the t-shirt 
11928 a real story about real people living their lives concerned about the future of an elderly , mentally handicapped family member 
11929 or , you can do something fun tonight 
11930 if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why did n't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
11931 the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining 
11932 an intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected 
11933 fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply 
11934 the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that 's even less plausible than the rest of the picture 
11935 it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen 
11936 despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development 
11937 branagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit 
11938 a droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling 
11939 the screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture 
11940 a beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world

11942 my response to the film is best described as lukewarm 
11943 diane lane shines in unfaithful 
11944 drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness 
11945 thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout

11947 an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously 
11948 ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie 's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible 
11949 a few artsy flourishes aside , narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days 
11950 even if the ride 's a little bumpy , with a final lap that 's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director roger michell , best known for the superfluous notting hill , credit for trying 
11951 ... a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism 
11952 both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie 
11953 as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting

11960 `` my god , i 'm behaving like an idiot ! '' 
11961 or some damn thing 
11962 its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it 's too slowly paced to be a thriller 
11963 its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces ... are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half 
11964 there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2 -- quite a rarity , even in the family film market 
11965 creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller 
11966 without resorting to hyperbole , i can state that kissing jessica stein may be the best same-sex romance i have seen 
11967 a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that is n't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears 
11968 the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting 
11969 ... too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying 
11970 this is pretty dicey material 
11971 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences 
11972 as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious 
11973 subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , the piano teacher is a daring work of genius 
11974 -lrb- a -rrb- hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning ... -lrb- but -rrb- lohman 's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer ...

11980 the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie 
11981 safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye 
11982 a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick 
11983 to enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending 
11984 but here 's the real damn : it is n't funny , either
