8658 there is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them 
8659 it may seem long at 110 minutes if you 're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert 
8660 while the stoically delivered hokum of hart 's war is never fun , it 's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation 
8661 although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women 
8662 it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong 
8663 it 's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth 
8664 exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise 
8665 however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust 
8666 broomfield turns his distinctive ` blundering ' style into something that could really help clear up the case 
8667 a mess when it comes to the characters and writing ... but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory 
8668 although german cooking does not come readily to mind when considering the world 's best cuisine , mostly martha could make deutchland a popular destination for hungry tourists 
8669 a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture 
8670 ` they ' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying i 'm still stunned 
8671 a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments

8673 smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities 
8674 all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that 
8675 a swashbuckling tale of love , betrayal , revenge and above all , faith 
8676 not a film to rival to live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted 
8677 there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked 
8678 a rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love 
8679 on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion 
8680 macdowell , whose wifty southern charm has anchored lighter affairs ... brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role 
8681 the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center 
8682 despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed 
8683 at once half-baked and overheated 
8684 this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars

8690 if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday 
8691 candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work 
8692 its maker , steven spielberg , has n't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray 
8693 more romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original 
8694 it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment 
8695 it 's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force 
8696 coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit 
8697 with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge 
8698 lovely and poignant 
8699 at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there 's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential 
8700 and just when you think it ca n't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane 
8701 ... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause 
8702 paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma 's scarface 
8703 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag 
8704 ' 
8705 american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize 
8706 visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality 
8707 exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids 
8708 directed in a paint-by-numbers manner 
8709 the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter 's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second 
8710 detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor 
8711 i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i 've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe 
8712 despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults 
8713 huppert 's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face 
8714 so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines 
8715 i just loved every minute of this film 
8716 the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey 's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment 
8717 to say this was done better in wilder 's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east 
8718 the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes 
8719 they should have called it gutterball 
8720 -lrb- majidi -rrb- makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day 
8721 it 's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant 
8722 that 's a cheat 
8723 the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well 
8724 i do n't think i laughed out loud once 
8725 may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen 
8726 taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes 
8727 i am sorry that i was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy 
8728 the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts 
8729 it 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface 
8730 ... think of it as american pie on valium 
8731 the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power 
8732 this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash 
8733 here 's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep 
8734 all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based 
8735 for anyone unfamiliar with pentacostal practices in general and theatrical phenomenon of hell houses in particular , it 's an eye-opener 
8736 if steven soderbergh 's ` solaris ' is a failure it is a glorious failure 
8737 new best friend 's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous 
8738 there 's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl 
8739 not for the prurient or squeamish , it 's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics 
8740 while locals will get a kick out of spotting cleveland sites , the rest of the world will enjoy a fast-paced comedy with quirks that might make the award-winning coen brothers envious 
8741 while -lrb- hill -rrb- has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film 
8742 this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing 
8743 the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom 
8744 -lrb- a -rrb- shapeless blob of desperate entertainment 
8745 dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation 
8746 makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff 
8747 apart from dazzling cinematography , we 've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other 
8748 over age 15 ? 
8749 an exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , minority report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order 
8750 this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities 
8751 this disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget 
8752 from the opening scenes , it 's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie 
8753 it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal 
8754 the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take 
8755 it all adds up to good fun 
8756 `` the time machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself 
8757 unfortunately , it appears that -lrb- jackie -rrb- chan 's us influence is starting to show in his hong kong films 
8758 something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously 
8759 ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine 
8760 the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth 
8761 a coarse and stupid gross-out 
8762 cool ? 
8763 the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries 
8764 a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity 
8765 the weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough 
8766 it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen 
8767 the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor 
8768 when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie 
8769 to my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation 
8770 as ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting 
8771 despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience 
8772 uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance 
8773 socrates motions for hemlock 
8774 the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty 
8775 an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy 
8776 like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... how can something so gross be so boring ? 
8777 feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work 
8778 a celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals ' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences 
8779 awesome creatures , breathtaking scenery , and epic battle scenes add up to another ` spectacular spectacle 
8780 ' 
8781 -lrb- a -rrb- n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s 
8782 neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula 
8783 by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , ... actually pretty good 
8784 seldahl 's barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness 
8785 filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels 
8786 what 's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you 
8787 it 's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it 's brilliant 
8788 it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others 
8789 open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny 
8790 better to just call it abc kiarostami 
8791 just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever 
8792 the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise 
8793 exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling 
8794 this movie is maddening 
8795 not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through 
8796 not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it 's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time 
8797 another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues 
8798 that dogged good will of the parents and ` vain ' jia 's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums 
8799 more concerned with sade 's ideas than with his actions 
8800 allows us to hope that nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker 
8801 one of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year 
8802 an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story 
8803 what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action 
8804 but it could have been worse 
8805 a wildly inconsistent emotional experience 
8806 it 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker 
8807 we root for -lrb- clara and paul -rrb- , even like them , though perhaps it 's an emotion closer to pity 
8808 if you dig on david mamet 's mind tricks ... rent this movie and enjoy ! 
8809 you wo n't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him 
8810 delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas 
8811 for starters , the story is just too slim 
8812 the vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one 
8813 half submarine flick , half ghost story , all in one criminally neglected film 
8814 the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays 
8815 my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it 's virtually its own hollywood remake 
8816 an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce 
8817 \/ but daphne , you 're too buff \/ fred thinks he 's tough \/ and velma - wow , you 've lost weight ! 
8818 the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated 
8819 feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot 
8820 the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones 
8821 a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear 
8822 an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes 
8823 a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ... 
8824 not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit 
8825 a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution 
8826 fancy a real downer ? 
8827 a painfully funny ode to bad behavior 
8828 featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , `` sade '' covers the same period as kaufmann 's `` quills '' with more unsettlingly realistic results 
8829 given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done 
8830 has all the depth of a wading pool 
8831 the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work 
8832 it 's just filler 
8833 a deep and meaningful film 
8834 sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you 
8835 holden caulfield did it better 
8836 the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide 
8837 samira makhmalbaf 's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal 
8838 ... brian de palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad 
8839 nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle 
8840 well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull 
8841 while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy 
8842 there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer 
8843 suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative 
8844 -lrb- t -rrb- here 's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them 
8845 if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world 
8846 you wo n't miss its messages , but you 'll be entertained as well 
8847 for movie lovers as well as opera lovers , tosca is a real treat 
8848 the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end 
8849 the film 's performances are thrilling 
8850 a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz 
8851 in all , this is a watchable movie that 's not quite the memorable experience it might have been 
8852 affleck and jackson are good sparring partners 
8853 it inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental ` picture shows 
8854 ' 
8855 ... with `` the bourne identity '' we return to the more traditional action genre 
8856 what the director ca n't do is make either of val kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about 
8857 holm ... embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma 
8858 -lrb- næs -rrb- directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage 
8859 my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor 
8860 if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he does n't hold them in contempt 
8861 this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well 
8862 whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting 
8863 with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff 
8864 at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s 
8865 moretti 's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss 
8866 a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -lrb- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -rrb- 
8867 the end result is a film that 's neither 
8868 scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about 
8869 an artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre 
8870 makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience 
8871 pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery 
8872 travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment 
8873 like the chelsea 's denizens ... burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste 
8874 altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece 
8875 ... an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly should n't hurt talented young gaghan 's resume 
8876 the story and structure are well-honed 
8877 it will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth 
8878 has a lot of the virtues of eastwood at his best 
8879 do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk 
8880 do not see this film 
8881 a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie 
8882 this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer 's star trek vi : the undiscovered country 
8883 a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers 
8884 due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality 
8885 a by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise 
8886 enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age 
8887 thanks to scott 's charismatic roger and eisenberg 's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men 
8888 richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez 
8889 immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop djs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch 
8890 a pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable 
8891 this movie is a snow emergency 
8892 an important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values 
8893 griffiths proves she 's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession 
8894 christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire 
8895 an entertaining , colorful , action-filled crime story with an intimate heart 
8896 and that 's a big part of why we go to the movies 
8897 while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target 
8898 it 's a scathing portrayal 
8899 the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as ... -lrb- quills -rrb- did by showing them 
8900 the film 's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip 
8901 it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie 
8902 historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit 
8903 a rarity among recent iranian films : it 's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist 's plight 
8904 while there 's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying ` get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer 
8905 if your taste runs to ` difficult ' films you absolutely ca n't miss it 
8906 the film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go 
8907 the cold turkey would 've been a far better title 
8908 it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28k modem 
8909 two hours fly by -- opera 's a pleasure when you do n't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated 
8910 hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story 
8911 mcconaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script 
8912 a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama 
8913 looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen 
8914 inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat 
8915 its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? 
8916 the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams 
8917 the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together 
8918 the film may appear naked in its narrative form ... but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the catholic doctrine 
8919 there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them 
8920 overall very good for what it 's trying to do 
8921 it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away 
8922 sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance 
8923 it showcases carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff 
8924 escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie 
8925 the most compelling wiseman epic of recent years 
8926 sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out 
8927 entertains by providing good , lively company 
8928 just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame 
8929 it 's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip 
8930 it 's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake 
8931 there is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients 
8932 it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived 
8933 even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping 
8934 impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly 
8935 preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment 
8936 there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through 
8937 it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that 
8938 manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer 
8939 a smart , witty follow-up 
8940 it 's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie 
8941 for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam 
8942 anchored by friel and williams 's exceptional performances , the film 's power lies in its complexity 
8943 without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelström is just another winter sleepers 
8944 the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip 
8945 it just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read stevenson 's book , which is a treasure in and of itself 
8946 turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting 
8947 it 's also , clearly , great fun 
8948 oscar wilde 's masterpiece , the importance of being earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century 
8949 it 's like watching a nightmare made flesh 
8950 forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending 
8951 it 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that 
8952 the mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted 
8953 belongs to daniel day-lewis as much as it belongs to martin scorsese ; it 's a memorable performance in a big , brassy , disturbing , unusual and highly successful film 
8954 if the first men in black was money , the second is small change 
8955 writer\/director mark romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in america 
8956 for the most part stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue 
8957 there 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route 
8958 viewers of `` the ring '' are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes 
8959 it 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism 
8960 it 's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way 
8961 looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in jane hamilton 's exemplary costumes , rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon 
8962 ' 
8963 thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters 
8964 i do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool 
8965 if you 're in the mood for a bollywood film , here 's one for you 
8966 dilbert without the right-on satiric humor 
8967 an exquisitely crafted and acted tale 
8968 skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt 
8969 has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence 
8970 the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we ca n't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo 
8971 not since tom cruise in risky business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear 
8972 or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife 
8973 scooby dooby doo \/ and shaggy too \/ you both look and sound great 
8974 may be far from the best of the series , but it 's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation 
8975 one of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it 
8976 does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence 
8977 the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time 
8978 movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction 
8979 even in this less-than-magic kingdom , reese rules 
8980 not only unfunny , but downright repellent 
8981 for the most part , it 's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions 
8982 seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work 
8983 you 'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear 
8984 comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class 
8985 this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get 
8986 ramsay , as in ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid 
8987 if there 's one thing this world needs less of , it 's movies about college that are written and directed by people who could n't pass an entrance exam 
8988 director of photography benoit delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors , and the costumes and sets are grand 
8989 is not easy 
8990 instead , he shows them the respect they are due 
8991 ... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments 
8992 the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation 
8993 a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored 
8994 warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality 
8995 it is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of leon 's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction 
8996 a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel 
8997 it 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic 
8998 few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands 
8999 the lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it 
9000 this is it 
9001 yes , dull 
9002 that 's pure pr hype 
9003 it is great summer fun to watch arnold and his buddy gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters 
9004 a subtle and well-crafted -lrb- for the most part -rrb- chiller 
9005 that is a compliment to kuras and miller 
9006 if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it 's john turturro , who 's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish 
9007 if it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent 
9008 one of the more intelligent children 's movies to hit theaters this year 
9009 for the most part , director anne-sophie birot 's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama 
9010 it 's a beautiful madness 
9011 stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros. -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green 's half-hearted movie career 
9012 i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand 
9013 harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment 
9014 the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing 
9015 a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn 
9016 the words , ` frankly , my dear , i do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate 
9017 by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie 
9018 his healthy sense of satire is light and fun ... 
9019 a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama 
9020 ` a ' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy 
9021 it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it does n't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise 
9022 part low rent godfather 
9023 or emptying rat traps 
9024 the special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original , while the oscar-winning sound and james horner 's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system 
9025 under 15 ? 
9026 on the heels of the ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness 
9027 harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness 
9028 it 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center 
9029 schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character 
9030 offers much to enjoy ... and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends 
9031 in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space 
9032 adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized 
9033 so unassuming and pure of heart , you ca n't help but warmly extend your arms and yell ` safe ! ' 
9034 walter hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity 
9035 full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny 
9036 professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller 
9037 this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience 
9038 it 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue 
9039 one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution 
9040 nothing 's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun 
9041 it 's not without its pleasures , but i 'll stick with the tune 
9042 drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why 
9043 a muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that 
9044 while undisputed is n't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes mr. hill higher than he 's been in a while 
9045 a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original 
9046 it does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored 
9047 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so 
9048 jacquot 's rendering of puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera 
9049 the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships 
9050 a warm , funny , engaging film 
9051 uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity 
9052 i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers 
9053 -lrb- serry -rrb- wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition 
9054 with tightly organized efficiency , numerous flashbacks and a constant edge of tension , miller 's film is one of 2002 's involvingly adult surprises 
9055 the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who 's ever had family trauma 
9056 there seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there 
9057 aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better 
9058 by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , -lrb- jones -rrb- calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity 
9059 a breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters 
9060 because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling 
9061 there 's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you 'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it 
9062 exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes 
9063 a superbly acted and funny\/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate 
9064 the movie 's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast 
9065 it 's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt 
9066 in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in 
9067 green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project 
9068 the socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides ... -lrb- and -rrb- personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy 
9069 a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney 
9070 writer\/director joe carnahan 's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic 
9071 too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... the isle defies an easy categorization 
9072 based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters 
9073 the format gets used best ... to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups 
9074 even in its most tedious scenes , russian ark is mesmerizing 
9075 this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes 
9076 you wonder why enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie 
9077 funny but perilously slight 
9078 chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama 
9079 in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest 
9080 makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun 
9081 this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you 're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other 
9082 while it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it 's alarmingly current 
9083 fresnadillo 's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that wo n't go away 
9084 ` easily my choice for one of the year 's best films 
9085 ' 
9086 pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins 
9087 candid camera on methamphetamines 
9088 it 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction 
9089 but it 's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle 
9090 in spite of good housekeeping 's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film 
9091 more maudlin than sharp 
9092 no aspirations to social import inform the movie version 
9093 outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent 
9094 rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment 
9095 van wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers 
9096 so , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today 's new delhi 
9097 a subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; the pianist does not 
9098 ... routine , harmless diversion and little else 
9099 not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers 
9100 blanchett 's performance confirms her power once again 
9101 this is nothing but familiar territory 
9102 this is a winning ensemble comedy that shows canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world 
9103 it ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy 
9104 while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they 're presented with a wry dark humor 
9105 the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did 
9106 a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection 
9107 the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance 
9108 this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work 
9109 it can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull 
9110 sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation 
9111 a film about a young man finding god that is accessible and touching to the marrow 
9112 nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting 
9113 although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there 's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun 
9114 it 's hard to imagine alan arkin being better than he is in this performance 
9115 it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study 
9116 a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores 
9117 a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back 
9118 nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay 
9119 not since japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa 's ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur 
9120 though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions 
9121 the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him 
9122 although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs 
9123 hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile -lrb- emphasized here -rrb- accent the humor of wilson 's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness 
9124 reggio 's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking 
9125 about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it 's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological 
9126 too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped 
9127 `` roger michell -lrb- '' notting hill `` -rrb- directs a morality thriller 
9128 '' 
9129 unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies 
9130 the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure 
9131 in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan 
9132 cq 's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors 
9133 jones ... does offer a brutal form of charisma 
9134 it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds 
9135 not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions 
9136 it 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes 
9137 this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults 
9138 the lion king was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on imax it seems better , not just bigger 
9139 kinnear does n't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth 
9140 is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
9141 wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty 
9142 this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs 
9143 you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this 
9144 a quiet , pure , elliptical film 
9145 harrison 's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all 
9146 it 's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman 
9147 no screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of clones ' last 45 minutes 
9148 despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine 
9149 it 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role 
9150 building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise 
9151 overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube 
9152 it 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong 
9153 this is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming 
9154 the band 's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring , especially for aging hippies -lrb- this one included -rrb- 
9155 this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs 
9156 thanks to haynes ' absolute control of the film 's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , far from heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act 
9157 more whiny downer than corruscating commentary 
9158 beneath clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from rabbit-proof fence 
9159 a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle 
9160 the film is powerful , accessible and funny 
9161 a good piece of work more often than not 
9162 there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade 
9163 in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey 
9164 care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters 
9165 the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque 
9166 the chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between gauls and yanks 
9167 i can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers 
9168 ... the film suffers from a lack of humor -lrb- something needed to balance out the violence -rrb- ... 
9169 a working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered 
9170 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he 'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor 
9171 with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here 
9172 but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
9173 majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places 
9174 if you 've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like , here it is 
9175 the vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination 
9176 martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid 
9177 all that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight 
9178 it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness 
9179 it confirms fincher 's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight 
9180 this is as respectful a film as byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it 's necessary 
9181 dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments 
9182 if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle 
9183 good film , but very glum 
9184 nine queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head 
9185 when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while 
9186 the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain 
9187 a solid examination of the male midlife crisis 
9188 -lrb- d -rrb- oes n't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful 
9189 it 's a coming-of-age story we 've all seen bits of in other films -- but it 's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity 
9190 an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles 
9191 -lrb- grant 's -rrb- bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle 
9192 they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending 
9193 a poignant and compelling story about relationships , food of love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart 
9194 a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug 
9195 a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other 
9196 this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film 
9197 a marvel like none you 've seen 
9198 the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects 
9199 leigh 's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom 
9200 manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time 
9201 the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens 
9202 determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult 
9203 the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes 
9204 whether you like rap music or loathe it , you ca n't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie 
9205 all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us 
9206 feature debuter d.j. caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton 's narcotics noir to life 
9207 serving sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs 
9208 ah yes , and then there 's the music ... 
9209 my reaction in a word : disappointment 
9210 the film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style 
9211 star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before 
9212 very psychoanalytical -- provocatively so -- and also refreshingly literary 
9213 the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not 
9214 with rabbit-proof fence , noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie 
9215 a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal 
9216 even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor 
9217 this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast 
9218 the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale 
9219 add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney 's a good director 
9220 as unseemly as its title suggests 
9221 the movie is n't just hilarious : it 's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it is n't even all that dumb 
9222 among the year 's most intriguing explorations of alientation 
9223 the sort of film that makes me miss hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there 's hope for popular cinema yet 
9224 the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants 
9225 the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing 
9226 and if you 're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes , you 've got ice water in your veins 
9227 a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures 
9228 the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances 
9229 -lrb- lawrence bounces -rrb- all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place 
9230 what distinguishes time of favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts 
9231 crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action 
9232 with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap 
9233 in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song 
9234 ... designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns 
9235 as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear 
9236 worth watching for dong jie 's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change 
9237 if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then esther 's story is a compelling quest for truth 
9238 unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners 
9239 stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad 
9240 `` mostly martha '' is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see 
9241 no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie 
9242 a workshop mentality prevails 
9243 this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : al pacino loathing robin williams 
9244 writer-director 's mehta 's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres 
9245 ... takes the beauty of baseball and melds it with a story that could touch anyone regardless of their familiarity with the sport 
9246 one of the smartest takes on singles culture i 've seen in a long time 
9247 it 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks 
9248 this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against 
9249 to call the other side of heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be 
9250 the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental 
9251 it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience 
9252 a great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar 
9253 lapaglia 's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver 's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class 
9254 my thoughts were focused on the characters 
9255 it 's slow -- very , very slow 
9256 though it 's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class 
9257 should have been someone else - 
9258 it 's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker 's movie adaptation 
9259 it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes 
9260 indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie 
9261 even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy 
9262 it 's fascinating to see how bettany and mcdowell play off each other 
9263 teen movies have really hit the skids 
9264 i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example 
9265 stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond 's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , ` tis 
9266 even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller 's hand often feels unsure 
9267 every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn 
9268 it gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right 
9269 i 'm sure if you 're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... me , i did n't care for it 
9270 a poignant , artfully crafted meditation on mortality 
9271 one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals ... a psychological masterpiece 
9272 no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand 
9273 even if you do n't think -lrb- kissinger 's -rrb- any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he 'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch 
9274 ... a story we have n't seen on the big screen before , and it 's a story that we as americans , and human beings , should know 
9275 irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater 
9276 instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it 's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life 
9277 the film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency 
9278 scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas 
9279 hey arnold ! 
9280 though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining 
9281 woody allen 's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz 
9282 it 's the perfect kind of film to see when you do n't want to use your brain 
9283 there 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging 
9284 as a first-time director , paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul 
9285 a gripping movie , played with performances that are all understated and touching 
9286 too slow , too long and too little happens 
9287 plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread 
9288 at all 
9289 there can be no other explanation 
9290 by the time we learn that andrew 's turnabout is fair play is every bit as awful as borchardt 's coven , we can enjoy it anyway 
9291 attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience 
9292 it 's a demented kitsch mess -lrb- although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative -rrb- , but it 's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year 
9293 bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves 
9294 it is amusing , and that 's all it needs to be 
9295 what time is it there ? 
9296 the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory 
9297 a taut psychological thriller that does n't waste a moment of its two-hour running time 
9298 ... is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri 
9299 michael gerbosi 's script is economically packed with telling scenes 
9300 light years \/ several warp speeds \/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful insurrection 
9301 what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian 
9302 at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it 's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form 's history 
9303 at the very least , if you do n't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave 
9304 a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic ... 
9305 partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show 
9306 bennett 's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any ` reality ' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first 
9307 jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory 
9308 ... mafia , rap stars and hood rats butt their ugly heads in a regurgitation of cinematic violence that gives brutal birth to an unlikely , but likable , hero 
9309 ' 
9310 i got a headache watching this meaningless downer 
9311 montias ... pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters 
9312 slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
9313 his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level 
9314 big fat waste of time 
9315 it 's not that kung pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk 's impish augmentation 
9316 it 's so good that you can practically see the hollywood ` suits ' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too - inevitable american remake 
9317 a delightful coming-of-age story 
9318 binoche makes it interesting trying to find out 
9319 the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant 
9320 a beguiling , slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in iran 
9321 kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble 
9322 ... a fun little timewaster , helped especially by the cool presence of jean reno 
9323 prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this english trifle 
9324 the old-world - meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie 's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco bollywood that , by the end of monsoon wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater 
9325 as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming 
9326 director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback 
9327 the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained 
9328 claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that 's okay 
9329 puts a human face on a land most westerners are unfamiliar with 
9330 unflinchingly bleak and desperate 
9331 the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence 
9332 like mike is n't interested in recycling old cliches 
9333 it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker 's motherland 
9334 works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them 
9335 the film 's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties 
9336 no one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best 
9337 verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies 
9338 creepy , authentic and dark 
9339 uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions 
9340 as vulgar as it is banal 
9341 i 'm just too bored to care 
9342 i had to look away - this was god awful 
9343 it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color 
9344 84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare 
9345 a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going 
9346 what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we 've shared a great adventure 
9347 of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad 
9348 for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal 
9349 scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence 
9350 though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama 
9351 it 's a charming and often affecting journey 
9352 nervous breakdowns are not entertaining 
9353 this is a story of two misfits who do n't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent 
9354 atom egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues 
9355 as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor 
9356 it 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible 
9357 no way i can believe this load of junk 
9358 we know the plot 's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish 
9359 lan yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree 
9360 will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues 
9361 another one of those estrogen overdose movies like `` divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood , '' except that the writing , acting and character development are a lot better 
9362 byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama 
9363 it 's unnerving to see recoing 's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment 
9364 the humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original 
9365 instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone 
9366 a moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate 
9367 offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm 
9368 it haunts you , you ca n't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it 
9369 sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest 
9370 as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms. redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality 
9371 almost gags on its own gore 
9372 the film is quiet , threatening and unforgettable 
9373 ... the movie is just a plain old monster 
9374 likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer 
9375 sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos 
9376 displaying about equal amounts of naiveté , passion and talent , beneath clouds establishes sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential 
9377 it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot 
9378 a strangely compelling and brilliantly acted psychological drama 
9379 i 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film 
9380 every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable 
9381 the movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach 
9382 a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right 
9383 minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report 
9384 the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting 
9385 like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well 
9386 confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it 
9387 -lrb- e -rrb- ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism 
9388 denis o'neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others 
9389 forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power 
9390 this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms 
9391 first-time writer-director serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film 
9392 while it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records -lrb- sugar hill gang , etc. -rrb- , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences 
9393 -lrb- leigh -rrb- lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race 
9394 the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past 
9395 combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest system of a down video 
9396 there 's no emotional pulse to solaris 
9397 a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of -lrb- besson 's -rrb- earlier work 
9398 the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it 
9399 does paint some memorable images ... , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters 
9400 rare birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable 
9401 the film 's essentially over by the meet-cute 
9402 but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell 
9403 generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes 
9404 dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled 
9405 sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn 
9406 essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of aliens 
9407 the quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy 
9408 the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge 
9409 very bad 
9410 having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , khouri then gets terrific performances from them all 
9411 a woman 's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken 
9412 mr. tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? 
9413 the intent is almost exactly the same -lrb- as the full monty -rrb- 
9414 for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout 
9415 a by-the-numbers patient\/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground 
9416 a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j.m. barrie 's peter pan 
9417 why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? 
9418 the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough 
9419 burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast 
9420 oh come on 
9421 generally provides its target audience of youngsters enough stimulating eye and ear candy to make its moral medicine go down 
9422 even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting 
9423 its well of thorn and vinegar -lrb- and simple humanity -rrb- has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks 
9424 the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy 
9425 at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects 
9426 and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new 
9427 is this love or is it masochism ? 
9428 ... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller 
9429 a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment 
9430 mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way 
9431 slick piece of cross-promotion 
9432 sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero 
9433 deliriously funny , fast and loose , accessible to the uninitiated , and full of surprises 
9434 a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 
9435 for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he 's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars 
9436 birthday girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments 
9437 a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty 
9438 while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer 's appetite , the film 's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving 
9439 ... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock 
9440 we learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef 
9441 excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters 
9442 if you 're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here 
9443 davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is 
9444 it 's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again 
9445 dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness -lrb- which always relates to characters and story -rrb- and johnny dankworth 's best soundtrack in years 
9446 highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up 
9447 once -lrb- kim -rrb- begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard 
9448 -lrb- t -rrb- his beguiling belgian fable , very much its own droll and delicate little film , has some touching things to say about what is important in life and why 
9449 simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy 
9450 too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance 
9451 it 's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that does n't feel it has to prove anything 
9452 bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era 's creme de la celluloid 
9453 it 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job 
9454 it 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense 
9455 fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment 
9456 hey arnold ! 
9457 just one bad idea after another 
9458 it 's a lovely film with lovely performances by buy and accorsi 
9459 the script kicks in , and mr. hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow 
9460 this is her blue lagoon 
9461 does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past 
9462 a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line 
9463 like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter 
9464 remember the kind of movie we were hoping `` ecks vs. sever '' or `` xxx '' was going to be ? 
9465 it 's a buggy drag 
9466 yakusho and shimizu ... create engaging characterizations in imamura 's lively and enjoyable cultural mix 
9467 it 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel 
9468 i ca n't say that i liked homeboy ; it 'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way 
9469 there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine 
9470 a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness 
9471 very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant achilles ' heel in `` stuart little 2 `` : there 's just no story , folks 
9472 like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all 
9473 manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite 
9474 it 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think 
9475 the very definition of the ` small ' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher 
9476 one from the heart 
9477 and when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem 
9478 this is so bad 
9479 so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises 
9480 ahhhh ... revenge is sweet ! 
9481 against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine 
9482 the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad 
9483 it 's one heck of a character study -- not of hearst or davies but of the unique relationship between them 
9484 as a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a triumph , however , it is not 
9485 the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned 
9486 whether writer-director anne fontaine 's film is a ghost story , an account of a nervous breakdown , a trip down memory lane , all three or none of the above , it is as seductive as it is haunting 
9487 the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves 
9488 the draw -lrb- for `` big bad love '' -rrb- is a solid performance by arliss howard 
9489 one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year 
9490 basically a static series of semi-improvised -lrb- and semi-coherent -rrb- raps between the stars 
9491 for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking 
9492 a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction 
9493 some of it is clever , but it is never melodic \/ 
9494 there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill 
9495 it 's fun lite 
9496 a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion 
9497 although there are several truly jolting scares , there 's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at 
9498 not nearly long enough 
9499 the overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts 
9500 trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive 
9501 so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie 
9502 chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson 's dahmer 
9503 visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it 
9504 columns from ladies home journal ... 
9505 a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda 
9506 once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back 
9507 on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura 's best work since the xfl 
9508 but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned can not be said to suck 
9509 at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch 
9510 the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate\/surf culture , the l.a. beach scene and the imaginative -lrb- and sometimes illegal -rrb- ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults 
9511 should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor 
9512 much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind -- namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation 
9513 for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery 
9514 corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in 
9515 nothing is black and white 
9516 this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath 
9517 trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son 
9518 villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi 's generic angst -lrb- there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows -rrb- 
9519 what is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting 
9520 who needs love like this ? 
9521 as the two leads , lathan and diggs are charming and have chemistry both as friends and lovers 
9522 like leon , it 's frustrating and still oddly likable 
9523 if you can stomach the rough content , it 's worth checking out for the performances alone 
9524 there 's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache 
9525 and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea 
9526 there 's ... tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate 
9527 although jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for the return of the king , we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of the two towers 
9528 director andrew niccol ... demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame 
9529 try as i may , i ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` thank you ! ' 
9530 shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere 
9531 utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni 's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film 
9532 further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of dubya 's axis of evil 
9533 but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 
9534 miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness 
9535 the piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to anspaugh 's three lead actresses 
9536 what better message than ` love thyself ' could young women of any size receive ? 
9537 if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you 
9538 may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow 
9539 it 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -lrb- and who knew they even had any ? -rrb- 
9540 the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that 's all too rare in hollywood 's hastier productions 
9541 prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment 
9542 there 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours 
9543 although huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun 
9544 a gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life 
9545 nothing is sacred in this gut-buster 
9546 a tender , heartfelt family drama 
9547 ... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects 
9548 it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen 
9549 but the power of these -lrb- subjects -rrb- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative 
9550 suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it 's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood 
9551 a delirious celebration of the female orgasm 
9552 reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way 
9553 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace 
9554 the acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production 's austere locales 
9555 this is n't even madonna 's swept away 
9556 i ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it 
9557 a coda in every sense , the pinochet case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the british court 's extradition chess game and the regime 's talking-head survivors 
9558 brilliantly explores the conflict between following one 's heart and following the demands of tradition 
9559 like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away 
9560 involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters 
9561 the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous -lrb- but with bears , and a g rating -rrb- , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure 
9562 i 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here 
9563 -lrb- director -rrb- o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short 
9564 the problem with this film is that it lacks focus 
9565 on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality 
9566 long time dead ? 
9567 ... a magnificent drama well worth tracking down 
9568 the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people 
9569 the next generation of mob movie 
9570 perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie 
9571 for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution 
9572 it believes it 's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it 's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile 
9573 it 's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part 
9574 old-form moviemaking at its best 
9575 a sometimes tedious film 
9576 whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u.s. satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife\/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy 
9577 a gorgeous , witty , seductive movie 
9578 moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not 
9579 a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes 
9580 late marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u.s. viewers off their feet 
9581 a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it 's approached with imagination and flair 
9582 but it still jingles in the pocket 
9583 it 's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this `` two weddings and a funeral '' fun 
9584 it all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time 
9585 the french are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the americans , who have a passion for musketeers , only to spoof them 
9586 nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns 
9587 it wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor 
9588 which is n't to say that it 's the equal of some of its predecessors 
9589 an unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse 
9590 comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief 
9591 you do n't have to know about music to appreciate the film 's easygoing blend of comedy and romance 
9592 if you 're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a.i. , you 'll probably like rollerball 
9593 the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life 
9594 it 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` can this marriage be saved ? '' 
9595 it will grip even viewers who are n't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way 
9596 challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative 
9597 expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery 
9598 there 's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichéd , doddering , misogynistic boy 's club 
9599 the whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film 
9600 the film 's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone 
9601 tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar 
9602 while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these 
9603 barely gets off the ground 
9604 beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama 
9605 a solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring 
9606 let 's hope -- shall we ? 
9607 i still ca n't relate to stuart : he 's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough 
9608 stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time 
9609 the ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures 
9610 good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back ! 
9611 a movie with a real anarchic flair 
9612 it 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions 
9613 characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs 
9614 maneuvers skillfully through the plot 's hot brine -- until it 's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors 
9615 a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard 's finest work 
9616 a thinly veiled look at different aspects of chinese life clashing with each other 
9617 far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features nickelodeon has made from its other animated tv series 
9618 pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r. abrams , in their feature debut 
9619 it 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one 
9620 zhang ... has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast 
9621 without ever becoming didactic , director carlos carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality 
9622 it 's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth 
9623 pumpkin wants to have it both ways 
9624 gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive 
9625 -lrb- chaiken 's -rrb- talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters 
9626 a psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor bill paxton 's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural americana 
9627 it 's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children 
9628 dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away 
9629 the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle 
9630 less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins 
9631 a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left 
9632 -lrb- w -rrb- hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall 's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands 
9633 intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject 
9634 the son 's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos 
9635 a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers 
9636 it 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination 
9637 ... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it 
9638 this time mr. burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again 
9639 manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane 
9640 a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past 
9641 yes , ballistic is silly 
9642 the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan 's madness 
9643 a sequel that 's much too big for its britches 
9644 this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento -lrb- a producer here -rrb- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic 
9645 nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy 
9646 it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons 
9647 it treats women like idiots 
9648 there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness 
9649 the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died 
9650 an interesting story with a pertinent -lrb- cinematically unique -rrb- message , told fairly well and scored to perfection , i found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive `` missing thing 
9651 '' 
9652 weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger 
9653 what 's next : `` my mother the car ? '' 
9654 not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics 
9655 a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year 
9656 an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss 
9657 the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second 
9658 hilariously inept and ridiculous 
9659 vera 's three actors -- mollà , gil and bardem -- excel in insightful , empathetic performances 
9660 for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one 
9661 good car chases , great fight scenes , and a distinctive blend of european , american and asian influences 
9662 the performances take the movie to a higher level 
9663 some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny 
9664 chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum 
9665 if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this imposter 
9666 would n't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc. , be more valuable ? 
9667 though catch me if you can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie 
9668 despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected -lrb- even , at times , preposterous -rrb- turns , love is just too , too precious in the end 
9669 deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness 
9670 collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans 
9671 part three stooges 
9672 still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed 
9673 his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it 
9674 portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama 
9675 the minor figures surrounding -lrb- bobby -rrb- ... form a gritty urban mosaic 
9676 no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise 
9677 complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort 
9678 it 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it 's about as exciting as a sunburn 
9679 while it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold 
9680 the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life 
9681 returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy 
9682 there 's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino 's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television 
9683 zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight 
9684 not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j.k. rowling 's books 
9685 the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence 
9686 the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it 's an enjoyable one 
9687 chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer 
9688 too much of the humor falls flat 
9689 falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun 
9690 if the count of monte cristo does n't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago 
9691 jaglom ... put -lrb- s -rrb- the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters 
9692 if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con 
9693 every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency 
9694 velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene 
9695 hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people 
9696 one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others 
9697 it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death 
9698 the so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing -lrb- featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer -rrb- brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks 
9699 it 's everything you do n't go to the movies for 
9700 mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity 
9701 the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows 
9702 pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical 
9703 a compelling spanish film about the withering effects of jealousy in the life of a young monarch whose sexual passion for her husband becomes an obsession 
9704 holy mad maniac in a mask , splat-man ! 
9705 there 's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like steven spielberg to follow a.i. with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority 
9706 whereas last year 's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it 
9707 bad 
9708 an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution 
9709 it 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show 
9710 the subtle strength of `` elling '' is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation 
9711 not exactly the bees knees 
9712 audrey tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate french comedy , she 's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in amélie 
9713 just not campy enough 
9714 an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director john mckay can swallow 
9715 equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today 's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 
9716 a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking 
9717 a spellbinding african film about the modern condition of rootlessness , a state experienced by millions around the globe 
9718 a cartoon that 's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that 's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore 
9719 you will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report 
9720 an operatic , sprawling picture that 's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length 
9721 i 've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal 
9722 morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern 's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan 
9723 and i 've decided to leave a light on every night from now on 
9724 the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious 
9725 it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought 
9726 rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign 
9727 we have n't seen such hilarity since say it is n't so ! 
9728 true tale of courage -- and complicity -- at auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable 
9729 how do you spell cliché ? 
9730 manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious 
9731 the script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman -lrb- the actor -rrb- can make it work 
9732 a giggle a minute 
9733 made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss 
9734 the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater 
9735 maud and roland 's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy 
9736 but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material 
9737 just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time 
9738 vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them 
9739 a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking 
9740 the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner 
9741 corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless 
9742 huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair 
9743 in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy 
9744 if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong 
9745 nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle 
9746 a sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes 
9747 it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i ca n't wait for the sequel 
9748 liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image 
9749 passable entertainment , but it 's the kind of motion picture that wo n't make much of a splash when it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards 
9750 the movie is for fans who ca n't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it 
9751 a sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss 
9752 it 's made with deftly unsettling genre flair 
9753 it 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary 
9754 a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers ... 
9755 ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it 
9756 the tale of tok -lrb- andy lau -rrb- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o -lrb- takashi sorimachi -rrb- , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold 
9757 something like scrubbing the toilet 
9758 `` the ring '' is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws 
9759 smart , provocative and blisteringly funny 
9760 this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics 
9761 charles ' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld 's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams ' attempts to get his shot at the big time 
9762 an effectively creepy , fear-inducing -lrb- not fear-reducing -rrb- film from japanese director hideo nakata , who takes the superstitious curse on chain letters and actually applies it
