[BEGIN] this pathetic junk is barely an hour long  [END]
[BEGIN] the irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts  [END]
[BEGIN] it 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni  [END]
[BEGIN] i 've never seen -lrb- a remake -rrb- do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra 's classic ...  [END]

[BEGIN] a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies  [END]
[BEGIN] not only are the film 's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were  [END]
[BEGIN] a rip-off twice removed , modeled after -lrb- seagal 's -rrb- earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat  [END]

[BEGIN] an infuriating film  [END]
[BEGIN] seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof  [END]
[BEGIN] soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence  [END]
[BEGIN] while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it 's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle  [END]
[BEGIN] the biggest problem with roger avary 's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything  [END]
[BEGIN] it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action  [END]

[BEGIN] cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth  [END]
[BEGIN] a ` girls gone wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that  [END]

[BEGIN] several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` unfaithful ''  [END]

[BEGIN] there 's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies  [END]
[BEGIN] to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved  [END]
[BEGIN] a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive  [END]
[BEGIN] this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness  [END]
[BEGIN] the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year  [END]
[BEGIN] you ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff  [END]
